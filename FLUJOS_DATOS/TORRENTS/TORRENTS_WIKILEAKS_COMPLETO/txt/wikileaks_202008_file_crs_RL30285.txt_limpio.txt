congress abstract with the negotiation of the kyoto protocol international emissions trading has become the centerpiece of efforts to minimize costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions review of existing cost analyses of us compliance with the kyoto protocol indicates consensus that the potential for international emission trading to reduce compliance cost is substantial and indisputable however this report also indicates that potential for turning that potential into fact is problematic and that other alternatives may deserve hearing further information on global climate change is available from the crs electronic briefing book at httpwwwcongressgovbrbkhtmlebgcc1html this report will be updated as circumstances warrant global climate change lowering cost estimates through emissions trading some dynamics and pitfalls summary major element in the debate about global climate change has been how to minimize costs by selecting the most economically efficient strategies to reduce greenhouse gases with the negotiation of the kyoto protocol international emissions trading has become focal point of attention indeed the administration believes that the goals of the kyoto protocol can not be achieved without effective emissions trading international emissions trading is one of four flexibility mechanisms contained in the kyoto protocol article 17 review of existing cost analyses of us compliance with the kyoto protocol indicates consensus that the potential for international emission trading to reduce us compliance cost under the kyoto protocol is substantial and indisputable however whether the potential for international emissions trading can be turned into fact is more problematic this analysis suggests that implementing international emissions trading under kyoto would represent uncharted territory for us environmental policy first an international emissions trading scheme has to function very efficiently to achieve the savings projected by analyses for example the administrations analysis relies on an unprecedented amount of international trading to achieve the substantial cost reduction it projects under its most aggressive scenario 8288 of the us reduction requirement would be bought from foreign sources the magnitude of transactions not only raises questions of its feasibility but also may conflict with the intent of the kyoto protocol which states that international emissions trading is to be supplemental to domestic actions second besides the amount of trading estimated the sources of these reductions raise additional questions for example according to an analysis by charles river associates half the estimated savings from international emissions trading would come either from socalled hot air credits that countries of the former soviet union have available because of their economic difficulties or from transactions with third world countries that are not required to participate in the program third while the us acid rain emissions trading program is cited as model for international carbon trading in fact unlike an international carbon trading program the acid rain program does not have to operate particularly efficiently to achieve substantial cost savings the simplest trades those between companys own plants achieve the greatest cost savings under the acid rain program thus the us acid rain emissions trading program provides little guidance to any future international carbon trading program the complexity presented by international emissions trading suggests that alternatives may deserve hearing contents overview importance of emission trading to kyoto compliance 1 review of analyses the dynamics of trading 5 implementation pitfalls comparison with acid rain 9 conclusion 11 list of tables table 1 climate change perspectives and policy parameters 3 global climate change lowering cost estimates through emissions trading some dynamics and pitfalls overview importance of emission trading to kyoto compliance united states concerns about implementing the kyoto protocol focus on three interlinked issues 1 the considerable uncertainty and risk of substantial cost from carbon dioxide co2 abatement 2 the competitive impacts of compliance both domestically and internationally and 3 the comprehensiveness of the protocols scope in particular the exclusion of third world countries from any co2 reduction program1 these implementation concerns along with perceived scientific uncertainty have prevented any serious effort by the administration to seek senate ratification of the kyoto protocol removal of any one of the three interlinked issues might significantly improve the prospects for approval of the kyoto protocol or some other regime to control greenhouse gas emissions for example if the cost of kyoto compliance could be shown to be not as burdensome as some have suggested the competitive impact would be weakened and the concern about comprehensiveness would lessen such concerns along with scientific doubt would not be eliminated however they would be attenuated such task would not be easy estimates of costs to reduce co2 emissions vary greatly and focus attention on an estimators basic view about the problem and the future rather than on simple technical differences in economic assumptions2 some of these lenses through which people view the problem and their effects on cost analysis are summarized in table 1 based on these perspectives the cost of complying with kyoto can appear to range from none or indeed positive benefit to an estimate so high as to potentially bankrupt the economy for example the american petroleum institute in summarizing the results of several studies concludes that kyoto compliance would require heavy taxes or high carbon permit prices to be achieved resulting in sharp declines in domestic demand encourage 1 for analysis of us policy see larry b parker and john blodgett global climate change policy

public interest groups concludes that new energy policies can cut energy costs increase employment and protect the environment such path is seen as reducing energy costs by 530 household while exceeding the reduction requirements of kyoto4 none of the perspectives on which these analysis are based is inherently more right or correct than another rather they overlap and to varying degrees complement and conflict with each other people hold to each of the lenses to some degree the uncertainties about the risk of global climate change and the critical impacts of differing assumptions about the nature of the problem effectively preclude predictions of the ultimate costs of reducing greenhouse gases as result attention has focused on how to minimize costs by selecting the most economically efficient strategies to reduce co2 emissions with the negotiation of the kyoto protocol the mechanism that has become the centerpiece of this attention is emissions trading indeed janet yellen chair of the president council of economic advisors has stated that the promise of kyoto can not be achieved without effective emissions trading5 emissions trading is one of four flexibility mechanisms contained in the kyoto protocol article 176 under the kyoto protocol developed countries are given greenhouse gas emissions budgets for the compliance period 20082012 based on percentage of their 1990 or 1995 emissions levels depending on the particular greenhouse gas if country determined that it would exceed its emissions limit during the compliance period emissions trading would permit it to purchase emissions reductions ie credits7 from another country that determined it would have achieved more emissions reductions than necessary to comply with emissions trading countries that can make relatively inexpensive emissions reductions have an incentive to reduce emissions below the level required by the kyoto protocol and sell the extra credits to other countries whose emissions control costs are more 3 rayola dougher the impact of the kyoto protocol on allied industry output employment and trade american petroleum institute 1999 for rebuttal of the type of studies

vironmental values seen as trivializing that economics can the issue not readily quantify and monetize crs4 expensive thus both the seller and the buyer would have lower costs by virtue of the sellers profit and the buyers savings this mechanism however comes with significant restrictions under the kyoto protocol first emissions trading is restricted to countries that have legally binding greenhouse gas emission limitations commonly called annex 1 parties only developed industrialized countries are included8 this restriction also applies to two of the other three mechanisms bubbles and joint implementation projects only the clean development mechanism cdm can be employed for transactions between annex 1 countries and countries without legally binding requirements ie developing countries the specifics of this mechanism are yet to be defined second restriction to trading is the requirement that it be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitations and reduction commitments9 however the protocol is vague as to what supplemental means and the term is subject to continuing negotiation some parties have suggested third restriction on trading with respect to how reductions are accomplished specifically some have argued that trading be restricted to transactions where the traded carbon credits are the result of explicit controls that reduce greenhouse gases and not because of economic downturns or other events separate from the protocol this issue arises as several countries of the former soviet union are projected to have sizeable amounts of credits available for sale because of current economic difficulties proponents of trading restrictions argue that such hot air reductions would have occurred anyway and would weaken the protocols targets these concerns are heightened by the failure of russia and seven other members of the former soviet union countries to comply with the montreal protocol10 because of economic difficulties the same difficulties that would create the hot air credits however the kyoto protocol places restriction on the means countries may use to comply with reduction requirements thus this position may be difficult to sustain in negotiation because trading is central feature of costs analyses of the kyoto protocol this paper analyzes some of the dynamics and pitfalls of carbon trading based on various analyses done on us compliance with the kyoto protocol as the analysis conducted by the administration has become the focus of much of the cost debate it receives special emphasis here 8 although called annex 1 countries in reference to annex 1 of the framework convention on climate change fccc the correct reference is to annex b of the kyoto protocol the lists of countries in annex 1 and annex b are very similar but not identical crs uses the common usage term annex 1 in this report 9 article 17 kyoto protocol 10 the montreal protocol is an international environmental treaty designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the global production of ozonedepleting chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons crs5 review of analyses the dynamics of trading several attempts have been made to estimate the cost of us compliance with the terms of the kyoto protocol seventeen estimates by eight different organizations are shown in figure 111 in terms of the discussion in table 1 these estimates are the result of topdown analyses although some have more aggressive assumptions about market penetration rates for new more energy efficient technologies than others several bottomup technologyoriented analyses of potential carbon reductions under various scenarios have been conducted however these analyses rely on assumed availability and penetration of various energyefficient and low carbon technologies not international emissions trading to achieve their cost savings and so are not reviewed here12 indeed recently released bottomup analysis conducted by the tellus institute expresses concern that the flexibility mechanisms contained in the kyoto protocol could threaten environmental integrity and result in misguided policies that could actually increase costs in the long term13 most analyses of the kyoto protocol either exclude emissions trading or limit trading to the developed countries covered by the protocol annex 1 countries the latter assumption is consistent with the intent and language of the protocol developing countries participation in emission trading is restricted to clean development mechanism the parameters of which are yet to be sorted out14 only three estimates incorporated global trading scenario despite the wide range of estimates plotted in figure 1 for each trading scenario the differences between the three trading scenarios strongly suggest that emission trading would significantly 11 the organizations are the energy information administration eia wefa inc charles river

existing analyses figure 1 cost estimates for kyoto compliance year 2010 400 350 348 300 295 280 266 250 265 221 200 193 175 171 150 119 114 100 110 100 61 50 50 23 14 0 trading annex 1 trading global trading source us energy information administration charles river associates administration economic analysis to examine this little further two organizations conducted cost analyses for three different trading scenarios those estimates calculated by the administration and by charles river associates cra are provided in figure 2 as indicated moving from trading posture to an annex 1 trading posture lowered the cost estimates by 60 cra to 68 administration according to these analyses if the kyoto protocol permitted full global trading the costs would be lowered by 83 cra to 88 administration these analyses agree on the potential cost reductions presented by emissions trading potential that increases as the pool of potential participants increase this agreement on tradings effect on costs is evident despite the significant disagreement on what the actual compliance costs under the kyoto protocol might be15 15 the difference in costs between the administrations and cras analyses is primarily the result of two factors first the administration assumes higher energy efficiency improvement rate than cra second the administration assumes higher elasticity of substitution between coal and natural gas these more aggressive assumptions by the administration are consistent with its technological view of kyoto implementation for more on that view see table 1 crs7 figure 2 another important dynamic with respect to trading illustrated in figure 2 is the importance of hot air credits to reducing costs as noted earlier hot air credits is rather pejorative term used to describe potentially large pool of co2 credits available from the former soviet union this pool of perhaps 200 million metric tons of carbon according to doe estimates results from the substantial reduction in economic activity in the former soviet union since 1990 the baseyear for the kyoto protocol if these credits are dumped on the market during the fiveyear compliance period 20082012 credit prices would be depressed reducing compliance costs as indicated in the cra analysis likewise without the availability of these credits the cost of us compliance under kyoto could be substantially higher this substantial cost savings projected under the cra analysis illustrates why the administration opposes any restriction on hot air credits an increase in the available pool of credit for sale would tend to reduce the price of credits in the trading market for country like the united states which is projected to be very active in the trading market lower credit prices would translate into lower compliance costs all else being equal indeed the lower cost estimates of the administrations analysis is partially the result of trading system that is assumed to be very free and unconstrained in crs8 essence the administration assumes the trading system will work very well indeed just how well is indicated by figure 3 in order to gain the 68 cost reduction from emission trading between annex 1 countries discussed above 61 of the necessary carbon credits must be bought from other annex 1 countries in order to gain the 88 reductions in costs from global trading 82 of the necessary carbon credits must be bought from other countries in maximum trading scenario developed by the administration up to 88 of carbon credits would be purchased from other countries figure 3 this scale of potential trading may put any resulting us implementation strategy in conflict with restrictions contained in the kyoto protocol and with the negotiating position of other parties to the protocol as noted earlier according to the protocol international emissions trading is to be supplemental implementation tool to domestic efforts according to the latest european union position supplemental means more than 50 if the european standard was adopted in negotiation the estimated savings from trading would be substantially reduced two conclusions emerge from this review first there is little debate among the analyses that emission trading could reduce us compliance cost under kyoto indeed the percentage reductions resulting from increased trading do not differ crs9 greatly rather the dispute is over how well such program would work second it is the assumption of the administrations analysis that trading will work extremely well resulting in substantially lower costs for the united states this possibility may be difficult to achieve given restrictions contained within the kyoto protocol the negotiating position of some of the other parties and the sources from which many of the credits are projected to come moreover current efforts to devise workable trading system suggest that it will be difficult and lengthy process at best implementation pitfalls comparison with acid rain the importance of trading to cost estimates and the scope to which it is employed by the administration in its analysis has direct parallel in any existing environmental program the closest example of such trading program is the acid rain program under title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments however significant differences between acid rain and possible global warming limit the usefulness of title iv as an analogy for an international carbon trading system for example the acid rain program involves up to 3000 new and existing electric generating facilities that contribute twothirds of the countrys sulfur dioxide so2 and onethird of its nitrogen oxide nox emissions the two primary precursors of acid rain this concentration of sources makes the logistics of emissions trading manageable and enforceable however co2 emissions are not so concentrated although over 95 of the co2 generated comes from fossil fuel combustion only about 33 comes from electricity generation transportation accounts for about 33 direct residential and commercial use about 12 and direct industrial use about 20 thus small dispersed sources in these other areas are far more important in controlling co2 emissions than they are in controlling so2 emissions this creates significant administrative and enforcement problems for an international emissions trading program if it attempts to be comprehensive these concerns multiply as the global nature of the program is considered along with the number of greenhouse gases that would be included in it in addition to the substantive differences in the problems the trading dynamics of national so2 trading and international co2 trading are different as indicated by figure 4 the largest projected saving from emission trading under the so2 program is from permitting relatively simple and uncomplicated trading between utilitys own facilities an additional ten percent can be gained by permitting intrastate trading however expanding the boundaries of the trading to interstate trading does not result in as dramatic cost reductions as for intracompany trading for implementation policy this is very significant as it suggests that the so2 trading program does not have to work very efficiently to achieve large proportion of the economic benefits that have been estimated given the increasing regulatory and administrative complexity of expanding the scope of trading to regional levels the trading dynamics suggest that such complexity can be avoided at little loss of economic efficiency16 16 for further discussion see larry b parker robert d poling and john l moore clean air act allowance trading 21 environmental law 4 1991 pp 20232068 crs10 figure 4 however although the positive effects of trading have been borne out in the first few years of the so2 program it is not necessarily harbinger of the potential cost savings from an international carbon trading program first the baselines for measuring cost savings are different for the acid rain program unitbyunit allocation of reduction with absolutely trading is the baseline from which cost savings from trading are measured for carbon trading program the baseline is an interstate or intracountry trading scenario from which cost savings from international trading is measured thus the maximum trading scenario estimated under the acid rain program interstate trading is the baseline scenario for measuring the effect of intercountry trading under carbon trading in essence the trading scenario of the carbon trading program is the interstate trading scenario of the acid rain program thus the scope of international carbon trading is well beyond that of the title iv program second the trading dynamic under the so2 program discussed above contrasts strongly with that projected under an international carbon trading program as indicated in figure 5 under an international carbon trading program only half the anticipated savings from trading occur in transactions between developed annex 1 countries about fifth of the savings projected by charles river associates is the result of hot air credits finally about quarter to third of the anticipated savings crs11 results from transactions with countries not currently covered by the protocol thus about half the total savings from trading would come from sources whose credits are either contested in some quarters or from countries who are not required to participate in the reduction program at all17 figure 5 conclusion the potential for international emission trading to reduce us compliance cost under the kyoto protocol is substantial and indisputable whether that potential can be turned into fact is more problematic the analysis presented here suggests that implementing international emissions trading under kyoto would represent uncharted territory for us environmental policy 17 indeed it is not clear that developing countries can participate in the cdm unless they assume reduction obligations for more on the cdm see united nations development programme issues options the clean development mechanism united nations publications 1998 crs12 first an international emissions trading scheme has to function very efficiently to achieve the savings projected by analyses for example the administrations analysis relies on an unprecedented amount of international trading to achieve the substantial cost reduction its projects under its most aggressive trading scenario 8288 of the us reduction requirement would be bought from foreign sources resulting in domestic co2 reductions of only 66 to 99 million metric tons compared with an estimated 550 million metric tons if all reduction were achieved domestically18 even restricting trading to annex 1 countries results in 61 of the countrys reduction requirement coming from foreign sources the magnitude of transactions not only raises questions of its feasibility but may also conflict with the intent of the kyoto protocol and with the positions of some other countries which states that international emissions trading is to be supplemental to domestic actions second besides the amount of trading estimated the sources of these reductions raise additional questions for example according to analysis by charles river associates half the estimated savings from international emissions trading would come from either hot air credits from the former soviet union or from transactions with third world countries that are not required to participate in the program trading with these sources does not have the certainty that trading with most annex 1 countries would have in terms of monitoring enforcement and integrity of transactions with respect to the former soviet union current problems with achieving compliance with the montreal protocol far simpler international treaty does not bode well for the kyoto protocol that economic difficulties are proffered by these countries as grounds for noncompliance and nonenforcement of the montreal protocol is particularly disturbing as those same difficulties are the source of the hot air credits the situation may be more uncertain with third world transactions as developing countries generally have neither the incentive of binding obligation under the protocol nor the infrastructure to monitor enforce and protect the integrity of transactions in addition there may be complications resulting from the kyoto protocol itself as currently written transactions with third world countries are to be funneled through clean development mechanism an institution whose role and parameters have yet to be worked out how much this middle man mechanism would affect trades is unclear third the situation with international carbon trading is not analogous to the acid rain program often cited as model19 the acid rain program involves domestic trading in one pollutant from about 3000 relatively large stationary sources as such it has been administratively manageable enforceable and successful the kyoto protocol involves 6 pollutants millions of small medium and large sources and 18 for further information on the projected us reduction requirement under the kyoto protocol see larry parker and john blodgett global climate change reducing greenhouse gases how much from what baseline crs report 98235 enr march 11 1998 19 for example see council of economic advisors economic report of the president us govt print off february 1997 pp 208213 crs13 international trading the maximum trading scenario under the acid rain program interstate trading is the baseline for international trading under the kyoto protocol while electric generating facilities the focus of the acid rain trading program account for twothirds of us sulfur dioxide emission they account for only 29 of the six greenhouse gases emitted in the us mostly carbon dioxide other more dispersed energy uses such as transportation make up most of the rest add the international scope of carbon trading to this mix and it is clear that implementation challenges would be on different level than that encountered with the acid rain program level to which the implementation of the acid rain program provides little guidance besides questions raised by the scale of carbon trading the trading dynamics of carbon trading differ from those of the acid rain program unlike an international carbon trading program that must operate very efficiently to achieve much of its cost savings the acid rain program does not have to do so the simplest trades those between companys own plants achieve the greatest cost savings under the acid rain program not interstate trades between unassociated parties that there have been relatively few interstates trades so far under the acid rain program means once again that the program provides little guidance to any future international carbon trading program in short to expect trading to reduce costs by the 8090 suggested by some analyses seems at the current time to be unrealistic indeed the complexity presented by international emissions trading suggest that alternatives may deserve hearing for other versions of this document see
