public broadcasting act of 1967 pl 90129 the cpb was intended to provide funding mechanism for individual public broadcasting stations but not subject these stations to political influence or favoritism cpb was also intended to provide funding mechanism for the creation and operation of program distribution systems interconnecting the individual public broadcasting stations therefore the cpb receives an annual appropriation and then uses this money to provide grants to individual public television and radio broadcast entities and independent program producers and distributors the public broadcasting service p bs national public radio npr and public radio international pri sometimes receive direct grants from cpb but the vast majority of the appropriated money goes directly to individual cal public broadcasting stations including most of the member stations and affiliates of these national organizations the number of radio and television public broadcasting stations supported by the cpb increased from 270 in 1969 to approximately 1100 as of august 2003 of which 356 are television stations public broadcasting stations are mostly run by universities nonprofit community associations state government agencies and local school boards public broadcasting is regarded by many as public service to serve most americans public television reaches approximately 99 of the population and public radio 91 with regard to programming the public broadcasting system observes the principle of local autonomy that is public broadcasting stations make decisions independently of the cpb as to what programming will be available to their viewing or listening audience as well as on their programming schedule 1

for public television and radio broadcasting the cpb is nonprofit private corporation and is guided by 9member board of directors of which the members are appointed by the president with the advice

g347g561media attention was directed towards several controversial films particularly hound dog starring 13year old actress dakota fanning who is assaulted in the movie one group the american family association afa noted on its website that these controversial films were being funded with pbs taxpayer money3 the afa initiated campaign for its members to write to members of congress to protest pbs involvement at sundance in response pbs released information on its participation in the sundance film festival according to pbs it participates in this festival because it considers it as one of the highest profile showcases of documentary films in the united states pbs contends that it has control or influence over films the sundance film festival accepts in 2007 pbs provided 40000 to sponsor events at the filmmaker lodge venue for educational panels on film making film distribution and other industry issues pbs executives participated on panels at the filmmaker lodge to discuss film making and distribution of documentaries and to highlight pbs films and film makers accepted at the festival pbs sponsorship funds have been used to support specific nonpbs film in addition the pbs funds used at the festival come from member station dues not federally appropriated money 4 in may 2007 another broadcasting controversy occurred when pbs decided not to nationally distribute documentary entitled islam vs islamists v oices from the muslim center the 52 minute film contends that among other issues moderate muslims are being intimidated by radical islamists in several western nations including the united sates the films producers claimed that pbs and the station that produced the film bowed to pressure from conservative american muslims by pressuring pbs not to distribute the film nationally eight members of congress reportedly responded by letter demanding that cpb ask pbs to release the film or find another avenue for distribution in response cpb released the film to oregon public broadcasting which will distribute it to other public broadcast stations in the country this will likely result in fewer stations airing the film th an if otherwise distributed through pbs observers are concerned that cpb has contradicted its original mandate of 1967 to buffer public broadcasting and its stations from political pressure 5
