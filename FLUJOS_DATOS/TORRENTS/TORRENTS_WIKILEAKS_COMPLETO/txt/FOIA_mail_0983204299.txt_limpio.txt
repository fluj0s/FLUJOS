from tom crowley tomoceantamuedu to michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu subject re wally date mon 26 feb 2001 111819 0600 cc mhughesltrrarizonaedu rbradleygeoumassedu kbriffaueaacuk pjonesueaacuk tosbornueaacuk mike you are really the most appropriate person to be the lead author on this i was just volunteering myself as the unfortunate soul who has to bear the brunt of wallys wrath tom ps peck would be fine of course but i dont know whether we want to get him tangled up in the acrimony we could of course ask for his comments beforehand hi tom thanksi was thinking this too ray held out real olive branch to wally by the extremely balanced piece he wrote in science last year some of us thought he caved in bit too much so there was absolutely reason for wally to write this piece if julie uppenbrink gives us the goahead i say lets do as tom suggests i think this has lot more cachet if all on this list are willing to sign on as coauthors regarding primary authorship on the one hand it would be appropriate for tsince it is primarily mann et that is explicitly under attack here though all of us are implicitly under attack however i think the piece carries lot more weight if it is authored by someone of wallys stature and i think tom far better fits the bill in this regard so if tom is willing to bear the brunt of this i would definitely endorse him being primary author i would argue to include peck too but i think this would be conflict for him as he is pretty close to wally so best to leave it w the current group in my opinion lets pursue this further once phil hears back from ju mike at 0916 am 22601 0600 tom crowley wrote hi all i vote for response quick and to the point itemized in fact the only problem is somehow has to volunteer to be the sacrificial lamb as first author that person will almost certainly be badgered by wally and probably charged with some trumped up unethical piece he will also probably try to subvert the review process by contacting the editor of science this is not paranoia wally did exactly this when some people some at lamont questioned his conveyor explanation for the lia that came out in science year or so ago he was actually screaming at some of these people in the lamont lunch room that said i say we must bite the bullet and do it wally doesnt like anyway so it wouldnt make as much difference to if i volunteered to go to the slaughter but if there is anyone else who wants to take the lead thats fine with tom ps as i indicated the other day i will be in only until this friday after which i am out for month i could write enough to get us going and then hand it over to someone else to deal with the submission business mike thanks bunch phil will look forward to hearing back w more info i talked to dick kerr last week about related stuff an ipcc article hes writing and he made mention of this at all i wonder who did commission this and why mike at 0251 pm 22601 0000 phil jones wrote mike ive had quick read and sent an email to julia uppenbrink to get her views as she commissioned our piece also asked about response particularly on the high and low frequency indicators i was going to send wally two papers sarah rapers on linking trees and glaciers in j glaciol and brian luckmans in the holocene where the two are also linked but only in qualitative way from the weekend it was clear he had ideas about these his lack of knowledge of density data in trees come through in the article as well in maine he also went on at length about the stine work and seems to in this piece as well malcolm should know all about this im going to go home soon as im getting knackered but ill email you julias response i think shell find out who asked wally to do it as he implied to it was cheers phil ps meant to say at the start that i see your points thanks for pasting it to us prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603
