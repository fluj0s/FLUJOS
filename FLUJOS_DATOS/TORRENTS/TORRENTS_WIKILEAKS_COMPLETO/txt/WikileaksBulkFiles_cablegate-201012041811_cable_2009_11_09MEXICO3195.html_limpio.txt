issues classified by political minister counselor gustavo delgado reason 14 bd 1 snf summary president calderons security strategy lacks an effective intelligence apparatus to produce high quality information and targeted operations embassy officers working with the gom report that mexicos use of strategic and tactical intelligence is fractured ad hoc and reliant on us support despite their myriad inefficiencies and deficiencies mexican security services broadly recognize the need for improvement sustained us assistance can help shape and fortify the technical capacity of institutions and can also create more reliable collegial interagency environment end summary gom intel strategy criticized 2 c recent criticism of president calderons security strategy cites poorly utilized and underdeveloped intelligence apparatus as key obstacle to greater improvements in the countrys security environment calderons political opponents from both the institutional revolutionary party pri and the revolutionary democratic party prd have told poloff that largescale joint militarypolice counterdrug deployments notably joint operation chihuahua have failed to make real gains in the war against organized crime due to reliance on overwhelming numerical superiority of troops absent the strategic and operational use of intelligence critics argue that the more effective use of intelligence would help the security services better cooperate on counterdrug issues wrapup more highlevel traffickers and eventually curb the countrys escalating rates of narcorelated violence emboffs working with the gom in counternarcotics and intelligence matters similarly note that mexicos use of strategic and tactical intelligence is often fractured ad hoc and heavily reliant on the united states for leads and operations the players 3 snf myriad of gom agencies have stake in counternarcotics intel issues including the secretariats of defense sedena and marines semar the mexican national intelligence center cisen the public security secretariat ssp which includes the federal police and the attorney generals office pgr each has different intelligence mission and varying levels of development and professionalism as mexicos primary intelligence agency cisen is the natural choice to be the goms coordinator of intelligence and analytic efforts indeed it technically has the lead on encouraging interagency coordination and is developing mechanisms to facilitate such endeavors for the most part however cisen lacks the capacity to effectively direct the interagency process particularly when it includes such institutional giants as ssp which bureaucratically overshadows cisen in budget personnel and other resource issues cisens inability thus far to serve as real leader on intelligence operations and analysis has effectively left mexico without an effective interagency coordinator 4 snf ssp is increasingly becoming major player on the intel block it is exploring ways to take advantage of new authorities granted under the federal police reform legislation passed last year to develop its intelligence capabilities ssp can now directly solicit telephonic information from phone companies with judicial order bypassing the pgr entirely it is also interested in building its own complete telecommunications intercept capability the implementation of which has stalled over the past two years because of turf disputes between ssp and the attorney generals office moreover as the keeper of plataforma mexico the massive new criminal database the ssp oversees one of the goms cornerstone and resourceheavy informationsharing projects mexico 00003195 002 of 005 the challenges 5 snf the gom faces number of institutional challenges to more effectively develop analyze and use information for intelligencebased operations one of the most critical of these is the lack of trust between and within gom institutions emboffs report that sedena for example has wellestablished intel units that develop targeting packages on cartel kingpins in general they do not share information or analysis with forces on the ground deployed to fight counternarcotics like in ciudad juarez these units will share threat information against military components but also see local military commands as often penetrated by organized crime locally deployed sedena forces rarely develop or utilize tactical intelligence in fact they have true intel units that collect information nor do they have professional intel corps military units deployed to hotspots operate virtually blind except for anonymous tips particularly given the fallout from the highlevel corruption cases uncovered last year pgr and ssp suffer from similar internal suspicions as sedena 6 snf institutions are fiercely protective of their own information and equities and are reluctant to share information with outsiders in part because of corruption fears but also because they would rather hoard intelligence than allow rival agency to succeed they are under enormous pressure to produce results moreover bureaucratic culture in mexico is generally risk averse so intelligence entities would rather do nothing than do something wrong corruption fears are wellfounded given the number of operations that have been compromised or foiled because of leaks emboffs note that constructing an effective intelligence structure in mexicos northern border area is particularly difficult as many of the regions security forces are compromised the rivalry between attorney general medina mora recently replaced by arturo chavez chavez and ssps genaro garcia luna dramatically diminished cooperation and informationsharing between the two services leadership and personality conflicts may in fact be one of the most significant drivers of whether or not agencies set themselves up as rivals or allies in sharing important information some observers see the new federal police and pgr reforms as unlikely to resolve the zero sum competition and it is too early to know whether the chavez appointment will mitigate the specific pgrssp problem 7 snf there are also some legal and institutional unknowns ssp which receives the bulk of the goms security budget now has the legal backing it needs to allow garcia luna to move ahead in building large new intelligence and investigative program with such indigenous capabilities ssp probably would have even less incentive to cooperate with pgr sedena meanwhile tends to work better with pgr than with ssp but the armys efforts are still highly limited and compartmentalized and it remains to be seen how better vetting practices and stronger ssp will impact those relations secretary of defense galvan galvan in recent meeting with us officials expressed little interest in bolstering cooperation with other agencies because of internal strife and mistrust in gom institutions mission law enforcement agencies say that usg elements tend to work with gom counterparts separately which may end up indirectly contributing to stovepiping taking steps to get smart 8 snf there is broad recognition among mexican security and intelligence agencies as well as political leadership that they must do better in developing sources analyzing information and using it operationally they also know that the effective use of intelligence requires more complete collaboration between involved bureaucracies despite its deficiencies the gom does have some intelligence capabilities and emboffs note that when they are deployed in full force as in michoacan they can do good work mexico 00003195 003 of 005 9 snf the gom is working hard to improve communication among agencies with stake in intelligence cisen is trying to develop mechanisms to facilitate coordination for example cisen has established at its mexico city headquarters fusion center that has representatives from every involved agency including the finance secretariat ssp pgr semar sedena and state and local investigators when they can be trusted mexico is also in the process of establishing series of tactical operations intelligence units unitos at military bases in each state throughout the country the gom has established number of units reports range from 9 to 27 with participation from the army navy ssp pgr and cisen comprising command section tactical analysis group investigations group operations sector and cadre of judicial experts when properly functioning the unitos provides centralizing platform for federal forces to work together share information and plan operations it is still unclear as to whether these would be short or long term units but if implemented correctly they might serve as key piece of revamped gom intel and operational architecture so far the unitos are plagued by the same interagency rivals and mistrust that characterize the broader institutional relationships and have not yet reached the point of being effective 10 c the statelevel c4 centers command control communications and coordination are at the low end glorified emergency call centers at the high end they include more professional analytic cells that produce useful analysis and planning documents and also have quick response time the more complete c4s include representatives from national and regional entities and are the nerve centers for daytoday information flow intelligence and directing operations in the state they are often also the link to national databases such as plataforma mexico huge disparities between state c4s exist but many states are working to move their units from merely housing emergency dispatchers to being functional hubs of operations and intelligence the unitos often rely on information fed from good c4s in addition to federal databases and platforms 11 c plataforma mexico is another important piece of the intel puzzle and continues to expand its presence throughout the country the megacriminal database has wide array of informationsharing and analytical tools that help to track and share information on individuals and organized crime cells vehicles air movements and is linked with an increasing number of surveillance and security cameras the database is housed at ssp and is being deployed to an increasing number of states with different tiers of access that are controlled through the vetting system not all states have access mostly because they have yet to comply with federal standards in order to be connected and some states with access have complained that the system is too slow to be of any use to them additionally project constanza is pgrs new case tracking system for the judicial system and will include all data related to individual cases of persons apprehended and later charged some pieces may be made available to plataforma mexico and pgr would like to have system for tracking detentions that can be made available to police units when apprehending suspect the mission is actively engaged in trying to plug etrace atfs powerful arms tracing software into both systems 12 snf despite myriad challengece cooperation with the usg on intelligence and counternarcotics issues has never been better indeed embassy experts say that mexican authorities often rely on tips from us law enforcement and intelligence organizations and that many successful captures of important cartel figures are often backed by us assistance mexico has indicated interest in improving its collection and use of intelligence with additional us help for example in early 2009 the director of the national security information center came to mexico to among other things meet with cisen director valdez nsic runs the merida culture of lawfulness project but also works in the field of mexico 00003195 004 of 005 intelligence structures in democratic societies he pitched to valdez program developed by nsic to divide hostile zone into series of quadrants and assign team to each that contains four specialties interviewers humint signals interceptors sigint analysts and operators as well as an adequate security contingent to keep the members secure in their safe area and during movement the teams take up residence in the area as clandestinely as possible and begin to develop sources and information that is used to make arrests at the same time the team filters raw and semiprocessed information to the next level which has parallel structure but more robust operations capabilities and higher level skill sets especially for analyzing the information the ideas is to develop strategic as opposed to tactical information that can be used to take apart whole networks valdez was impressed by the concept and directed his deputy gustavo mohar to meet with the embassys nas director to discuss its viability in us programming nas director and legatt met with mohar and suggested that in the training line of merida it would be possible to pursue such program comment 13 snf mexico is long way from developing selfsufficient and expert intelligence apparatus but the creation of coherent system is critical for the sustained success of its antiorganized crime efforts usggom cooperation while not flawless has never been better close collaboration and assistance in training and improving mexican security agencies ability to produce and use intelligence in key counterdrug operations undoubtedly is critical and will pay dividends over time perhaps the greatest challenge to lasting progress on intelligence matters is cultivating an environment of trust based on high standards of security among mexicos law enforcement military and intelligence agencies to ensure that information is appropriately collected shared protected and acted upon reducing institutional rivalries and encouraging agencies to move past the zerosum mindset that one entitys success in catching highvalue target is anothers loss is also critical to reducing rivalries and distrust on intelligence issues the growing ssp footprint on intelligence matters has the potential to seriously impact the informationsharing dynamic factor that will have to be integrated into our assistance programs to ensure that we do not exacerbate existing institutional tensions particularly with the pgr while our mexican interlocutors recognize the need for greater interagency cooperation they are reluctant to address the problem the solution will require sustained us help in fortifying institutions against the corruption inefficiencies and backbiting that have bred distrust amongst gom partners 14 snf the usg can help mexico develop interagency capabilities and there are number of line items in the merida initiative that can be employed in this effort for example the polygraph program properly pushed out to the states and consistently applied to special units could help produce the core integrity and trust that all good intelligence will depend on the statelevel law enforcement c4 coordination centers when done right can bring all agencies and information together plataforma mexico the core database for law enforcement informationsharing is rolling out across mexico with new resources in 2009 that will enhance its capabilities and accessibility through law enforcement professionalization we are training investigators who will be key piece of the intelligence puzzle as they serve as frontline collectors we will be supporting vetted units among the highest yielding entities in the gom for intelligence with usd 5 million of fy2009 funding perhaps most importantly these programs can serve as effective carrots to resolve the entrenched mistrust and parochialism of mexican institutions by ensuring that organizations come to the table together when necessary to support the goms efforts to combat rife corruption within its institutions mexico 00003195 005 of 005 visit mexico citys classified web site at
