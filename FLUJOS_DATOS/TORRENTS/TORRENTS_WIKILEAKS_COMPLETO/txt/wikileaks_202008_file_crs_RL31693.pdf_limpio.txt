congress have historically played different roles when sending us troops into hostile situations the president has the power under article ii section 2 of the constitution to use the armed forces to repel attacks congre ss under article i section 8 has the power to declare war and raise and support the armed forces the war powers resolution1 was enacted to ensure that the president and congress share decisions where us troops may become involved in hostilities this sharing of power has often resulted in controversy particularly when troops are sent into situations where there has not been formal declaration of war in most instances congress has used its legislative prerogatives through funding mechanisms or declarations of policy either to affirm or to place limits on presidential action in three instances congress has authorized the use of military force in advance of hostilities the persian gulf war 1991 military operations in afghanistan 2001 and the use of force against iraq resolution 2002 in each case however the president has maintained that while he may have sought congressional consultation and support the president has the constitutional authority as commander in chief to use force including the armed forces of the united states to protect us national security interests g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g5g152g151g157g142g151g157g561 this report describes the congressional debate that often surrounds the issue of employing the us military abroad initially written in response to congressional request for list of votes on this topic from 19821992 this report has been updated as needed since that time the votes included are those directly related to the use and funding of us troops abroad often in the context of the war powers resolution or to their continued presence or withdrawal the laws bills and resolutions below are listed in the chronological order of the votes that were held links to the actual roll call votes are provided when available since 1990 in the house and 1989 in the senate these links include each members yea or nay vote in some cases house or senate votes are voice votes and thus roll call vote exists moreover the ultimate disposition of amendments listed in the report ie whether such amendments were incorporated into any final law may not be selfevident in other instances only one chamber of congress may have voted on particular measure for example house or senate simple resolution is nonlegislative measure that expresses nonbinding opinions on policies or issues and is effective only in the chamber in which it is proposed it does not require concurrence by the other chamber or approval by the president 1 pl 93148 november 7 1973 for more detailed contextual and legislative history information see crs report
