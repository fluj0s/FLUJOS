developing countries june 16 1999 marc humphries analyst in energy policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress abstract china leads the world in coal use and co2 emissions from coal coal use in china and other asian developing countries is expected to increase significantly over the next 20 years the 1997 kyoto agreement on global climate change imposes binding reductions in emissions of co2 and other major greenhouse gases on developed nations but not on china and other developing nations with chinas co2 increases projected to surpass us emissions by 2020 the clinton administration says it will not send the agreement to the senate for advice and consent without meaningful participation by developing countries this report discusses the factors behind chinas planned reliance on coal for future energy growth and provides statistics on coal use and co2 emissions in asia global climate change coal use in china and other asian developing countries summary under the international global climate change agreement negotiated in december 1997 in kyoto japan the united states would be required to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and other greenhouse gases by 7 from their 1990 or 1995 levels depending on the gas however the kyoto protocol places binding greenhouse gas restrictions on developing countries such as china and india whose co2 emissions are projected to grow dramatically concerns have arisen in the united states that without binding agreement from china india and other developing countries the responsibility for realizing worldwide greenhouse gas reduction goals would fall entirely on industrialized countries while developing countries continue to increase their emissions before completion of the kyoto protocol the us senate passed resolution sres 98 urging that the united states not become party to the treaty if it did not include specified commitments by developing countries to limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions the clinton administration has stated it will not send the protocol to the senate for consideration until meaningful participation by developing countries is achieved developing countries are being encouraged to make voluntary commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions economists anticipate many asian developing countries will continue to experience rapid economic growth in the years ahead that will increase their demand for electric power with coal likely to be major energy source to support that growth forecasts show world coal demand growing nearly 70 between 1995 and 2020 with china and india accounting for 85 of that increase coal is major source of co2 emissions china one of the worlds fastest growing economies is on track to become the world leader in co2 emissions within 20 years and is already the world leader in co2 emissions from coal however to date china and india have not made any voluntary commitments to limit co2 emissions china is expected to rely on coal to power much of its future development because of its abundant domestic reserves and low cost and because the nations infrastructure is better developed at this time for coal than for other energy sources china stresses its right to pursue this course of development fostering economic growth while curtailing co2 emissions from fossil fuels is one of the greatest dilemmas facing attempts to encourage thirdworld participation in greenhouse gas reduction efforts until this is addressed the extent of us participation remains unclear contents introduction

rapid upward trend particularly in china1 this trend has special relevance to issues related to global climate change because the burning of coal currently accounts for some onethird of all carbon dioxide co2 emissions worldwide and co2 accounts for 85 of all greenhouse gas emissions increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may affect global climate systems2 to address the global climate change issue the third conference of the parties cop3 of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc convened in december 1997 in kyoto japan parties to the resulting protocol agreed to legally binding reductions in emissions of the six major greenhouse gases3 for the developed countries listed in annex i of the unfccc and referred to as annex i countries each annex i country negotiated specific emissions reduction commitment listed in annex b to be met as an average over commitment period between 2008 and 20124 if the united states ratifies the treaty it would be committed to reduction of 7 cumulatively for the six gases below 1990 emissions levels for co2 ch4 and n2o and below 1995 levels for the remaining three gases during this commitment period5 the kyoto protocols lack of corresponding commitments for china and other developing countries has been key point of contention before completion of the kyoto protocol the us senate passed resolution sres 98 urging that the united states not sign the treaty if it did not require developing countries to take on 1 in the statistics cited in this report developing asia includes all

from what baseline crs2 binding commitments to limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions ongoing negotiations and discussions are dealing with this issue the clinton administration has signed the kyoto protocol but has stated it will not submit the agreement to the senate until meaningful participation by developing countries has been achieved6 one major difficulty in engaging developing countries in limiting greenhouse gas emissions is the dependence of these countries on fossil fuels especially coal for their economic development chinas energy future is particularly important to greenhouse gas emissions vast reserves of coal constitute chinas primary energy resource resource that the chinese government has said it plans to exploit as part of the huge nations future development china has the thirdlargest proved reserves in the world see table 1 table 1 proven coal resources for selected countries 1996 estimated in million short tons rank country total proved

coal use trends coal plays crucial role in energy demand and supply in the developing countries of asia china accounts for 73 of coal consumption in developing asia now and could increase its share to 82 by 2020 china and india together already make up nearly 90 of developing asias coal consumption developing countries such as china and india expect their use of coal for electricity generation to increase tremendously to support rapid economic growth see table 3 electric power transmission projects in the region designed to alleviate power shortages that hinder economic development have been funded by the world bank over the past several years8 in 1998 the world bank group provided 550 million towards power transmission projects totaling about 16 billion and 63 million of total 151 million for energy efficiency projects much of the energy development will rely on private sector financing and primarily on coal as the least cost energy source asian and world energy demand generally economic growth assumptions of countries throughout developing asia indicate there will likely be an enormous increase in the consumption of coal natural gas and oil according to one estimate coal would grow between 22 to 47 each year and nuclear would grow as much as 49 annually through 20209 natural gas growth in asia may be anywhere between 61 to 84 annually oil consumption could grow at an annual rate between 25 to 48 see figure 1 despite these large projected total increases energy consumption per capita will likely 8 the world bank group annual reports 19891998

together will grow at slower rate than natural gas oil nuclear and renewables between 1995 and 2020 expected rapid growth in the transportation sector largely drives the projected increase in oils share of the energy market the annual growth rate for natural gas consumption outpaces coal consumption in china and india because natural gas starts off at such low level as result coal consumption falls from 53 of total energy consumption in developing asia in 1995 to 48 in 2020 while natural gas rises from 7 of total energy consumption to 15 over the same period the small amount of nuclear capacity in the developing asianpacific region is expected to double between 1995 and 2020 but declines as percent of the total energy share world coal demand is expected to increase by nearly 70 from 1995 to 202010 if current trends continue china and india are expected to account for 85 of that increase during that same period coals share of total energy consumption falls only 1 percentage point from 25 to 24 see figure 2 and holds steady at 36 of fuels used for electricity generation11 the world annual energy consumption growth rate is predicted to be 4 for coal 86 for natural gas and 6 for oil over the same 25year period chinas percentage of world coal consumption has risen from 17 in 1980 to 29 in 1995 and is forecasted to climb to 37 by 2020 according to the energy information administration eia12 china is banking on its huge coal reserves to help power its future economic growth even though the projected rapid rise in coal demand will require enormous amounts of infrastructure to deliver energy to end users china is relying heavily on foreign investors for much of this needed capital13 electric power generation accounts for most of the projected increase in asian coal consumption over the next 20 years the power generation sector increases its share of total asian coal use from 41 in 1995 to 54 in 2020 according to current projections14 with the worlds largest population 12 billion china has one of the lowest electrification rates in the world but is expected to increase electricity generation from 925 billion kwh 1996 to 2030 billion kwh in 2010 and reach 3486 billion kwh by 2020 see table 315 china is projected to increase its consumption of coal for electricity generation at an annual rate of 53 this would imply nearly fourfold increase in

just to meet its year 2000 capacity needs us firms have already invested heavily in chinas power facilities by investing in significant share of 16 coalfired power plants the director of chinas state power corporation recently made the point that chinas rapid economic growth is creating huge demand for energy which provides great opportunities for foreign investors however the terms of foreign direct investment in china are fluid for example policy of guaranteed returns for foreign investors was recently terminated which means that new investments in china will be more risky18 additionally china places wide variety of restrictions on foreign investment including limited ownership asian coal and world markets according to standard and poors dri world energy service growth in asias coal imports including those of japan will average nearly 13 annually between 19952020 the fastest rate in the world much of this import growth will occur outside of china because of chinas huge production

18 bangsberg pt china ends guaranteed returns for foreign investors in the energy sector journal of commerce april 19 1999 crs7 available to meet its demand19 under basecase scenario prepared by the energy information administration eia asian coal imports would almost double from 257 million short tons to 442 million short tons excluding japan coal imports into asia would be expected easily to more than double from 119 million short tons to 271 million short tons between 1995 and 2020 india which currently imports little coal for country its size is believed to have substantial potential for import growth20 under eias basecase scenario forecasts for metallurgical coal trade coal used in steel are flat from 1996 to 2020 some regions will decline and others will rise in trade but the net effect is flat in contrast trade in steam coal coal burned for energy almost doubles from 305 million short tons in 1996 to 540 million short tons in 202021 the biggest exporters will continue to be australia the united states and south africa over the period 19962020 most of the us and south african exports will go to europe australias exports will go to asia coal exports from south america and australia are growing at the fastest rate annually at 36 and 20 respectively south africas coal exports increase 18 annually and those of the united states 14 under the eia base case co2 emissions trends the kyoto agreement requires the united states to cut back greenhouse gas emissions from all sources by about 7 from their 1990 or 1995 levels depending on the gas co2 represents 82 of the us emissions inventory if co2 emissions were reduced in the same proportion as other greenhouse gases annual us carbon emissions would fall to 1252 million metric tons mmt by 2010 under the kyoto agreement according to eia if us emissions continued to increase at current trends they would reach 1803 mmt in 2010 and 1956 by 2020 china on the other hand would produce 1481 mmt of carbon emissions by 2010 and 2340 mmt by 2020 china is therefore projected to surpass us emissions by 2020 even if the united states pursues business as usual policy and does not reduce its emissions22 the amount of carbon dioxide produced by developing countries in asia is expected to outpace co2 emissions in developed countries even with kyoto cutbacks in the developed world china already the world leader in co2 emissions from coal is on track to lead the world in total co2 emissions in developing asia india is projected to remain distant second in co2 emissions all the developing countries of asia are projected to produce about 38 of world co2 emissions by 19 ibid p 82 20 doeeia 1998 p 8182 21 doeeia 1998 p 81 22 doe eia 1998 p142 crs8 2020 nearly catching up to projected businessasusual emissions from the industrialized nations23 china intends for coal to power its future development see tables 1 and 2 because of its abundance and low cost and because the nations infrastructure is better developed for coal than for other energy sources fostering economic growth while curtailing co2 emissions from fossil fuels is one of the greatest dilemmas facing developed countries attempts to encourage thirdworld participation in greenhouse gas reduction efforts according to white paper on environment issued by the peoples republic of china prc in 1996 china attaches equal importance to energy conservation and the growth of the energy industry china has already enacted many laws on environmental protection including the law on the prevention of air pollution under the national environmental protection agency china has established three major policies for environmental protection 1 putting prevention first and combining control technology with prevention 2 making the polluter responsible for treatment of pollution and 3 intensifying environmental management24 however it is unclear as to what extent these laws are enforced and whether those policies will have significant effect on chinas projected co2 emissions from coal according to united nations development program undp report one view is that china is substantially improving its energy efficiency and has already cut its energy consumption per unit of output in half with improved technology since 1980 also noted was that chinas emissions growth rate was well below its per capita gross national product gnp growth rate see table 4 statistic considered by some to indicate that china is already participating meaningfully in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from previous trends25 in other words china is well below where it would have been had energy efficiency measures been put in place according to this view 23 ibid 24 white paper on environment issued by the information office of the state council in beijing june 4 1996 25 mythical monster fred pearce slays the myth of the chinese carbon dragon new scientist january 9 1999 p 44 crs9 table 4 per capita trends for china and the

50 by the year 2020 meaning that the economy continues to grow faster than energy consumption and possibly grow more efficiently also the relative size of co2 emissions to the size of the economy shows china approaching the united states the table also illustrates that co2 per capita in china would remain far below that of the united states during the same period that the total amount of co2 will greatly exceed that of the united states however even though chinas emissions of co2 grow at slower rate than its gnp overall its total co2 emissions would be the highest in the world by 2020 under various growth scenarios potential strategies for addressing the co2 problem in developing countries include technology research and development technology transfer and emissions trading schemes these are growing areas of interest by the us government and the world bank that are addressed in separate crs reports27 projected energy supply and emissions from other sources although chinas economic development plans rely primarily on coal other energy sources are also projected to increase as noted above number of natural gas projects are currently underway in china according to the president of china national petroleum corp china should double its annual gas production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by 200528 however that amount would still be only about 5 of current us production nuclear power could become more prominent in chinas power supply mix three reactors are currently operating and four more are currently under construction and scheduled to begin operation by 2003 two additional plants may be in the 26 us and china gnp and population data for 1990 was obtained from the statistical abstract of the united states us department of commerce bureau of the census 1998 gnp projections for the us were calculated based on an annual growth rate of 25 percent gnp projections for china are based on an average annual growth rate of 7 percent 27 see crs report

journal of commerce november 6 1998 p 11a crs10 works29 forecasts show that nuclear power could provide 2 of chinas energy in the year 202030 under chinas most aggressive nuclear scenario nuclear power capacity would increase from 12 billion kwh in 1995 to 125 billion kwh in 2020 an average annual increase of nearly 1031 hydropower development of the three gorges dam in china is expected to be completed by 2010 and provide 85 billion kwh of electricity per year and produce co2 emissions32 in china carbon emissions from natural gas are projected to grow from 12 to 23 of total carbon emissions during the period 1996202033 worldwide carbon emissions from natural gas remain at between 1520 of total carbon emissions34 carbon emissions from petroleum increase at pace of 5 each year in china and remain at about 15 of total carbon emissions during the 19962020 time frame there are direct carbon emissions from nuclear power or hydropower conclusions asian developing countries use of coal especially chinas should continue to rise substantially because of the current electric generating capacity designed for coal huge reserve base and coal production capacity already in place natural gas rises at faster rate than coal but has much lower starting point only in the very long term will natural gas begin to make dent in the energy supply picture and co2 emissions because of the hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure projects needed estimates of worldwide carbon emissions show most of the emissions growth is taking place in china and india largely because of the projected growth in coal consumption without the kyoto protocol in place the developing world as whole will emit about the same amount of carbon as the developed world by the year 2010 carbon emissions from developing countries should surpass those from the industrialized world by the year 2020 the asian coal outlook raises questions about global climate change policy if the emissions issue is not sufficiently addressed in developing asia especially china and india senate ratification of the kyoto protocol appears doubtful but given developing asias current plans for economic growth based largely on coal and other fossil fuels gaining the regions acceptance of kyotostyle co2 limits is likely to face many challenges the search for strategies that will satisfy both the industrialized and 29 world list of nuclear power plants nuclear news march 1999 p 35 30 doeiea p 163 31 doeeia 1998 p153 32 doeeia 1998 p 117 and spdri p 100 33 doeeia 1998 34 based on reference case
