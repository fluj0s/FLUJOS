bridge publications inc newsletter date operating as professional scientologist now we scientologists very often some of us make slight error we think scientology is totally auditing scientology is not totally auditing scientology is broad address to life itself i just received letter from an auditor who says i am not working professionally in scientology now and then goes on to say that shes running an accounting business which is succeeding wonderfully because shes using scientology in it and shes handling all her help with this and handling all of her customers with this and shes getting along beautifully and shes straightened out her home with this and its never occurred to her that she is operating as professional scientologist and could simply expand that accounting business of hers to organizational accounting with scientology to level that she hasnt dreamed of yet she has thought of scientology as simply auditingjust auditing preclear to better his health thats what shes thought of scientology as now thats an awfully narrow lookan awfully narrow look but there are those of us who do just this and do further than this and that is all right too because in order to run business with scientology or to conduct yourself as professional business scientologist you would have to know auditing and be very very good auditor because its essentially the action of bringing people into an awareness of themselves their surroundings and you l ron hubbard excerpted from the power of simplicity lectures willingness and the power of choice an article by l ron hubbard from the power of simplicity lectures now if everybody was brute and everybody could get through life by using his two fists we wouldnt have any civilization if the government depended completely upon its bayonets to enforce its laws there would be government they are dealing with random factor that factor is willingness all an industry can take from its employees is the willingness of the employee to serve and when that gets dulled down its gone and matter how much force you use youre not going to get any work done this is something the great empires of earth i dont know theyre buried someplace i noticed old ragged bones showing through the soil every now and then which was some great empire of earth and these great empires of earth one after the other have failed to learn this lesson man cannot be controlled by force man is controlled only by his own willingness its fantastic lesson youll never get anybody who has the power of hiring lordknowshowmany legions convinced that he might have skipped the recruitment in the first place if he wanted decent state the legion blunts the willingness you can force into position and situation people to the degree that they are willing to be forced into position and to cooperate that willingness is so tremendous that it is only measurable by the will to live itself that is tremendous willingness what it takes to blunt it is fantastic but the only thing that ever blunts it is force forceapplication of force to an individual to overcome the selfdeterminism and power of choice of his own mind when force is used to overcome the power of choice of an individual we may have the individual moving along certain pattern afterwards but the movement will become devious interestingly random and will then cease and so do nations run down so do they get old there is random factor at all times amongst people and that random factor is the power of choice of the individual an individual becomes as well as his power of choice is restored to him its quite an interesting thing to just set out with process which is determined just to do nothing but restore persons power of choice now to give you pat process that would do this would be rather silly but i can give you class of processes that would not be silly lets just go on the line of decision decision itself is not the topmost bracket of power of choice because the word decision implies that something goes before he has to decide about something therefore this is very lowlevel process two things must exist or more to then demand of the individual decision amongst them and so this precludes that we have primarycause situation here but the power to postulate lies through the power to decide when an individual cannot decide its certainty he cannot postulate thats fairly
