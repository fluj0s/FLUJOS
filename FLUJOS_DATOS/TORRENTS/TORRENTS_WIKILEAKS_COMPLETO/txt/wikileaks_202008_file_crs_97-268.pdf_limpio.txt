ndc proposals on economic reform were not controversial those dealing with crossstrait relations were criticized by beijing but represented the consensus view in taiwan proposals on political reform were controversial both in taiwan and in the prc prospects for implementing the policy proposals of the ndc are mixed if proposals in the areas of crossstrait relations and political reforms are carried out the likelihood of strong counteraction from beijing increases this would seriously complicate us interests in calming recent tensions in the taiwan strait and in concurrent us efforts to develop construct ive engagement with the prc while sustaining close us ties with taiwan context of taiwanprcu s relations3 this triangular relationship was seriously strained following taiwanese president lee tenghuis june 1995 visit to cornell university beijings subsequent use of intimidation tactics including ballistic missile tests and livefire military exercises before taiwans legislative and presidential elections in december 1995 and march 1996 respectively and the strong us response to beijings tactics including the sending of two aircraft carrier battle groups to the taiwanese area in march 1996 since mid1996 us and prc leaders have markedly improved the atmosphere if not the substance of uschina relations4 nevertheless beijing and taipei remain locked in an intense competition for international recognition and support in january 1997 beijing vetoed security council resolution in support of peacekeeping force in guatemala due to guatemalas close relationship with taiwan after negotiations in which guatemala reportedly agreed to moderate support for taiwan beijing approved the peacekeeping plan for guatemala5 us policymakers have repeatedly called for improved crossstrait dialogue in order to ease tensions between taipei and beijing in line with us interest in regional peace and development the increasingly zerosum game quality of taipeibeijing competition for favorable attention from the united states and other powers also makes it difficult for us policymakers to take initiatives in support for one side for fear of alienating the other most recently for example taiwanese officials have pressed the case to their us counterparts that they expect the united states to beef up its official dialogue with taipei as the clinton administration carries out series of highlevel meetings with prc leaders over the next year6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97268crs3 7see coverage in free china journal january 4 1997 as well as far eastern

taiwaneseprc political dialogue remains at standstill each side maintains political positions that appear unbridgeable although economic cultural and other contacts continue to develop significantly in particular chinese officials have said privately that beijing is so distrustful of lee tenghui that the prc is prepared to wait until the end of lees term before working with more responsive successor taiwanese officials say they are prepared to wait for beijing to alter its stance and have focused their attention on the changes announced at the end of the national development conference in late december background and results of the conference7 the national development conference was called for by president lee tenghui in his inaugural speech last may president lee wanted the conference to define the future course of taiwanese politics and policy after some delay the conference had been planned to begin in september 170 members of taiwans political elite and relevant experts met for five days beginning on december 23 1996 the three major parties the ruling nationalist party the opposition democratic progressive party dpp and the opposition new china party nominated their own delegates meetings occurred prior to the formal conference where party delegates mixed with scholars and other experts to work out proposals for consideration by the full body in the end the conference agreed on proposals in two main areas crossstrait relations and economic policy on the third major area of concern to the conference reform of taiwans government structure nationalist and dpp leaders were in agreement while new china party leaders disagreed on crossstrait relations there was consensus in support of taipeis current policy toward the mainland the delegates emphasized that taiwan is one of two equivalent political entities that make up china that taiwan has its own sovereignty and is not part of the prc and that taipei will never accept the one chinatwo systems approach that beijing is using to incorporate hong kong and proposing as the basis for taiwans reunification with the mainland the delegates also supported ongoing taiwanese efforts to join international organizations like the imf the world bank and the world trade organization further they held that rejoining the united nations was taiwans long term goal they added that the burgeoning crossstrait economic relations about 30 billion in annual trade and 30 billion in cumulative taiwanese investment in the prc should not be allowed to jeopardize taiwans national security this suggested that the taiwanese government may take some steps to curb such investment and trade in certain cases economic goals endorsed by the conference did not generate much controversy they involved improving government efficiency balancing the budget in five years reducing gradually the national debt expanding the tax base combining the business and personal income taxes gradually raising real estate taxes and privatizing state owned enterprises the controversial taiwanese government reforms which may require constitutional amendment called for freeze in provincial government

specialists on taiwan washington dc january february 1997president and the legislature both were slated to get more power the national assembly the national body which amends the constitution and the national watchdog agency the control yuan were proposed to lose power the changes proposed for the taiwanese provincial government triggered the most controversy as provincial governor james soong and much of his administration resigned soong also resigned from his senior leadership position in the nationalist party in january soong resumed his duties pending approval of his resignation by the premier reaction us media and official comment virtually ignored the taiwanese developments some clinton administration officials nonetheless were privately concerned about the direction of taiwans policies and possible adverse prc reaction these concerns reportedly were raised with senior officials from taiwan visiting washington for the national prayer breakfast during early february 19978 prc officials and official media have remained generally low keyed although pro prc media in hong kong criticized the results of the conference and what they mean for taiwanesemainland relations9 on january 29 1997 beijings peoples daily also warned generally that china would not stand idly by as taiwan implemented the ndc proposals in move toward taiwanese independence10 some us specialists have judged that the hong kong accounts reflected prevailing views of chinese officials concerned with taiwan11 they surmised that beijing is trying to avoid direct comment in its own name for now the prc officials are presumably waiting to see if the taiwanese authorities actually implement the changes proposed by the national development conference prc officials may also judge that prominent public complaints from beijing now would only increase the incentive for taiwanese officials to carry out their proposed reforms beijings complaints continue to focus on president lee tenghui as reflected in the proprc hong kong media lee is charged with steering the nationalist party away from its past emphasis on chinese reunification and toward closer collaboration with the dpp party which advocates taiwanese selfdetermination the criticism states that lee and his nationalist party allies have come together with the dpp leadership as the overwhelmingly dominan t force in taiwanese politics and that they have set forth political and governmental reform agenda in the national development conference that will be implemented over the next year or so beijing appears to fear that lee and his allies will eliminate institutions and political structures in taiwan that reflect its status as province of china and will support institutions and political structures in taiwan that will boost taiwans stature as an independent government in world affairs the criticism sees president lee and his nationalist allies working closely with the dpp leaders to ease out the remaining leadinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97268crs5 12discussions with prc government officials washington dc januaryfebruary 1997 13china conference william and mary university february 8 1997politicians in the nationalist party who were born on the mainland or whose families came to taiwan with chiang kaishek in 1949 provincial governor soong is the most prominent of such mainlander leaders in taiwanese politics today outlook it is unclear when and if beijing will react more directly and strongly to the changes in taiwan some us specialists think that president lee and his allies have chosen good time to begin to carry out these changes since the prc leadership is currently preoccupied with issues like hong kongs reversion and the approach to the chinese communist partys 15th congress in late 1997 presumably beijing has little desire to complicate these delicate processes with flareup in crossstrait tensions that could involve the united states and possibly other powers perhaps reflecting this assessment prc spokesmen currently note in reference to changes in taiwan that changes on the island do not alter taiwans status as province of china12 at the same time chinese officials sometimes offer the private view that crossstrait economic and other exchanges and chinas rising importance in world affairs offset these negative trends in taiwan and make taiwans reunification with the mainland only matter of time13 moreover there are still some obstacles for president lee and his allies to overcome in trying to carry out their reforms heading the list is governor soong and many of the 28000 taiwan provincial government officials who spend budget of 13 billion year any significant government structural changes will probably require constitutional changes enacted by the national assembly some assembly members enthusiasm for the reforms endorsed by the national development conference has been reduced because the conference also called for substantial weakening of the powers of the national assembly several specialists in washington feel that the conferences success in carrying out these ambitious reforms depends heavily on president lees and his dpp counterparts ability to maintain party unity and discipline especially in votes in the national assembly if lee succeeds in having the reforms implemented the specialists note beijing may feel it has choice other than to respond directly and strongly to these steps which it views as moving toward taiwanese independence us policy approaches us policy approaches appear to depend in part on circumstances surrounding the proposed reforms in taiwans government and its stance on crossstrait relations if the reforms are delayed because of opposition from governor soong provincial legislators national assembly members or others in taiwan there may be less likelihood of harsh response from beijing in this case us policymakers in congress and the clinton administration may feel little need to go beyond continued private and public statements advising moderation and restraint on both sides in the interests of easing tensions and resuming cross strait political dialogue if the reforms are implemented and taiwan adheres to its stated position on cross strait relations beijing may feel compelled to react more strongly in order to dissuade taiwan from further steps toward independence in this case some us policymakers may show strong support for taiwan while others may want to take stronger stance stabilize the situation one dilemma in this situation is that both beijing and taipei will behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97268crs6 acutely sensitive to any sign of the us siding with one against the other it is difficult to imagine public stance that the us could take under these circumstances that would not at least temporarily damage us relations with beijing taipei or both of course beijing may respond moderately to the taiwanese reforms as they are implemented unlike prc judgments during the period of harsh rhetoric and military actions in the taiwan strait following lee tenghuis visit to cornell university in 1995 mainland china leaders may see their interests better served by lowkeyed approach such moderation would avoid further alienating the taiwanese people it could also reflect prc optimism that economic other crossstrait exchanges and other factors will eventually lead to taiwans reunification with the mainland us policy under these circumstances might not have to change substantially from current advocacy of cross strait moderation and dialogue more active us approach designed to avoid renewed crisis in the taiwan strait might involve us mediation such mediation is opposed by many uschina specialists who recall the disastrous results of us negotiating efforts to end the chinese civil war in the 1940s and who judge that us interests are likely to suffer since us negotiators are almost certain to alienate beijing or taipei other observers judge that the danger of renewed military conflict in the taiwan strait is rising because of conflicting trends in taiwan and on the mainland the danger that this conflict could directly involve us forces was illustrated by the deployment of two us aircraft carrier battle groups to face prc military intimidation efforts in the taiwan area in 1996 as result they feel us policymakers may need to take risks associated with mediation rather than face those of direct us involvement in miliary conflict in the taiwan area
