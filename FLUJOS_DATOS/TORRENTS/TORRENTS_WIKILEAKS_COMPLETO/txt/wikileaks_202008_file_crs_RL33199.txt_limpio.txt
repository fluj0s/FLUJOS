specialist knowledge services group data security breaches context and incident summaries summary personal data security breaches are being reported with increasing regularity within the past few years numerous examples of data such as social security bank account credit card and drivers license numbers as well as medical and student records have been compromised major reason for the increased awareness of these security breaches is california law that requires notice of security breaches to the affected individuals this law implemented in july 2003 was the first of its kind in the nation state data security breach notification laws require companies and other entities that have lost data to notify affected consumers as of january 2007 35 states have enacted legislation requiring companies or state agencies to disclose security breaches involving personal information congress is considering legislation to address personal data security breaches following series of highprofile

summaries introduction personal data security breaches are being reported with increasing regularity during the past few years there have been numerous examples of hackers breaking into corporate government academic and personal computers and compromising computer systems or stealing personal data such as social security bank account credit card and drivers license numbers as well as medical and student records these breaches occur not only because of illegal or fraudulent attacks by computer hackers but often because of careless business practices such as lost or stolen laptop computers or the inadvertent posting of personal data on public websites recent infamous example occurred in may 2006 when 265 million veterans and their spouses were in danger of identity theft because veterans affairs data analyst took home laptop computer containing personal data including names social security numbers and dates of birth which was later stolen in burglary1 depending on the definition the most common type of identity theft is credit card fraud and there is evidence that the extent of credit card fraud has increased due to opportunities provided by the internet2 although some aspects of identity theft have been known for many years it is viewed now primarily as product of the information age particular crime of identity theft may include one or all of these stages stage 1 acquisition of the identity through theft computer hacking fraud trickery force redirecting or intercepting mail or even by legal means eg purchase information on the internet stage 2 use of the identity for financial gain the most common motivation or to avoid arrest or otherwise hide ones identity from law enforcement or other authorities such as bill collectors crimes in this stage may include account takeover opening of new accounts extensive use of debit or credit cards sale of the identity information on the street or 1 for additional information on legislative proposals

reference service ncjrs 2005 at httpwwwncjrsgovpdffiles1nijgrants 210459pdf crs2 black market acquisition breeding of additional identity related documents such as drivers licenses passports visas health cards etc filing tax returns for large refunds insurance fraud stealing rental cars and many more stage 3 discovery of the theft while many misuses of credit cards are discovered quickly the classic identity theft involves long period of time to discovery typically from six months to as long as several years evidence suggests that the time it takes to discovery is related to the amount of loss incurred by the victim3 identity theft is rarely one crime but is composed of the commission of wide variety of other crimes such as check and card fraud financial crimes of various sorts various telemarketing and internet scams auto theft counterfeiting and forgery etc the difficulty in studying identity theft is investigating what portion of the long list of identity theft related crimes is related to the classic type of identity theft that results in repeat victimization for example common type of credit card fraud is to steal an individuals credit card the offender makes quick purchase of an expensive item then discards the card has the victims identity truly been stolen the event clearly fits within the definition above but it is not the wholesale theft of the victims identity however should the offender be working with an accomplice the card could be turned over several times and even sold on the street finally should the victims drivers license and other identifying documents such as health card with social security number on it also be stolen the basic elements for stealing an individuals identity are present4 january 2007 white paper by the computer security research company mcafee avert labs reports dramatic increase in global identity theft trends5 one key finding was that personal data for tens of millions of people disappears each year its either been stolen or misplaced despite this disturbing trend the number of complaints is surprisingly low which leads us to believe the losses are not fully acknowledged6 3 ibid p v 4 ibid p 14 5 francois paget

mark11 the new york times wrote an article discussing this landmark and questioned the usefulness of computing such data breaches the bigger picture here may be that we are now slicing and dicing the niceties of data breaches against running tally so large that it has lost nearly any meaning at all the threat of identity theft from data losses is being greatly exaggerated fred h cate the director of the center for applied cybersecurity research at indiana university in bloomington told this newspaper not long ago and thats because lot of people have fallen into the trap of equating data loss with identity theft whether or not that is true is open to debate but what all this data loss does represent however is the potential for identity theft one that will never go away sure its game of odds there is only so much crook can do with few hundred thousand names and social security numbers but once they are out there they are out there for good names dont change neither do social security numbers or dates of birth and as long as it remains easy enough to fashion that trifecta into car loan home credit card work papers that would seem to be bit of longterm problem12 the identity theft and assumption deterrence act of 199813 established the federal trade commission ftc as the government entity charged with developing procedures to log and acknowledge the receipt of complaints by individuals as well as educate and assist potential victims14 the ftc compiles annual reports and charts of aggregated statistics on these events but does not identify which corporations organizations

causes and effects of incidents and apply the lessons learned21 in february 2007 the federal bureau of investigation fbi reported that 160 laptop computers were lost or stolen in less than four years february 2002 to september 2005 including at least 10 that contained sensitive or classified information one of which held personal identifying information on fbi personnel22 according to the report

number of incidents 3600 reported the prior year including 706 instances of unauthorized access and 1465 cases of malicious computer code according to yearly omb report25 experts say the federal government faces special challenges because of the variety of sensitive information it keeps the increasingly mobile nature of the federal workforce and the pervasive use of contractors which allow thousands of individuals with varying levels of security clearance to access government databases from remote sites 2004 government survey on the work practices of 18 million federal workers found
