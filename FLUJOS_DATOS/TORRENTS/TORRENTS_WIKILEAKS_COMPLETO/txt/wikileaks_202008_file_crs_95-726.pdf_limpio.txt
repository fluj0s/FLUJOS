daggett foreign aﬀairs and national defense division updated june 16 1995 abstract widely divergent estimates of the costs of us military commitments abroad are frequently cited in congressional debates over defense burdensharing one source of such divergence is the very diﬀerent deﬁnitions of overseas costs being used commonly cited measures of overseas costs include 1 incremental costs of deploying forces abroad rather than in the continental united states 2 direct pay and operating costs of us forces deployed overseas 3 total costs including shares of indirect support overhead and weapons acquisition of forces deployed abroad and 4 total costs of us forces assigned to fulﬁll regional commitmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs957261departm ent of defense washington headquarters service

web95726 f june 16 1995 defense budget alternative measures of costs of military commitments abroad stephen daggett foreign affairs and national defense division summary as of sept 30 1994 about 286594 us active duty military personnel were stationed overseas including about 128000 in european nato countries over 45000 in japan and almost 37000 in korea1 under current plans the number of us troops stationed ashore in europe will decline to 100000 by the end of fy1996 but other overseas deployments will remain stable the department of defense projects that it will spend 16 billion in fy1996 to pay and operate forces permanently stationed ashore in foreign countries2 this 16 billion figure however reflects only one way of measuring the costs borne by the united states for military activities abroad other definitions of costs are applied frequently in the 103rd congress where members of congress addressed defense burdensharing issues on the floor of the house or senate more than forty times figures cited for the costs of defending our allies ranged from 1 billion year to 180 billion3 the main source of this wide divergence is the very different definitions of overseas costs being used commonly cited measures of overseas costs range from very narrow to very broad including 1 incremental costs of deploying forces abroad rather than in the continental united states 2 direct pay and operating costs of us forces deployed overseas 3 total costs including prorated shares of weapons acquisition overhead and indirect support of us forces deployed abroad and 4 total costs of us forces assigned to fulfill regional commitments this report explains these measures and analyzes some of the strengths and weaknesses of each httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95726crs2 4defense officials sometimes claim that it is cheaper to deploy forces in japan than in conus because of japans large host nation support contributions crs analysis however found that this is not the case see stephen daggett defense burdensharing is japans host nation support model for other allies crs report 94515 f june 20 1994 5the incremental cost of oconus forces also appears to vary by service for fy1992 preliminary crs analysis showed that personnel costs major element of total incremental costs of forces stationed overseas were higher than those in conus by 8 percent in the marine corps 13 percent in the navy 14 percent in the army and about 25 percent in the air forceincremental costs of forces deployed overseas the narrowest way to measure the costs of us overseas commitments is to determine how much more or less it costs to operate us forces abroad than it would to operate the same forces in the continental united states conus these are referred to as the incremental costs of overseas stationing the elements of incremental cost can be divided into three broad categories 1 personnel pay and benefits including stationing allowances and moving expenses 2 operation and maintenance related to the operational tempo of forces and 3 unit support costs including community and family support services and base operations while most costs are the same regardless of where military units are deployed some expenses vary with locale the cost of acquiring weapons for example is equal for unit at home or abroad but housing and cost of living allowances permanent change of station payments for moving personnel and dependents transportation costs and fuel and utility costs are often higher for forces stationed outside the continental united states oconus to the extent that host nations cover expenses such as salaries for foreign nationals employed at us facilities utilities and facility construction and maintenance some of these higher costs may be offset4 if one assumes that us military end strength would not shrink if forces were withdrawn from overseas that the united states would retain in conus those units presently stationed abroad rather than demobilize them then incremental cost is the most appropriate measure of the additional burden borne by the united states to maintain forces abroad determining incremental cost is difficult however requiring substantial manipulation of budget accounts dod estimates that the costs of deploying us forces in europe are between 10 and 20 higher than the direct costs of stationing the same forces in conus crs analysis of budget data suggests that this is not an unreasonable estimate using this as basis for calculation the incremental costs of us forces in europe in fy1996 will be between 1 and 2 billion5 direct costs of overseas operations estimates of direct costs of forces deployed overseas represent somewhat broader measure of the burden of commitments abroad direct costs include pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenance of units including civilian pay construction of facilities and construction and operation of military family housing the value of this measure of overseas funding is that it is relatively straightforward calculation with clear meaning three shortcomings of the direct cost measure are worth noting however httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95726crs3 one shortcoming is that cost figures cover only forces permanently deployed ashore overseas and not the costs of forces deployed overseas afloat this omission would be difficult to correct since naval forces at sea are not directly associated with any particular allied country and the costs of such forces can vary substantially from month to month the exclusion of naval forces afloat becomes problematic in trying to assess costs of activities in different regions since us forward deployed forces in the pacific are comprised mainly of naval forces at sea while forces in europe are comprised mainly of army and air force units based on land direct costs for the two regions are not comparable second dods method for allocating operation and mainten ance costs to units abroad is not fully consistent with its method for allocating costs to units in conus specifically some transportation costs are treated differently and more importantly the price of major depot maintenance of weapons is generally not charged to units abroad as result dods direct cost figures fail to provide valid basis for comparison between forces abroad and forces in conus finally the issue of host nation support contributions by allies complicates the interpretatio n of the direct cost measure allies that host us forces provide differing amounts and kinds of host nation support all major allies provide land free of charge to the united states most waive some taxes and fees and some such as japan and korea also provide relatively large amounts of more direct support including pay of foreign nationals working at us bases utilities and construction of some buildings in determining what share of operating costs allies provide for us forces deployed abroad dod simply compares us direct costs to the total value of allied host nation support means of measurin g the value of land and other indirect support vary from country to country however and some allied direct contributions offset us operating costs while others do not japan for example spends large amount on noise barriers and other environmental projects at us facilities but such contributions do not reduce us expenditures the direct cost measure therefore indicates how much the united states is actually expending on forces in particular countries but it does not clarify the extent to which allied contributions may offset us costs despite these shortcomings direct costs are the most commonly cited measure of overseas basing costs since 1989 congress has required the defense department to report annually on the direct costs of forces deployed abroad dods most recent report entitled defense overseas funding fy1996fy1997 projects total us funding for defense operations overseas of about 16 billion in fy1996 including 100 billion for troops

the overseas command such as some equipment repairs some transportation costs and some supply operations overhead expenses include headquarters staffs personnel recruitment and training most medical care and global communications investment costs are comprised mainly of weapons development and procurement funding in estimating total costs indirect overhead and investment expenses must be allocated to particular units based on formula that is inherently somewhat arbitrary analytically the allocation process presents problem because different formulas may lead to very different estimates of total costs politically the defense department has been concerned that release of such figures may create misleading impression that the withdrawal of units from europe or elsewhere would entail budget savings equal to the estimated total costs of those units6 as result dod undertook such estimates only when required to do so by congress the figures that dod did prepare were normally classified as secret occasionally however the defense department released unclassified estimates of total costs of forces deployed in certain regions december 1991 dod paper reported estimated total costs of forces in europe in fy1992 of about 50 billion more than double the thencurrent direct cost estimate of about 20 billion currently congress does not require dod to prepare data on the total costs of forces deployed abroad and official figures are available costs are likely lower today because of troop withdrawals from europe and the decline of weapons procurement funding total costs of regional commitments the broadest measure of costs of overseas commitments is the total costs of forces assigned to particular regions the distinction between the total costs of deployed forces and the costs of regional commitments is that the latter includes costs of all forces available to fulfill us military commitments abroad including those stationed in conus as well as those stationed abroad in this broadest measure of overseas costs both conusbased and overseasbased forces are allocated to particular regional commitments for example defense of europe and the total costs including direct indirect overhead and investment costs of the assigned forces are calculated for fiscal years 1983 to 1992 congress required dod to report annually on the total costs of forces available for the defense of europe in the event of war with the soviet union and its allies in this report dod also estimated the total costs of forces assigned primarily to the pacific and of contingency forces not assigned either to europe or the pacific dod complied with the reporting requirement reluctantly and it always included an introductory essay explaining why the congressionally mandated structure of the report was in dods view misleading dod argued that the report was flawed because 1 forces assigned to europe in the event of global war were defending the united states and not just european allies 2 such forces were available for other missions as well as defense of europe and 3 reduction in forces assigned to europe would not necessarily entail budget savings as great as the estimated total costs data in each annual report were classified as secret occasionally however dod did mention data from the reports publicly and this was the source of frequently cited estimates that the us commitmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95726crs7 to europes defense typically amounted to 50 to 60 of the overall us defense budget ie 150 billion year or more in the postcold war era the department of defense has shifted away from strategy focused on ussoviet conflict in europe to one focused on two major regional contingencies mrcs given that all us military forces are dedicated to fighting and winning first one and then if necessary two mrcs any measure of the total costs of regional commitments simply would reflect dods top line requested 2578 billion in budget authority in fy1996 thus setting aside the issue of flaws in the methodology in the postcold war era calculation of total costs of regional commitments would provide additional useful input to the burdensharing debatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95726
