onesite if wetland at another site is impr oved has been identifie d as potential answer to this shrill and seemingly intractable debate mitigation banking is relatively new and federal mitigation banking policies continue to evolve it was first endorse d by the bush administration the clinton administration subsequently endorsed th concept in 1993 and the corps and epa issued detailed direction to field staff concurrently five federal agencies publishedfinal guidance in the federal register in november 1995 providing framework to support functioning banking system in ddition many states have initiated or are considering banking programs banking can occur only after three steps are taken in the federal process for protecting wetlands first wetland development must be avoided if possiblesecond when this it is unavoidable impacts must be minimized and third impactsthat can not be minimized to an acceptable level must be mitigated mitigationbanking is an option only when mitigation onsite is not possible bank sponsorscreate wetland credits at bank site that can be acquired by those who fall within the purview of these two programs and are required to offset wetland losses ordebits at other sites congressional interest is building because mitigation banking appears to be promising approach for offsetting wetland degradation and implementing an overall policy goal of net loss while the recent growth in the number of mitigationbanks suggests expanded interest and support for this approach several years ormore may elapse before success or failure at individual sites can be determined this time lapse is one reason why mitigation banking is controversial supporters claim that mitigation banking when compared with mitigation onsiteprovides betterorganized planning an improved regulatory climate greatercommitment to longterm wetland protection and more consolidation of habitatopponents are concerned that banking is loophole and endorses additional wetland destruction that some types of wetlands are difficult to create or restore as thriving ecosystems and that wetland losses are so metimes allowed before the bank is fully functional more generally supporters vi ew policy flexibility as critical to success especially for commercial banks while cr itics worry that flexibility will lead to unacceptable losses of wetland functions and values congress is hearing aboutthese benefits and concerns as it c onsiders how mitigation banking might be incorporated into future wetland protection laws and

under the supe rvision of jeffrey zinn senior analyst in natural resources policy 2 40 cfr 150820wetland mitigation banking status and prospects1 introduction mitigation has received widespread attention because it has been incorporated into federal wetland protection policy as an approach for offsetting the negativeimpacts of wetland losses the presidents council on environmental qualitydefines mitigation as actions taken to avoid minimize reduce rectify or compensatefor the adverse repercussions of development 2 federal agencies may require mitigation so that an applicant will recei ve permit only after agreeing to substitute replacement wetlands to offset an unavoidable loss of wetland and its functionsrecognized wetland functions include groundwater recharge and discharge pollution control including nutrient and waste retention water supply flood water storage and conveyance barriers to erosion sediment trapping and control fish and wildlife habitats and recreation and aesthetic values banking is one method of implementing mitigation policies that has received considerable attention and interest recently it can be used to compensate for the lossof valuable functions of wetlands that contribute to healthy environment amitigation bank is usually relatively large site where wetland habitat is created orrestored this habitat will replace altered or degraded wetlands from several nearby sites banking can consolidate activities to offset wetland losses that may otherwise have been mitigated piecemeal at smaller sites that are not coordinated and may provide less overall benefit the interest in mitigation banking is high as measured by the numerous recent publications sampling of which are cited in the bibliography and by congressional interest this report describes the concept of banking its principal elements and various forms it examines the potential of mitigation banking as means to protectwetlands given their wide variation in forms functions and value to societyadditionally it outlines current criteria for federally approved mitigation bankhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs2 3 this definition is basically the one used by federal agencies some states use different definitions for example while the federal definition allows preservation as anoption for banking some states do notsummarizes the reported advantages and disadvantages of banking and reviews policy issues of interest to congress mitigation banking defined mitigation banking has many definitions but most center on the restoration creation enhancement or in exceptional circumstances the preservation of wetlandswhich will compensate for unavoidable wetland losses at another site 3 banking is designed to coordinate mitigation at one location for habitat losses allowed underfederal programs at other sites mitiga tion banking is used primarily when onsite mitigation can not be achieved or is not as environmentally beneficial mitigation banking involves process in which clie nt may be required to obtain wetland units with similar functions and values at near by site to satisfy federal permit or program requirements bank operations vary widely but all follo w the same general principles these principles use the terminology of financial institutions transactions are described in terms of credits and debits to wetland re sources bank sponsor creates credits as it restores enhances or creates wetlands at the bank site these credits are eitherdebited money is not involved or purchased by clients financial transaction who are being required to compensate for wetland losses when clients obtain thesecredits they are withdrawn from the bank and become unavailable for futuretransactions clients are usually required to make these withdrawals prior to orconcurrently with their proposed activity that will result in wetland losses banksmay be allowed to transfer some credits usually to fund their operations before the site is fully established hypothetical example of bank may help to explain this process consider that banking entity has been established the bank sponsor purchases 500 acresof land on which it plans to restore we tland the land costs 1000 per acre the sponsor then spends 2000 per acre to rest ore and maintain the wetland for total investment of 15 million at later time and as part of sec tion 404 permit approval at nearby site client whose project will alter 10 acres of wetlands that are almost identical to the ones at the bank site is required for permit approval to purchase mitigationcredits to offset these impacts the bank sponsor sets price of 8000 per creditand each credit is one acre the client is required to purchase 10 credits thispayment will partially compensate the banker for restoring wetlands at the bank siteafter several clients have purchased cred its the costs of setting up the bank may be repaid the bank sponsor may become the longterm manager of the site after creditsare sold and the bank site is fully f unctioning wetland or it may sell the propertyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs3 4 the longterm responsibility of bank is similar to the perpetual care obligation of cemetery 5 some ventures operate on feebased system so that clients pay fee perhaps into trust that subsequently funds improvement s at banklike site private entities who have expressed an interest in becoming bank sponsors see the ability to receive funds before the bank site is fully established as critical to their involvementto another owner such as conservation group who assumes longterm responsibility for maintaining the site4 the example described above is priv ate commercial bank one of four types of banks that the us army corps of ngineers corps identif ied in recent multi volume review of many aspects of banking it distinguishes these types based on the relationship between the sponsor and clients and on the financial goals of thesponsor 5 single use banks have sponsor who is also the principal client common example is banks established by state departments of transportation orhighways to be used to compensate for losses associated with roadconstruction activities joint project banks are cooperative ventures by two or more sponsors at least one of which is public entity sponsors anticipate that poolingresources will reduce development and ope rating costs joint project banks like single use banks generally serve limited and defined clientele public commercial banks often sponsored by public entities are used to compensate for wetland losses in defi ned service area where multiple needs are anticipated these banks are typically in or near urban areas and oftenare established to support implementation of regional or area plan ofdevelopment private commercial entrepreneurial banks are sponsored by private entities who acquire the bank site and price credits so as to realize the desired return on their investment federal mitigation evolution of policy two federal programs might require wetland mitigation section 404 of the clean water act cwa enacted in 1972 requires federal approval for mostactivities involving the disposal of dredge or fill material into wetlands landowners must obtain permits from the corps before they can carry out such activities thecorps can impose certain conditions including mitigation as part of the permitapproval permit approval is shared responsibility of the corps and theenvironmental protection agency epa other agencies may have importantadvisory roles including the us fish and wildlife service fws and the nationalmarine fisheries service nmfs the swampbuster program enacted in the 1985 food security act may also require mitigation for activities affecting agricultural wetlands under this program farmers may be denied most federal farm program benefits for altering wetland tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs4 6 it is important to remember that even without development and with protection wetland could be substan tially degraded by activities on surrounding sitesplant crops the natural resources conservation service nrcs monitors agricultural wetlands for compliance with swampbuster in some instances nrcs may allow mitigation as part of farmers effort to comply with swampbusterswampbuster and 404 do not affect identical sites on agricultural lands so in some instances an applicant who is not ffected under 404 may fall under swampbuster and vice versa federal mitigation policy for wetlands s grown out of regulations that the corps uses to evaluate the environmental impacts of proposed discharges called the 404 b1 guidelines these regulations first promulgated in 1975 provided astructure for mitigation from the beginning offsite mitigation was permitted toavoid onsite impacts of development such as siltation in general however offsitemitigation was limited because public agencies sometimes objected and businessinterests apparently viewed the risks of upf ront costs and uncertainty as too high for the projected return mitigation policies were clarified by memorandum of agreement moa signed on february 6 1990 between epa and the corps this moa specifies that these two agencies are primarily responsible for assuring that actions affectingwetlands comply with federal regulations the moa mandates that compensatorymitigation should be used only when 1 impacts cannot be avoided and 2unavoidable impacts cannot be minimized controversies do arise over defining the least environmentally damaging alternative for particular project some wetland protection advocates contend thatavoidance is the only acceptable policy b ecause wetland degradation should not be allowed avoidance means an applicant has selected an option that causes unacceptable environmental damage to wetland resources mitigation is notnecessary if the applicant is determined to have successfully avoided affecting wetlands others claim that avoidance may be the best policy for protectingwetlands with high habitat and hydrological values but that greater flexibilityincluding mitigation is appropriate especially for sites of less value 6 impact minimization is required when altering wetlands cannot be avoided projects are generally required to be modified to minimize impacts of wetlanddegradation minimization might include re designing or scaling back aspects of proposal or limiting proposed modifications to portion of the project site wetland protection advocates generally support onsite minimization of wetland damagesover mitigation because it preserves some important wetland characteristics thatmight otherwise be lost minimization requirements may be opposed by thoseapplicants who would prefer to use more of the site and to implement mitigationprogram if unacceptable impacts would still result mitigation may be required mitigation on the site is generally prefe rred over mitigation at another location it may include the restoration of existing we tlands or creation of new wetlands if on site mitigation is not possible then offsite mitigation is the final option bankinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs5 7erwin k an evaluation of wetland mitigati on within the south florida water management district volume 1 south florida water management district july 1991 p 3can provide an acceptable offsite mitigation option if it is properly designed however the 1990 moa does not provide detailed guidelines on banking it does state that each bank has to be approved by the epa and the corps and that moredetailed guidance would be forthcoming mitigation banking does not become anoption until the corps and the epa have termined that the applicant has fully complied with the policies of avoidance and minimization evaluations concluding that onsite mitigation has performed poorly have helped garner support for banking several reviews of early mitigation efforts found extensive failure for example kevin er win conducted study for the south florida water management district in which only 40 of permitted projects requiringwetland mitigation had been completed 7 only four of the completed projects were deemed successful among the deficiencies cited were poor site selection improperor insufficient monitoring and evaluation lack of wetland persistence poorhydrological design sparse vegetative cover inadequate management andinsufficient wildlife utilization other defi ciencies identified by different evaluators include delays in construction and lack of maintenance many view mitigation banking as having the potential to overcome these problems poor record should not be surprise as with few exceptions applicants seek leastcost solutions that meet minimum acceptable standards and avoid legal actions or further costs they have incentive to exceed these standards even when added commitments are necessary for an ecologi cal success the relatively high cost of conducting mitigation on some sites has also dampened applicant enthusiasmaverage mitigation costs per acre tend to increase as the size of the site decreasesin this environment applicants have little incentive to create and maintain high quality sites mitigation banking today the clinton administration endorsed mitigation banking in its wideranging wetland plan issued on august 24 1993 as pa rt of this effort the corps and epa issued regulatory guidance letter endorsi ng mitigation banking as part of the 404 program the administration promulgated detailed guidance issuing draftregulations in the federal register on march 6 1995 and final regulations on november 28 1995 effective on december 28 1995 the guidance is signed by the five principal agencies involved in federal wetland programsin addition to the corps and epa the other agencies are the fws nmfs and nrcs theseagencies are all members of interage ncy wetlands work group the regulations detail the process by which banks could be set up used and monitored to complywith requirements of the 404 and swampbuster programs emphasizing the roles that the federal agencies will play this guidance includes list of related statutes regulations and

monitoring and financing mitigation banking is intended to help resolve contentious situations where growth and development pressures conflict with wetland protection efforts thisview is gaining support as measured by the growing number of operating banks and the larger number that are being discussed or proposed most of the early operating banks are used by departments of transportation or highways to mitigate wetlandimpacts from highway construction and are primarily managed by states privately owned forprofit banks are less numerous and all have opened recently the corpsapproved the first commercial bank in december 1992 the federal interagencywetlands work group is now working to br ing greater continuity to the many and disparate efforts by developing model banking instrument which can be used byeach bank to document its objectives and operation continuity may become more important as banking policies and operations continue to evolve in various forms inmost states the 1990 water resources development act pl 101640 authorized wetlands demonstration studies and the ffice of management and budget used that authority to direct the corps to make detailed study of mitigation banking thecorps institute for water resources has produced 9 volumes the initial 6 werereleased in early 1994 final report is an ticipated soon this study has inventoried banking experiences and studies of banks and discussed almost all aspects ofbanking the study determined that about 10 of all the land on which mitigation banks were located was federally owned 8 the remainder were on other public or privately owned lands sponsors of banks on federal lands did not have to be federal entities the three examples of federally owned mitigation banks taken from the study and introduced in the following paragraphs provi sense of the diversity of possible arrangements9httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs7 10 testimony submitted by charles ruma on behalf of the national

the navy assumed the maintenance responsibilities the naval amphibious base eelgrass mitigation bank in san diego castarted in 1986 was the first bank to be federally owned and operated it has been used to mitigate for damage to eel grass habitat from the operations of the naval amphibious base in san diego bay of the 10 acres at this site 42acres compensated for one mitigation project and 58 acres were establishedfor future navy projects the navy is responsible for the operation of thebank but the nmfs managed the restoration of the wetland and wasreimbursed by the navy since these banks were established so new approaches have emerged and many new banks have been started more recent examples were described bybanking proponents at march 14 1996 hear ing convened by the senate committee on environment and public works to lear n more about the status and potential of banking for example charles ruma representing the national association ofhome builders described the establishment of foundation by the associationchapter in ohio that developed two banks the first established in 1993 at 34acre site has sold all its credits at 7500 per acre while the second 292acre site to bededicated in may 1996 had already sold over 100 acres at 12000 per acre mrruma noted that the ohio department of transportation has been the largest customer and also seemed pleased to be ab to report that one applicant using the bank had been able to obtain 404 permit from the corps in just 21 days 10 this hearing and other discussions of banking show that participation in banking by both sponsors and clients is expa nding rapidly especially for commercial banks for example the corps survey of commercial banks conducted during thesummer of 1995 identified 77 banks but only 24 were in operation and the remainderwere either proposed or in planning in fl orida where this activity is concentrated the survey identified 12 operating or planni ng banks but only several months later the

corps representative conducting an informal survey of banks in 1997 found that about 20 of the 108 operating banks he identified had been approved under the federal guidelines13 federal agency wetland responsibilities five federal agencies primarily responsible for banking policy cooperate under the moa and collaborated in developing the federal guidance that was issued in1995 the overall wetland activities of these agencies as well as the current statusof efforts by states are summarized below followed by discussion of the criteriathe federal agencies are to consider corps of engineers the corps is the federal agency with the lead roll in implementing the principal federal program that provides regulatory protection for wetlands 404 of the clean water act cwa pl 92500 as amended its intentis to protect waters of the united states including adjacent wetland areas fromenvironmental damages due to discharges of dredged or fill material established in1972 404 requires landowners or developers to obtain permits from the corps tocarry out activities involving disposal of dredge or fill materials into these waters the corps has long had regulatory jurisdiction over dredging and filling starting with the harbors and rivers act of 1899 ch 425 30 stat 1151 asamended the corps and epa share some responsibilities for the section 404program although the corps administers th daytoday program including permit decisions other federal agencies in cluding fws nmfs and nrcs also have roles in this process in the 1970s legal decisions in several cases led the corps to revise

part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the department of commerce isactively involved in providing guidance on mitigating wetlands losses in coastal areas this agency contributed to the development of the federal register guidelines its role is similar to that of the fws natural resources conservation service nrcs in the department of agriculture administers the swampbuster program enacted in the 1985 foodsecurity act pl 99198 swampbuster sp ecifies that farmers who drain wetlands to plant crops could lose access to numerous federal farm program benefits until theyrestore those wetlands swampbuster is not regulatory or permit program as each farmer decides whether he will risk sing these benefits by altering wetland nrcs assists farmers in identifying

reserve programcrp 16 state involvement the concept of mitigation banking was applied at few sites and in relative obscurity for about two decades until interest suddenly blossomed in the 1990ssome states operate programs but most are currently translating the concept froman abstract idea into functioning program some states prohibit banks undercurrent laws other states limit mitigation banking to use by state departments oftransportation or highways for impacts to wetlands caused by highway construction few states have been more aggressive in developing mitigation banks and some were pursuing banking initiatives before the federal guidance was issued includingcalifornia illinois wyoming and minne sota two innovative states new jersey and south carolina have created wetland councils to oversee the development ofbanks and have numerous projects underway many other states which areattempting to develop banks are working to resolve the same kinds of questionsabout the guidelines and operation for mitigation banks that the federal governmenthad to resolve for its guidelines federal mitigation banking guidance federal mitigation banking guidance requires programs to be consistent with agency policies before bank development and maintenance plans are approvedunder the 1995 guidelines banking may be acceptable if specific criteriasummarized below are followed this guida nce is intended to be administered with flexibility to accommodate variations in banking this flexibility may become more important if planning on watershed basis continues to be emphasized thewatershed approach places wetlands in larger geographic context and shouldcontribute to more effective decisions about the location and use of banking sites at each federallyapproved bank site activ ities of all agencies are coordinated through an interagency mitigation bank review team the team oversees planninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs11 and operations the corps representative chairs all teams except the nrcs representative chairs banks that are limited to wetland losses on agricultural landsin conjunction with the swampbuster program the primary purpose of these teamsis to facilitate the timely development of an acceptable banking instrument but they are involved in other ways as well project considerations the central goal of any bank is to manage self sustaining functioning wetland ecosystem the criteria encourage restorationprojects to replace the wetland values that would be lost over creation projects experience has shown that restoration s ites are much more likely to succeed than sites where wetlands are created the credits at bank should be at least equal inacreage functions and values to similar wetlands that will be degraded throughanticipated projects each bank is to ve specified number of credits that it can provide for compensatory mitigation each proposed activity which mustcompensate for adverse impacts to wetlands can be authorized to use mitigationbank as condition of permit as long as credits are not resold or used tocompensate for multiple activities howeve r the same credit can be used for an activity which requires approval by more than one agency geographical considerations the guidelines stress that the designation of the banking service area should be based upon the consideration of hydrologicedaphic and biotic criteria with str ong preference for replacing the losses at the impact site with similar wetland functions similar positioning in the broaderlandscape and similar species populations for example purchasing credits at afreshwater wetland bank may not be appropr iate compensation for the degradation of brackish or saline wetland debiting fr om mitigation banks which have different functions than affected wetlands may be limited to banks that are developed toaccomplish specific resource objective all permit reviews are handled on casebycase basis the selection of bank site should be based on how it will function in the context of the watershed and not on what nd happens to be available as often has been the case with mitigation banking ma have its greatest potential for success when it is part of watershedbased wetland plan however such planning isespecially difficult for banks that serve linear projects passing through multiplelandscapes or watersheds such as new hi ghway or pipeline corridor locations the guidelines emphasize that banking should be used only after the threestep process of avoidance minimization and onsite mitigation has been followed which is likelyto fit with watershed planning goals crediting and debiting procedure credits and debits designate the units of trade credits represent the composite of wetland functions at bank site whiledebits represent either the loss of wetlands nd their functions at project site or the wetlands values that are withdrawn from bank when transaction is approved the number of wetland credits available from the mitigation bank should be determinedusing an appropriate functional assessment methodology acceptable to all partieswith official responsibilities including memb ers of the mitigation bank review team single method should be used to quantify the value of both credits and debitscredit and debit documentation is to be s ubmitted to the chair of the mitigation bankhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs12 17testimony submitted by steve gordon on behalf of the council of lane county governments to the senate committee on envi ronment and public works march 14 1996review team each time transaction is pproved the guidance allows the use of an acreage measure if functional assessment methodology is impractical compensation ratios some banks do not always issue credits at ratio of 11 that is each acre of wetland lost is not treated as identical to an acre gained at the bank site the ratio may be different because the value of the wetland debits varies the value of the credit depends on the prebank wetland functions the bank recognizes different levels of risk of success in various bankingsituations the transaction involves different types of wetlands or some functions are valued more highly than others the replacing of naturallyoccurring wetland with one that is restored or created may also lead to variable ratio the ratio may change over time as well it maydecrease as the wetlands at the bank site b ecome established and the risk of failure declines bank in eugene oregon for example uses variable compensation ratios it gives restored wetlands full credit but only 066 for created wetlands and only 044 for enhanced wetlands 17 therefore at restored mitigation bank site of 3 acres for example credit would be 30 but if th bank site was an enhanced wetland the credit would only be worth 132 using th same example and viewed from the applicants perspective 3 acres of degraded wetlands would require purchasingcredits worth 3 acres of restored wetlands but 75 acres of enhanced wetlands inthis example the quality of the 3 acres to be affected or lost is not considered it is not clear from published sources whether variable credits are widely used but they appear to be more widely used now than in earlier years and may reflect anincreasing sophistication and creativity in banking bank sponsor responsibilities the bank sponsor is responsible for assuring the success of all operations at the bank s ite the bank sponsor carefully manages the accounting procedures financial considerations and longterm maintenance ofwetland functions and values for the banking entity the bank sponsor should submit all appropriate documentation to the team prior to any debiting from bank the sponsor must satisfy three requirements the banking instrument and final mitigation plans must be approved the bank site must be secured and appropriate financial assurances must be confirmed in addition initial physical and biological improvements to the bank site should be completed within the first growing season following the first debiting by the bankfederal and state agencies will oversee the maintenance of the bank site one source of information about the condition of the s ite is the monitoring reports prepared by the bank sponsor the bank sponsor can be held responsible to finance additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs13 18kusler j the mitigation

memoranda of agreement to permitsto corporate charters topics commonl addressed in banking instruments include the permitting and approval process bank management and operation creditproduction and evaluation client relationshi ps and if appropriate longterm bank ownership these agreements vary in veral ways including the amount of detail the duration of the agreement the methods prescribed to resolve disputes andenforcement mechanisms if the model banking instrument that the interagencywetlands work group is developing is widely adopted it will gradually bringgreater uniformity to future agreements support for mitigation banking many advocates of banking view it as promising alternative to current mitigation programs which some characterize as ineffective they argue thatbanking can make important contributions to achieving the overall national policygoal of net loss the benefits ascribed to banking below are generallysupported by the experiences recounted at congressional hearings consolidation of small wetland losses mitigation banks encourage the restora tion and creation of larger wetland areas than onsite mitigation banks generally have higher success rates and lower costratio per mitigated acre 18 wetlands within banks may also be more enduring because the sponsor has the opportunity and strong commitment to implementing longterm program for preservation and maintenance of wetland valuesadditionally combining many wetland acres in single site may allow themitigation effort to focus on habitat with especially desirable characteristics by contrast individual onsite mitigation projects are typically smaller and fragmented often such sites are less hospitable to the creation or restoration ofwetlands and may have lower probability for establishing sustainable habitatnumerous scattered sites have proven inefficient and difficult for public agencieswith limited staff to mon itor and for applicants who have little commitment to protecting longterm wetland values beyond what is requi red by regulatory agencies to maintain 19 in addition large majority of permit applicants do not have professional staff knowledgeable about wetla nds ecology and are often interested in minimizing the financial and other resources that must be devoted to their mitigation effort httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs14 20riddle mitigation banks

the council of lane county governments to the senate committee on envi ronment and public works march 14 1996proponents contend that having the banker select site for mitigation banks is an additional advantage banker has strong incentive to choose location atwhich project could flour ish often conventional mitigation ends up being placed on lands which the applicant owns or can easily purchase at the time that the permit process is being completed these sites ma be far less than ideal for establishing and maintaining wetland functions and values the process of locating andestablishing bank helps insure that it will be located at hydrologically andecologically favorable place planning and implementation mitigation banks may have better design for longterm maintenance and operation than onsite mitigation projects bank sponsors make substantialfinancial commitment to the success of each project and are much more likely to retain experts including biologists engin eers and ecologists to design and monitor the site 20 scattered mitigation projects are more likely to fail especially if applicants have little wetland experience because they seek to minimize additionalcosts supporters of mitigation banking clai m that the extra scientific and technical effort that goes into establishing bank will continue with stronger commitmentto successful implementation including pr oper siting design and construction and longterm maintenance of the site the timing with which credits are made available has been subject to some debate entrepreneurial bankers want the flexibility to sell at least some credits as they develop the site to raise implemen tation funds skeptics of mitigation banking want some credits to be withheld from the market until the performance of thewetland can be certified also if credits ar sold only after the bank is operating and the wetland functions are in place then th purchase of credits will bypass temporary losses associated with onsite mitigation these temporary losses can be significantif they occur during the breeding or nesti ng season or if flood occurs for example the federal guidance supports sale of some credits before the bank is fully functional at sites where it can determine that there is high likelihood of success some sites such as bank in eugene oregon sold uncertified credits at lowerprices in this case they sold them only during the first 6 years of the project and the quantity that could be sold was limited 21 for commercial banks the longer the time before credit sales are allowed the greater the economic exposure for the banksponsor monitoring and evaluation monitoring wetland values at mitigation sites is more practically accomplished at larger mitigation bank the process is more efficient because single entityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs15 would operate bank for federallya pproved bank the banking agreement defines responsibilities for maintaining wetland values followup evaluation activities bymitigation banking review team members would identify adjustments that arenecessary to protect the site values that are identified in bank management plan if sponsor fails to comply with its ba nking instrument it could be held accountable for its violations up to rescission of its approval to operate the bank numerousrecent reviews have shown that most agenci do not have adequate staff to monitor the many small mitigation projects or to initiate actions against violators improved regulatory climate the availability of mitigation banks may allow for faster permit processing and more streamlined decisionmaking by federal agencies bank credits can serve as bond or collateral to enforce compliance with the required mitigation measures the mitigation bank can recover the cost of tablishing the credit units through credit purchase this system can be much more fficient then series of onsite mitigation projects criticisms of mitigation banking mitigation presents the difficult challenge of creating restoring or enhancing complex wetland ecosystems many wetlands have evolved over thousands of yearswith animal and plant communities that reflect precise relationships between wet anddry conditions opponents of mitigation and mitigation banking are concerned that it is difficult to determine how fully thes complex ecosystems can be reestablished or replicated in short time opposition comes from the members of theenvironmental and scientific communities but it is also important to note that within both these communities views range from support to strong opposition one likely source of skepticism from environmentalists and scientists is that they may measuresuccess by different typically higher standa rds than regulators another source is that the poor results from onsite mitigation have heightened skepticism about banking and many critics have similar criticisms of both as mitigation banking is relatively recent and untried for many types of wetland ecosystems bank sponsors may not recognize current or potential problems if banking site fails to maintain the promised value of the credits then double lossresults at the bank and at the purchasers project site encourages wetland destruction critics are concerned that the expande d use of mitigation banking will allow greater destruction of wetlands banking provides more efficient system forcompleting mitigation requirements to pplicants by simply allowing them to purchase credits opponents worry that this relatively simple process will lead to decline in the quality of regulatory decisionmaking since credit purchase maybecome an increasingly accessible alternative when onsite mitigation is not feasible opponents also hypothesize that if mitiga tion banking flourishes pressure will grow to use it before avoidance or nimization measures are fully consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs16 resulting in even more wetland destruction mitigation banking could be exploited by applicants who might try to promote inappropriate projects or avoid morecomplex and costly but environmentally superior mitigation activities uncertainty of replacing natural ecosystems opponents claim that limits to the techni ques of preservation enhancement and creation of wetlands must be recognized preservation of existing wetlands couldresult in net loss if they were merely maintained to compensate for destroyed wetlands enhancement may not completely offset impacts to wetlands either and artificial enhancement could accelerate the loss process if it allowed for theintroduction of different habitats and species that did not replicate the wetland it wasintended to replace portion of all banks have involved creation however creating wetlands remains generally regarded as an experimental technique among knowledgeablescientists critics contend that created we tlands may not be as successful as natural wetlands to date created wetland areas ve not replaced the equivalent attributes of natural wetlands wetland protection advocates caution that created wetlandmust be evaluated over long time period before conclusion can be drawn onwhether equivalent functions and values ve been replaced and the site is self sufficient credit purchases should be authorized only after this objective is achieved and contingency plans including some form of performance bond in case the bank fails should be included dissimilar replacement of wetland habitat opponents claim that replacement of similar functions and values of altered wetlands will be difficult to accomplish th rough bank ideally mitigation should occur in the same watershed as the affect ed site and should have similar ecological characteristics sometimes referred to as inkind mitigation since mitigation banks are not at the same site as the project they may not fully replicate the mix offunctions and values that the affect ed wetlands provided that mix may be impossible to recreate due to ecological di fferences the location of the bank in the watershed or surrounding land uses for ex ample it may be impossible to recreate significant flood storage at wetland with the same value at bank site even in the same watershed differences are often more subtle than this example yet have asubstantial effect on the value of the re source critics contend that differences should be accounted for in the credit system and any uncertainty about how to value the credits and debits should err in favor of protecting wetland resources opponents also believe that the diversity of species supported by the wetland to be altered should be fully replaced they argue that even when replacement isattempted identical habitat may not be read ily established at another site resulting in declines or the potential loss of some species and in less diversity in the ecosystem the availability of banks could promote more purchases of mitigation credits at sites with different replacement values in terms of vegetation for example shrub marsh or tidal wetlands have been the most common replacement projects thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs17 22 testimony submitted by jan goldmancarter on behalf of the national wildlife federation to the senate committee on envi ronment and public works march 14 1996wetlands require less planning management and expense than other types of wetlands such as bottomland hardwood forests and generally are more likely to besuccessful some types such as those with peat soils or ones that rely on groundwater or rainfall are more difficult to cr eate or restore as result banks with easier sites could be established more widely and quickly while applicants andbank sponsors would seek to use these easier sites whenever possible they mightprovide inadequate or inappropriate credit for degraded wetlands from differentbiological community expanding mitiga tion banking opportunities could stimulate this kind of inappropriate mitigation and lead to debate over whether the bank isa success with either less than anticipated benefits or different mix of benefits while the federal guidance addresses this issue by stating that inkind compensation of wetland impacts should generally be required and the requests foroutofkind mitigation will be handled on casebycase basis critics wonderwhether federal agencies can be counted on to vigorously monitor theserequirements requests for outofkind m itigation are supposed to be approved only when it is part of an areawide management plan designed to address specificresource objective nature of crediting and debiting techniques critics contend that consensus shoul d be reached on the value of wetland credits purchased for mitigation before banks can be utilized such an agreement is necessary so that when debits are measur ed team members and others can determine the amount of credit necessary for appropr iate compensation disagreements over the value of credit can be contentious in part because alternative methods for calculating these values are available probably the most widelyused method issome version of the habitat evaluation procedure hep first developed by fws20 years ago hep comes in several form s and has several competitors as well some of these methods are relatively simp to use while more complicated ones better assess the values and functions single method appears to be simple yetsophisticated new method for assessi ng functions being developed and field tested by the federal agencies the hydrogeomorphic approach is not yet fully inplace another cause of disagreements is whether and how to differentiate the value of credits for wetlands that are created restored or preserved at the bank site bank operations critics worry that banking proponents are not sufficiently concerned about both the start up of banks and the longterm liab ility to ensure that wetland values will be maintained as part of the start up there will be pressure to sell credits before they have matured at the site practice characterized as speculating in wetland creditfutures 22 if the bank fails after selling credits wetland values at both the old and new sites are lost also financial pressu res on bank sponsors from the private sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs18 could cause them to seek public lands and agency expertise generating additional taxpayer costs longterm responsibility may be at risk if enforcement mechanisms and operating controls are inadequate and bank fails many banking agreements appear to offer little detail on enforcement and responsibility should bank fail there islittle evidence about the frequency with whic h this kind of information is included in agreements or even what should be required at minimum requiring bond and clear assignment of liability would certainly be important to ensure theprotection of public values congressional considerations mitigation banking is drawing increasing attention from congress some members may view banking as an additiona l means to slow the decline of wetlands and attain the net loss goal others may view banking as an approach that would relieve some pressure on congress to act to further protect private propertyrights by providing marketbased option th at also could increase flexibility for federal agencies administering wetland programs implementation of the pilotprogram mitigation banking provisions in the 1996 federal agriculturalimprovement and reform act 1996 farm bill through the conservation reserveprogram could create substantial new opportunities on agricultural lands thesteadily increasing number of operating banks demonstrates an xpanded interest and an ability to overcome impediments economic activity and growth will continue to threaten the existence of some wetlands keeping the issue of wetland protection before congress onsite mitigation projects have poor track reco rd supporting the claims of those who believe that these efforts are not effec tive the potential for banking to be more successful especially under some conditions appears viable however mitigationbanking will be inhibited unless conservation interests support it banking entitiesprove that they can make the program work for long time period and mitigationrequirements are achieved for congress th policy debate will continue to center on how national policy should endorse or support mitigation banking as practical mitigation alternative for wetland protection programs however the 105 th congress has yet to act on legislation that would affect mitigation banking activities in the 104th congress the house did address many of these issues as it considered hr 961 clean water act reaut horization legislation provisions in this bill which passed the house in may 1995 would have modified the 404 program in many ways among other things it would have required the corps to issueregulations governing mitigation activities in wetlands and regulations for theestablishment use and oversight of mitig ation banks the senate did not act on this bill or on other legislation which included similar mitigation and mitigation bankingprovisions the senate environment and public works committee however did explore current mitigation banking efforts at march 14 1996 hearing witnesses suggestedthat there is considerable entrepreneuria l interest and activity they identifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs19 examples of current experiences successes and impediments and suggested further changes that they believe would help mitigation banking flourish one tension inbanking was between the flexibility that proponents sought for success and the tightadministration that critics thought should be placed on these activities to ensure that wetland resources are protected policy topic not addressed at the hearing thatseem certain to receive future congressional attention is whether the federalgovernment should provide financial or ot her incentives should any incentives be provided for all federallyendorsed banks fo r selected model banking efforts or for banks also are nonfinancial incentives such as streamlining the permitprocess or providing scientific or technical assistance either appropriate ornecessary and if so under what circ umstances should revolving fund be established to support overall banking efforts federal agencies have moved slowly in adopting mitigation banking policies after president clinton announced his wetland policies in august 1993 includingsupport for mitigation banking more than 2 years elapsed before the final guidance was issued with five agencies having to agree on the many specific issuessurrounding implementation perhaps this is not surprising but even after therelease of final guidance for banking cerns over banking policy remain and are likely to continue implementing the mitigation banking guidelines could help ensure that degraded wetlands are fully replaced yet many unanswered questions remaindevelopment interests are generally strong supporters of the concept of bankingthey view banking as another alterna tive for the mitigati on process many environmentalists are skeptical of mitiga tion banks they claim that banking policy endorses wetland destruction with little assurance that functional values will beprotected over the long term some of them will only support mitigation banking ifuse is limited to last option and monitore d closely they want mitigation banks to have precise scientifically sound rules th at provide for guaranteed banking success though the federal guidance seems to respond to many of these argumentsmitigation banks must provide some long term success stories before concerns can be alleviated congress may continue to encourage banking generally as it did in the 1996 farm bill but it is also likely to address these issues as part of legislationthat authorizes any specific mitigation banking programs or policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97849crs20 bibliography the following bibliography is not comprehensive listing of the rapidly expanding library of sources that examine wetland mitigation banking
