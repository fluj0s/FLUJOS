6509c09 shspec66 classification and gradation we have twenty people going for clear we are really getting an assembly line going the world is going downhill but we are reversing the curve all the laws passed to hit mr big end up hitting the worker the effect of the east grinstead city councils refusal to permit building as soon as needed is to make the staff work harder in very little space the maharaja of jaipur who used to own st hill wanted to build forty cottages and polo field the city planners denied him permission so he sold st hill to lrh furthermore the council never meets they didnt meet all august during the best building weather technical advances now consist of improvements in application of the existing technology technology that cannot be applied is not useful some things arent even meant to be applied eg pure mathematics lrh while he was in college suggested applying an abstruse form of mathematics to aerial navigation he was told that he would be flunked out of college if he continued this mathematical principle was later developed by the navy into loran we have had more technology than we have had application there was bug in the application which was not teaching auditors to recognize fns so the only thing holding up scientology has been the failure on the part of auditors to know or recognize the floating needle the trouble that we had with r212 was that it is too fast you have to be on your toes because your pc will go release perhaps before you have finished the first list overrun on k212 can be terrible unfortunately it was done regularly we overran our success point by many years on this process the main trouble you have today isnt getting result it is recognizing that you have gotten it saint hill students have had trouble getting classified for levels iii and iv because of the problem of auditing someone up to grades 3 and 4 people went release before they got to the processes required for those classification levels tech exists now we need to get it applied we have enough tech on world basis we need the technology of dissemination supplied this tech is in the fsm appointment letter if you can see it and it is also released elsewhere we are used to being improved or fixed by being passive and letting things be done to us but the individual is what we are interested in as final product it is interesting how long it can sometimes take for the individual to find himself somewhere around fourth stage release r6ew ep the individual finds himself with an answer to the question who am i namely im not as an intellectual knowledge but as total connection with self all the way back what has disappeared is all the times when the individual has been various identities the gains he gets can seem microscopic yet full of impact as he goes up the line these gains can get incredibly simple as things blow and stops get asised the individual feels that he could always have done whatever ability he has just attained he could have but he didnt so any commentary about the ability of thetan has to come off as an invalidation by understatement any assertion of ability is thus an invalidation you could make the wildest statement you could possibly dream up and then assert that as your own ability eventually youd have to get it off your case as invalidation of self recovery from illness could be related to dissemination you might have pain in the head and not know it until you become aware of it and it blows so that you feel much better what the pc assigns as gain is generally great understatement of the real gain the route the bridge when you first say to someone we will make you better they immediately ask better what better bank robber or is my lumbosis going to be better the difficulty is in trying to communicate what we are trying to do in scientology to someone who has inkling that that sort of thing can happen telling someone who thinks that he is body that he is himself is very hard people tell each other that man is an animal and when he dies he is gone dead this happens even though they dont believe it of themselves man has only believed that he is an animal for the past 7590 years psychology has changed since dmsmh was published it used to say that mans intelligence and condition couldnt be changed it is therefore difficult to tell someone on the street that he can get better you have to show him you can use graph the classification and gradation chart showing that there are these various states so he sees that there is place to go he can get reality on the level just above where he is by visualizing the graph he will see which way to go however it is unlikely that he will have any reality on the levels beyond the next level up life is improved on gradient not by leaps into ot from db if you buy the idea that you could become ot by inspection etc then you are also buying the idea that you dont have anything to do with life because it is you and your awareness that is improving not the attendant and appendant machinery with which you are surrounded we are handling life you must give an individual gradient that is real to him for instance to sick man not hurting is real after you have handled this then you could get him to consider sitting up if you ignore the gradient you can advance person more rapidly than he can tolerate when you promise person that he will made too big jump in too little time you set him up to get big lose people on this planet were not issued an instruction book on themselves how do you learn about yourself you learn by studying one lesson at time by getting one improvement at time you can advance person beyond his tolerance rate in processing the bridge we have is across an actual chasm the way across is by the bridge not off the edge the gradation and classification plan is designed to prevent people from going into the abyss the grade chart prevents loses by providing gradient ethics is the traffic cop the chart has an elastic bottom some people start from zero some people start from lower states level 34 is unexistence there are states way below unexistence on the awareness scale but someone in one of these states wont be able to read the chart as person at given level on the awareness chart improves he is likely to become aware of the next level but he cant skip levels his position on the awareness chart is not question of his behavior or what he is dramatizing it is what he as being is aware of person at unexistence when he improves becomes aware of disconnection level 33 misconnection would be an improvement over existence at all he gets the idea that hes disconnected from things he becomes aware of alert to the fact that in life he is actually disconnected person at fixidity level 27 wont find power real but he will become aware of ridicule or glee level 26 laugh at him and hell notice the awareness scale doesnt show what the guy is dramatizing it is not his behavior that counts it is what he himself as being is aware of it is what hes aware of not what you are aware of about him if the person is aware that he is introverted level 11 he can then and only then become aware of the fact that he is numb numbness level 10 at this level the individual gets reaction from life need of change level 4 is very high state most homo sapiens wonder how they can endure the thing they cant change the one thing scientology does do for sure is to change conditions so someone has to be up to level 4 before he can become scientologist person who has to be helped may not be aware of help or the possibility of it someone who only wants to receive help and doesnt want to give it isnt really up to the help level level 11 being aware of help is sixflow operation person who is unwilling to help others is not up to help on the awareness chart someone moving up the chart through the levels does achieve the awareness at each level above that the person has recognition he sees where he is his orientation becomes better he begins to recognize himself and others for what they are he gets up to where he can communicate then perceive then get oriented you cant find out where you are unless you can perceive where you are then comes understanding then enlightenment enlightenment never takes place before understanding people think it can and modern universities are dedicated to it above that guy gets return of his energy an adjustment he becomes aware of the fact of body and that he is not body he gets to where he can predict he goes into action he sees himself as capable of production he knows result when he sees one he can review the things of his life and take care of it he regains his ability his own purposes start coming out straight he didnt ever realize he was really running on other peoples purposes he gets clearing of his entire past and other purposes and realization of himself and then he goes into state where he is capable of power comprising conditions existence and source the top of the scale of awareness but by the time he gets into that state he is of course totally responsible and can be trusted with it otherwise he wont make it the grades approximate these steps the gradation chart parallels and makes possible the attainment of these awareness levels there are four states of release up to grade 6 then you get clear this is another state of release an ot is capable of operating with or without body he is himself he is independent of the universe around him the only thing that stands in the way of just getting person to become of each level one after another is the machines and odds and ends that he has around him and that have to be dealt with it is hard for person to get close to himself and confront these things you have to know the secret of dealing with these things the actual length of time that it took to find and develop the bridge is more than fifteen or thirty years it would be hard for most people to believe how long it has taken but anyhow it has been done
