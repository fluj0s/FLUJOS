infringement liabi lity although the courts recognize an exception to patent infringement known as the experimental use privilege this judicia lly created doctrine has been described as very narrow and rarely applie d in particular the exper imental use privilege applies only to uses done for amusement to satisfy idle curiosity or for strictly philosophical inquiry this doctrine does not excuse us that are in keeping with the accused infringers business objectives in 2002 the us court of appeals fo r the federal circuit applied these principles in the case of madey v duke university the court held that the experimental use privilege does not apply to activities that are in keeping with the alleged infringers legitimate business even though the business of the defendant duke university was nonprofit research this ruling has raised concerns among some representatives of universities and research institutions who fear that their basic rd activities will subject them to patent infringement lawsuits competing views have arisen over the significance of the madey v duke university case some commentators believe that limited experimental use privilege may best encourage technologi cal advancement by rewarding successful researchers with robust patent rights others argue that the restricted nature of the experimental use privilege may in fact limit researcher access to stateoftheart technologies and thus discourage further technological development still others assert that this issue is not of great prac tical importance as few patent owners will likely file costly and timeconsuming lawsuits against researchers who are not making commercially important us of patented inventions the judicially created common law experimental use privilege is complemented by limited statutory experimental use privilege for patents on pharmaceuticals medical devi ces and certain other produc ts regulated by the food and drug administration this provisi on enacted as part of the 1984 hatch waxman act applies to firms seeking to market generic equiva lents of brandname products in addition congress has enacted other intellectual property legislation that incorporates provisions shielding researchers from infringement liability should congressional interest continue in this area variety of options are available if the current scope of th common law experimental use privilege is deemed to be appropriate then action need be taken alternatively congress could enact legislation confirming the limite d experimental use privilege recognized in madey v

goal of the patent system is to promote the production and dissemination of technological information some observe rs believe that absent patent system individuals and firms would be less likely to engage in research and development without the availability of patent protection new inven tions could be easily copied by free riders who incurred cost to develop and perfect th technology involved and who would therefore be able to unders ell the original inventor the resulting inability of inventors to capitalize on their inventions would lead to an environment where too few inventions are made by pr oviding individuals with exclusive rights in their inventions for limited time the patent system allows inventors to realize the profits from their inventions16 other commentators believe that if the patent system were unavailable individuals would maintain their inventions as trade secrets so that competitors could not exploit them trade secrets do not rich the collective knowledge of society however nor do they discourage others from engaging in duplicative research the patent system avoids these inefficiencies by requiring inventors to consent to the disclosure of their inventions in issued patent instruments17 additional explanations for the patent ws have been offered the patent act may stimulate technological advancement by inducing individuals to invent around

examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention28 in addition the application must di sclose the best m ode or preferred way that the

must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tang ible benefit30 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publica tion or other knowledge within the public domain31 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time

states the patented invention33 the term of the patent is ordinarily set at twenty years from the date the patent application was filed34 patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions or license others to do so the grant of patent permits the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery often by charging higher price than would prevail in competitive market patent rights are not selfenforcing patentee bears responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether

ascertaining the sufficiency of the machine to produce its described effects41 later in sawin v guild 42 justice story explained that an unauthorized manufacture of patented invention was not an infringement unless it constituted making with an intent to use for profit and not for the mere purpose of philosophical experiment or to ascertain the verity and exactness of the sp ecification the 1861 decision in peppenhausen v falke further explained it has been held and doubt is now well settled that an experiment with patented article for the sole purpose of gratifying philosophical taste

advantage of the experimental use privilege duke explained that it was nonprofit educational institution dedicated to teach ing research and the advancement of knowledge duke further argued that it does not undertake research or development work principally for the purpose of obtaini ng patents or designing products for the marketplace the district court agreed that the experimental use privilege applied and ruled in favor of duke54 on appeal the federal circuit reversed the district courts experimental use determination the court of appeals char acterized the experimental use privilege as very narrow and strictly limited55 in particular the federal circuit observed that the experimental use privilege does not immunize any conduct that is in keeping with the alleged infringers legitimate business regardless of commercial implications56 it further explained that major research universities such as duke often sanction and fund research projects with arguably commercial application whatsoever however these projects unmistakably further the institutions legitimate business objectives including educating and enlightening stude nts and faculty participating in these projects the projects also serve for ex ample to increase the status of the institution and lure lucrative research grants students and faculty57 as result the federal circuit held that the district court had resolved the case based upon an inappropriately expansive view of the experimental use privilege it remanded the litigation back to the district court with instructions to resolve the issue in light of the federal circuits decision58 many patent law experts agree that following the madey v duke university case colleges universities and othe r academic institutions are unlikely

practically any project conducted by research univers ity even one without any commercial implications would be in keeping with the universitys legitimate business interests and hence would not

law experimental use privilege as it might be applied outside of academic settings62 attorneys paul devinksy and mark g davi s concluded that the opinion is consistent with previous judicial interpretations of the common law experimental use privilege as result the privilege lives on as na rrow defense to claim of infringement63 other observers would go further ms cai states for example that the decision has essentially destroyed any practical meaning to the experimental use defense64 attorneys cathryn campbell and rv l upo are in accord stating that after madey v duke university the

experimental use privilege is inappropriate as matter of technology policy under this view liberal experimental allowance would greatly ease the ability of competitors to design around the invention

purring increased innovative ac tivity broad experimental use exception would have just the opposite effect67 for some observers broad experimental use privilege is inappropriate even when research takes place within an academic research setting this is because university research is often not isolated from the private sector but instead may have significant commercial implications68 as stated by two senior officers of the uspto the madey v duke university decision recognized basic economic truth underlying research performed by larg universities it is business and universities derive substantial commercial value from that research69 indeed some commentators believe that university research is increasingly likely to have commercial implications this shift is believed to be due in part to federal legislation commonly known as the bayhdole act70 the bayhdole act aims to encourage the commercialization of basic research by allowing universities and small businesses to pr ocure patents on inventions that result from federally funded research since the passage of the bayhdole act many research universities have developed patent portfolios and garnered significant royalties from intellectual property licensing71 because academic institutions are increasingly benefitted from the patent system some observers reason they should also be held accountable when they infringe the patents of others72 in contrast others believe that the common law experimental use privilege is overly narrow they assert th at the current scope of this doctrine too greatly restricts the ability of innovators to tinker with the developments of others73 under this view research may be chille d if scientists cannot expe riment upon stateoftheart technology free from charges of patent

limiting the experimental use privilege with respect to universities and nonprofit institutes could impede academic research some universitybased scientists believe that unlike some of their counterparts in the private sector academic researchers have all but ignored the patent system75 in order to avoid patent infringement universities may have to devote scarce resources to perform costly patent searches and enga ge in licensing negotiations with patent holders to greater extent than profitseeking firms educational institutions may find that these obligations weigh heavily on their frequently tight budgets76 several legal scholar s have suggested that the holding of madey v duke university raises particular concerns with rega rd to patented research tools research tool is an inventi on such as particular cell line reagent or antibody that is used exclusively or primarily for th purpose of conducting sc ientific research77 some observers believe that patents are too frequently granted on research tools particularly in biotechnology and that such patents ma impede future advancement for example two members of the university of michigan law school faculty michael heller and rebecca s eisenberg have concluded that researchers might someday need to obtain numerous patent li censes in order to conduct basic research78 the costs and complications of engaging in numerous patent transactions may potentially create an anticommons an nvironment where resources that could be committed towards further research and development are inefficiently under utilized79 under this view the narrowly cabined experimental use privilege contemplated in madey v duke university strengthens patents on research tools and might make research and development more difficult to accomplish80 notably other scholars contest these theories for example f scott kieff member of the law faculty of washington university in st louis asserts that this scenario is incorrect as matter of individual incentives81 rational patent holders should always encourage others to research with their t echnologies kieff explains so as to increase the number of applications for their inventions and

the broad use of patented research tools in biotechnology 84 in particular the nih encourages patent proprietors to license their proprietary research tools in such way as to minimize restrictions upon their use lthough the principles and guidelines formally apply only to recipients of fe deral funding the nih has urged the entire biotechnology community to adopt similar po licies so that all biomedical research and development can be synergistic and accelerated85 finally third set of co mmentators remain agnostic about the propriety of an experimental use privilege but believe that this issue is not of great importance for practical reasons patent infringement litigation is widely regarded as costly time consuming and complex86 there may be insufficient economic justification to commence litigation against individuals who are not making commercially important uses of patented inventions as resu lt patent infringement suits may only rarely be brought against hobbyists philosophers and noncommercial defendants regardless of how narrowly or broadly the expe rimental use privilege is defined 87 it is also important to remember that the patent law may in certain

its pharmacological profile to those of other compounds if th firm is able simply to purchase the patented drug on the open market then issues of patent infringement will ordinarily arise any patent

the other hand suppose that patented drug is not available for purchase within the market in order to exper iment with that com pound pharmaceutical firm must synthesize it within its own laboratorie s this step would be an act of patent infringement however because the right to make patented invention is exclusive to the patent owner90 in this case the experimental use privilege would at least theoretically come into play as po ssible defense to patent infringement statutory experimental use privileges the existence possible scope nd importance of the common law experimental use privilege

timeconsuming in some cases the effort to obtain fda marketing approval requires many years to complete93 many firms wish to sell drugs or medical devices that are generic that is to say equivalent to product that was first developed and sold under brand name by different company prior to hatchwaxman act generic firms faced two notable difficulties in getting their products to market first generic firms ordinarily had to conduct the same sort of expensive nd lengthy clinical investigations as their brandname counterpa rts in order to obtain fda marketing approval this requirement existed even in circumstances where the generic drug was chemically identical to brandname drug of wide ly acknowledged safety and effectiveness94 second generic firms had to account fo r the patents owned by their brand name competitors as of the early 1980s legal uncertainty existed as to whether generic firm could conduct clini cal trials at all if bra ndname firm held patents on the drug or medical device as part of the fda marketing pproval process the generic firm would need to both make and use the patented drug or device activities that under the intellectual prope rty laws are exclusive to the patent proprietor95 the result was that generic firm could be sued for patent infringement and at least until the releva nt patents expired enjoined from engaging in the activities it needed to perform in order to satisfy fda marketing approval requirements some generic drug and medical device firms sought to rely upon the common law experimental use privilege in this situation their position was that activities performed in order to fulfill fda marketing approval standards were merely experimental in nature and as result should be exempted from patent infringement96 whether the courts would uphold this argument remained an open legal question for many years eventually this issue came before th federal circuit which in 1984 issued its decision in roche products inc v bolar

trifle in its economic effect on the parties even if the quantity used is small it is not dilettante affair such as justice story envisioned we cannot construe the experimental use rule so broadly as to allow violation of the patent ws in the guise of scientific inquiry when that inquiry has definite cognizable and not insubstantial commercial purposes99 congress responded to roche v bolar by enacting the statute commonly known as the hatch waxman act the statute introduced number of changes to both the patent law nd the food and drug law100 among them was an accelerated marketing approval proce ss for generic products101 in addition the hatchwaxman act created statutory exemption from patent infringement for activities associated with regulatory marketing approval as originally enacted and codified in 35 usc 271e1 the hatchwaxman act exem pted from patent infringement uses reasonably related to the velopment and submission of information under federal law which regulates the

defibrillator was reasonably related to obtaining data for fda approval eli lilly in turn argued that the wording of 35 usc 271e1 as it was at the time only expressly referred to drugs not medical devices104 the supreme court sided with medtronic concluding that all of the products eligible for patent term extension under the hatchwaxm an act fall within the scope of the 35 usc 271e1 experimental use privilege justi ce scalia concluded that the statutory phrase federal law which regulates the manufacture use or sale of drugs meant the entirety of the food drug and cosmetic ac t

privilege the leading decision in intermedics inc v ventritex inc interpreted the statutory exemption generously106 according to the intermedics decision where it would have been reasonable objectively for an accused infringer to believe that there was decent prospect that the use in question woul d contribute relatively directly to the generation of information that was likely to be

but is instead narrowly tailored exemption in tended to have minimis impact on the patentees right to exclude113 other statutes although the hatchwaxman act awards limited experiment use privileges with respect to patents on certain dr ugs medical devices and other products regulated by the fda the patent act of 1952 does not provide for more broadly oriented experimental use privilege however congress has enacted number of specialized intellectual property statutes that expressly incorporate more comprehensive experimental use doctrine for example the plant variety protection act allows the department of agriculture to issue plant variety certificates on sexually reproducible plants114 these certificates provide their owner with the exclusive right to exclude others from selling the variety or offering it for sale or reproducing it importing or exporting it or using it in producing as distinguished from developing hybrid or different variety therefrom115 the statute does include

trips agreement does allow member states to limit patent rights under certain circumstances however as stated in article 30 of the trips agreement members may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by patent provided that such ex ceptions do not unreasonably conflict with normal exploitation of the pa tent and do not unr easonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties article 30 presumably allows its signatories to provide for generally applicable experimental use privilege many wto members including germany126 japan127 and the united kingdom128 already incorporate such privilege into their patent statutes however more limited form of the experimental use privilege may raise concerns under the nondiscrimin ation provision of article 27 to the extent that the experimental use privilege is available for some sorts of inventions and not others it may conflict with the article 27 obligation not to discriminate as to the field of technology in which pate ntable invention arises129 finally the experimental use privile ge need not be an allornothing proposition another option is to grant resear chers the ability to experiment with the patented inventions of others provided they compensate the patent holder at specified royalty rate this regime would effectively amount to compulsory license available to researchers130 janice mueller member of the faculty of the university of pittsburgh law school posits that this approach would ensure royalty award of sufficient amount to maintain incentives for the development and patenting of new research tools yet alleviate the access restrictions and upfronthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32651crs21 131see mueller supra note 4 132schechter thomas supra note 16 at 126costs currently associated with acquisiti on and use of many proprietary research tools131 in weighing this approach to the experimental use issue it is also important to note that the trips agreement places some restrictions upon the ability of wto members to grant compulsory licenses ar ticle 31 which is among the more detailed provisions in the trips agreement in part requires that each application for compulsory license be considered on its individual merits that the proposed user must have made efforts to obtain license from the patent owner and that the legal validity of such license be subject to review by the courts or other independent authority132 deliberations over compulsory license approach to the experimental use privilege may wish to account for these obligations concluding observations whether the patent laws ex perimental use privilege should be retained as narrowly confined doctrine of limited ava ilability or expa nded to encompass additional experimental activities technologie s and researchers continues to be the subject of active discussion in the scientific and legal communities limited experimental use privilege may best encourage technologi cal advancement by rewarding successful researchers with patent rights that are not easily circumvented however some commentator s believe that the circum scribed nature of the experimental use privilege may in fact restrict researcher access to stateoftheart technologies and thus discourage further t echnological development although the courts have relied upon existing law in orde r to reach their decisions in particular cases whether narrow experimental use privilege most appropriately serves the contemporary scientific research co mmunity remains open to policy debate
