congressional research service the library of congress crs2 pl 108447 requires the secretary of state to report to congress on pakistans education reform strategy and the us strategy to assist islamabad in this effort2 both the united states and pakistan are seen to have an interest in the strengthening of pakistani education system that will better prepare young citizens for gainful employment in an increasingly knowledgebased economy as well as in curtailing or halting the teaching of militantextremist values that are implicated in breeding terrorism3 to some degree and often through overt means such values can be widely transmitted in mainstream nonreligious schools through historical narratives that provide false or inaccurate accounts portraying muslims andor pakistanis as victims of foreign aggression and repression4 however for many observers it is the curriculum taught in some pakistani religious schools madrassas that represents the most daunting sociocultural obstacle to president musharrafs stated goal of enlightened moderation the number of madrassas in pakistan increased more than tenfold from 1947 to1988 in apparent correspondence with the deterioration of pakistans public education system the taliban movement itself began among students attending pakistani religious schools among the more than10000 madrassas training up to two million children in pakistan are small percentage that have been implicated in teaching militant antiwestern httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22009 antiamerican antihindu and even antishia values press reports citing pakistani government estimates claim that about 10 of all pakistani school children attend madrassas and that 10 of madrassas have links to militant groups secretary of state powell identified these madrassas as offering programs that do nothing but prepare youngsters to be fundamentalists and to be terrorists even the pakistani president concedes there are many madrassas which are involved in militancy and extremism5 sizable portion of these madrassas are financed and operated by pakistani islamist political parties such as jamaateulema islam jui closely linked to the taliban as well 2

20012015 in december 2001 the government launched an education sector reform esr with seven main goals among them significantly increasing the national literacy rate providing universal education with increased completion rates and reduced gender disparity and improving education quality through curriculum reform teacher training and assessment reform an education for all project which islamabad calls special focus of esr was launched in 2001 and funded with about 20 million in 2003 beginning in 2005 english httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22009 language classes are to be compulsory in all of pakistans public schools8 also among the stated esr goals is bringing madrassa curriculum into the mainstream of pakistans general education system through the inclusion of secular subjects such as science in august 2001 the islamabad government created pakistan madrassa education board to establish network of model madrassas and regulate others in january 2002 president musharraf vowed to begin regulating pakistans religious schools and his government launched fiveyear 113 million plan to bring the teaching of formal secular subjects to 8000 willing madrassas however concrete action was taken until june of that year when 115 madrassas were denied access to government assistance due to their alleged links to militancy and musharraf set december 31 2002 deadline for such schools to register with the government or face closure in november 2003 the government decided to allocate about 50 million annually to provide assistance to registered seminaries especially by paying the salaries of teachers hired to teach nonreligious subjects in july 2004 pakistans theneducation minister announced government agreements with private companies to provide computer education at all of the countrys public schools she later declared islamabads intention to provide financial grants to madrassas that seek to impart modernday education9 6 see testimony of codirector of the independent

million almost tripling the fy2004 outlay of 24 million there are concerns that us funding to assist pakistans education reform efforts has thus far been too small to have significant effect11 policy discussion in the longerterm interest of promoting moderation and democratic values in pakistan and in improving the socioeconomic status of its people sectorwide reform of the education system appears vital some analysts suggest that donors such as the united states may do best to direct their resources at reform of pakistans public education sector as they see in this the most effective and least controversial means of reversing the influence of islamic extremists and their threat to pakistani stability many observers find the root of problems with pakistans education system in

children to private english medium schools the vast majority of pakistanis must choose between deteriorated public system that can be physically difficult to access and religious schools that will feed clothe and oftentimes house their children for free12 some analysts are critical of pakistans government for what they view as excessive spending on the military in country where abject poverty is rife although expenditures on education have risen considerably over the past decade islamabad is set to spend nearly 16 on defense for every 1 spent on education this year corruption and economic demands also are factors in many locales schools and textbooks are available and teachers are paid but never report for work usaid administrator natsios has called the existence of these ghost schools terrible problem for pakistan moreover the use of child labor remains widespread in pakistan and international human rights groups have identified extensive use of bonded child labor there especially in agriculture and textile industries13 pakistani officials insist that president musharraf is serious in his aims to bring madrassa curriculum closer in substance to that provided in nonreligious schools with the longterm goal being curriculum that is nearly identical in pakistan the issue of government andor foreign interference in the operations of madrassas is an extremely httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22009 sensitive one in part due to perception that the pakistani government at the alleged direction of the us government is seeking to interfere with religion14 us and pakistani officials emphasize that us assistance efforts are districtwide and are not targeted at any individual schools or types of schools likewise the united states claims to be putting pressure on pakistans internal education policies some western nongovernmental organizations working with private donations have teamed with local islamic groups to reform madrassa curricula15 despite president musharrafs repeated pledges to crack down on the more extremist madrassas in his country there is little concrete evidence that he has done so according to two observers most madrassas remain unregistered their finances unregulated and the government has yet to remove the jihadist and sectarian content of their curricula16 many speculate that musharrafs reluctance to enforce reform efforts is rooted in his desire to remain on good terms with pakistans islamist political parties which are seen to be an 12 dead end for afghan children adrift in pakistan new york times march 7 2003 13

pakistans semifeudal landlord system especially prevalent in sindh represents much more serious obstacle to reform efforts than does islamist resistance 15 author interviews with usaid officials 16 samina ahmed and john norton moderation of freedom washington post june 15 2004 author interviews with pakistani government officials and scholars in islamabad in january 2004 tended to confirm that movement on madrassa reform was slow at best crs6 important part of his political base17 more than three years after its creation the pakistan madrassa education board appears to have had little success in fulfilling its mandate only three model madrassas have been established and only small fraction of pakistans religious schools have registered the board has ability to compel cooperation18 resistance to reform efforts is not limited to islamist groups but can also been seen in the statements of pakistans top political leaders an example is the april 2004 uproar over changes made to ninth and tenthgrade syllabi clamor that caused the prime minister education minister and religious affairs minister to reaffirm their commitments to islam and backpedal on planned curricula changes the september 2004 replacement of education minister zobaida jalal with former intelligence chief lt gen javed ashraf qazi was seen by some analysts as setback to reform efforts as pakistans intelligence agency has long been viewed as traditional ally of the countrys religious conservatives yet other observers see the move as potentially shielding the government from criticism by conservatives as it goes ahead with reform efforts19 it appears that even setting aside the question of president musharrafs sincerity and full commitment on this issue resistance to the reform of pakistans madrassas is fierce and the schools identified as the most immediately threatening to pakistani society and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22009 us interests though small in number may be immune to governmental pressure due to their access to external funding sources and their close connections to powerful islamist politicians one nongovernmental report identifies centralized and deeply politicized control of pakistans public education system perhaps most especially of curriculum and textbooks and an overemphasis on urdumedium instruction to be important causes and exacerbators of the countrys ongoing ethnic and sectarian divisions the report also criticizes centralized curricular decisionmaking as bringing about rise in the islamization of public syllabi an outcome that may be the intent of national leaders seeking to manipulate religious fervor in pursuit of foreign policy goals in kashmir and afghanistan20 given this view combined with extreme pakistani sensitivity to perceived interference in religious teaching it may be that focus on public sector reform currently is the best choice for donors years or even decadeslong effort to improve the quality of pakistans education system and reduce the spread of religiousbased militancy appears to be the course that both pakistani and us leaders have chosen attaining set objectives likely will require greater determination and genuinely longterm commitment 17 john lancaster and kamran khan at an islamic school hints of extremist ties washington post june 13 2004 18 in november 2003 pakistans education
