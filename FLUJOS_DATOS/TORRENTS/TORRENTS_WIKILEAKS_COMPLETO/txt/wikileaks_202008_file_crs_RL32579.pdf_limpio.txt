on how much money could be deposited for the first eight years fy1985 through fy1993 congress lifted the cap for fy1994 through fy1999 beginning in fy2000 congress reinstated annual caps to protect

that are not obligated by congress must remain in the fund for obligation in future fiscal years without fiscal year limitation currently the funding for the current years grants are provided by the previous years collections deposited in the fund the capped amount is the amount that ovc can award grants in given year in years where the receipts from the previous year are not sufficient to reach the congressionally set cap for fiscal year the additional amounts are made up from the amount credited to the cvf emergency fund otherwise referred to as the rainy day fund if collections in previous year exceed the cap then amounts over the cap are credited to the rainy day fund for future program benefits for example in fy2000 the first year the congressionally set cap was reinstated funding for the year was capped at 500 million for voca grants despite the fact that collections were 985 million in fy1999 the collections over the cap were credited to the cvf for future use table 1 provides the amounts of receipts amounts available for voca grants and the balances available at the end of each year in the cvf or rainy day fund since fy2000 when the cap was reinstated by congress there has been considerable fluctuation in the amounts collected while the congressionally set cap has increased in most years it is important to note that there has been significant variation in collections

all 50 states have passed some form of legislation to benefit victims of crime24 as of 2000 33 states have recognized the fundamental rights for crime victims by raising these protections to the state constitutional level the strength of enforcement within the 50 states varies however every state administers crime victim compensation program that provides financial assistance to victims of both federal and state crimes most state programs have similar eligibility requirements and offer comparable range of benefits maximum awards generally range from 10000 to 25000 the typical compensation program requires victims to report crimes to law enforcemen t within three days of the offense and to file claims within fixed period of time usually two years most states can extend these time limits for good cause if other financial resources such as private health and property insurance are available to the victim the program pays only to the extent these resources do not cover the loss in addition to victim compensation funding all the states and several territories provide some victim assistance services such as crisis intervention emergency shelter emergency transportation counseling and criminal justice advocacy as noted above voca awards are made annually by states to organizations to provide these and other services to victims of crime voca assistance funds may be used only for direct services to crime victims most funding is awarded on competitive basis voca also authorizes the ovc to award discretionary funds to improve the skills knowledge and abilities of victim service

traffic offenders for example virginia imposes 3 fee on all traffic and misdemeanor offenders and some felony drug offenders these funds are then deposited into virginias victimwitness fund and used to implement victims rights virginia brings in 38 million annually using this method texas imposes 45 penalty for felony 35 for class and b misdemeanors and 15 fee for class c misdemeanors using these fees texas raised nearly 69 million in 1999 for the texas crime victims compensation fund and more than 16 million was appropriated for crime victim services in addition some states raise money by setting specific assessments for offenders of particular types of crime eg child pornography other offenses against children domestic violence sex offenses pimping or soliciting prostitute and crimes against the elderly or disabled other states impose costs on offenders placed on probation or other forms of supervised release whereas other states withhold percentage of an inmates earnings that
