the principles addressed in existing guidance relative to prudent risk management practices and consumer protection laws17 concerning risk management the proposed guidance states th at predatory lending typically involves at least one of 1 lending on collateral value rather than borrower ability to repay 2 inducing repeated refinan ces to charge high points and fees or 3 using deceptive marketing to conceal the true nature of the mortgage obligation concerning consumer protection the proposed guidance st ates that mortgage product scriptions and advertisements should provide clear detailed information on the costs terms features and risks of the loan to the borrower including any payment shock or prepayment penalty in the proposed guidance the ffiec asks for comments concerning restrictions on planned refinances because the stru ctural evolution of subprime mortgage lending in recent years has introduced some products that are intended at their outset to be temporary credit accommodations in an ticipation of early sale or refinancing rather than longerterm amortizing accounts18 commentors are asked to address the following do planned subprime refinances ways present inappropriate risks that should be discouraged if not under what circumstances are they appropriate will the proposed guidance restrict existing subprime borrowers attempts to refinance and avoid
