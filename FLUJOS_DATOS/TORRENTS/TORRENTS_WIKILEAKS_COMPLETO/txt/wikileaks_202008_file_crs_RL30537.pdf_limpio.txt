divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537computer services personnel overtime pay under the fair labor standards act summary the fair labor standards act of 1938 flsa as amended is the primary federal statute in the area of minimum wages and overtime pay section 13a1 provides among other things that th acts wage and hour overtime pay requirements will not apply to any empl oyee employed in bona fide executive administrative or professi onal capacity through ad ministrative rulemaking the secretary of labor has estab lished two tests through whic h to define eligibility under the section 13a1 exem ption duties test and an earnings test the department of labor dol th rough many years had defined professional as one who has undergone pr olonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study as dis tinguished from general academic education and from an apprenticeship after review of thencurrent practice in the field dol in series of decisions beginning in the 1960s decided that it was not able to determine that computer services worker s were professional for section 13a1 purposes thus such workers continued to be fully covered by the wage and hour provisions of the flsa in 1990 congress adopted freestandi ng legislation directing dol to promulgate regulations defining the stat us of computer services workers and to include in that definition an earnings test not less than 6½ times the federal minimum wage although dol proceeded as directed congress revisited the issue in 1996 it removed the computer services exemption from section 13a1 creating new categorical exemption in section 13a17 here unburdened by the issue of defining professional congress set its own standard it also froze the earnings test at 2763 per hour d ecoupling it from the genera l minimum wage with the increase in the general wage floor part of the 1996 amendments that came to equal 54 times the minimum wage some might argue that the rationale for exemption of computer services personnel in the absence of significant hearings record may not be entirely clear further given the broad definition of computer services professional in the legislation for example some may question which workers in the industry would not be exempt still legislation tinued to be introduced th at would have broadened the exemption further none however was enacted however in the spring of 2004 the admin istrations revi sion of section 13a1 of the flsa dealing with compensation for executives administrators or professionals provided yet nother option for employers of computer professionals the new rate under section 13a1 woul d provide new reduced rate for such workers this paper explores treatment of co mputer professionals under the flsa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537contents most recent

fair labor standards act most recent developments under the fair labor standards act not all workers are treated in precisely the same manner in terms of wa ges and hours computer services personnel is case in point through number of years empl oyers had sought to classify them at professionals and thus to exempt them from minimum wage and overtime pay but to avail then in 1990 congress adopted special legislation directing the department of labor to reassess its treatment of such workers the department did so but in 1996 congress created new pr ovision of the flsa section 13al7 declaring such workers under certain circum stances to be as cat egorically exempt although the 1996 amendments were adopte d it was suggested that some fine tuning continued to be needed various proposals dealing with computer services legislation continued to be introduced through the 108th congress although none of the new proposals was adopted the ad ministration proposed more general revision of the section 13a1 requirement dealing with executives administrators and professionals as ultimately promulgated in the spring of 2004 and given effect in august of that year the new provisi on would have made it somewhat easier for computer services workers with others to qualify for exemption whether the new regulation will be sufficient to deal with computer services personnel or will need further congressiona l involvement remain s somewhat unclear this report traces the manner in which one industry computer services has been treated for wage and hour purposes under the fair labor standards act introduction the fair labor standards act of 1938 fls as amended is the basic federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay and related standards three sections are of immediate relevance for this report section 6 is the acts basic minimum wage provision section 7 requires that one and onehalf times ones regular rate of pay timeand ahalf be paid to workers for hours worked in excess of 40 per week section 13 is devoted to exemptions in section 13a1 congress exempted both from minimum wage and overtime pay protections any employee employed in bona fide executive administr ative or professional capacity the eap exemption adding that such terms were to be defined and delimited by regulations of the administrator th at is now the secretary of

while there are different qualifying factors established by the secretary for each classification executive administrative or professional the computer services issue revolved around the concept of professional 3 the timeduties requirement was changed under the new section 13a1 but prior to the 2004 administrative changes in the act it remained significant factor initially limited largely to industrial workers associated with interstate commerce wagehour coverage under the flsa has gradually been expanded to include larger portion of the workforce speaking generally employers have urged broadening of exemptions while worker s have urged expanded coverage in some cases precise exemptions have been written into the act at other times exemption has been flexible leaving discretion to the secretary of labor the result after 60 years some have argued is statute that is inordinately complex and difficult to interpret though others would argu that it is necessarily precise1 section 13a1 under the fair labor standards ac t of 1938 flsa special minimum wage and overtime pay trea tment an exemption was allo wed for certain persons who could qualify as bona fide executive administrative or professional employees section 13a1 definition of bona fide executive administrative or professional employee was left to the di scretion of the secretary of labor who through the years has developed qualifying criteria2 to be exempt under section 13a1 two criteria must normally be met first the worker must be paid salary above threshold established by the secretary the salary test second the worker must be engaged in duties that would meet in this instance the standard of professional the dutie s test as specified by the secr etary in addition the worker would be required to devote not more than 20 of his or her time to duties that are not regarded as executive administrative or professional 3 definition of executive administrative and professional and establishment of the elements necessary to qualify as bona fide have proved contentious in part because persons so defined and thus fallin g within the section 13a1 exemption are stripped of minimum wage and overtime pay protection under the act further in rapidly evolving fields it has not always been clear who actually is bona fide professional and who is simply technically skilled worker in computer sciences for example job descriptions academic requirements and work patterns varied widely and were early in near constant flux thus the depa rtment after lengthy consideration determined th at it was not practical to render clear definition of professional in the computer services field delaying finding till the discipline had stabilizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs3 4 hearings were conducted on

congress but new legislation was adopted general definition of professional the eligibility criteria developed by the secretary for the eap exemption are precise bona fide professionals are to be paid

relatively new occupational area still in state of flux and that job titles and duties are not regularized and overlap and in termix in confusing manne r they contended that to expand the exemption was an invitati on for employers to work such employees longer hours with additional compensa tion both employers and employees concurred that college degree was not requirement for entry into the data processing field11 ultimately the department concluded that there is need to change the definition of professional employee in the regulations as it would affect computer services personnel instead it would authorize exemptions based upon specific circumstances and work situations12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs6 13 federal register may 7 1973 pp 11390 and 11404 14 opinion letter

narrowly as landis stated here this is so because an application of an exemption deprives an employee of the monetary benefits which the act otherwise providesthrough the early 1970s dol maintained its ad hoc approach13 emphasizing that the professional exemption under s ection 13a1 required knowledge of an advanced type which is customarily acqui red by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study14 it maintained that bachelors degree was standard prerequisite for professional defining its c oncept of prolonged course of specialized instruction and study as four academic years of preprofessional and professional study in an accredited university or college15 it affirmed that it could not give blanket determina tion as to the exempt status of any group or class of employees since the problem is factual one dependent upon the particular situation with respect to each individual employee16 it viewed itself as constrained by judicial decisions to interpret exempti ons from the acts provisions narrowly and limited to those who come plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit17 various departmental initiatives for revision of the regulations governing section 13a1 would be considered durin g the ford and carter administrations with the advent of the reagan administr ation general reform would be suspended the department would tinue to follow its policies of the 1960s and 1970s seeking legislative solutions when the department of labor did not adopt regulations more broadly exempting computer services personnel congress took up the issue there has now been more than decade of legislative activity in this area congress addresses the issue in the 101st congress 19891990 nator david durenberger with others proposed an amendment to general flsa gislation that direct ed the secretary of labor to interpret the wagehour professi onal exemption of section 13a1 in manner that permits computer systems analysts software engineers and other similarly skilled professional workers to qualify for such exemption under the durenberger amendment the exemption would seem to have applied to salaried workers and to hourly paid

not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this act the secretary of labor shall promulgate regulations that permit computer systems analysts computer programmers software engineers and other similarly skilled professional workers as defined in such regulations to qualify as exempt executive administrative or professi onal employees under section 13a1 such regulations shall provide that if such employees are paid on an hourly basis they shall be exempt only if their hourly rate of pay is at least 6½ times greater than the applicable minimum wage thus congress took three steps first it mandated developm ent of regulations that would permit the designated computer rvices personnel to be exempt from flsa wagehour requirements under s ection 13a1 if the requis ite salary st were met as bona fide executive administrative or professionalemployees but it did so without amending secti on 13a1 directly second it mandated that dol within 90 days following enactment promulgate th section 13a1 regulations applicable to the computer industry third it established by statut the qualifying salary test for section 13a1 exemption for the computer industry it did not direct that the secretary regard the co mputer services salary test as guide for other industries but it did provide precedent that the partment could hardly have missedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs8 25

rule on february 22 1991 it noted that there had beeninsu fficient time allowed for the department to issue proposal for comments review the comments and promulgate final rule to be effective 90 days after the law was enacted but it invited submission of comments through 60day peri od preliminary to publication of final rule since hearings had been conducted on the issue and the legislative history was sparse dol may have been uncertain about the precise intent of congress25 the final rule made number of techni cal and definitional changes in 29 cfr 541 the broader regulation applying the s ection 13a1 exemption for example it amended the definition of professional 5413a by adding the following 4 work that requires theoretical and pr actical application of highlyspecialized knowledge in computer systems analysis programming and software engineering and who is employed and engaged in these activities as computer systems analyst computer programmer software engineer or other similarly skilled worker in the computer softwa re field as provided in 541303 and in 541303 it presented an inventory of j ob titles indicative that an overtime pay exemption might be in order other criteria having been met but added because of the wide variety of job titles applied to computer systems analysis and programming work job titles alone are not terminative of the applicability of this exemption in 5413b dol stated that consideration for an exemption would also rest upon an employees primary duty th at is one or more of the following 1 the application of systems analys is techniques and procedures including consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional specifications 2 the design development documentation analysis creation testing or modification of computer systems or programs incl uding prototypes based on and related to user or system design specifications 3 the design documentation testing or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems or 4 combination of the aforementione d duties the performance of which requires the same level of skills it explained that employees engaged in the operation of computers or in the manufacture repair or main tenance of computer hardwa re and related equipment as with persons whose work is highly dependent upon or fac ilitated by the use of computers and computer so ftware programs would not be included as eligible for the overtime pay exemption26 at least since the 1970s the departme nt had argued that the concept of professional for section 13a1 purposes involve d as prerequisite substantialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs9 academic education here in response to pl 101583 dol modified its stance in 541303c the final rule stated with respect to computer professionals c the exemption applies only to highlyskilled employees who have achieved level of proficiency in the theoretical and practical application of body of highlyspecialized knowledge in computer systems analysis programming and software engineerin g and does not include trainees or employees in entry level positions learning to become proficient in such areas or to employees in these computerrelated occupations who have not attained level of skill and expertise which allows them to work independently and generally without close supervision the level of expertise and skill required to qualify for this exemption is generally attained through combinations of education and experience in the field however dol added while such em ployees commonly have bachelors or higher degree particular academic gree is required for this exemption nor licensure or certification as is required for the exemption for the learned professions of course employees who may not qualify for exemption as professional could potentially qualif under another component of section 13a1 because of their managerial and administrative duties congress restructures the exemption 1996 under pl 101583 congress directed dol to promulgate new regulations concerning the section 13a 1 computer services exem ption the result had been regulatory not statutory except with resp ect to the earnings threshold five years later congress would adopt different approach during the 104th congress 19951996 veral hearings we re conducted on the concept of the minimum wage but not up on specific legislation none of them focused upon the computer personnel exempti on nor was that major issue during consideration of the proposal in augu st 1996 new flsa legislation was adopted and signed by

13a1 reference to executive administrativ or professional in doing so it first decreed that certain computer services personnel would be exempt from the minimum wage and over time pay protections of the flsa and second specified the conditions that would permit that exemption to have effect the new statutory language read 17 any employee who is computer systems analyst computer programmer

with the targeted workers positioned under section 13a17 there wa s longer any need for the wage and hour division to define bona fide or professional the exemption was now categorical with statutory salary test for workers co mpensated on hourly basis27 declining value of the salary test in floor statement explaining the earnings test incorporated within section 13a17 representative w illiam goodling affirmed his understanding that it was merely restating the law indicating that if they are making 65 times the minimum wage the targeted computer services workers would not qualify for overtime pay under the flsa the amendment simply ma intains the current exemption level for 65 times 425 or 2763 per hour28 representative steve gunderson however stated the view that the amendment freezes the rate at which certain computer professionals are exempt from the min imum wage at 2763 per hour the current exemption amount is at 65 times the minimu m wage if the threshold 6½ times was allowed to fl oat with the minimum wage representative gunderson observed the dollar volume threshold would continue to increase under pl 104 188 it wouldnt do so but he explained the flsa was intended to protect those who were underpaid not high ly paid professionals29 under pl 104188 the 1996 amendments the threshold was indeed 6½ times the minimum wage at the time the ne w amendments were adopted 425 x 6½ 2763 however pl 104188 also ra ised the minimum wage to 515 per hour because the 2763 figure was now frozen in the statute the 6½ times formula was reduced had the threshold been allowed to float ie 6½ times the new minimum wage the new earnings test would ve been 3348 per hour as result of moving from floating threshold to fixed frozen figure the new ratio became 54 times the minimum wage30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs11 30 continued the minimum wage 31 hr 3038 did not directly specify dollar amount rather it provided continuedlegislative proposals during the 106th

revisited the issue nd altered the structure of wagehour regulation for comput er services workers but the industry continues to be marked by evolution both of systems and work patterns thus the statutory language of 1990 and 1996 ma be perceived as need ing further alteration in the 106th congress representative robert andrews with others introduced legislation hr 3038 that would have rewritten section 13a17 the bill had basically three provisions first the proposal in effect would have repealed the existing section 13a17 and w ould then have started over second although its language generally paralleled that of the existing code hr 3038 would have redefined and broadened the types of computerrelated work that could qualify one as overtime pay and minimum wage exempt

compensated on an hourly basis is compensated at the rate set by the amendment enacting this paragraph made by section 2105a of the employee commuting flexibility act of 1996 this of course is the

representative rick lazio with others called for an increase in the minimum wage to 615 per hour further it would have altered wagehour coverage for certain sales personnel and would have exempted persons employed as licensed funeral director or licensed embalmer from wagehour coverage under the flsa in language largely identical to hr 3038 andrews the lazio bill would have re defined wagehour tr eatment of certain computer services personnel similarly setti ng the earnings test at not less than 2763 an hour but stating that amount directly in monetary terms32 while the lazio bill would have incr eased the minimum wage to 615 per hour it made change in the threshold of earnings that would permit minimum wage and overtime pay exemption thus it altered the ratio of th threshold to the

reported the bill on november 11 hrept 106467 part i the committee on education and the workforce did not act immediately on january 28 2000 the committee on education and the workforce was discharged from further consideration of the legislation hearings were held and re port was filed on march 9 2000 hr 3081 was passed by the house of representatives the senate had earlier adopted different nd separate minimum wa ge language an amendment to s 625 the bankruptcy refo rm act of 1999 but the latter did not deal with the exemption for computer rvices personnel ultimately as the 106th congress drew to close the computer services legislation was laid aside and it died as the congress adjournedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs13 33 see crs report rl30993 the fair labor standards act wagehour and related issues before the 107th congress by william g whittakerlegislative proposals during the 107th congress on february 8 2001 representative quinn introduced hr 546 an umbrella proposal dealing mostly with nonlabor i ssues added at the end however were provisions to raise the minimum wage to 615 an hour after april 1 2002 and among other changes in the flsa to broa den the wagehour exemption with respect to computer services personnel the co mputer services pe rsonnel provisions were later introduced as freestanding bill by representative andrews hr 1545 the bills were essentially identical nd similar to the proposals of the 106th congress the same pattern of referral wa s followed hr 1545 to education and the workforce hr 546 to ways and means and to education and the workforce various other flsarelated proposal s were introduced during the 107th congress some as part of composite legislation and others free standing33 the primary focus however appeared to be upon an increase in the minimum wage which in turn some argued would need to be linked to tax benefits for business while hearings were conducted on certain of the flsarelated bills the computer services personnel legislation did not r eceive immediate atten tion neither bill was acted upon during the 107th congress legislative proposals during the 108th congress the treatment of computer services wo rkers under the flsa was the subject of new legislative initiatives during the 108th congress given impetus by regulatory change initiated by dol new legislation proposed on march 3 2003 senator graham of south caro lina introduced s 495 proposal that would amend section 13a17 of the flsa to redefine the treatment of certain computer services workers with respect to minimum wage and overtime coverage companion bill hr 1996 was introduced by representative joe wilson also of south carolina on may 6 2003 the bills list certain types of computer services workers who could be minimum wage and overtime pay exempt any employee who is computer systems network or database analyst designer developer programmer software engineer or other similarly skilled worker and provide an inventory of duties that such exempt workers could be expected to perform the bills were referred respectively to the committee on health education labor and pensions and to the committee on education and the workforce but did not advance beyond their referralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs14 34 see crs report rl32088 the fair labor standards act historical sketch of the overtime pay requirements of section 13a1 by william g whittaker 35 since few workers presumably would have qualified for exemption as bona fide executives administrators or professionals th ey would likely have been covered under the flsa even without the new minimum standard 36 see federal register april 23 2004 p 22122 ff new section 13a1 regulations proposed by dol on march 31 2003 dol proposed genera l restructuring of the regulations implementing the minimum wage and overtime pay treatment of certain bona fide professional or executive and administra tive employees under section 13a1 the proposed rule 29 cfr part 541 was contentious and provoked several legislative initiatives designed to block its issuance in final form andor implementation34 none of these alternative m easures was adopted and in late august 2004 the new regulation took effect the new rule provided veral new elements first to qualify for exemption ie to be exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay worker would need to earn at least 23600 per month35 second for any worker earning in excess of 100000 year there would be presumed ex emption so long as he or she was engaged in any single executive admin istrative or pr ofessional duty thus two standards were tablished for computer services workers section 13a1 new standard which could in clude anybody earning at least 23660 year with duties that were considered appropr iate with sec ond standard section 13a17 categorical exemption as computer services workers who were paid at least 2763 roughly 57470 year36 how these two options would mesh is not entirely clear nor is it clear how one might distinguish section 13a1 exempt worker at 23660 year from section 13a17 exempt worker at 57470 given these options arguably few employers would seek exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay standards under section 13a17 when they coul d easily and more economically comply with the standard potentially offered by section 13a1 under th departments new regulation of course an employer could still classify his or her employee as an executive or administrator under the section 13a1 exemption as the case may be and secure exemption comment and policy considerations wagehour treatment of co mputer services personnel has been intermittently an issue before the department of labor nd the congress through the past 25 years although it does not appear to have attracted great atte ntion it has raised number of considerations of policy these fo cus both upon specific legislation and upon the broader implications of the issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30537crs15 whether andor how to exempt certain computer services personnel from the minimum wage and overtime pay protections of the flsa reflects continuing change in the field some may argue that the rationale for such action exemption is not entirely clear further who are the workers who would actually be affected by this exemption how many of them are there in which subcategories of computer services personnel are they most numerous and who are those other similarly skilled workers what types of employers firms arewould be affected by the exemption precisely how would the changes proposed in the 108th congress affect the earnings and work patterns of specific computer services workers prior to 1990 the department of labor encountered difficulties in determining the professional status of categories of computer services workers to surmount that hurdle the legislation of 1990 ma ndated that the regulations governing wagehour treatment of such workers unde r the flsa be written in manner that would allow these workers more easily to be classified as exempt with the 1996 amendments congress stepped directly into the process and created new categorical exemption sec tion 13a17 under which cer tain computer services workers meeting specified earnings thre shold and duties test could be classified as exempt from flsa overtime pay nd minimum wage protection subsequent legislative proposals have been directed at redefining the section 13a17 exemption in the case of section 13a17 congress acted directly to exempt the computer workers setting specific exemption criteria there was further concern under that exemption with the concept of professiona l because the targeted workers paid on an hourly basis would be categorically exempt by statute with the changes projected under section 13 a1 that exemption may have been significantly broadened through the rulemaki ng process in the latter case the targeted workers salaried would need to meet professiona l test but that st could be different from that set statutorily by congress under section 13a17 this could raise number of questions first how will section 13a1 and section 13a17 mesh second in defining exemptions in the executive administrative and professional category some may query whether it is more useful for congress to act directly as in 1990 and 1996 or rather to offer general guidance to dol and then allow that agency to proceed administratively third if congress does continue to act in areas where professional standards and skill requirements are rapidly changing will it find itself drawn inevitably year after year into revisiting these issues would ongoing direct congressional invol vement be useful continuing oversight or be tedious and possibly lend itself to neglect fourth how much discretion ought properly to be left to the department in matters that have broad impact with respect to the wages and hours of americas workers and the personnel policies of their employers fifth if the department does not act in timely fashion to define and delimit the pattern of exemptions under the flsa as in the case of section 13a1 where it has th at authority will congress necessarily be drawn into the process
