addresses28 the internets possible effects on chinese politics the internet has given small but rapidly growing number of chinese economic opportunities and potent communication and information tool analysts suggest several factors that may influence how chinese use the internet politically the governments efforts to regulate content miis regulatory powers over internet services the economic and political influence of the new technological elite and the political atmosphere in general as with economic reforms the prc government both welcomes its contributions to chinas modernization and guards against its adverse effects on political control some of the governments efforts at regulating the internet are new and only partially successful they involve employing personnel software and servers that monitor internet traffic other means of controlling the internet have long been used to effectively regulate other forms of social activity these methods include granting compliant individuals and companies government approval or material rewards and severely punishing those who violate state laws or prohibitions chinas new economy entrepreneurs are reportedly eroding the states sphere of influence and gaining voice in policymaking but they lack real political power they possess the capab ility of attracting relatively large amounts of foreign capital and the potential capability of disseminating information on vast scale some observers note that premier zhu rongji and many other reformers in the communist party leadership acknowledge and support the desires of
