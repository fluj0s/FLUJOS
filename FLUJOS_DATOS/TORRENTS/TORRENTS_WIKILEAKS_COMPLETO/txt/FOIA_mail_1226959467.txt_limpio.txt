from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov subject re ghcn date mon nov 17 170427 2008 gavin first the figures are just for you dont pass on i dont normally see these i just asked my mohc contact and hes seen the furore on the blogs why did the daily telegraph run with the story its all back to their readers thinking the uk is run by another country these 3 paras below are from the ghcn web site they appear to be the only mention i can see of the wmo climat network on web site the rigorous qc that is being talked about is done in retrospect they dont do much in real time except an outlier check anyway the climat network is part of the gts the members nmss send their monthly averagestotal around the other nmss on the 4th and the 1820th of the month afterwards few seem to adhere to these dates much these days but the aim is to send the data around twice in the following month data comes in code like everything else on the gts so few centres probably handful noaacpc mohc meteofrance dwd roshydromet cma jma and the australians that are doing analyses for weather forecasts have the software to pick out the climat data and put it somewhere at the same time these same centres are taking the synop data off the system and summing it to months producing flags of how much was missing at the mohc they compare the climat message with the monthly calculated averagetotal if they are close they accept the climat some countries dont use the mean of max and min which the synops provide to calculate the mean so it is important to use the climat as this is likely to ensure continuity if they dont agree they check the flags and there needs to be bit of human intervention the figures are examples for this october what often happens is that countries send out the same data for the following month this happens mostly in developing countries as few havent yet got software to produce the climat data in the correct format there is wmo software to produce these from wide variety of possible formats the countries might be using some seem to do this by overwriting the files from the previous month they add in the correct data but then forget to save the revised file canada did this few years ago but they sent the correct data around day later and again the second time after they got told by someone at mohc my guess here is that noaa didnt screw up but that russia did for all countries except russia all data for that country comes out together for russia it comes out in regions well it is big place trying to prove this would need some russian help pasha groisman but there isnt much point the fact that all the affected data were from one russian region suggests to it was that region probably not of much use to an faq cheers phil the global historical climatology network ghcnmonthly data base contains historical temperature precipitation and pressure data for thousands of land stations worldwide the period of record varies from station to station with several thousand extending back to 1950 and several hundred being updated monthly via climat reports the data are available without charge through ncdcs anonymous ftp service both historical and nearrealtime ghcn data undergo rigorous quality assurance reviews these reviews include preprocessing checks on source data time series checks that identify spurious changes in the mean and variance spatial comparisons that verify the accuracy of the climatological mean and the seasonal cycle and neighbor checks that identify outliers from both serial and spatial perspective ghcnmonthly is used operationally by ncdc to monitor longterm trends in temperature and precipitation it has also been employed in several international climate assessments including the intergovernmental panel on climate change 4th assessment report the arctic climate impact assessment and the state of the climate report published annually by the bulletin of the american meteorological society at 1256 17112008 you wrote thanks actually i dont think that many people have any idea how the nwss send out data what data they send out what they dont and how these things are collated perhaps youd like to send some notes on this that i could write up as faq wont change anything much but it would be handy reference gavin on mon 20081117 at 0753 phil jones wrote gavin i may be getting touchy but the ca thread on the hadcrut october 08 data seems full of snidey comments nice to see that they have very little right where have they got the idea that the data each month come from ghcn there are the daily synops and the climat messages nothing to do with ghcn all they have to do is read brohan et 2006 and they can see this and how we merge the land and marine they seem to have idea about the global telecommunications system anyway expecting the proofs of the wengen paper any day now have already sent back loads of updated references and sorted out almost all of the other reference problems when the paper comes out not sure if the holocene do online first happy for you to point out the publication dates date first received etc when they scream that they sorted out that diagram from the first ipcc report dont know how you find the time to do all this responding keep it up cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of
