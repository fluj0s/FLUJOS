exist regarding the fb22s feasability cost and combat potential order code rs21848 june 5 2006 crs report for congress received through the crs web air force fb22 bomber concept christopher bolkcom specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the air force has expressed interest in developing bomber variant of the f22a httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21848 raptor to bridge the gap between todays bombers and followon bomber in 2037 questions exist regarding the fb22s feasability cost and combat potential this report will be updated as events warrant background in 2002 it was reported that lockheed martin corp had begun studying radically modified version of the raptor called the fb22 this variant would seek to significantly increase the f22as airtoground capabilities primarily through redesign that would double the aircrafts range and significantly increase the aircrafts internal payload1 some estimate that the deltawinged fb22 could carry up to 30 of the developmental 250lb small diameter bombs these potential improvements would likely result in some performance tradeoffs such as reduced acceleration speed and maneuverability although not officially part of the f22a program the fb22 idea appeared to gain traction during the first george w bush administration former air force secretary james roche favored the fb22 as the platform of choice for providing better close air support for tomorrows ground forces2 air force leaders have also depicted the fb22 as mediumrange bomber that could serve as bridge between the current bomber force and followon capability to be fielded in the 2037 timeframe in april 2004 the air force issued request for information on resources and technologies that might contribute to regional or interim bomber other officials have reportedly shown less interest in the fb22 former air force acquisition chief marvin sambur said that the f22as developmental difficulties would 1 for more on the f22a see

be solved before the fb22 could be considered3 former dod acquisition chief pete aldridge is reported to have said that there is need for another bomber to serve as an interim longrange strike capability because for the time being its more important to have better munitions than new platform4 further this concept has received little mention during the second george w bush administration and it is unclear whether the idea is still being considered the costs of developing the fb22 are debated some argue that by leveraging the f22a cockpit engines computer systems production methods and materials the fb22 could be produced relatively cheaply others argue that redesigning an aircraft to perform mission it was not originally intended to perform is difficult and usually costly some estimate that developing the airframe alone could cost up to 1 billion5 in july 2003 it was reported that air force officials have discovered that the f22a will likely not be able to carry external fuel tanks without encountering structural problems the fb22 could also encounter similar difficulties6 also some question the attractiveness of medium range bomber with relatively small payload house armed services committee chairman duncan hunter for example commented that it was counterintuitive that as we have lost basing our modernization program has on the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21848 average encompassed acquisition of aircraft with shorter and shorter legs that is almost bombers in fact bombers lots of fighters7 in congressional testimony former secretary roche suggested that up to 150 fb22s could be procured fullrate production could be achieved by fy2011 roche estimates if development funds were committed in fy20048 however funds in the f22a program have yet been devoted to the fb22 nor has money been allocated to the bomber program from other sources consequently potential costs and schedule of the fb22 concept are still quite notional how this multirole aircraft would compete with or conversely complement the f35 joint strike fighter has not yet been determined issues many in congress have promoted more emphasis on long range bombers and have looked unfavorably on air force attempts to divest itself of portions of the b1 and b52 fleets9 some note that the air force has resisted calls to speed up its schedule for 3 bill sweetman smarter bomber popular science

recommends an increase of 958 million to regenerate 10 b1 bombers that the air force had retired p 91 crs3 procuring new longrange bomber and to take steps such as reengining the b52 fleet the fb22 appears to be the only bomber concept that air force leaders have discussed with any enthusiasm some question whether the fb22 is legitimate capability to be explored or if it is an attempt to bolster the f22a program in challenging budgetary environment10 air force leaders counter by saying that the fb22s potential combination of speed survivability range and payload could make it useful platform for attacking timecritical targets which tend to be difficult to attack11 regardless of questions about the fb22s potential cost and feasibility policy makers may examine more closely air force assertions about the utility of the fb22s potential capabilities alternatives to procuring the fb22 exist and are discussed below range various estimates of the fb22s unrefueled combat radius have appeared in the media many say that it will be about twice that of the f22a 500600 statute miles depending on operational assumptions other estimates have ranged from 650 miles to 1800 miles regardless of where the fb22s actual capabilities may fall on this continuum it appears to be clearly different class of aircraft than todays longrange bombers which typically exhibit unrefueled combat radii of 3400 to 4400 miles httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21848 air force leaders say that bombers do not necessarily have to achieve long refueled ranges like the current fleet and that regional ranges would be useful former secretary roche has suggested that unrefueled range is not the most important capability in bomber because with access to aerial refueling aircraft also called tankers almost anything is long range12 mr roche also noted that the majority of air strikes in iraq came from shorterrange fighters and not the bomber fleets13 while mr roches statements above appear factually accurate they may not be as compelling when placed in context aerial refueling can extend the range of shorter ranged aircraft but aerial refueling resources are finite many believe the current aerial refueling fleet to be strained and adding medium range aircraft to the inventory rather than longer range aircraft may stress the system further also while fighter aircraft may have flown more combat sorties than did bomber aircraft in operation iraqi freedom bombers dropped more bombs14 in operation enduring freedom air force bombers flew more sorties than air force fighters and also dropped more bombs15 10 new bomber aerospace daily aug 5 2002 11 john tirpak long arm of the air force air force magazine oct 2002 lorenzo cortes roche looking to next year for nearterm proposals

the jdams thomas hargrove oftdebated bomber gets shot at crs4 additionally long range bombers are less reliant on intheater basing allowing shorter range aircraft such to use the closest bases to theater in baselimited scenarios further long range bombers can often fly combat missions directly from us bases speed air force leaders have also said that the fb22 is an attractive candidate for regional bomber because its speed potentially up to mach 18 would make it effective in attacking moving or timecritical targets mr roche was quoted saying that supersonic bomber is needed to more effectively attack mobile targets particularly as the united states is engaged in prolonged war on global terrorism16 retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen richard myers also stated that speed is critical in attacking rapidly moving targets particularly in counterterrorism operations17 improving the ability to attack timecritical targets will likely require faster targeting however it is not clear that employing faster aircraft is critical part of this process those currently tasked with more effectively attacking timecritical targets are focusing their efforts on improving intelligence sensors communications and decision making processes18 retired air force chief gen john jumper hoped that these improvements can shorten the targeting cycle to 10 minutes or less improvements to decision making httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21848 appear to be particularly promising officials report that they achieved 50 to 100 percent improvement in hitting time sensitive targets from operations in afghanistan and those in iraq simply by more effectively delegating targeting authority19 in recent operations in afghanistan and iraq timecritical targets were frequently destroyed not by fast moving aircraft but aircraft that were slowly loitering over the battlefield such as b52s and predator uavs many analysts have posited that the ability to loiter for long periods of time over battlefield thus being available to quickly drop weapon once timecritical target is identified appears to have proven more valuable than the aircrafts speed in attacking these kinds of targets20 long loiter time is direct function of long range fast medium range bomber would not be able to loiter for as long as slower long range bomber so it is not clear that an aircraft such as the fb22 would be better suited to attack timecritical targets than existing aircraft payload the fb22 is projected to carry up to 30 250lb small diameter bombs sdbs which are still in development air force officials say this is substantial improvement over the f22as projected payload of eight sdbs and make it an attractive regional bomber while 30 sdbs may compare favorably with the f22as capability it appears insubstantial compared to the 320 sdbs that the b2 is projected to carry saddam scripps howard news source apr 8 2003 16 vago muradian f22 may be modified as speedy new medium bomber to strike

afghanistan to iraq inside the air force june 20 2003 20 frank wolf navy fy03 budget likely to emphasize ssgn csba says defense daily jan 31 2002 crs5 coupled with shorter unrefueled combat radius than todays bombers the fb22s smaller payload makes it appear decidedly less capable of loitering over battlefields and attacking emerging targets than the b1 b2 or b52 in the wake of recent conflicts in afghanistan and iraq air force leaders specifically pointed to the large payloads of precision guided munitions pgms that bombers carried as distinct leverage point in the wars for example one air force general remarked the fact that you can dynamically retarget precision ordnance and employ it in mass emphasis added from bombers is very very significant shift in force effectiveness21 bomber that can carry only 30 250lb bombs may not offer the same significant shift in warfare capabilities additionally longrange bombers are capable of carrying wide variety of weapons the b52 for instance can carry every munition in the air forces inventory it is not clear if the fb22 would be able to drop munitions other than the sdb survivability air force officials say that the fb22s speed maneuverability and stealth make it an attractive medium range bomber because these characteristics will ensure its survivability in hostile environments it is not clear however that substantial and costly efforts need to be taken to further ensure combat aircraft survivability since httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21848 operation desert storm 1991 the services have flown over 400000 combat sorties and lost only 39 combat aircraft survival rate of 9999 percent22 none of these lost aircraft were bombers while it may be that tomorrows adversaries are more threatening to the bomber force than yesterdays adversaries they may also be even less threatening it is also not clear that it is worth the cost to invest in increased survivability for aircraft that are already very survivable further employing standoff munitions such as airlaunched cruise missiles may be more costeffective means of increasing bomber survivability than the methods speed and stealth inherent in the fb22 potential alternatives if policy makers seek alternatives to procuring the fb22 or other medium range bombers it appears that several options could be considered the first option would be to accelerate new long range bomber development23 many policy makers both inside and outside of congress have encouraged the air force to more quickly deploy followon to the b1 b2 and b52 rather than wait for the 2030 time frame as one example representative mac thornberry challenged the air force for not pursuing new long range bomber there is just very little if any work going on to think about designs for followup bomber arent we being shortsighted in not pursuing platforms which have that global strike range24 second option would be to augment todays bomber force increased application of weaponized unmanned aerial vehicles uavs25 uavs enjoy attributes that lend themselves to attacking timecritical targets such as long loiter times being unmanned and low cost also makes uavs appropriate for use in high risk environments the 21 john tirpak long arm of the air force air force magazine oct 2002 22 see crs report rs21141 military suppression of enemy air defenses sead 23 see crs report rl31544 long range bombers background and issues for congress 24 fdch political transcripts op cit 25 see crs report rl31872 unmanned aerial vehicles background and issues for congress crs6 predator uav for example has already demonstrated its ability to destroy timecritical targets during the recent conflict in afghanistan new and more advanced projects indicate that the services see value in fielding armed uavs the army has weaponized the hunter uav and is pursuing several armed unmanned aircraft concepts26 the air force and the navy are developing longrange unmanned combat air vehicle ucav which has already dropped pgms in tests27 third option might be to procure more b2 stealth bombers this idea emerged in 2001 when northrop grumman made an unsolicited proposal to build 40 more b2 bombers for approximately 545 million per plane about one fourth the unit cost of the existing 21 aircraft28 this proposal has proven controversial with several members of congress in favor and many dod officials opposed proponents tend to emphasize the b2s powerful combination of stealth long range and large payload coupled with the opportunity to acquire them for half price opponents say that the b2 is 1980s technology and very expensive to maintain29 fourth option would be to develop bomber based on commercial aircraft fb22 opponents argue that its attributes of speed and stealth are not required instead they say httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21848 bomber requirements would be better satisfied by converting large commercial aircraft to carry very large weapons payloads to long ranges and conduct strikes in permissive threat environments standoff munitions could be used in high threat areas fb22 proponents stand by their opinions that speed and stealth are needed and also argue that b52s can already satisfy the bombing requirement in benign environments fifth option may be to increase resources for and reliance on navy strike aircraft if increased quickresponse bombing capability is required out to medium ranges increasing the number and capabilities of navy aircraft operating from carriers may be an attractive approach the naval variant of the joint strike fighter is already projected to have range of almost 700 statute miles and increased payloads may be feasible proponents of this approach could argue opponents could argue that an fb35 could not be developed on the same timetable as the fb22 and the navy has not yet shown any interest in such concept although questions remain about the fb22s cost feasibility and requirements supporters and opponents would likely agree that modifications to existing aircraft even major modifications are not uncommon historically the air force has modified the b 52 to conduct precise closeairsupport missions using gpsguided and laserguided weapons function likely never envisioned by the bombers manufacturer 26 stephen trimble viper set to strike with us armys hunter uavs flight international mar 22 2004 27 boeing x45a makes
