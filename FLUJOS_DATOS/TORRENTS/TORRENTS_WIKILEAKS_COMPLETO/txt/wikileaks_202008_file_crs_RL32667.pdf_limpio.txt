current status and legal issues background and introduction the united states possesses unique paleont ological fossil legacy it is one of the few countries in the world to posse ss fossilized remains of several species of dinosaurs and rich fossil repositories of an cient plants and other animals also exist1 americas paleontological resources are great heritage and the management of these resources is significant responsibility fossils are elements of the human envir onment although they are not crucial to existence like water and air they ffer intangible gifts to imagination and curiosity in the same ways that art and music enrich our lives they remind us who we are and how we might have come to be unlike archaeology which seems near and familiar because we are studying ourselves paleontology offers pilgrimage to deep time it lets us study what natural systems were like before human influence2 large tracts of land under federal management3 possess valuable fossil

fossils on federal and indian lands interior report4 which outlined the scientific cultural and historical value of americas fossil resources this report remains the definitive source and authority concerning the management of fossils located on federal lands5 currently there is only limited and scattered authority for federal management and protection of fossil re sources on federal lands6 indeed the existing federal statute that broadly protects archaeological resources the archaeological resources protection act of 1979 arpa7 specifically excludes fossil resources from the scope of its coverage unless the fossil is an integral part of the human archaeological resource or site8 and while other federa l laws may provide some protection for fossil resources there is uniform and comprehe nsive legislation for their regulation as there is comprehensive mana gement andor protection gislation the role of law enforcement personnel in the protection of fo ssils often is not clearly defined also for various reasons the availability of law enforcement pe rsonnel may be limited nor has consistent and dispositive body of caselaw developed concerning the regulation and control of fo ssil resources located on federal property the extant cases do not necessarily provide clear cas precedent in part because the few cases have tended to be subject specific and ar not necessarily app licable to broader protection regulati on management and marketing issues9 efforts have been undertaken in the past several years to enact laws to manage and protect paleontological resources on federal lands10 these legislative efforts continue in the 108th congress on july 17 2003 the senate passed s 546 the paleontological resources preservati on act the bill would permit

not emerged from committee the concept of paleontological resource and other related terms the absence of uniform regime to regulate paleontological resources on federal lands is evidenced in the abse nce in federal law of precise uniform definitions of key terms various federal regulations and administrative guidelines do define paleontological resource within certain specific contexts the following discussion demonstrates the varied definitions among different federal entities in forest service regulations for instan ce specific definition is provided paleontological resource means any evidence of fossilized remains of multicellular invertebrate and vertebra animals and multicellular plants including imprints thereof organic re mains primarily collected for use as fuel such as coal and oil are paleontologic resources but are excluded from the prohibition under the rule14 in addition specific federal regulatory finition for paleontolog ical resources has been promulgated by the forest service for the management of the hells canyon national recreation area this definition differs from the forest services general definition in that it is mu ch broader in scope paleontological resources means any remains trace or imprint of plant or animal that has been preserved in the earths crust prior to the holocene epoch15 holocene epoch is not defined by the regulation the management handbook of the national park service sets out definition for such resources paleontologicalpaleoecological resources resources such as fossilized plants animals or their traces includi ng both organic and mineralized remains in body or trace form paleontological resources are studied and managed in their paleoecological context that is the geologic data associated with the fossil that provides information about the ancient environment16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32667crs4 17 interior report at 38 18 43 cfr 822405 the term traces pr obably does not mean imprints and might mean bits or pieces of the ancient creature the meaning of the term seems ambiguous 19 the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra does not specifically include or exclude paleontological resources nagpra gives specific definitions to cultural items 25 usc 30013 and other terms such as associated funerary objects 25 usc 30013b it would appear that for nagpra to be applicable to paleontological object the obj ect would have to be closely associated with funerary objects or practices sacred objects or the cultural patrimony of particular group of people 20 implementing regulations are located at 43 c fr part 7 department of interior 36 cfr 296 department of agriculture nd 32 cfr 229 department of defense 21 for example specific definition exists with in the context of the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra25 usc 30015 22 this concept of federal lands is utilized in the pending paleontological protection legislation s 546 108th cong 23 2003 hr 2416 108th cong 43 2003the interior report while not defining the term paleontological resources defines paleontology as science dealin g with the life of past geological periods as known from fossil remains17 likewise there also does not appear to be uniform definition for the term fossil within the context of the bureau of land managements recreation program definition is provided for the excl usive use of fossil resources at the fossil forest research natural area in new mexico it should be noted that this definition specifically excludes certain energy minerals such as coal and oil b fossil means the remains or traces of an organism or assemblage of organisms which have been preserved by natural processes in the earths crust the term does not mean energy minerals such as coal oil and gas oil shale bitumen lignite asphaltum and tar sands even though they are of biologic origin18 as noted above federal statutes and re gulations may distinguish paleontological resources from archaeological res ources andor cultural resources19 arpa provides very specific definition for the term archaeological resource and specifically excludes paleontological resources from th definition nonfossilized and fossilized paleontological specimens or any portion or piece thereof shall not be considered archaeological resources under the regulations under this paragraph20 the term federal

concerning fossil resource occurs on nps lands90 if an unauthorized person is found removing or otherwise handling pr otected fossil resources the nps law enforcement personnel make report of the incident incident report which is forwarded to the park superintendent the incident report is then forwarded to the appropriate us attorneys office at this point the us attorney makes the decision often in consultation with the pa rk superintendent nd park personnel to issue citation impose fine br ing civil action for damages91 andor seek criminal prosecution factors which may be taken into consideration in determining the appropriate penalties include value of the resources damage to the resources prior offenses use of heavy andor power tools and the caseload of the us attorney the circumstances surrounding each incident are reviewed upon casebycase basis on many occasions civil citation with monetary fine is issued to the offender in other cases the us attorney may c hoose to bring criminal action against the alleged offender one option may be to prosecute under 36 cfr 21 which deals with the preservation of natural cultura l and archaeological resources on national park lands as previously stated this regulation specifically prohibits 1 possessing destroying injuring defacing removing digging or disturbing from its natural state httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32667crs14 92 36 cfr 21a1iii 93 such an action was pursued in united states v jones 607 f2d 269 9th cir 1979 94 16 usc 19jj to 19jj4 it does not appear that there is specific precedent in applying these provisions to the recovery of damage to fossil resources 95 16 usc 19jj2iii nonfossilized and fossilized paleontological specimens cultural or archeological resources or the parts thereof92 another enforcement option is provided under the general property theft statute 18 usc 461 46293 it also appears that civil action may be brought in the appropriate us district court by the us attorneys office u nder the national park system resource protection act94 against persons who may be lia ble for damage to nps property95 an action for general trespass under stat law might be possible under certain circumstances however state law may not apply to all nps lands and state trespass laws vary applicability depends upon the f actual circumstances of the incident the nps lands involved and the ppropriate state trespass law as many of these prosecutions and civil actions do not have formal written opinions or are otherwise settled through payment of fine or other settlement mechanism it is difficult to formulate comprehensive overview of the success or failure of the prosecutions which have been brought against persons who have damaged andor remove d paleontological objects from nps property conclusion there is uniform guidance on managing paleontological resources on federal lands penalty provisions and their forcement also vary among management agencies these problems have led the department of the interior and some members to look more closel at adopting legislation th at would provide for the uniform management and prot ection of paleontological resources on federal lands such legislation is currently pending
