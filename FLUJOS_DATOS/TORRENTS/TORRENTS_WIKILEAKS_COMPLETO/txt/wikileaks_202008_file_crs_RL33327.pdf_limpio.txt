departments existence as currently organized usdas agricultural research service ars is the inhouse scientific research agency the economic research service ers analyzes statistical indicators in all agricultural issue areas in order to support public and private decisionmaking the national agricultural statistics service nass which has field offices in most states and us territories collects and analyzes broad range of data and ad ministers the us census of agriculture the cooperative state research education and extension service csrees is the agency that channels portion of annua l usda appropriations to states and us territories to support higher education pr ograms in agriculture state and regional research and continuing agricultural education and outreach to the public when adjusted for inflation appropriations fo r agricultural research education and extension have mostly rema ined level since the 1970s agricultural research educa tion and extension at the fe deral and state levels are supported through combination of direct appropriations to ars ers and nass and block grants to states competitive grants and congressionally designated grants all administered by csrees althoug h these funding mechanisms are widely acknowledged to have served agriculture we ll the larger scientific community has consistently argued that greater pr oportion of usda resear ch funding should be distributed through the competitive pee rreviewed grant process the national academy of sciences nas maintains that competitive grants reach large pool of talented scientists and s timulate new research in high priority areas recent administration proposals to redirect funds to competitive grants from the blockgrant funded programs in the absence of new m oney have drawn vi gorous criticism from the colleges of agriculture in the states and congress has not adopted them the house and senate agriculture committees passed legislati on in 1998 intended to capture new funds for competitive grants from the mandatory side of the usda budget the appropriations committees however have consistently prohibited those funds from being used to support the compe titive grants program for which they were intended under potential consideration in the ex pected farm bill debate in 2007 is usda task force recommendation from 2004 to establish an independent competitive grantawarding national institu for food and agriculture within the department supported with new money in the current prefarm bill period international trade issues nd pressure for change in domestic farm support policies are causing many observers and policymak ers to suggest that usda should explore ways to support broader range of us pr oducers than it currently does some have argued that usda

mechanical arts the morrill act of 1862 gave grant of federal land to each state and directed the state to sell the land and use the proceeds to establish college of agricu lture in many states the original 1862 school became the foundation for the state university growing to include wide range of academic disciplines including agriculture these large institutions sometimes are referred to as land grant universities but usda funding and programs pertain only to the colleges of agriculture within themthe state partners are the colleges of agriculture at land grant universities in 50 states and eight us territories with their affiliated state agricultural experiment stations schools of forestry and veteri nary medicine and cooperative extension1 there also are 18 historically black nd grant colleges of agriculture the 1890 institutions and 31 native american college s that gained land grant status in 1994 referred to as the tribal colleges agricultural research education and exte nsion have played critical roles in the huge increase in us agricultural productivity since world war ii scientific basis for crop livestock and food production practices existed at the beginning of

among other things since 1977 congress periodically has made changes to the several permanent statutes authorizing research education and extensi on programs in one title of an omnibus multiyear farm

title 7 of pl 107171 along with the other rela ted statutes the house and senate agriculture committees are primarily res ponsible for oversight of agricultural research education nd extension programs appropriations history shapes policy issues when adjusted for inflation funding for agricultural research has been relatively flat with slight increase since the late 1990s the slow growth in real funding is further constrained by the need to devot substantial portion of appropriations to maintenance res earch necessary to maintain crop and livestock productivity levels in the face of newly resistant pests emerging crop and livestock diseases and changing environmental factors and by generally higher than average inflation in the cost of new hightech quipment for research advances3

the national institutes of h ealth and the national scien ce foundation in particular funds from private industry for saes resear ch also have been steadily increasing publicprivate collabor ations facilitate tec hnology transfer and at the same time help to supplement federal and state support however some observers are concerned that both the increase in private fundi ng and the increase in nonusda agency funding could cause the focus of public res earch to shift away from truly agricultural priorities such shift could hamper the nations ability to be preeminent in innovation and to cope with challenges over the long term observers say5 the house and senate agriculture co mmittees have focused recent research policy reforms on 1 increasing the financia l contributions of existing federal and state sources 2 finding new sources of funding 3 assuring that research supports national and stakeholders pr iorities and 4 improving access to information about projects and outcomes the most activ debates however generally occur around congressional action on the nnual appropriations acts when authorized reforms administration initiatives and constituent considerations combine to shape the actual operation of the agricultural research ex tension and teaching network for the next year most recent legislative activity congress traditionally considers resear ch education and extension policy reforms and extends program funding author ities in periodic omnibus farm bills that cover virtually all usda prog rams and policies in the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 and subsequently

appropriations have exceeded the 100 matching point for both research and extension the change in statutor language was made to simplify and equalize matching requirements for the 1862 land grant institutions in part because the act also initiated matching fund requirement in the states having 1890 historically black land grant schools usda grants to the tribally controlled institutions are exempt from matching requirements 7 communication from csrees november 2005and senate agriculture committees focused in particular on federal agricultural research education and extension po licies the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 reauthorized the research education nd extension provisions of the 1996 and 1998 laws through fy2007 and contai ned some further revisions 2002 farm bill accountability the 2002 farm bill continued policies set in the 1996 and 1998 laws that are intended to increase th input of stakeholders into decisions concerning how federal and st ate research education and extension dollars are spent these included provisions requiring ars to 1 establish prioritysetting process for its research agenda that includes input from wide range of stakeholders and 2 establish procedure to ve ars scientists research projects regularly peer reviewed by panels of mostly nonars scientific experts with regard to statelevel cooperators the 2002 farm bill required 1 similar effort on stakeholder input 2 peer or merit review of re search extension or educati on grants supported by federal money and 3 an annual plan of work on which each states entitlement to receive federal funds is based the law also re quired the 1890 historically black land grant schools to fulfill these responsibilities funding the 2002 farm bill extended provision from the 1998 law requiring states to match 100 of federal funds under the tw statutes that authorize federal funds for statelevel research nd extension the hatc h act of 1887 and the smithlever act of 1914 previously 90 match of only portion of the federal grants was required6 the 2002 farm bill reauthorized stat matching requirement for 1890 schools which was established by the 1998 law th requirement was revised to increase by 10 each year reaching 100 in fy2007 in addition the farm bill authorized minimum appropriations levels for the formula funds supporting research and extension programs at the historically bl ack land grant schools expressing them as percentages of formula funds appropriated for research and extension at the 1862 schools the minimum appropriation for 1890s extension in any year is set at 15 of appropriated smithlever act formul funds for that year and the minimum appropriation for 1890s research is set at 25 of appropriate d hatch act formula funds appropriations to date have not met those minimum levels remaining at about 11 and 20 for 1890s extension and research programs respectively7 the 2002 farm bill also contained sen of congress provision calling for agricultural

mandatory funds was authorized in the1996 farm bill pl 104127 congress authorized the use of 100 million annually in us treasury funds to support rural development and related research under fund for rural america in most years until the program authority xpired in 2002 appropriators prohibited some or all of the annual transfers from the us treasury to be used to carry out the activities of the fund for rural america 11 scientific research generally is broken dow n into two categories basic or fundamental and applied basic research in agriculture is that which explores th biological chemical and genetic factors underlying plants and an imals with the aim of obtaining knowledge without any direct application in mind the scientific community and policymakers generally consider this type of research cruc ial for the nation to remain in the technological forefront and be prepared for future needs nd emergencies applied research as the name implies explores the realworld applica tions of science for potential commercial usemaintain the scientific ba on which food and agricu ltural advances are made8 this provision expresses the importance that congress places on increasing funding for agricultural research but does not provi any authority for appropriations for that purpose research appropriations in the 20022006 period have not doubled the search for new money the most significant provision in the 1998 act was the establishment of fiveyear 600 million initiative for future food and agriculture systems ifafs competitiv grants program supported by mandatory funds made available from the commod ity credit corporation instead of by appropriated funds9 the provision was significant in that it represented only the second time that congress authorized ma ndatory funds for programs traditionally supported with discretionary annually appropr iated money10 congress reauthorized the initiative in th 2002 farm bill raising its authorized funding level from the original 120 million annually to 140 million in fy2004 160 million in fy 2005 and 200 million annually thereaf ter ifafs is intended to promote cuttingedge basic research in the areas of genomics biotechnology resource conservation and f ood safety among others11 usda awarded grants under the initiative in fy2000 and fy2001 in fy1999 and every year since fy2002 appropriators have prohibited ccc funds from being spent on the initiative except to service existing grants until they end usda research administration different from the standard variety of funding mechanisms direct appropriations and formula funds usda differs from other federal research agencies in allocatin g the majority of its annual research appropriation directly to in house research ars ers and nass most federal science agencies primarily fund research extramurally through competitive peer reviewed grant process httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33327crs7 nonetheless it is widely acknowledged in the agricultural community that intramural research has an important role to play federallevel research is best able to take on higherrisk and longterm proj ects of national importance like deciphering plant and animal genomes

mission areas and nass administers and analyzes the results of the nationwide us census of agriculture which is conducted every five years census data are cr itical to usda program planners governmental and nongovernmental policym akers and lawmakers the primary and longeststanding m echanisms for distributing the annual appropriation for cooperative re search and extension to the college of agriculture at each states land grant university are the hatch act and smithlever act formulas see box below additional funding for c ooperative state research comes from state appropriations competitive grants from usda and other federal agencies and private industry formula funds federal funding for research at the st ate agricultural experiment stations is authorized under the hatch act of 1887 which congress amended in 1955 to include formula that distributes the federal appropr iation among states based on each states farm and rural population as determined by the decennial us census the hatch act as amended also requires dollarfordollar matching funds from state appropriations most states however appropriate three to four times the federal allotment another provision in the act as amended by the agricultura l research extension and education reform act of 1998 pl 105185 requires each stat to use 25 of its hatch act funds to support multistate or regional research increased from 20 the level set in 1955 congress reauthorized the higher percentage through 2007 in the 2002 farm bill using censusbased formula to calculate the annual distribution of research funds to each state has meant that the state alloca tions have been quite constant from year to year since annual appropriations have remained level or increased slightly although all federal sources account for 30 or less of total funding for the experiment stations including grants from nonresearch agen cies within usda and from other federal departments the reliability of the formula f unds have resulted in their traditionally being used to support the core ongoing research pr ograms of the state agricultural experiment stations the latter in turn underpin the universities academic programs formula funds are similar to block grants and the sc ope and content of the programs they support are under the control of the research deans at the colleges of agriculture federal funding for cooperative extension in the states is distributed under formula similar to the hatch act formula and censusbased in the smithlever act of 1914 as amended state appropriations generally ex ceed the 100 matching funds requirement federal funding supporting forestry and veterinary programs at the land grant institutions also is distributed among the institutions ac cording to formulas but these have different criteria than the hatch act and smithlever act formulashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33327crs8 12 it should be noted that although the major ity of nih funding is competitively awarded

for fy2006 divided by total f unding for ars and csrees for fy2006one of the most controversial additiona l sources of funding for ars and the land grant agriculture schools is earmarked gr ants in annual appropriations acts for fy2006 congress appropriate d 109 million for 67 specific ars research projects at various labs across the nation and 181 million for 294 designated research and extension projects at various land grant institutions congressionally designated grants typically do not receive any type of formal review before they are awarded however in response to repeated criticism that such funds could be supporting weak or unnecessa ry research csrees many years ago developed an internal mer it review process that research projects must undergo before the funds will be released mer it reviews may result in improvements being made to the project in research methodol ogy for example before the funding is transferred to the designated institution controversy over earmarked appropriations arises every year each annual budget request proposes eliminating the designated grants under both ars and csrees stating that they deflect money away from higherpriority research in the national interest s upporters of such grants counter that members are most qualified to know what research is most important to their districts and to make sure those local needs are not ignored in the larger re search picture continued static funding for agricultural research overall is likely only to perpetuate this controversy competitive grants in contrast to usdas research nd extension funding mechanisms the governments two largest science agenci the national science foundation nsf and the national institutes of health n ih allocate the majority of their appropriations through competitively awarded grants to scientists in variety of research venues nationwide12 the national academy of sciences nas has recommended for more than decade that at least 35 of total usda research money be distributed competitively13 when the nas first made its recommendation in 1989 it determined that less than 6 of usda s research funding was competitively awarded in fy2006 it is approximately 14 according to crs calculations14 national research initiative following publication of the 1989 nas report the 101st congress significantly expanded usdas existing competitive research

million in fy2006 the nas reviewed the nri program tw ice in 1994 and 2000 the more recent report concluded that due to insufficien t funding the nri has not lived up to its mission to support highpriority fundamental research of importance to the sciences relevant to agriculture food and the envir onment the nas argued that in order to operate the program with insufficient f unding usda awards grants that are too small and too short to elicit the highestquality researc h in addition the report cited the statutory limit on overhead reimbursement that congress set originally 14 and currently 19 less than half of the average overhead rates for nsf grants for biology research 45 the nas expresses concern that such mandated cap may have negative effect on the nri program because it causes some ins titutions especially those from outside the traditional applicant community to discourage their researchers from submitting proposals15 proposal for national institute for food and agriculture among the recommendations in the nas 2000 report was one to create new separate grantmaking agency within usda and put it in charge of administering the nri and other competitively awarded programs in research and extension this agency would be headed by nonusda scientist who would be advised by an extramural board subsequently in th 2002 farm bill cong ress authorized usda to create task force to prepare report examining the merits of establishing national institutes in one or more of the agri cultural sciences the fy2003 emergency supplemental appropriation act pl 10811

consequences of rd growth in agriculture and sust ain the federalstate partnership18 the report argued specifically against redirecting f unds from ars or the hatch and smithlever acts redirection of funding would unde rmine not only the systems capacity for innovation but also continuing effort s to strengthen its research capab ilities redirection runs the risk of destroying some of the muscle of quality research in intramural and formulafunded research while attempting to cut out any fat19 recent budget proposals the bush administration has shown support for increasing the proportion of competitive gr ants in agricultural research given current budget constraints it has sought to do so by redirecting funds from elsewhere in the research budget in the presidents budget request for

nri increase and the new grant program if appropriated would have constituted 14 increase in federa l funding for state research over the previous year at the state level howev er the proposal had it been adopted would have represented 50 cut in funding fo r core programs any additional funds the universities received from competitive grants would be awarded by external peer review panels rather than at the direction of state research dir ectors would be linked to specific research projects and likely would vary considerably over time this would constitute significant change not only in the administration of core programs but also in the ability of research deans to set the scope and content of their institutions research response to the fy2006 proposal from th national association of state universities and land grant colleges nasulgc the umbrella policymaking organization for the land grant system was unequivocal nasulgc opposes the presidents proposal to eliminate progra ms that provide ssential base funding for research at america s land grant universities21 congress did not adopt the administrations proposal in the fina l fy2006 appropriations act pl 10997 the administrations budget request for fy2007 takes somewhat different approach it proposes to increase the percentage of formula funds supporting multi state research projects from the current 25 to roughly 55 twenty percent of that pool would continue to support multistate or regional researc h and 35 would be redirected to competitively awarded national projects to be administered under the nri this proposal if adopted would re sult in about onethird decrease in the level of federal support for the core re search programs compared to the 50 decrease proposed in the fy2006 budget the administration also proposes to reduce the funding for integrated programs joint research and extension programs that congress authorized in 1998 by tran sferring several of the existing programs and their funding into the nri program since integrated programs and the percentage of hatch act funds going to regional research are authorized through 2007 by the 2002 farm bill it seems unlikel that house and senate appropriators will adopt the presidents pr oposal based on congresss ac tions in previous years looking ahead the 2007 farm bill the larger context several factors have emer ged since 2002 that could influence the consideration of research teaching and extension policies when agricultural policy is next considered in the context of an omnibus farm bill most likely in
