bridge publications inc newsletter date going into competition with the mest universe the essential difference between your own universe and the other fellows universe and the mest universe is that youre making yours and that part of it which youre doing good job on is the mest universe and that part of it which youre doing lousy job on you see is your own universe and then you try to go into competition with mest oh how can you go into competition with you youll only be on two sides of the chessboard as soon as person starts to go into real arduous competition with mest he goes into real arduous competition with himself of course and so hes defeating himself all the time because the best thing hes doing is the mest universe and the worst thing hes doing is what hes calling still his its just problem in automaticity l ron hubbard excerpted from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lecture series the phenomena of exteriorization an article by l ron hubbard from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lectures i could give you lot of material on this subject in fact we could probably talk for couple of hundred hours just on variuos ways people got exteriorized the essential method of exteriorization the method which you must have and use if you expect success in exteriorizing somebody is to know the elements of what you are exteriorizing and predict its behavior under certain conditionsthe various conditions you encounter now if you know of what it is capable you will then know very well how to get it out of one place and into another place this is simplicity true but its something that you might overlook if you know how thetan operates behaves of what he is capable you then will be able to use these capabilities in order to exteriorize him you are all too prone to suppose that because thetan finds himself in the middle of body he then does not have the same characteristics as he would have far from body this is brought about with some justification for thetan when trying to operate in the middle of the body is operating straight up against his own ridges very often and in operating against those finds it very difficult to exteriorize do you see that every time he tries to do something he activates something which he has already deposited in the body and he now becomes the effect of what he has caused and thus you stir up too many ridges inside the body and the thetan is apparently less capable than before the answer to this is the validation of mest barriers and the invalidation of the thetans own barriers well his inability to exteriorize is made difficult by the fact that he has too largely validated those barriers in which he finds himself enmeshed hes too greatly validated his own thought processes his thinkingness processes as he conceives them his own facsimiles and other material and he is in contact with these and the other part of the problem is he is frightened of mest hes rather frightened of it once in while you will exteriorize thetan and he will try to steady himself by putting beam on the wall and the wall will eat up the beam the beam you see is verytoo close to the wavelength of that wall and thehell stick and sometimes youll exteriorize somebody and youll exteriorize him as body you know and then you dont exteriorize him from the body he exteriorized in we justyou see whats happening there i mean heshe has something you might call theta body well its very silly for him to have this its not something he sends aroundhes in it but he can exteriorize out of that one its built out of slightly less heavy effort on different anchor point system than the mest body now he can exteriorize out of that exactly as he exteriorizes out of mest body because he is essentially just sourcepoint for energy and if he locates himself as point he is very small very small if he locates himself as point well now in trying to agree with the body hell eventually mock himself up as body this is not true hes small spot of light you might say and he will get out in one of these quote theta bodies unquote and lay his handyou know theta body hand it operates just like mest body handand hell lay his hand on the wall or on the back of chair or into the upholstery or something of this sort and he will go right on in see itll grab hold of him and boy he doesnt want anything to do with that oh hell try to pull freenever occurs to him to just drop the hand which is caught and mock up new hand this doesnt occur to him and he becomes very frightened and will dive back in generally the theta body that they exteriorize in are simply mass of effort ridges which have accumulated on the mest body which they cant get rid of so they drag along with them which is different thing thats other energy theyre dragging with them well one of these that could almost make his own body will exteriorize with some sort of hand or something of the sort which has long electronic beams on it all of which are vibrating and he has you might say an electrical metabolism which would fascinate an engineer just fascinate him because hes an electronic machine hes rigged up so that his energy performs certain exact functions and you generally have four or five stringers on aon the end of his arm you see in lieu of hand which is almost handtheres just three four five stringers all of which are in very strong vibration this is tough boy this is tough boy you very often have trouble exteriorizing him because hes real rough hes real tough what hes used that hand for in possibly relatively recent times is the simple act of decapitation just one backward flip of the hand and mest bodys head would come off thats all see of course they have sort of humor about their roughness i ran into one one time that had beautiful tail this solid black sort of furry with beautiful tail and cats face and long electronicthis sounds like something out of nightmare i knowand long electronic claws and i asked this character few questions one way or the otheri mean i exteriorized him just that way you see exteriorized him in his bodyand i asked him to knock piece of paper off the desk and he simply reached over and he knocked the piece of paper all right but he also charred it and he reached around moment later and took hold of the sofa and stuck to it he couldnt get his hand free instantly startled him and he did an immediate flip back into the body but he was quite visible to mest eyes it was like dark shadow standing in the room if you can imagine shadow quite plain shadow standing upright in the room with quite bright set of streamers coming out of its hands youd have this this is very very strange this fellow by the way was quite afraid of demons and hed mocked hishe had mocked himself up this way because for many centuries he had fought demons and of course he went in and mocked up then the winning valence the demons l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture exteriorization from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lectures going into competition with the mest universe the phenomena of exteriorization operate from an ot perspective thetan operates as paradox hes trying to survive when he cant do anything
