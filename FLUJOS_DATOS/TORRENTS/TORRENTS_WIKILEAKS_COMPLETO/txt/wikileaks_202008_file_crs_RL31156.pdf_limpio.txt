summary on may 28 2002 the us supreme cour t handed down its unanimous decision in festo corp v shoketsu kinz oku kogyo kabus hiki co ltd 535 us ___ 122 s ct 1831 152 l ed 2d 944 hereinafter festo reversing the most controversial of the holdings in the case by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc vacating the decision and remanding the case for further proceedings the cafc decision had been criticized as upsetting wellsettled expectations and understandings concerning th operation of certain lega l principles namely the doctrine of equivalent s and prosecution history estoppel the doctrine of equivalents provides that product or process that doe s not literally infringe patent can still be found to be infringing if the differences between the allegedly infringing product or process and the patented invention are minimal and insubstantial that is if the allegedly infringing product or process is substantially equivalent to the patented invention the doctrine of equivalents is limited by prosecution history estoppel prosecution history estoppel provides that as patent applicant surrenders subject matter during prosecution to avoid rejection ie amends claims to narrow them for reasons related to patentability the patentee also surrenders that subject matter for purposes of any infringement suit based on th doctrine of equivalents for example an applicant applies to patent plastictop table with metal legs the examiner rejects the claim for metal legs because prior art includes plastictop table with rigid metal legs so the applicant narrows the claim to distinguish it from prior art by amending it to cover plastictop table with collapsible metal legs folding into two parts the patent is granted the patent ee cannot now claim that plastictop table with rigid metal legs is equivalent nd should be found infringing because the patentee surrendered rigid metal legs in th narrowing amendment in the past the cafc had applied flexible bar rule wh ich meant that out of range of possible equivalents eg plastictopped metal legged table that folds differently from the patented table prosecution history est oppel did not necessarily bar finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents for the entire range in festo the cafc established new complete bar rule which meant prosecution history estoppel would completely bar the appli cation of the doctrin of equivalents the supreme court reversed this holding reinstating and affirming the flexible bar rule as the appropriate rule and the one more consistent with the spirit of the doctrine of equivalents at the same time the court affirmed the holding of the cafc that prosecution history estoppel applies to an amendment which narrowed claims in order to satisfy any patent requirement rejecting the petitioners argument that such estoppel only applies to an am endment which narrowed claims to avoid prior art the court remanded the case for further proceedings to decide whether the amendments made by the festo corporati on surrendered the par ticular equivalents at issue in the case under the f lexible bar rule it noted that the concerns of those who desired clearer bright line rule w ith regard to est oppel and equivalents would be best directed to congress which could alter the doctrine legislatively in the wake of its festo decision on june 3 2002 the supreme court granted certiorari in nine patent cases then vacated prior ru lings in those cases and remanded them for further proceedings taking into c onsideration the rules announced in

decision in festo corp v shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co ltd 535 us ___ 122 s ct 1831 152 l ed 2d 944 hereinafter festo reversing the most controversial aspect of the holdings in the decision of the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc vacating the decision and remanding the case for further proceedings last june the court had granted certiorari to consider highly controversial banc opinion issued by the cafc in the festo case this cafc opinion had been criticized as upsetting we llsettled expectations and understandings concerning the operation of certain patent law principl namely the doctrine of equivalents and prosecution hi story estoppel in favor of establishing supposedly clearer rule that would yield greater certain ty about infringement the court held in favor of restoring the flexible approach noting that the policy arguments of those who desired clearer bright line rule with regard to the doctrine of equivalents and prosecution history estoppel would be best addressed to congre ss which could alter the doctrine legislatively background the patent application process is comm only referred to as patent prosecution generally this is nonadvers arial process wherein the pa tent applicant submits the application consisting of specifications nd claims delineating and describing the invention and engages in dialogue with th patent examiner to further clarify and distinguish the invention from the prior art which consists of existing inventions consequently it is common for patent applicant to amend the application to satisfy objections and questions raised by the exa miner the applicant must provide in the specifications disclosure of the invention which is in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the i nventor of carrying out his invention 35 usc 112 in the cl aims the applicant must describe the invention in manner which distinguishe s it as new and nonobvious compared with the prior art and must also describe the utility of the invention1 patent infringement occurs when pe rson uses manufactures sells or imports product or process covered by an unexpired patent without authorization by the patent holder the patent holder typically will sue the alleged infringer seeking tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs2 prevent further unauthorized activities and monetary damages once the patent is established as valid the court will analyze and compare literal language describing the elements of the claims in the patent with the elements of the defendants product or process to determine whether the patent claims completely cover every element of the allegedly infringing pr oduct or process if they do literally cover or read on the product or device then there is literal infringement by the defendant the festo case concerns the application nd interplay of two longstanding principles of patent law the doctrine of equivalents and pros ecution history estoppel also known as file wrapper estoppel th doctrine of equivale nts provides that product or process that does not literally infringe patent can still be found to be infringing if the differences between the allegedly infringing pr oduct or process and the patented invention are minimal and insubstantial that is if the allegedly infringing product or process is substantially equivalent to the patented invention there is equivalents infringement if the ements of an infringing product or process perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result as the elements of the patent claims this doctrine evolved in the federal courts around the midnineteenth century and is generally acknowledged to have been first expressed and applied in us supreme court case in winans v denmead 15 how 330 14 l ed 717 1853 the doctrine seeks to balance the right of patent holder to just and fair sc ope of protection with the ri ght of the public and potential competitors to know the scope of the patent protection granted to the patent holder potential competitors must know with fair certainty the limits of the patent grant in order to be able to innovate and design around the patent to avoid infringement the patent policy seeks to encourage further genuine innovation in given industry at the same time patent holders merit protection from competitors who attempt to design around patent with minor changes to elements of an invention covered by patent the doctrine of equivalents is limite d by prosecution history estoppel prosecution history estoppel provides that if patent applicant surrenders subject matter during prosecution to avoid rejection ie amends claims to narrow them for reasons of subject matter patentability th patentee cannot later claim that this surrendered subject matter is equivalent to surviving claims in the patent for example an applicant applies to patent plastictop table with metal legs the examiner rejects the claim for metal legs because prior art includes plastictop table with rigid metal legs the applicant then narrows the claim to distinguish it from prior art by amending it to cover plastictop table with collapsible metal legs folding into two parts and the patent is granted the patentee cannot now claim that plastictop table with rigid metal legs is equivalent and shoul d be found infringing because the patentee surrendered rigid metal legs in the narrowing amendment the patent applicant could surrender subject matter by amending claim voluntarily or at the request of the patent examiner additionally the applicant could surrender subject matter by making an argument on the record to answer the concerns of the examiner without actually ame nding the claims before festo the standard for applying both amendmentba sed and argumentbased pr osecution history estoppel was whether person reasonably skilled in the art would reasonably believe that the patentee had surrendered subject matter durin g prosecution this balanced the public notice function of the prosecution history w ith the fair adequate and just scope of patent protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs3 in warnerjenkinson co v hilton davis chemical co 520 us 17 1997 the us supreme court explicitly affirmed the continued vitality of the doctrine of equivalents but established the all elements rule clarifying that the allegedly infringing product or process must be more than equivalent overall to the patented invention rather the doctrine must be applied on an elementbyelement basis equivalence refers to the equivalence of claimed element of patented invention with an element substituted in the llegedly infringing product or process otherwise an overall equiva lence could expand patent beyond its claims in manner which effectively eliminates particular claimed element in the example of the plastic table with collapsible meta l legs folding into two parts assuming estoppel did not apply court could not ju st look at an item that allegedly infringes on the patent for that table for example woodtop table with rigid metal legs and find that overall the woodtop table is equiva lent to the plastic table the court would have to look at each element the w ood top and the rigid metal legs and decide whether the wood top was equivalent to the plastic top the rigid metal legs equivalent to the collapsible metal legs in two parts otherwise court might eventually find that all tables are equivalent to each other since they perform the same function in the same way which would completely eliminate the significance of any distinct element the court further found that prosecution history estoppel was valid defense against infringement but that if patentee could demonstrate that an amendment was made for reason unrelated to patentability court must consider that reason to determine whether estoppel is precluded where the reason for an amendment cannot be determined from the prosecution record rebuttable presumption arises that the reason is related to patentab ility and therefore that estoppe l would apply the burden of proof is on the patentee to rebut the presumption and establish reason unrelated to patentability in warnerjenkinson hilton davis chemical company had applied for patent on an ultrafiltration purification process for dyes during prosecution the original claims were rejected because prior art existed for process operating at ph levels above 90 to distinguis h the invention from prior art h ilton davis amended the application to claim pro cess which operated at ph range of 60 to 90 then warnerjenkinson company deve loped process which operated at ph level of 50 hilton davis ed warnerjenkinson for infringement on the theory that the process operating at ph of 50 was quivalent to the process operating at ph of 60 to 90 because the record did not reveal the reason why hilton davis chemical company had added the lower ph 60 limit to the ph range the court remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether there was reason which might avoid estoppel pe r further discussion below the festo case had previously been granted certiorari vacated and remanded by the supreme court for further consideration in light of warnerjenkinson with regard to the issue of the exte nt to which prosecution history estoppel restricts the doctrine of equi valents one should note the ex istence of two alternative solutions exemplified by two cases one line of cases leading back to hughes aircraft co v united states 717 f2d 1351 fed cir 1983 applies the flexible bar rule under which there is range of equivalents which may be available for claim element not all of which are n ecessarily barred by prosecution history estoppel in the example of the plastict opped table with the co llapsible metal legs folding into two parts literal infringement would require an identical table andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs4 claims of equivalence with regard to plas tictopped tables with rigid metal legs are estopped however plastictopped tables w ith collapsible legs folding into three parts while not literally infringing because each leg is in three parts not two could lie within the range of equivalents because they perform substantially the same function folding up to be easily stored in substantially the same way collapsible metal legs to achieve the same object an table that can be stored in small space the hughes case was the first case concerning this issue which the cafc decided after it was established in 1982 the ot her line of cases leading back to kinzenbaw v deere co 741 f2d 383 fed cir 1984 cert denied 470 us 1004 1984 applies the complete bar rule which provi des that there is range of equivalents the application of the doctrin of equivalents is complete ly barred although this rule provides bright line rule it can have hars h consequences for patentee in the example of the plastictopped table with colla psible metal legs in two parts not only would claims of equivalence for rigid tal legs be estopped but also any other possible range of equivalents such as th collapsible legs in three parts the hughes flexible bar rule has been followed most often over the last twenty years the festo case in the lower courts patents at issue and ea rly procedur history festo corporation had two pa tents the stoll patent and the carroll patent concerning components of conveyer be lt system the stoll patent covered device consisting of cylinder pist on which moved inside the cylinder and included magnets two sealing rings and two guide rings and sleeve which moved outside the cylinder and included magnets nd was made of magnetizable material so that the movement of the piston inside the cylinder caused corresponding movement of the sleeve outside the cylinde r the patent examiner had originally rejected all of the original claims citing failure to satisfy the specification and claims requirements under 35 usc 112 and so citing three patents as pertinent references stoll amended so claims and cancelled othe rs in the application and also cited two patents including arguments with the amendments that the revised claims were distinguishable from the cited patents the amende d language included the description of the sleeve as made of magnetizable material the carroll patent covered device also consisting of piston cylinder and sleeve arrangement carroll had requested r eexamination of the patent to account for prior german patent that was not of reco rd in the original prosecution history and which called into question the patentability of the carroll device the claims were amended to cite pair of sealing rings on the piston engaging the cylinder to effect fluidtight seal and multiple magnets and cushioning parts on the piston the sleeve outside the cylinder of the carroll device also included multiple magnets which magnetically coupled the sleeve to the piston so that they moved together the sleeve also had gripping device mounted on it to m ove objects along conveyor belt festo sued shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki company also known as smc corporation for infringement of the two pate nts the district court granted festohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs5 272 f3d 857 fed cir 1995 3172 f3d 1361 fed cir 1999 4234 f3d 558 fed cir 2000summary judgment of infringement of the ca rroll patent jury concluded that both patents were valid nd found that claim of the sto ll patent was infringed under the doctrine of equivalents the jury found that the nonmagnetizable sleeve and single sealing ring of smc corpor ations device performed substantially the same function in substantially the same way as the magnetizable sleeve and two sealing rings of the stoll patented device on appeal to th cafc the panel affirmed the judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equiva lents of the stoll and carroll patents2 smc petitioned the supreme court for writ of certiorari which the court granted in the meantime the court had decided warnerjenkinson and thus vacated the decision of the cafc in the festo case and remanded it for c onsideration in light of warner jenkinson panel of the cafc affirmed mo st of the earlier judgment again remanding it in part because the prior record was insufficient for the cafc to make determination regarding prosecution hi story estoppel for the stoll patent3 smc corporation petitioned for rehearing banc which the cafc granted the cafc sitting banc reversed holding that prosecution history estoppel completely barred the application of the doctrine of equivalents4 banc decision in the federal circuit opinion of the court the cafc asked the parties to brief the following five questions and by an 84 majority answered them accordingly 1 for the purposes of determining whether an amendment to claim creates prosecution history estoppel is subs tantial reason relate d to patentability limited to those amendments made to overcome prior art under 35 usc 102 and 103 or does patentability mean any reason affecting the issuance of patent substantial reason related to patentability is not limited to amendments made to overcome prior art but includes other reasons related to the statutory requirements for patent thus any am endment narrowing the scope of claim element for any reason related to such requirements will give rise to estoppel with respect to that claim element the cafc does not find this decision to be inconsistent with warnerjenkinson which focused on amendments to avoid prior art but did not limit estoppel to such amendments the rationale underlying prosecution history estoppe l to prevent the patentee from recapturing subject matter previously surrendered during prosecution is valid for amendments made for patentability reasons other than avoiding prior art in the instant case the court found that th narrowing amendments made to the stoll patent to satisfy the requirements of 35 us c 112 were amendments made for substantial reason related to patentab ility the court found thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs6 the amendments made during the reexamination of the carroll patent were made at least partly to avoid th prior art of the german patent 2 under warnerjenkinson should voluntary claim amendment one not required by the examiner or made in res ponse to rejection by an examiner for stated reason create pr osecution history estoppel yes voluntary claim amendments s hould be treated the same as other amendments there is reason why est oppel should arise if patent examiner rejects claim as unpatentable but shoul d not arise if the applicant voluntarily amends claim because he believes it to be unpatentable furthermore this holding is consistent with the doctrine of argumentbased estoppel under which arguments made voluntarily during prosecution may give rise to estoppel if the evidence surrender of subject matter 3 if claim amendment creates prosecution history estoppel under warner jenkinson what range of equivalents if an is available under the doctrine of equivalents for the claim element so amended range of equivalents is available for claim amendment which creates prosecution history estoppel the appli cation of the doctrin of equivalents is completely barred the cour t found that this issue of the range of equivalents available under estoppel had never been before the supreme court and had never been decided by it contrary to th dissent of judge michel it further noted the hughes case and the kinzenbaw case with their competing rules regarding flexible bar and complete bar respectively the court observed that after twenty years of experience with the rangeofequivalents issue it rejected the flexible bar approach as resulting in too much uncertainty about the scope of patent protection to fulfill adequate ly the public notice function of patent claims the flexible bar approach wa s unworkable under the certainty of the complete bar approach competitors of patentee will be more inclined to develop innovative elements of pr oduct or process which otherwise might lie within the uncertain range of equi valent products or processes around the literal terms of narrowed claim free from the fear of infringement litigation 4 when explanation for claim amendm ent is established thus invoking the presumption of prosecution history estoppel under warnerjenkinson what range of equivalents if an is available under the doctr ine of equivalents for the claim element so amended range of equivalents is available fo r unexplained claim amendments under warnerjenkinson an unexplained amendment give s rise to presumption that the reason was related to patentability and thus pr osecution history estoppel applies against the doctrine of equivalents accordingly it results in complete bar just as for narrowing amendments known to be made fo r substantial reasons related to patentability 5 would judgment of infringement in this case violate the all elements rule of warnerjenkinson that is the requirement that the application of the doctrinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs7 of equivalents is not allowed such broad play as to eliminate an element in its entirety this issue went unanswered since th court found that prosecution history estoppel applied completely to bar the doctrine of quivalents it did not reach this issue concurrences and dissents there were two concurring opinions judge plager considered the cafc decision to be secondbest solution to an unsatisfactory situation suggesting that the best solution would be for the court to hold that the doctrine of equivalents is firmly rooted in equity principles and to allow the courts to develop set of known factors to determine when the doctrine of quivalents would apply thus allowing for flexibility within predictable analytical framework judge lourie responded to the proponents of the flexible bar rule noting that it was not working led to uncertainty encouraged clever lawyers to argue infringement outside the scope of claims and discouraged innovation alt hough occasional injustices may result in allowing some copiers to avoid infringement overall the new complete bar rule would encourage innovation lessen uncertainty and reduce litigation there were four opinions concurring in part and dissenting in part basically the dissenters took issue with the courts resolution of issue 3 establishing complete bar bright line rule governin g the application of prosecution history estoppel to the doctrine of equivalents judge michel joined by judge rader believed that the complete bar rule was inconsistent with warnerjenkinson and other supreme court decisions that th courts holding provided guide to infringers allowing them avoid infringement by making trivial modifications to claimed elements which had patentabilityrelated amendments and that the complete bar rule deprives most patentees of recourse to the doc trine of equivalents because most patent claims were ame nded during the prosecution judge rader opined in his dissent that the new rule would completely eliminate patent protection for amended claims with respect to afterarising technology technology which comes into existence after patent is issued and is equivalent to the claimed invention this would be illogical according to judge rade r because prosecution history estoppel is intended to prevent patentee from recapturing subject matter surrendered during prosecution but by definition patentee could not have surre ndered afterarising technology judge linn foresaw an increase in the cost and complexity of patent prosecutions to the detriment of indivi dual inventors and st artup or smaller businesses which do not have the res ources to pursue lengthy expensive prosecutions furthermore there would be an increased undue emphasis on skill in claims drafting like judge michel judge linn believes that the new rule allows unscrupulous copyists free ride by providi ng guide on how to avoid infringement finally judge newman also objected to the complete bar rule as departure from the holdings of warnerjenkinson and as rejection of l ongstanding supreme court and federal circuit precedent without adequate considera tion and debate about the impact of the new rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs8 5brief for petitioner on writ of certiorari at 3945 and brief of amicus curiae american intellectual property law ssociation in support of pe titioner at 13 19 festo corp v shoketsu kinzoku k ogyo kabushiki co 001543 james toupin john whealan effects of festo deci sion on uspto operations feb 28 2001 at httpwwwusptogovwebofficescom advisoryacrobatppacpres201pdfthe us supreme court decision festo corporation petitioned the supreme court for writ of certiorari which was granted on june 18 2001 at 121 s ct 2519 150 l ed 2d 692 2001 docket 001543 in its petition for writ of certiorari festo argued that the decision of the cafc disables the congressional sc heme balancing the pr omotion of creativity with certainty regarding the scope of th patent noting that congress could have enacted laws expanding prosecution histor estoppel and eliminating the doctrine of equivalents if it had wanted to but that it has not done so the court certified two questions whether every claimnarrowing amendment designed to comply with any provision of the patent act including t hose provisions not related to prior art automatically creates prosecution hi story estoppel regardless of the reason for the amendment and whether the finding of prosecution hi story estoppel completely bars the application of the doc trine of equivalents petitioners arguments in its brief on the certified issues festo argued that narrowing amendments triggering prosecution history estoppel are limited to those made to avoid prior art or to satisfy substantive statutory provisions concerning patentability and do not include amendments to satisfy require ments concerning the form of the applications with regard to the complete bar festo argued that the court should adhere to its traditional unde rstanding of the reach of prosecution history estoppel that such estoppel does not completely bar every possible range of equivalents for an amended claim element and that the new rule would complicate patent prosecution and litigation and would injure the patent system festo argued that the cafc decision departed from past precedent when it held that every narrowing amendment to satisfy patent requireme nts gives rise to estoppel and then established its complete bar rule the petitioner alleged that the complete bar on equivalents cast doubt on many currently existing unexpir ed patents that were amended during prosecution when narrowing amendments di d not incur such stringent penalty festo and other critics of the complete bar rule alleged that range of undesirable consequences would arise from it5 including the drafting of narrower claims with increased resort to litigation of doctrine of equivalents issues in infringement suits as means of avoiding narrowing amendments which might give rise to prosecution history estoppelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs9 more arguments to overcome prior art rather than amendments since the complete bar rule appa rently only applies to am endmentbased estoppel not argumentbased estoppel more complex and expensive patent prosecutions disadvantaging smaller companies and individuals more refusals to amend to satisfy claim rejections and thus more frequent appeals of claim rejecti ons which would burden the patent system extend the time before patent issuance and thus reduce the term of patent protection harm to us efforts with respect to international harmonization of patent regimes unfair retroactive application of the complete bar to the approximately 12 million extant patents that were issued prior to the festo decision of the cafc which would disturb wellsettled expectations concerning the operation of prosecution history estoppel to restrict application of the doctrine of equivalents possibly even implica ting the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the us constitution acco rding to at least one commentator more reexamination requests by thirdparties seeking to force amendments giving rise to complete bar to doctrine of equivalents under prosecution history estoppel filing of narrower claims then trying to broaden them later only narrowing claims trigger prosecution history estoppel more provisional applica tions being filed with more precisely drafted applications being filed later and more extensive prior art searches nd better disclosure which may prove beneficial in building the body of pr ior art for business methods patents respondents arguments the respondent argued that the cafc hol ding should be affirmed because the narrowing amendments made by festo we re made to avoid prior art or were unexplained and therefore are presumed under the warnerjenkinson rule to be related to patentability reasons related to patentability were not limited to avoidance of prior art especially ce patent applicant could manipulate the prosecution record by trying to characterize an amendment as merely clarifying an ambiguity rather than narrowing the scope to avoid prior art with regard to the complete bar the respondent argued th at the cafc adopted rule supported in supreme court precedent that any subject matter outside claim language after amendment was automatically considered abandoned the flexible bar was rightly rejected as uncertain unworkable and deterrent to innova tion and competition finally the respondent denies that any cl aim of reasonable reliance that is of disruption of settled expectations regarding the doctrine of equivalents and prosecution history estoppel can defeat the cafc adoption of complete bar notinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs10 6the notion of an unforeseeability standard for determining whether equivalents infringement is barred by prosecution history toppel apparently was advocated in another amicus curiae brief in festo and in matthew j conigliar andrew c greenberg mark lemley foreseeability in patent law 16 berkeley tech lj 1045 2001the alleged supreme court precedent for complete bar and th realities of patent practice governments arguments the federal government filed an micus curiae brief and was granted permission to participate in oral arguments in its brief the government agreed that the cafc correctly held that prosecution hi story estoppel applies to claims amended to comply with the patent act and not just to claims amended to avoid prior art however it disagreed with the complete bar rule adopted by the cafc the government argued that narrowing ame ndment to comply with any requirement of the patent act gives rise to prosecution hi story estoppel with respect to the amended portion of the claim and presumptively precludes application of the doctrine of equivalents for the amended portion of the cl aim this presumption can be rebutted where the patentee shows concrete basi s based on the prosecution history and relevant to the specific context of the infringement suit for nonliteral extension of claim element that was narrowed to secure patent the government noted two scenarios where the presumption might be re butted 1 the allege d equivalent is development of afterarising technology unforeseeable by persons of ordinary skill in the art field of the invention at the time of the amendment6 and 2 the subject matter of the claim is such that it would have been impossible for the patent applicant to draft an amendment that literally encompassed the allegedly equivalent claim element while disclaiming the surrendered subject matter supreme court opinion justice kennedy delivered the unanimous opinion of the court on may 28 2002 holding that any narrowing amendment ma to satisfy any requirement of the patent act may give rise to prosecution history est oppel regardless of whether the amendment was made to avoi d prior art but that such estoppel does not necessarily bar suit for infringement against any equivalent to the amended claim element the court noted the difficulty in precisely describing the patent claims which necessitated the doctrine of equivalents patent laws attempt to strike balance between the exclusive rights awarded to an inventor for present innovation and the incentive to others to pursue innovations bey ond the scope of the inventors exclusive rights therefore scope of patent righ t must be clear so that the public may have notice of what constitutes an infringemen t on patent and what is permissible innovation however language cannot always adequately capture the essence of an invention alt hough the clear est and most certain infringement rule would be infringement of the literal terms of the pate nt such rule would not necessarily be the most economically efficient and desirable because it may result in the destruction of the value of patent by the availability of equivalents therefore the scope of patent is not limited to its literal terms but may include equivalents to the claimshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs11 described the doctrine of equivalents may create uncertainty and result in more litigation about the scope of patent but it is more equitable toward the inventor than literal rule the court noted that it had recently affirmed the doctrine of equivalents in warnerjenkinson and had commented in that case that congress could legislate the doctrine out of existence at any time the court describes the na ture and role of prosecution history estoppel as means of ensuring that the doctrine of equivalents remains li nked to its underlying purpose if the doctrine remedies the inherent limitations of language in adequately delineating the scope of patent then prosecution history estoppel prevents the inventor from claiming equivalents infringement where the act of making narrowing amendment indicates recognition of the difference between the invention claim described by the original language and the one described by the amended language the patentee has acknowledged that there is equivalence for innovations that fall within th scope of the original cl aim but outside the scope of the amended claim and the estoppel works to prevent him from regaining through litigation that which was lost through the application process having reviewed the underlying rationale for the doctrine of equivalents and prosecution history estoppel the court considered the issues presented for consideration it noted that although it had made clear that estoppel applies to amendments made for substantial reason related to patentability it had not defined the term nor enumerated reasons and had even suggested that an amendment for reason unrelated to patentability might require estoppel th court affirmed the holding of the cafc that narrowing am endment made to satisfy any requirement of the patent act may give rise to estoppel although estoppel had been discussed most often in the context of an amendment to avoid prior art this did not mean that estoppel only applied in this context the underlying rationale that prosecution history estoppel rebuts the inference th at the proper scope of patent was indescribable still exists where narrowing amendment made to secure patent was for purpose other than avoiding prior art the court disagreed with the holding of the cafc that prosecution history estoppel is complete bar to equivalents infringement because complete bar is inconsistent with the underlying purpos of the doctrine of equivalents and prosecution history estoppel comple bar rule would foreclose any consideration of what subject matter d been surrendered and whether there were equivalents to the remaining subject matter the court noted that even amended language may not necessarily perfectly capture the essence of an invention and therefore patentee should not be restrict ed to claiming the literal language of claim for infringement narrowing amendment may indicate what subject matter was surrendered but not necessarily what remains the court affirmed the warner jenkinson ruling that patentee has the burden of proving that an amendment was not made for reason related to patentability and that where the reason is unclear or unexplained the presumption is that the reason was related to patentability and estoppel applies the court then held th at the patentee should also bear the burden of showing that narrowing amendment for patentability does not surrender the particular equiva lent at issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31156crs12 since the patentee is master of his cla im the presumption is that he knows what he is surrendering when making narrowi ng amendment however there may be reasons why the patentee could not be reas onably expected to have covered the alleged equivalent in the literal language of claim including the unforeseeability of some equivalents under afterarising technology th is new rule is similar to that advocated by the federal government since the record did not clearly show that the patentee had rebutted the presumption that the surrendered subject matter covered the disputed equivalent the

the supreme courts decision in festo and whether socalled consider ations of fair ness have any role in the application of the doctrine of equivalents the petitioner focused on the fact that the inventor prosecuted the patent application without be nefit of an attorney and amended the claims in accordance with the suggestions of the patent examiner the respondent argued that th fact that the examiner suggested the amendments to an inventor unfamiliar with the legal process was irrelevant the only relevant fact under the warnerjenkinson ruling was the reason for the amendment ie whether it was made for reasons related to patentability semitool inc v novellus systems inc ___ us ___ 122 s ct 2323 153 l ed 2d 152 2002 in an unpublished nonprecedential opinion semitool inc v novellus

equivalents infringement for later patent derived from the same initial application and containing the same claim limitation as the amended claim in the earlier patent semitool filed petition for writ of certiorari asking the same question presented in festo whether prosecution history estoppel completely bars application of the doctrine of equivalents semitool argued that estoppel should only bar the equivalent sp ecifically disclaimed as the difference between the prior art and its invention and should not bar all other equivalents including allegedly the invention of nove llus systems the respondent argued that this case concerned prosecution history toppel based on argume nts made by the petitioner as well as on amendments made to the claims as in festo but the cafc decision could have been based on estoppe l by argument alone therefore the supreme court decision in festo would have relevance to this case because it only concerned estoppel by amendment the petitioner replied that the cafc explicitly referred only to estoppel by amendm ent in its decision and to its festo decision as the basis for its decision in this case lockheed martin corp v space systemsloral inc ___

addition to the issues presented in festo 1 for the judicial basis for departing from the equitable flexible bar in favor of the absolute bar and 2 whether the absolute bar applies to equivalents for

interpretations of nonamendi ng arguments to bar literal patent infringement and to estop summarily the doctrine of equivalents whether such summary estoppel adds significantly to the body of law and whether unchecked judicial discretion in summarily applying argumentbased claim interpretation to estop the doctrine of equivalents circumvents the seventh amendment right to jury trial in patent infringement cases accuscan argued that the cafc had confused and blurred the line between argumentbased claim term interpretation and argumentbased prosecution history estoppel and that the festo holding did not apply to argument based estoppel xerox responded th at the complete bar rule of festo was not even applied in this case but that the cafc relied on wellestablished precedent that accuscan could not reclaim in litigation subject matter which it had explicitly surrendered during the patent prosecution it further argued that the traditional application of estoppel followed by the

applied rather than the earlier flexible bar rule litton systems had petitioned the supreme court for writ of certiorari asking whether retroactive application of the cafc festo rule to this case is contrary to other decisions allowing flexi ble bar range of equivalents although the cafc had intended to incr ease certainty with its complete bar rule in its festo decision the ruling reportedly had
