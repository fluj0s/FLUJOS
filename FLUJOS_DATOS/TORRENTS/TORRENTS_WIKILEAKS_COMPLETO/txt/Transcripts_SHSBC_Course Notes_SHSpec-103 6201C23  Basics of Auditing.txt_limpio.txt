6201c23 shspec103 basics of auditing person who is fairly new to scientology and in doubt about it is frequently someone who is just stuck in ridge where he has certainty that anything works or happens there is sense in trying to shove training down his throat he needs auditing first his whole life is in maybe and he will have to be run on positive and negative to handle the ridge another easily overcome barrier to training is pretended knowingness it is downscale mockery of knowing it gives the pc funny sensation being thoroughgoing fake but it doesnt buck your effort to train as much as the maybe case person stuck in maybe can make trouble as pc too he often sets extravagant unreal session goals and is in an obsessive games condition with the auditor where he is attempting to give the auditor loses the pc will go out of session very easily he is not under the auditors control run him lightly fundamental processes give only light effects this is noeffect case and you must audit him with feather 8c is not low enough for them they go around touching walls with never comm lag the process doesnt bite because they are not really there sit them down with some small dull object like piece of chalk and have them get the idea that the chalk is there not there this will pick up lot of confusion and randomity work with the person take the chalk away let them see what that would look like run the process until the pc takes over the automaticity of notising physical objects and the room starts going solid on them keep on with the process it is very light you are dealing with the old effect scale as the pc goes down towards total effect the effect he can experience is breath of air noeffect case cant confront or even notice large effect only very small one if you blew them up they would never find out about it thats too much effect we see that clearly in the overtmotivator phenomenon the more motivators the person has earned the less motivators the person can have so what to you seems minor to the person is major disaster he thinks everyone is against him etc but he couldnt perceive large explosive action if it occurred his automatic notis takes care of large effects you could probably give him session full of gaes noauditing and he wouldnt notice the badness of it but if you missed one tick on an arc break he would notice the small error critics of auditing are always looking for small errors on this basis in country like spain or mexico there can be enormous misgovernment atrocious wars banditry etc and at the same time punctilious courtesy and honesty in small things they dont see the gross outnesses democracy is only as good as people can see what is going on it is the enoughmotivator of an old empire that results in the notis lowscale cases could be given very bad auditing without their noticing this is not advised but it could be done middle range pcs will be aware of both large and small errors and are affected by them when they come upscale they see the whole error and are less affected by it than the lowscale pc so as you audit people up the line your auditing has to improve forms rituals procedures none of these will see you through session all that will see you through is auditing the second you start leaning on your tools like model session you are in trouble what is phenomenal is that you can make gain with pcs using only ritual auditing is science not an art lrhs sessions contain lots of auditing covering the bare bones of model session student sessions have the bones showing through the pc even if he is trained auditor or especially if he is is very aware of your taking up beginning rudiments but what is the pc doing listening to the auditing bones he is supposed to be interested in his case and there he is listening to the bones rattle good auditing is when you didnt notice the auditor using model session when he was using it it is smooooth theres need to make production out of everything you do get so that you can shift gears smoothly from say running simple havingness process to finding what inval or eval has caused it to stop working the more the pc is in session the faster the pc will blow an aberration the less afraid of things they are the less they duck and dodge and the braver they feel if the pc comes in talking about ptp he is stuck in handle it dont worry about formal start of session when it is handled get model session going so you either have to use tr4 when the pc comes up with any of the myriad things pcs can come up with or if it is something that really is in need of more handling you must know how to handle it you have the horsepower to head the pc in the right direction down through the slot the pc needs to get where he is going so use it and get him to the slot now there are four flows to the flow process 1 outflow 2 restrained outflow 3 inflow 4 restrained inflow all of these are selfdetermined they are easy for the pc to selfdetermine we have hitherto looked on inflow as motivators and restrained inflow as sort of motivator side of it but mixed up in the motivators is the pcs selfdetermined action to make the inflow occur and the pcs selfdetermined action to make the inflow not occur respectively flows three and four are not as important as withhold and outflow you handle flows one and two all the time pc can selfdetermine bad inflow in order to get motivator when you make an auditing error that causes the pc to arc break the action seems to be so much yours that you seldom notice the selfdetermined part the pc has in it maybe he did it so he could outflow makeyouguilty there are more than four flows of course theres the pc determining the flows for someone else for third dynamics etc how could you use flow processes in session to keep ruds in suppose the pc keeps coming up with session withholds how about tripping one of the other flows eg run what have you outflowed in this session to balance all his withholds then get when he started not wanting to outflow get the objection to the outflow off and the tendency to withhold vanishes or ask have you been inflowing the pc says yes auditing commands you dont have to q and with it just accept it and the pc has blown it you dont have to take up all the pcs withholds by the way let blown overts and withholds expire when they are blown dont try to remedy nonexistent situation on any flow line what you want to know is when it started roughly and how long it has been going on and whether the phenomenon whatever it is happened again etc just give it lick and promise when used as ruds pc who is going sporadically outruds has flow out that you havent spotted you could use onceover on beginning ruds too on flows this all gets what the pc is doing that he isnt communicating its all basically withholds that mess him up so the flows direct his attention to the things he hasnt told you as long as the auditor has the desire to assist the pc and to keep him communicating the auditor can straighten the pc up and keep the session going under almost any conditions an auditor can interfere with pcs comm to him in various ways there are obsessive withholds on other people for instance eg cop restraining people from committing crimes or tax collector getting people to outflow if an auditor is dramatizing some such valence he will prevent the pcs comm or make him talk after hes said all auditors always talk too much an auditor who talks too much is for the pc confused area which the pc cant reach so the pc cannot talk into the area since the pcs havingness is often down anyway the auditors talking can reduce it to the point where the pc dopes off processes that clean up the auditor for the pc make the auditor more haveable who would i have to be to audit you or what dont i know about you would help generally its bad idea for the auditor to use his body for anything in the session one exception is that if the pc believes the auditor is too enturbulative you can run put your hand on my shoulder repetitively few commands of this will help by giving the pc the illusion of being able to reach the auditor the auditor who tries to put the pc on an obsessive withhold is of course poor auditor the other extreme is the auditor into whose zone one must never reach the auditor who runs away by say changing processes before they are flat the pc will be aware of this more than the auditor as noauditing the difficulties you have as an auditor are of your own making and stem from using ritual to avoid auditing there is substitute for sitting down with the pc using what you know of the mind auditing his case finding what it is squaring it up etc all for the pc with auditing intended if you have other considerations entering into it criticising the pc or whatever you wont get much auditing done
