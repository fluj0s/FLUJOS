rusi february 2008 vol 153 1 pp 4246 doi 10108003071840802002094over recent years the strategic debate in anglosaxon countries about theimplications of sustained counterinsurgency campaign in afghanistan hasevolved there is not much disagreementamongst countries like great britaincanada or the united states that natofaces an intensifying insurgency and thatnato strategy has to be adjustedaccordingly the recognition is that thewestern security community isconfronted with talibanled insurgencythat is gaining momentum nato maybe engaged in socalled small war inafghanistan but this misnomer belittlesthe operational reality that coalitionforces on frequent basis are engaged insustained combat with insurgents themajority view amongst nato membersis that under these circumstances acommon nato strategy for the afghanoperation has to be based on commonunderstanding of counterinsurgency yet as the current debate within the alliance shows such commonappreciation does not exist germany akey ally and one of the leadnations ofthe isaf operation for example conteststhe notion that nato forces are beingdragged into longterm counterinsurgency campaign in afghanistan thechanging operational reality of the afghan conflict provides germanstrategic thinkers with challenges theyare unprepared for germanys alliesshould recognise the absence of theconcept of counterinsurgencyhenceforth coin in germany coinas it is understood in the alliance is aninherently anglosaxon concept whichdoes not resonate in contemporarygerman strategic debate this deficitentails significant risks for nato andinhibits efforts to find common groundon new afghanistan strategy it mightalso restrain germanys ability to play aleading role in the reconstruction effortand hamper the bundeswehrs attemptto adapt to the changing operationalrealities on the ground benign neglect at least three reasons contribute to thisphenomenon firstly by now it is atraditional feature of the transatlanticsecurity community that changes in usstrategic debate gain prominence on theeuropean continent only after somedelay this time was different asearly as 2003 an american debate on theimplications of coin for nationalstrategy emerged pressed by painfullessons of the operational conduct iniraq us strategic debate rediscoveredthe challenges of classical coincampaign this resulted in fiercediscussions on the changes needed in us strategy with the exception of greatbritain european debate largely failed to take notice of this developmentmoreover while it took the us politicaland military establishment some time to absorb the lessons learned from iraqand afghanistan the us finally didinitiate substantial changes on thebenjamin schreer and dr timo noetzel are analysts at the

europeanstrategic debate only slowly takes noticeof the remarkable progress that coinefforts in iraq have brought about theabsence of german strategic debate oncoin at least partly fits within this widereuropean malaise the second factor was the relatively stable security situation in northernafghanistan for which germany hadtaken over military responsibility as theleadnation in the framework of theisaf peration until now the north has not experienced the heavy fighting thatbritish dutch us or canadian troopshave been confronted with in the southand east of afghanistan with its talibanof british canadian or american troopstaking casualties on more frequentbasis the third and probably most important factor to explain the benignneglect in german political debate oncoin is societal german policymakersfrom the beginning of natosafghanistan campaign have framedbundeswehr participation domesticallyas noncombat operation as resultregular german forces would be involvedin nationbuilding tasks only and wouldnot conduct offensive operations againstinsurgents alongside nato alliesfighting the taliban and other enemyforces would be left predominantly tous forces within the framework ofoperation enduring freedom oef or to those isaf forces operating in the southand east of afghanistan this message bysuccessive german governments as welland alqaida strongholds for

accept alliesinterpretation of the nature of conflict inafghanistan at its core counterinsurgency implies the fight againstenemy resistance and ranks the militarydimension equal to nonmilitaryinstruments it can also interchangeablybe used with the concept of small wars such conceptualisation of conflict in afghanistan however runs counter tothe german elites preferences which forthe most part still deny the changinglevel of politically motivated violenceeven in the northern parts ofafghanistan to accept the concepts ofcounterinsurgency or small warswould amount to defeat of berlinsselfperception as somewhat revisedcivilian power this power perceivesmilitary force as only one instrumentwithin wider strategic framework thatemphasises the nonmilitary dimensionsof security instead the germangovernment in line with majority inparliament has both domestically andabroad advocated for an approach whicheschews the notion that the militarydimension is one critical element ofnato strategy towards rebuildingafghan society the german consensus ison comprehensive approach to theafghan problem meaning in essence astrategy which integrates the politicaleconomic and military aspects of theoverall campaign in addition germanpoliticians strongly emphasise that thereis military solution to the conflict all of this is now conventional wisdom within the alliance the problemwith the german insistence on thecomprehensive approach however isthat while nato allies base theirplanning on comprehensive approachto counterinsurgency german politicalelites focus on comprehensiveapproach to postconflictreconstruction this differentiation is ofcritical importance since the emphasison postconflict obstructs an efficientgerman contribution to natos coincampaign in at least two ways firstlygiven that it implies the absence of ahigh level of violence such as displayedby insurgent groups in afghanistan theterm postconflict promotes germanunderstanding that civilian instrumentswill not be applied within the frameworkof ongoing military operations secondlyit also neglects the military instrumentas the most essential tool in order toconduct targeted offensive actionsagainst insurgents this deeply embedded consensual thinking amongst german political elitespotentially has serious consequences fornato strategy the political concepts ofallies

domestic audience with regardto the isaf mission majority of votersremain deeply opposed to anybundeswehr participation in combatoperations further the governmentsroom for manoeuvre is limited by

its relatedstrategic and operational implicationsoften are not known let aloneunderstood with very few exceptionsthe german translation of counterinsurgency aufstandsbekämpfung is absent in domestic debate this could beattributed to the fact that unlike manyof its allies the federal republic neverengaged in small war germany lackshistorical memory of such conflictswhich could inform current debatenevertheless the remarkable absence ofcoin as concept in german domesticdiscussion is more likely due togerman political and legal caveats on the useof bundeswehr units forcombat purposes

this political situation ensures that german political and legal caveats onthe use of bundeswehr units for combatpurposes in afghanistan will remain inplace for political reasons thebundeswehr is still bound to resort toforce only as defensive measure andnot in the framework of selectiveoffensive military operations againstafghan insurgents yet any coinoperation that wants to have crediblechance of success will have to resort tothe use of force against radicalinsurgents in fact the changingoperational reality in northernafghanistan has forced germancommanders on the ground to
