43014333the impact of mobilization on student reservists background the ongoing mobilization of reservists in support of operations enduring freedom and noble eagle oefone has been the largest reserve callup since the persian gulf war as of septem ber 17 2002 about 93000 reservists had been involuntarily called to active duty under federal authority1 most of these reservists held civilian j obs prior to mobilization and as such are entitled to certain legal protections under the uniformed servicemembers employment and reemployme nt rights act userra2 for example userra generally guarantees that mobilized reserv ists will be allowed to return to their civilian jobs or similar jobs after mobilization without adverse treatment however substantial number of reservists today are students at institutions of higher education either on fulltime or parttime basis their academic status is not covered by userra or an similar federal law althoug h it is covered under the laws of some states some of these students have reported that their academic status has been harmed by mobilization and have advocated legal protections similar to those enjoyed by employees this report provides informa tion on the types of problems encountered by student reservists the scope of those problems the remedies available to student reservists who experience difficulties rela ted to mobilization and an assessment of the effectiveness of these remedies it so provides several lternative options for assisting student reservists that congress may wish to consider how many student reservists are there the department of defense dod doe s not track the academic status of reservists so precise number is not av ailable however dod has made roughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31601crs2 3the selected reserve subelement of the ready reserve contains those units and individuals most essential to wartime missions selected reservists generally perform one weekend of training each month for which they receive monthly paycheck and two weeks of training year for which they receive parate paycheck another subelement of the ready reserve is the individual ready reserv which is manpower pool of pretrained individuals who have already served in the active component or the selected reserve but who are not required to train regularly as ar those in the selected reserve although members of the individual ready reserve have been mobilized during each call up since desert storm the numbers have been low in comparison to the numbers of selected reservists activated 4dr john winkler protecting recalled students the officer december 2001 38 5 the methodology used to arrive at this figure deserves discussion according to the office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs oasdra there were 188960 members of the selected reserve who drew benefits from the reserve version of the gi bill at some point during fiscal ear 2000 during that same fiscal year the total membership of the selected reserve was 873207 thus based on these two figures oasdra calculated that 216 of selected reservists were drawing reserve gi bill educational benefits in addition an indeterminate number of selected reservists were attending school using active duty gi bill benefits or state military educational benefits or were self financing their education thus oasdra believes that student population estimate of 30 is reasonable when these other factors are taken into consideration it should be pointed out however that this estimate is fundamentally based on the number of students who drew reserve gi bill benefits at some point during an entire year as some students drop out graduate or only enroll for one semest er this methodology has the practical effect of maximizing the population designated as student methodol ogy which looked only at those drawing gi bill benefits during given month would produce lower proportion of student reservists 6this methodology looks at only those members of the selected reserve drawing active or reserve gi bill benefits during given month specifically january of 2000 according to the defense manpower data center th at number was 60114 with total selected reserve membership of 873207 people this indica tes that 69 of selected reservists were drawing gi bill educational benefits during that month the number of reservists using state military educational benefits or selffinancing their education is unknown but an estimate of 38 does not ppear to be unreasonable 7however it should be pointed out that this rvey was not administered to random sample of reservists so its findings cannot be consid ered representative of the reserve components generallyestimate of the student population within the selected reserve3 based on gi bill utilization rates according to dr john winkler deputy assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs manpower and personnel an estimated 30 percent of national guard members and reservists are students enrolled in institutions of higher learning4 the methodology used to arrive at this number however probably overstates the number of reservists who are students at the time of mobilization5 an alternative methodology indicates that about 1015 of rese rvists are students at any given point in time6 additionally recent survey by the general accounting office of 1608 reservists from selected high operational tempo units found that 22 of them were students on fulltime or parttime basis7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31601crs3 8 in other words volunteers replace those w ho would have difficult time deploying these volunteers may be dispr oportionately nonstudents 9 for example aviation and civil affairs units 10this figure is based solely on the number of reservists who had been involuntarily activated for federal service in support of oefone as of september 17 2002 for summary of these distinctions see crs report rl30802 reserve component personnel issues by lawrence kapphow many student reservists have been mobilized for operations enduring freedom and noble eagle another issue related to st udent reservists involves th degree to which they are affected by mobilization while the propor tion of students in the selected reserve may be 10 15 22 or 30 as the previous paragraph indicates that ratio may not correspond to the population of mobilized reservists in fact data from the bosnia and kosovo missions appear to indicate that student reservists were mobilized at rate lower than their overall representation in the selected reserve specifically of the reservists mobilized for bosnia only bout 55 were receiving reserve or active gi bill benefits within the three months prior to mobilization of the reservists mobilized for kosovo only about 3 were receiving reserve or active gi bill benefits within the three months prior to mobilization again these figures do not include those who were selffinancing thei r education or those who were receiving state military educational benefits however the gap between these figures and the figures cited in the previous paragraph is considerable th is gap may be due in part to the selfselection8 that often accompanies smallerscale mobilizations like bosnia and kosovo and to the heavy utilization in these operations of military units which typically have older and better educated populations9 alternatively the gap may be caused not by decrease in the proportion of students in the mobilized population but by decrease in the population of students using gi bill benefits in the mobilized population this too could be caused by th utilization of units which have older populations who may have used up all of their gi bill entitlements the reserve callups which occurred in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substa ntially larger than those of bosnia and kosovo and so these factors may have been reduced or eliminated however it may still be the case that student reservists are underrepresente d in the oefone mobilization in relation to their overall representation in the selected reserve nonetheless if one assumes that just 10 of those mobilized for oefone were students just prior to their activation then there are about 9300 reserv ists whose academic status could have been affected by the mobilization10 reported problems of student reservists mobilized student reservists have reported number of problems associated with their academic status perhaps the most commonly reported problem relates to the treatment of classes they are taking at the time of mobilization for example some students have complained of di fficulty withdrawing from courses withouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31601crs4 11reservists mobilized for contingency operations such as oefone are immediately eligible for military health bene fits nearly identical to those offered to active duty personnel however many reservists prefer to maintain their private health insurance while deployed especially if they have dependents who are accustomed to using certain health plan 12the author is aware of several cases such as this which occurred in connection with activations for the bosnia mission 13based on interviews conducted by tiffany petros with state official s in louisiana new jersey and west virginia it may be however that the low number of complaints in these states is due to the laws they have protecting student reservists 14soc was created in 1972 to provide educational opportunities to servicemembers who because they frequently moved from place to pl ace had trouble completing college degrees today soc is consortium of more than 1550 colleges and universities that provide educational opportunities for servicemembers and their families soc is cosponsored by the american association of state colleges and universities aascu and the american association of community colleges aacc in cooperation with 13 other educational continuedpenalty stating that faculty or administrators told them their grades would suffer if they did not complete their courses or th at they would be allowed to withdraw but would forfeit the tuition they had paid for the courses other students have objected to lack of guarantees regarding readmi ssion to school reinstitution of scholarships or renewal of oncampus housin g privileges when they return to school after their tour of duty loss of student health be nefits while mobilized and concerns about prompt reinstitution of this benefit after demobilization have also been reported11 there are solid data on the frequency of such problems but there is some evidence that mobilization related difficultie s are fairly uncommon steve kime the director of the servicemem bers opportunity college soc which has voluntarily agreed to respond to such complaints on be half of mobilized reservists stated that during the reserve mobilizations for the gulf war bosnia and kosovo his office received only handful of complaints about two dozen total from affected reservists this low rate of complaints through official channels seem to indicate that problems related to the academic status of mobilized student reservists are not widespread alternatively however it may simply indicate that student reservists are not well informed about avenues of assist ance for problems they encounter lacking such information they may attempt to deal with the problems on their own and accept any negative outcomes as part of the price of mobilization12 reports from officials in states which have laws protecting the academic status of reservists also indicate very small number of complaints13 what type of assistance is available to student reservists who experience problems with their academic status due to their reserve duties at the federal level the principal avenue reservists have for assistance with academic problems related to mobilization is provided th rough the servicemembers opportunity colleges soc14 dod funded educational consortium reservistshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31601crs5 14continued associations the military services the national guard and the coast guard soc is funded by the department of defense dod through contract with aascu the contract is managed for dod by the defense activ ity for nontraditional education support dantes for online information see the servicemembersopportunity colleges web site httpwwwsocaascuorgsocgenwhatishtml july 3 2002 15affected reservists can contact soc by calling 18003685622 via email at socamailaascuorg or by writing to servicemembers opportunity colleges 1307 new york avenue nw fifth fl oor washington dc 200054701 16authors conversation with mr steve kimecan contact soc and request assistance in dealing with their academic institution15 soc director kime states that his office has substantial leverage within the higher education community due to the militarys ongoing relationship with many colleges and universities this he argues allows soc to c ontact school administrators directly and to effectively mediate acade mic problems related to mobilization mr kime states that soc has been able to resolve all mobilization related cases brought to its attention since the organization assumed this role during the persian gulf war16 additionally soc played key role in getting major higher education associations like the american council on education and the american association of state colleges and universities to courage their members to adopt policies to protect the academic status of mobilized students at the state level reservists may also have legal recourse depending on the laws of the state in which they are attending sc hool states which have laws protecting the academic status of reservists include arka nsas louisiana new jersey texas and west virginia the scope of these laws varies considerably see appendix for listing of these statutes other states may have laws or regulati ons which protect the academic status of reservists as well what are the benefits and drawbacks of the current system the major benefit of the current system is that it appears to be working in those cases where soc is made aware of problems it claims to have resolved them in manner favorable to the reservist this system also has the benefit of being relatively inexpensive soc has small staff and student mobilization issues take up only small part of its time the current system also avoids the adversarial relationship which could develop between the military and academic institutions if student reservists were given specified legal ri ghts which the federa l government could enforce against colleges and universities the drawbacks of the current system are first of all that it has not been well publicized student reservists experienci ng academic problems due to mobilization may be unaware of and t hus unable to take advantage of the mediating services provided by soc additionally the existe nce of laws protectin g student reservists in some states but not othe rs creates situation where some student reservists havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31601crs6 more rights than others this disparity c ould generate feelings of inequity during mobilization and dissatisfaction with the lack of federal legal protections also the lack of uniform rules defining the rights and responsibilities for st udent reservists vis avis academic institutions might have negative impact on the attitudes of students towards reserve service as it complicates the individual reservists ability to plan for the future even if academic institutions generally accommodate student reservists in practice the possibility that they might not may cause students to attach an unjustifiably high cost to reserve servi ce and therefore discourage participation perhaps most fundamentally however the current system can be criticized for being wholly contingent upon the cooperation of academic institutions should school refuse to cooperate wi th soc especially one that is not part of the soc consortium there is legal recourse for the affected reservist this point is perhaps less relevant at present when th current operations ag ainst terrorism enjoy widespread support among the american pub lic and within acade mia however if this conflict or future conflict were to become unpopular within the academic community as was the case in vietnam the current level of cooperation might decrease markedly what are some alternatives for dealing with this issue congress has number of options for dealing with the impact of mobilization on student reservists the choice among these alternatives will likely hinge on congresss assessment of the prevalence of mobilization related problems among student reservists b the impact such problems could have on the recruiting and retention of reservists who are in college or have plans to atte nd college and c the effectiveness of the current system in resolving such problems do nothing one option for congress is simply to take action thereby maintaining the status quo this response would be most ppropriate if congress believed that there were relatively small number of mobilization related problems for student reservists that these problems had little impact on reserve recruiting and retention andor that the current system was doing an acceptable job handling the problems that do occur require the department of defense to study the issue another option congress might consider is directing the depa rtment of defense to conduct study on how mobilization impacts student reservists and the implications of this for reserve recruiting and retention based on the findings of the study dod could then make recommendations to congress on the most appropriate policy response such study would have the additional benefit of strengthening the factual basis for any policy decision cong ress decides to make as mentioned earlier there is lack of solid data on key issues concerning student reservists for example how many student reservists there are how frequently they are mobilizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31601crs7 17what is the national committee for employer support of the guard and reserve factsheet available at httpwwwesgrorg 18for more information on this option see the gao report titled reserve forces dod actions needed to better manage relations between reservists and their employers june 2002 pp 1617 and 2427 in this report gao made formal recommendation to dod that the secretary of defense in conjunction with the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs add students as target population to the mission and responsibilities of esgr study in depth the problems related to deployments that student reservists have experienced and determine what actions the gr might take to help students and their educational institutions th dod response was as follows concur during strategic planning esgr identified students and educati onal institutions as target customer group however without additional resources esgr can only provide limited information and continuedwhat proportion experience academic problem s as result of mobilization which problems are most frequently experienced and whether or not such problems affected their views about reserve service t horough study could therefore provide more substantive underpinning for debating polic alternatives than currently exists increase awareness of the current system run by soc this option might be useful if the cong ress believes that the current system run by soc is generally effective in assisting student reservists but that student reservists need to be better informed bout the services it provides for example congress could direct dod to ensure that ll reservists are aware of socs mediating services through the various communications channels at dods disposal or it could direct dod to hire an outside public relations firm for this purpose additionally congress could require that the military services brief rese rvists about socs mediating services on regular basis or upon mobilization increased publicity however would likely increase the demand for socs services and soc might have difficulty handling an increase in requests for mediation at its current staffing levels transfer responsibility for student reservists from soc to esgr congress could direct dod to transfer re sponsibility for student reservists from soc to the national committee for employ er support of the guard and reserve esgr esgr is dod chartered organi zation which was established in 1972 to promote cooperation and unde rstanding between reserv component members and their civilian employers and to assist in the resolution of conflicts arising from an employees military commitment17 it has 30 years of experience in helping resolve conflicts which arise between employers and reservists due to military duty and it has developed large networ k of volunteers in each state and territory to support this mission transferring responsibility for acad emic related issues to esgr would provide student reservists with rger more experienced and better known organization for addressing their mobiliza tion related problems however it should be pointed out that esgr does not have the same type of relationship with the academic community that soc has and this could make it more difficult for esgr to effectively mediate complaints from student reservists18 this option wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31601crs8 18continued mediation for guard and reserve studentsprobably be most appr opriate if congress felt that the current system run by soc was acceptable in principal but that it needed to be managed by larger more visible organization enact federal legal protections for student reservists another option for congress is to pa ss legislation roughly analogous to userra which defines the respective rights and duties of student reservists and academic institutions for example among other things such law might require academic institutions to readmit student reservists after th ey have been demobilized but also require that the st udent apply for readmission within specified period of time this type of law could eliminate many of the negative impacts which mobilization can have on student reservists and thereby reduce potential dissatisfaction with reserve service among st udents additionally by clearly defining rights and duties for student reservists and academic institutions such law could also help to minimize misunderstandings betw een the respective parties on the other hand depending on how the law wa s written it could prove burdensome to academic institutions especially in the case of small schools with large number of student reservists it might also create an adversarial relationship between members of the academic institution and reservists which could hinder resolving situations not specifically addressed in the law this option would probably be most appropriate if congress determined that the academic problems encountered by student reservists were fairly common were causing signifi cant recruiting and retention problems or were not being resolved effectively by the current system such legislation could be modeled on currently existing state laws see appendix allow students to defer mobilization while in school yet another option would be to place the burden of protecting the academic careers of student reservists on the military rather than on academic institutions under such policy reservists who are rolled in courses could be exempted from mobilization until the end of th semester or the end of the academic year however such policy would likely cause serious readiness and morale problems in reserve units for example would reserve unit be capable of performing its assigned mission upon mobilization if 10 of its mbers claimed exemption under such an academic deferment policy how would th unit function if the exempted personnel included key leaders such as the commandi ng officer during mobilization would reservists who could not claim academic deferment feel they were being treated unfairly further problem with such policy is that it would create moral hazard the ability to temporarily avoid service might tempt some reservists to enroll in school if mobilization appeared imminen t such actions even if undertaken by only few reservists could also cau morale and r eadiness
