hder began as national program w ith equipment available to all states territories and the district of columbia on june 1 2003 the program obtains excess equipment for ra diation monitoring laboratory analysis personal safety and f acility security from doe sites nd to lesser extent from other federal agencies the equipment typically older but serviceable became excess in several ways some was replaced by newer quipment some was longer needed when doe nuclear weapons production sites or facilities shut down because of the smaller post cold war workload and some that was purchased to decontaminate specific facility became excess when that task ended on source of equipment was does brookhaven ny national laboratory which operated graphite research reactor from 1950 to 1968 decommissioning still underway as of december 2003 began in 2000 as it proceeded some geiger counter s and other radiation detec tion equipment were longer needed and were provided to hder anot her source was the environmental protection agencys environmental radiation laborat ory in montgomery which provided hder with several dozen instruments th ird source is the navy which in august 2003 agreed to provide radiation tectors that it is replacing with newer models the units some new in the box have retail value of about 1400 api ece the navy delivered 1950 units to aunmr from yorktown and san diego in september 2003 aunmr expects the navy ultimately to provide over 7000 of these units the potential exists for the navy to provide large quantities of additional equipment to hder

environmental re storation and waste management account fy2003 odp funds come from that organi zations technical assistance budget like odp aunmr maintains that the pr ogram is economical doe had several choices for the disposition of excess or obsol ete equipment disposal sale or reuse disposal would have cost about 40 unit because much of the equipment contains radioactive material or other hazardous waste such as l ead silver and mercury that would have to be disposed of in specified ways at that rate disposing of the 1601 units distributed would have cost some 64000 th cost of administering sales to the public through auction would doe estimates have exceeded the proceeds in similar program aunmr distributed 28 instruments internationally through the international atomic energy agency i aea for use in responding to industrial accidents as well as terrorist threats5 specifically aunmr provided instruments to iaea at the request of the state department to help locate abandoned radioactive sources in the republic of georgia in another pr ogram related to hder odp provided radiation detection instruments to the us public health services noble hospital training center at ft mcclellan in nniston to assist in training hospital personnel to deal with casualties from weapons of mass destruction6 issues for congress should the program be halted kept at low level or expanded once doe has distributed excess equipment currently at doe sites there might not be enough additional equipment available to support c ontinued hder activity alternatively small but continuing flow of equipment may become obsolete or unneeded in that case maintaining hder at low level might be possible finally nondoe sources such as other government agencies and corporations have excess equipment for example the navys nuclear program di scussed providing hder some 7000 instruments it plans to replace and mgp instruments corporation offe red to provide old instruments such as for radiation monitoring being returned for replacement by its nuclear power industry customers if hder were to become able to accept this equipment an issue discussed below the program might be expanded should hder provide equipment to foreign requesters given the terrorist threat and the resources currently available to first responders hder equipment is available only to domestic users c ongress might elect to use hder to provide equipment to foreign nations as well on grounds that the shortage of equipment abroad especially in less developed c ountries is more severe than in the

attack on the united states and its allies at the same time it may well prove desirable to reserve most equipment for us users to satisfy both goals equipment might be made available overseas only 1 on an urgent ad hoc basis at the request of us government agency as in the case of the republic of georgia discussed above or 2 if the pieces are unlikely to be used at home because more recent equipment for given task is available or because the program has large stocks of particular item how should the program handle quipment donated by organizations outside the federal government corporations universities hospitals and other organizations have excess equipment that coul d be of use to first responders some have already offered equipment to hder such donations would bene fit corporations by saving them the expense of disposal and pe rhaps providing tax deductions the program however is unable to accept such equipment based on an interpretation of federal appropriations law according to the general accounting office while gifts to the united states do not require statutory authority gifts to an individual federal agency stand on different footing the rule is that government agency may not accept for its own use ie fo r retention by the agency or credit to its own appropriations gifts of money or ot her property in the absence of specific statutory authority7 while the equipment received by hder is transferred to nonfederal agencies and so is not intended for retention by the ag ency or credit to its own appropriation the office of the chief counsel of does oak ridge operations office interprets the language cited above to apply on grounds that 1 doe does not have statutory authority to accept gifts and 2 doe by using its own f unds to check out the instruments converts the instruments to its own use because it cannot accept such equipment hde r has link with the health physics society hps whereby hps accepts and ch ecks out equipment from nonfederal sources and distributes it to first responders s noted hps partnered with hder to support preparedness efforts it accepts nonfederal quipment as an augmentation of not the reason for the partnership this approach complies with the foregoing interpretation of law on the other hand hder program fficers argue that hders inability to accept donations of instruments from nonfederal sources reduces the effectiveness of the program if aunmr could accept all offerings then odp could select from larger inventory and wider variety of equipment to meet firs t responders needs options include maintaining the current arrangement with hps granting doe explicit statutory authority to accept gifts of this sort or as king for additional analysis of does current statutory limitations should hder attempt to fill gaps in its coverage supplydriven program can only provide equipment made available to it hder increases the utility of this equipment by assembling individual pieces into kits and by
