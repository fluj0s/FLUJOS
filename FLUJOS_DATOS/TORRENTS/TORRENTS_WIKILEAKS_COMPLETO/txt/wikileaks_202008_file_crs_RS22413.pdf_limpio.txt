congress would make the unauthorized presence of aliens in the us criminal offense including hr 4437 the border protection antiterrorism and illegal immig ration control act of 2005 introduced by representative james sense nbrenner on december 6 2005 and passed by the house as amended on december 16 2005 and s 2454 the securing americas borders act introduced by senator bill frist on marc h 16 2006 the version of chairman arlen specters mark reported out of the senate judiciary committee on march 27 2006 samdt 3192 does not contain provisi on criminalizing unlawful presence though the bill had initially contained such provisi on neither version of the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 introduced in the senate on april 24 2006 as s 2611 and s 2612 which are commonly referred to as the hagelmartinez compromise criminalize unlawful presence although unlawfu l entry into the united states is both criminal offense and ground for removal unlawful presence is only gr ound for deportation and is not subject to criminal penalty except when an alien is present in the united states after having been removed this report briefly discusses some of the issues raised by criminalizing unlawful presence immigration law contains both civil and criminal provisions the removal of aliens however severe its consequences has been consistently classified as civil rather than criminal procedure by the courts1 on the other hand th immigration and nationality act ina contains several pr ovisions that are unambiguously penal in nature subjecting offenders to imprisonment andor fi ne under title 18 of the us code certain immigration violations carry civil and criminal consequences an alien who enters or attempts to enter the united states without authorization is not only subject to removal or exclusion but is also subject to criminal pros ecution with first offensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22413crs2 2 ina 275a 8 usc 1325a unlawful entry has been crime since 1929 act of mar 4 1929 2 45 stat 1551 3 ina 276 8 usc 1326 4 in 2004 for example the border patrol seized approximately 116 million aliens who unlawfully entered or attempted to enter the united states from mexico department of homeland security office of immigration statistics earbook of immigration statistics 2004 2005 at table 38 only about 16000 aliens m ostly serial offenders were convicted of the crime of unlawful entry id at table 50 5 see eg united states v doyle 181 f 2d 479 2nd cir 1950 subject to six months imprisonment misdemeanor and any subsequent offense punishable by up to two year s incarceration felony2 although an alien who unlawfully enters the united states is potentially subject to removal and criminal prosecu tion an alien found unlawfully present in the us is typically subject only to removal unlawful presence is only criminal offense when an alien is found in the united stat after having been formally removed or after departing the us while remova l order was outstanding3 the availability of both criminal sanctions and removal authority for immigration violations does not mean that both tools will be used concomitantly especially if one tool can more easily be employed than the other the vast majority of aliens apprehended by the border patrol unlawfully entering the ited states are either removed or far more often permitted to voluntarily depart in lieu of removal without being criminally prosecuted4 this is largely because pursuing crimin charges in all cases would place heavy burden upon prosecutorial resources nd detention facilities unlawful entry prosecutions of aliens found in the interior of the us are even rarer such cases are difficult to prove as the government must pr esent affirmative evid ence that an alien unlawfully entered the us it cannot base its case solely upon the inference that the accuseds unauthorized presence in the us was likely due to him unlawfully entering the country5 an inference that might not always be accurate eg with respect to lawfully admitted alien who overstays his visa proposals to criminal ize unlawful presence few proposals made in the 109th congress would criminalize unlawful presence the version of the chairman arlen specters mark reported out of the senate judiciary committee on march 27 2006 samdt 3192 does not contain provision criminalizing unlawful presence though the bill had initially contained such provision however 203 of hr 4437 the border protection antite rrorism and illegal immigration control act of 2005 introduced by representative james sensenbrenner on december 6 2005 and passed by the house on december 16 2005 would amend the ina to make both unlawful entry and presence felonies subject to yearandadays imprisonment heightened sentences would be available for subsequent offenses as well as for aliens previously convicted of certain crimes section 206 of s 2454 th securing americas borders act introduced by senator bill frist on march 16 2006 would also criminalize unlawful presence but firsttime offense would be misdemeanor subject to six months imprisonment while subsequent offens would be felonies subject to two

until the alien is discovered within the united states by immigration officers both would also provide that convicti on for unlawful presence as well as unlawful entry at least in certain circumstances would have immigration consequences both 201 of housepassed hr 4437 and 203 of s 2454 would designate unlawful presence entry and reentry as aggravated felonies for purposes of the ina in cases where the offender was sentenced to at least one year imprisonment convic tion for an aggravated felony makes an alien ineligible for many immigration benefits6 and also makes an alien permanently inadmissible upon removal7 while firsttime convictions for unlawful presence and entry could potentially constitute aggravated felonies under housepassed hr 4437 under s 2454 only subsequent offens could potentially be designated as such selected issues the criminalization of unlawful presence would raise number of legal issues the nature of some of these issues would be shaped by the manner in which immigration and law enforcement authorities apply an unlawful presence statute indeed it is ultimately up to the discretion of federal prosecutors as to whether to pursue cas against individual aliens who may fall under th purview of statute cr iminalizing unlawful presence rights in criminal prosecution versus removal hearing removal hearings are not criminal proceedings wh ereas criminal cases are conducted through judicial trial removal cases are usually conducted through administrative proceedings before the executive office of immigration review eoir within the department of justice though orders of removal may be re viewed by federal c ourt statute and court jurisprudence generally provide that such review is limited in scope and largely deferential to the administrative authorities charged with implementing immigration laws8 the constitutional rights accorded to an alie n in removal hearing are generally less than those to which the accused is entitled in criminal proceeding among other things in criminal case the accused often has right to both trial by jury and appointed counsel while an alien in removal hear ing does not though an alien does possess the right to obtain counsel at expense of the government9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22413crs4 9 continued proceedings arriving aliens in expedited removal proceedings have even fewer rights 10

needed to order an alien removed in removal proceedings for unlawful presence it is the aliens burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence thathe is lawfully present in the united states pursuant to prior admission10 if the alien is able to demonstrate that she or he was lawfully admitted into the united states immigration authorities must demonstrate by clear and c onvincing evidence that the alien thereafter committed deportable offense11 less onerous burden than proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt in criminal prosecution12 as previously noted the availability of both criminal sanctions and removal authority for an immigration violation does not mean that both tools will be used for reasons described above it may often be simple r to remove an alien for unlawful presence than to successfully prosecute him for such an offense whether this means that prosecutors will forgo pursuing criminal charges against many aliens who may be removed on account of unlawful presence nd selectively bring charges only against certain categories of aliens g serial offenders aliens suspected of unlawful activity remains to be seen effects of making unlawful presence felony versus misdemeanor proposals to criminalize unlawfu l presence differ as to whether to make it misdemeanor or felony offense misdemeanors are consider ed less serious crimes th an felonies and are generally subject to maximum sentence of imprisonment of year or less whereas felonies are subject to greater penalties grand jury is usually required to issue an indictment before felony prosecution may proceed whereas that would not be required in the case of misdemeanor prosecution for unlawful presence13 further if unlawful presence is made subject to more than si x months imprisonment as is proposed by housepassed hr 4437 it woul d constitute serious crime for which the accused would have right to jury trial14 in contrast if unlawful pr esence is made subject to maximum of six months or less imprisonment as proposed in s 2454 the accused would probably not have right to jury15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22413crs5 15 continued additional statutory penalties such as h eavy fines are sufficiently severe 16 for background see crs report rl32270 enforcing immigration law the role of state and local law enforcement by lisa m seghetti stephen r vina and karma ester 17 united states v united states gypsum co 438 us 422 436 1978 these differences may influence law enfor cement decisions as to how seriously to pursue criminal charges against unlawfully pr esent aliens on the one hand prosecutors might be more willing to devote resources to the prosecution of unlawful presence violations if such offenses were made subject to greater penalties on the other hand the additional rights accorded to the accused in felony cases may impose greater strain on prosecutorial resources th an in misdemeanor cases state and local law enforcement issues the proper role of states and localities in the enforcement of immigration laws is matter of some debate while state and local law enforcements ability to enforce the inas civil provisions remains unclear there is broad agreement that these entities may apprehend persons for violating the inas criminal provisions and briefly detain such persons pending their transfer to federal custody at least to the extent states and localities authorize such practices16 if unlawful presence is criminalized state and local law enforcement may play an important role in assisting federal authorities in the apprehension of offenders the degree to which state and local law enforcement would assist the federal government in apprehending aliens for criminal prosecution might be dependent on number of factors some states and localities may lack the resources to assist in the apprehension of unlawfully present aliens community relations concerns may also cause states and localities to prohibit law enforcement from as king persons about their immigration status ie sanctuary cities state and local assistance may also be determined by the federal governments willingness to prosecute unlawfully present aliens who are seized by state and local law enforcement as previously discussed federal prosecutors pursue criminal charges against only small percentage of liens apprehended for unlawful entry and it is unclear whether they would be more willing to prosecute unlawful presence offenses requisite intent necessary for unlawful presence to be criminal offense whereas some proposals criminalizin g unlawful presence such as s 2454 provide that an alien must knowingly be present in viol ation of applicable immigration laws and regulations to be gu ilty of an offense other pr oposals including housepassed hr 4437 do not contain such language so have questioned whether proposals that do not specify requisite intent for unlawful presence would permit some aliens to be held criminally liable even if they had reason to be aware that they had engaged in unlawful activity eg when clerical error by immigration authorities causes an alien to overstay his visa it seems unlikely that court would in terpret any of the proposals criminalizing unlawful presence as imposing scheme of strict liability courts have recognized that the existence of mens rea for criminal offenses is the rule of rather than the exception to the principles of angloamerican criminal jurisprudence17 accordingly courts have generally in terpreted statutes crimina lizing conduct as having mens reahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22413crs6 18 staples v

monterocamargo 208 f3d 1122 1132 9th cir 2000requirement for liability even where the statutory definition did not in terms include it18 given this background it seems likely that reviewing court would interpret statute criminalizing unlawful presence as requiring an offense to be committed knowingly even if the statute does not ex pressly announce this requisite intent for criminal liability racial profiling issues another issue related to the criminalization of unlawful presence concerns whether it might result in the harassment of certain racial and ethnic groups by law enforcement in the 1968 case of terry v ohio the supreme court held that the fourth amendment permits law enforcement officer to stop and briefly detain person when the officer reasonably suspects that the person has committed crime19 reasonable suspicion may not be based on mere hunch but instead upon specific reasonable inferences which the officer is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience20 on several occasions courts have d ecided cases involving law enforcement authorities stopping persons for suspected immigration violations on account of those persons suspected mexican ancestry supr eme court jurisprudence holds that race or ethnicity cannot be the sole factor giving rise to law enforcement stop for suspected immigration violations but that at least in cases near the usmexican border stops may be partially based on race21 nevertheless the court s suggested that different conclusion might have been reached if stops based partially on mexican ancestry occurred in places farther removed from the usmexican border22 in 2000 the ninth circuit sitting banc ruled that the border patrol could not take into account hispanic origin when making stops in southern california c oncluding that in areas in which the majority or even substantial part of the population is hispanic as was the case in southern california the probability that any given hispanic person is an alien let alone an illegal alien is not high nough to make hispanic appearan ce relevant factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus23 in sum court jurisprudence indicates that law enforcement may not stop persons for suspected immigration violations solely on acc ount of such persons race or ethnicity but that at least in certain circumstances suspicion may partially be based on such considerations additional considerations including popul ation demographics may also affect the weight to which suspicions based on race or ethnicity may be permissibly given
