with french president sarkozy ref paris 1844 b paris 1871 classified by cda thomas j white for reasons 14 b d 1 c the meeting between the president and french president nicolas sarkozy in heiligendamm june 6 will be their first official encounter since theninterior minister sarkozy met briefly with the president on september 12 2006 the two presidents will meet on the same day that defense secretary gates and new french defense minister herve morin sipdis commemorate dday on the beaches of normandy frances new president who has promised frances citizens that he will say what he will do and do what he has said has declared that improving frances relationship with the united states is one of his top priorities we should take him at his word and seek to exploit this opening to reinvigorate our strategic relationship with france since close cooperation with france bilaterally within nato at the unsc and through the eu is key force multiplier 2 c that said we will need to take into account the fact that sarkozy was elected president primarily with mandate for domestic reform he will devote his first weeks and months in office to delivering on his promises and implementing that mandate even if sarkozy handily wins the june legislative elections as currently expected he will face vigorous opposition from those with entrenched interests including unions and the coalition of students and their parents who fear loss of frances vaunted social protections in the foreign policy arena as was made clear in his may 16 meeting with german chancellor merkel on the same day he assumed office sarkozy will focus in the short term on the runup to the june 2122 eu council meeting as means of finally reimparting institutional momentum following the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitutional treaty 3 c the president will want to welcome sarkozys election and the possibilities it represents for reforming and reenergizing france and europe while acknowledging the challenges that sarkozy faces in the years ahead sarkozy greatly enjoys political strategizing the basis of his close relationship with uk pm blair and can be expected to talk at some length about his strategy of moving toward the center winning the upcoming legislative elections and pushing through an ambitious reform program in his first months of office 4 c the president should also welcome sarkozys commitment to usfrench relationship based on mutual confidence and candor and will want to address sarkozys desire for frequent contact on the full range of issues we should suggest that nsa hadley would hope to have the same kind of close relationship with sarkozys diplomatic advisor jeandavid levitte and seek sarkozys agreement that they be mandated to begin quiet dialogue on how we might reinvigorate the usfrench strategic relationship including through larger and more positive french leadership role within nato the president can assure sarkozy that this would not be at the expense of the eu we do not see this as zerosum but that we are striving for winwin outcome for both organizations 5 c we believe it is essential for the president to raise two issues in this initial meeting afghanistan and iraq on afghanistan france has been sending mixed signals mfa political director araud has counseled us to try early on to move sarkozy away from chiracs pessimistic view of afghanistan and lay the basis for more activist multifaceted french effort there unfortunately in responding to the taliban hostagetaking of french ngo worker sarkozy suggested that longterm french presence would not be decisive implying that he would consider reducing frances commitments although we have since been assured by levitte that french policy has not changed we believe it is essential to obtain that commitment from sarkozy himself natoisaf requires frances continuing engagement as with bosnia or kosovo when it comes to the alliance it must remain in together and out together 6 c on iraq sarkozy recognizes that an american defeat is also defeat for europe and he told the president that he would help get the us out of iraq we take for granted that at minimum this means that the needling paris 00001995 002 of 002 rhetoric of the past will be dropped including repeated calls to offer horizon for an eventual troop withdrawal beyond that it is extremely unlikely that france would put troops on the ground but the president should seek new level of engagement that could be demonstrated for example by visibly working with arab governments in support of political settlement in iraq france could also raise the level of its representation at and support for the regional conferences with iraqs neighbors now underway 7 c sarkozy is likely to have two priority issues of his own to raise climate change and darfur on the first sarkozy signaled during his election victory speech that climate change was his top priority and he called on the us to take the lead in the fight against global warming sarkozy has stopped short of calling on the us to join kyoto but he publicly advocates the idea of carbon tax on imports from nonkyoto signatories as means of defending europes co2 emissions trading system ets the president should express our interest in enhancing collaboration on climate change with france with view to greater cooperation on positive science and technology agenda 8 c darfur is likely to be highprofile issue for sarkozy and his foreign minister former kosovo czar ngo doctors without borders activist and human rights interventionist bernard kouchner which would permit the sarkozy government to put more of human rights stamp on its foreign policy sarkozy has himself called for greater human rights emphasis in french foreign policy he has been sharply critical of russia on chechnya and opposes the lifting of the eu arms embargo on china on human rights grounds the president should assure sarkozy of our desire to work closely with sarkozy darfur with the aim of reproducing the kind of success we have had together on lebanon 9 c as time permits we would recommend that the president touch on the need to maintain continuity on usfrench cooperation on lebanonsyria and iran including the need to ratchet up sanctions and reinforce them outside the framework if necessary the president should also stress the importance of maintaining western unity on kosovo in the face of russian opposition this might offer chance for brief exchange on russia more generally including on missile defense and lead to brief assessment by sarkozys assessment of eurussia relations sarkozy has much more critical view of russia than did chirac 10 c finally sarkozys opposition to turkish entry into the eu is public and likely unshakeable it is one of his few defining foreign policy issues he has heard our strategic rationale for bringing turkey into the eu but has made clear that whatever the ramifications of keeping turkey out he opposes bringing 70 million muslims into europe further diluting its identity and exacerbating frances own sensitive immigration issue although he puts his argument in terms of turkey is in asia minor not europe the president while noting that this is an issue that only the eu can decide should nonetheless seek to persuade sarkozy to avoid any early or dramatic closing of the door not taking decision at this time would allow the accession negotiations so indispensable to turkeys own internal reforms to proceed uninterrupted please visit paris classified website at
