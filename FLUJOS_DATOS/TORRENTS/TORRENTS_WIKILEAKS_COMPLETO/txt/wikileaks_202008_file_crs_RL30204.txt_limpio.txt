increase of 171 billion above fy1999 and 18 billion above the administrations request during action leading to completion of the bill the house approved appropriations of 44156 billion for fy2000 while the senate approved 44351 billion the administrations fy2000 budget requested 42538 billion while the number of veterans is declining va entitlement spending will rise by 18 million in fy2000 to 23397 billion much of this increase results from liberalizations during fy1999 to the montgomery gi bill the primary education program also the enacted bill includes estimated funding for new homeless program under vas entitlement authority for veterans housing assistance appropriations for medical care increased by 17 billion congress approved 42625 billion in appropriations for va for fy1999 up from 4098 billion for fy1998 after incorporating supplemental appropriations and various reestimates of mandatory spending for that year the administration had requested 4215 billion for fy1999 fy2000 congressional budget resolution the house approved an amendment to its version of the fy2000 budget resolution that called for an increase of 11 billion over the amount that the administration requested for medical care the senate approved an amendment calling for 3 billion more for those programs final passage of the budget resolution contained language calling for 17 billion more in medical care funding for additional information on va programs see crs report rl30099 veterans issues in the 106th congress by dennis snook table 3 department of veterans affairs appropriations fy1995 to fy1999 budget authority in billions of current fy1995 fy1996 fy1997 fy1998 fy1999 3723 3811 4033 4241 4263 source budget levels remain uncertain until all program experience has been recorded and any supplemental appropriations or rescissions have been taken into consideration thus fy199598 figures are from budget submissions of subsequent years estimates of fy1999 spending are from hrept 106379 the conference report accompanying hr 2684 to final passage va cash benefits spending for va cash benefit programs is mandatory and amounts requested by the budget are based on projected caseloads definitions of eligibility and benefit levels are in law for fy2000 cbo projects that 234 billion will be required for these entitlements mostly serviceconnected compensation meanstested pensions and montgomery gibill education payments for the most crs4 part declining caseloads for pensions and education benefits have been decreasing program obligations from yeartoyear for fy2000 however this lower trend for education programs will be largely offset because pl 105178 increased montgomery gibill benefits by 20 for fy1999 congress appropriated 234 billion for va entitlement programs va appropriations for fy1998 included 221 billion for va entitlements veterans housing benefits historically the opportunity for veterans to have home loans guaranteed by the federal government was significant contribution to the national goal of increasing the number of families who owned their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the guarantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans were obligations of the federal government that constituted mandatory spending administrative expenses are discretionary appropriations transferred from the home loan programs to the general operating expenses account guaranteed transitional housing loans for homeless veterans program account pl 105368 the veterans programs enhancement act of 1998 established pilot project to expand the supply of transitional housing for homeless veterans the program was authorized to guarantee up to 15 loans with maximum aggregate value of 100 million with more than 5 loans guaranteed during the first 3 years these housing plans must enforce sobriety standards as well as provide various supportive services such as substance abuse counseling and job readiness skills workshops residents would pay reasonable fee to reside in the project homes pl 10674 includes an estimate that 4825 million for program costs for the program will be required during fy2000 based on the loan limitation of 100 million medical care house and senate bills both passed their respective chambers after total of 17 billion was added to the administrations request of 173 billion for va medical care for fy2000 in the senate 600 million of the additional appropriation was deemed to be emergency spending thereby excluding that amount from 302b spending cap limitations for the bill the administration had requested the same amount as had been appropriated for fy1999 freeze in part intended to force efficiencies within the va medical system in addition the administration assumed that 749 million more medical care funding would be provided in fy2000 from the medical care cost recovery mccf fund the congressional budget office cbo estimates this amount to be 608 million the mccf collects payments from insurance companies with joint coverage of veterans receiving care in va facilities and from veterans obligated for costsharing of their va medical care cbo estimates mccf collections for fy1999 to be 583 million congress appropriated 17057 billion in funds for va medical care for fy1998 increasing patient load and expanding access for several years va has been expanding access to medical services by transferring medical personnel slots from inpatient settings to more efficient outpatient care venues as result the unique patient count has increased by onethird in 3 fiscal years yet va estimates that it will eliminate another 7000 to 8000 positions in the medical care system during fy2000 the house committees report hrept 106286 expresses concern that crs5 too many additional veterans are being promised services without adequate personnel to serve them and calls for careful review to determine if it is premature to permit enrollment to all veterans who apply to va health care plans the report recommended passage of proposal to coordinate va services with medicare medicare subvention to help alleviate this problem saying that the va has repeatedly demonstrated capacity to treat patents at lower cost than most medicare providers while producing better health outcomes the report also called for continuing to expand communitybased outpatient access so that the number of patients that could be served within resource limitations will be maximized and will occur closer to where veterans live the senate report srept 106161 generally agreed with the house position and notes that vas budget was not predicated on detailed assessment of requirements and analysis of the specific reductions which would occur were conducted the report cited the administrations budget estimated reduction of 6949 personnel slots in fy2000 yet pointed out that vas own studies indicate that the reduction would be nearer to 13000 slots which the report suggested is an unacceptable level given the tremendous growth in the number of veterans being served in va outpatient clinics in the conference report hrept 106379 conferees also addressed one of the issues driving interest in medicare subvention access to needed care for veterans in remote areas while subvention proposals vary in their method for addressing the needs of veterans living substantial distances from va facilities many advocates of coordination between va and medicare envision system in which veterans could get needed care from providers nearer to where they live with the contracted costs paid directly by va or indirectly by medicare when appropriate va health plans would determine the circumstances in which such care could be more efficiently and effectively provided by contracting outside va with local medical services the conference report directs va to study and report to congress by february 1 2000 whether veterans in rural areas experience access and transportation difficulties and whether such difficulties serve as barrier to their health care the requested study must examine whether vas current resource allocation system contributes to the problem of rural access as the relatively few rural veterans may be experiencing lower quality care as va searches to find efficiency savings the report also requests proposal for dealing with the problems of rural access response to hepatitis c hcv evidence suggests that veterans have substantially higher infection rate for this dangerous communicable disease and veterans groups and some health care professionals advocate more aggressive stance by va to combat the threat specific dollar amount is appropriated under hr 2684 but the house urged va to establish vigorous program of testing and treatmentbroadly available to veterans and to use all available therapies in the most clinically appropriate and cost effective manner the senate estimated that 350 million would be needed to treat veterans suffering from hepatitis c with new and costly therapy conferees urge the va to make testing and treatment for hepatitis c broadly available to all veterans crs6 medical research the house approved 326 million for medical and prosthetic research in fy2000 up 10 million from fy1999 about onehalf of the additional funds would be used for the purpose of establishing publicprivate partnership to improve diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer one of the most common diseases of american veterans the senate report emphasized the need to intensify research efforts on the relationship between acid reflux and lower esophagealupper stomach cancer rise which has the committee concerned both reports also encouraged va to use research funds to further research into the treatment of hcv the administration had proposed freeze on research funds at 316 million and the senate bill endorsed that level conferees compromised the differences providing 321 million for medical research for additional information on va medical care see crs report 97786 veterans medical care major changes underway by dennis snook va construction conferees approved 65 million for major construction and 160 million for minor construction projects with an estimated cost under 4 million the house bill had approved 137 million for major and minor construction projects comprised of 35 million for major construction and 102 million for minor construction the senate bill included 70 million for major projects and 175 million for minor construction total of 245 million the administration requested 235 million for new construction projects comprised of 60 million for major construction and 175 million for minor construction many of the minor construction projects will continue vas overall strategy of expanding outpatient access most of the larger proposed projects will improve existing facilities 13 million recommended by the administration for surgical suite to be added to the kansas city facility was rejected by the house but endorsed by the senate and accepted by conferees 175 million proposed by the administration for spinal cord injury treatment and rehabilitation capabilities at the tampa florida hospital was included in both bills the senate added 10 million to facilitate additional planning for the disposition of underutilized hospital space or otherwise superfluous capital assets conferees accepted the senates proposal for fy1999 congress provided 317 million in new construction project funding for fy1998 congress appropriated 353 million for new construction and redirected to outpatient access projects 321 million that had been previously authorized and appropriated for new hospital in california program administration the house bill had proposed 886 million to fund the general operating expenses goe account for administering va benefit programs during fy2000 and approved the administrations request of 61 million for administering the medical programs the administration requested 912 million for goe after accepting certain minor accounting changes requested by the administration the senate essentially approved the va request for administrative expenses for medical and benefit programs conferees adopted the senates proposed levels for goe and trimmed 1 million from its proposed level for medical administration

legislative proposal in its fy2000 budget for the creation of 5year pilot capital asset fund caf that would allow va to sell transfer or exchange excess and underutilized properties collecting the proceeds in this asset fund for use in the disposal or conversion to other uses of superfluous assets primarily hospital facilities ten percent of the caf proceeds would be transferred to hud to be used for homeless assistance programs va estimated that the caf would receive 18 million annually from 2001 through 2004 and requested 10 million in startup funds for fy2000 neither house included the proposed caf but conferees did accept the senates proposed 10 million for capital asset planning as an earmark in the major construction account department of housing and urban development the administration requested 2805 billion for the department of housing and urban development hud in fy2000 this amount is estimated by cbo to be 397 billion more than the appropriation of 2408 billion for hud for fy1999 the house approved 2607 billion for hud in fy2000 approximately 2 billion decrease from the fy2000 request and 2 billion increase above the fy1999 appropriation the senate approved

advance fy2001 funding and offset by 22 billion in rescissions from spending appropriated for previous fiscal years the hud total included in the housepassed bill appeared to signal substantial increase over the fy1999 appropriations level but dissenters to the house appropriations committee report hrept 106286 claimed that reductions in hud programs below the prior years level are spread throughout the bill1 the reports dissenters claimed that the fy1999 fund level was artificially held down by rescissions and that the bill actually recommended 945 million below hard freeze supporters of the house position pointed out that the administrations fy2000 hud budget proposed an advance appropriation of 42 billion unavailable for expenditure before fy2001 move the house refused to endorse in part the house bill proposed to increase overall funding for the vahud bill by limiting tennessee valley authority tva borrowing for an estimated savings of 3 billion such an accounting device may have been used to offset increased hud spending without exceeding the 302b allocations for the entire bill 1 hrept 106286 p 127 crs9 for fy1999 president clinton requested 248 billion for hud the house approved 261 billion and the senate approved 241 billion the house and senate differed in amounts appropriated for components of the housing certificate fund and in their treatment of federal housing authority fha administrative expenses as well as in various earmarks and program subcategories in conference more funding than was approved by either the house or the senate for the housing certificate fund was adopted in part because of reforms in federal housing programs contained in title v of the legislation for fy1999 103 billion was provided for the housing certificate fund reduced

in advanced appropriations for use beginning in october 2000 with 22 billion in recaptured funds and carryovers from previous years and 183 million transferred from the annual contributions for assisted housing account if the administrations funding request had been granted 139 billion would have been available for the housing certificate fund in fy2000 of which 42 billion would actually first become available for expenditure in fy2001 the largest portion of the administrations request for new funding was for section 82 contract renewals 64 billion in fy2000 and 42 billion to be used after october 1 2000 of the remainder 347 million was to be set aside for incremental vouchers for section 8 families and the homeless 144 million for welfaretowork vouchers 156 million for tenant protection assistance 209 million for contract administration 6 million for administrative fees and 20 million for regional opportunity counseling 2 section 8 of the housing act of 1937 as amended provides subsidies for rental housing for lowincome families crs10 the house bill included 1054 billion for the housing certificate fund in fy2000 of this amount 25 million could have been used for section 8 tenantbased rental assistance for disabled families who chose to move from public housing now designated for elderly residents language in the house committees report also directed hud to provide relocation vouchers for families being displaced due to the demolition or revitalization of public housing under the hope vi program hud estimated that this assistance would cost approximately 30 million funded through the housing certificate fund for the most part however the house bill and its accompanying report did not specify how money in the hcf would be allocated or conversely how various subclassifications dependent on the hcf for funding would be expected to absorb the implied cutbacks the senate bill provided 1105 billion for the housing certificate fund the bill included the administrations request that an advance appropriation of 42 billion be provided for the remainder costs of contracts renewed in fy2000 for the months requiring section 8 assistance in fy2001 the senate bill also included 100 million to cover the costs of bringing below market rental contracts up to market the bill assumed that 205 billion in recaptures would be carried over from fy1999 and become available for section 8 renewals in fy2000 conferees approved 1138 billion for the housing certificate fund in fy2000 this appropriation includes 1083 billion for the renewal of section 8 expiring contracts 156 million for tenant protection and 347 million for incremental vouchers as requested by the president and 40 million for vouchers for the disabled the conferees did not provide appropriations to fund the presidents request for welfare towork vouchers regional opportunity counseling or additional funds for section 8 contract administration expiring rental contracts the administration proposed 1064 billion for the renewal of all section 8 contracts due to expire in fy2000 for fy1999 congress had approved 96 billion for section 8 contract renewals hud identified approximately 24 billion in recaptured and carryover monies from fy1999 including 183 million transferred from the annual contributions for assisted housing account which it assumed could also be used to renew section 8 contracts in fy2000 bringing the total available for renewals to 13 billion hud estimated that this amount would be sufficient to renew expiring contracts for 2383687 units3 however the 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 10631 rescinded 350 million of the section 8 reserve fund congress said that it would restore these funds to hud when needed for the fy2000 section 8 contract renewals hud expected to continue to renew these contracts through the markto market restructuring program established in the vahud 1998 appropriations act and estimates that millions of dollars will be saved that otherwise would be expended on contracts inflated beyond market rates given the aforementioned remark in hrept 106286 that 25 million of the recommended 1054 billion would be used for tenantbased assistance to the disabled 3 us department of housing and urban development congressional justifications for 2000 estimates p p2 crs11 it appeared that the house bill would have provided 1029 billion for section 8 contract renewals in fy2000 thus under the house bill except for the one recommendation the various subclassifications administered by hud through the hcf would have been expected to absorb shortfalls according to plan developed within hud rather than by the congress through language adopted during the appropriations process the senate bill allocated 10855 billion for section 8 contract renewals and the senate report stated hud is authorized to provide sticky or enhanced vouchers which permit current residents of such project to be subsidized based on the market rent for dwelling unit in the project tenants shall remain eligible for sticky vouchers so long as they continue to live in the same projects this upgrading of contracts entailed limit 30 of adjusted gross income on how much of the new contracts tenants would have to pay hud was urged to make every effort to renew the expiring section 8 contracts which are attached to this assisted housing especially those projects located in low vacancy areas including those in high cost urban areas and rural areas and especially those projects that serve the elderly and persons with disabilities the conferees appropriated 1083 billion for the renewal of section 8 contracts in fy2000 in an effort to encourage owners of projects to renew their contracts conferees included provision that permits marktomarket contract renewals at comparable market rate levels or higher for projects meeting certain criteria this provision is discussed under the subsection housing for the elderly and disabled for more information on expiring contracts and the restructuring program please see the following crs report 97264 the problem of section 8 expiring contracts by susan vanhorenbeck and crs report 971002 hud multifamily reform section 8 restructuring by susan vanhorenbeck section 8 contract amendments the perceived need for section 8 contract amendments resulted because funding was insufficient to maintain projects that originated during the 1970s and 1980s and which were built through longterm projectbased contracts usually written for terms up to 40 years the current practice of providing contracts for 1year term could eliminate the need for amendments to these contracts however some older contracts remain and in many cases managers cannot maintain their housing inventory without additional funds provided through amendments to existing contracts the administration did not request any additional funding for section 8 amendments in fy2000 contending that recaptured section 8 funds from previous years will be sufficient to fund any necessary amendments to section 8 contracts in fy2000 conferees agreed with this assessment and funds were provided for fy2000 in fy1999 the administration requested 13 billion in funding for section 8 amendments congress disagreed with the request and funding was also not provided for amendments to contracts in fy1999 section 8 tenantprotection assistance the administration assumes that not all owners of section 8 assisted housing are willing to renew expiring contracts and the housing certificate fund provides assistance to affected families when contract renewal does not take place the administration requested 134 million for housing tenants protection in fy2000 which was to be used to subsidize tenants displaced crs12 through optouts termination of contracts or property dispositions the administration estimated that this amount would aid approximately 27000 families another 22 million was requested for multifamily enforcement which provides protection for tenants facing additional costs of revised policies in multifamily housing this funding was to be used for enhanced vouchers relocation assistance and similar support bringing the total fy2000 request for tenant protection in fy2000 to 156 million in fy1999 434 million was appropriated for this purpose the house bill did not provide funding for enhanced vouchers or tenant relocation assistance however the house committees report stated that 25 million of the housing certificate fund appropriation could be used to provide relocation vouchers for disabled families who chose to move out of public housing now designated for occupancy by the elderly the house report also directed hud to provide relocation vouchers for families displaced by hope vi revitalization the senate committees report specified that 40 million was to be made available from the hcf for these disabled families in addition to the 156 million requested by the administration for tenant protection assistance conferees agreed with the senate bill and provided 156 million in tenant protection assistance and 40 million for vouchers for the disabled section 8 vouchers the administration requested total of 491 million to fund 85000 incremental vouchers in fy2000 including 243 million for 42000 section 8 vouchers to help those renters in worst case need defined as rent equal to more than 50 of tenants incomes or conditions determined to be substandard 144 million for 25000 section 8 vouchers to help families make the transition from welfareto work and 104 million for 18000 section 8 vouchers to help homeless persons making the transition from continuum of care facilities to permanent housing in fy1999 283 million was provided for 50000 housing vouchers all of these were used for the welfaretowork initiative neither version of hr 2684 provided funding for incremental vouchers or welfaretowork vouchers however conferees provided 347 million for approximately 60000 incremental vouchers the amount requested by the president contract administration the administration requested 209 million to contract out duties currently performed by hud staff including annual physical inspections of properties review of management financial statements and occupancy and release of replacement reserves in recent years the number of hud personnel has been declining and the administration would like to reserve remaining hud staff for duties which it believes should only be performed by federal employees the administration also asked for 6 million for an anticipated administrative fee increase for the section 8 program this increase was approved in the quality housing and work responsibility act of 1998 neither version of hr 2684 funded this increase or the request for contract administration and conferees did not provide such funds regional opportunity counseling the president requested 20 million for the regional opportunity counseling roc program in fy2000 the program which seeks to expand the housing opportunities of lowincome families living in high poverty crs13 neighborhoods funds special counseling conducted by public housing agencies in partnership with local nonprofit agencies in fy1999 10 million was provided for regional counseling neither version of hr 2684 provided funding for regional opportunity counseling and there is funding provision in the final conference agreement public housing programs the quality housing and work responsibility act of 1998 consolidated all public housing capital programs except hope vi into one public housing capital fund the act also directs hud to develop new formula to allocate resources of the public housing operating fund for fy2000 in the event that new formula for that fund has not been completed in time fy2000 funds would be distributed using the existing formula for fy2000 the administration requested 3003 billion for the public housing operating fund 255 billion for the public housing capital fund 310 million for drug elimination grants and 625 million for the hope vi program both versions of the bill provided 2555 billion for the public housing capital fund the house bill provided 2818 billion for the public housing operating fund the senate provided 29 billion the house bill provided 290 million for the drug elimination grant program the senate bill funded the requested 310 million and the house bill provided 575 million for the hope vi program the senate bill 500 million the final bill appropriates 29 billion for the public housing capital fund and 31 billion for the public housing operating fund both of these amounts exceed the request of the president the bill also provides 310 million for drug elimination grants and 575 million for the hope vi program the fy1999 appropriations provided 2818 billion for the public housing operating fund 3 billion for public housing capital fund 310 million for the drug elimination grant program and 625 million for the hope vi program quality housing and work responsibility act during house floor action on the fy1999 vahud appropriations bill an amendment was adopted that attached the essential language of the housing opportunity and responsibility act sweeping reform of federal housing assistance programs that had passed both chambers but had not been reported from conference committee conferees on the fy1999 vahud appropriations bill deliberated issues in the two versions of the housing reform language and with participation of the administration completed work on this major authorization of federal housing programs under the new law wellrun public housing agencies have more freedom to operate poorly run agencies can be held more accountable more working families with higher incomes live in public housing that is now largely occupied by the poorest of the poor and some residents are required to perform 8 hours month of community service in both public housing and section 8 programs it is now easier to evict tenants who commit crimes and cause problems home rule flexible grant demonstration program allows some local governments rather than public housing agencies to receive federal housing funds to develop creative approaches for providing crs14 affordable housing new section 8 housing voucher program is more landlord friendly and more marketdriven most provisions in the new law became effective october 1 1999 for further information on this significant change in federal housing policy see crs report 98860 housing the poor federal housing programs for lowincome families by morton j schussheim and crs report 98868 public housing and section 8 reforms the quality housing and work responsibility act of 1998 by richard bourdon leadbased paint reduction the administration requested 80 million for the leadbased paint reduction program for fy2000 the same amount that was appropriated for the program in fy1999 in fy1997 and 1998 this program was funded as setaside of the community development block grant cdbg fund and earlier it was funded under the annual contribution for assisted housing account the fy2000 budget proposal requests that all lead hazard balances from these accounts be transferred to the lead hazard account the house version of hr 2684 provided 70 million for leadbased paint reduction in fy2000 decrease of 10 million from the fy1999 funding and the administrations request for fy2000 the senate version funded the administrations request in addition the house bill would have funded the healthy homes initiative at 75 million 25 million below the administration request and the fy1999 level while the senate bill approved the requested amount the enacted bill included 80 million for leadbased paint reduction for fy2000 the same as requested by the administration housing for the elderly and disabled the president requested 660 million for housing assistance for the elderly in fy2000 the administration proposed combining new and existing hud programs to help subsidize full range of housing options for the elderly of the 660 million requested for fy2000 510 million would be used for the section 202 supportive housing program 100 million for new initiative which would provide capital grants to convert projects to assisted living facilities and 50 million to expand the service coordinator program and provide renewal money for congregate housing services in fy1999 660 million was appropriated for housing for the elderly under the section 202 supportive housing program the budget also proposed 87 million in new mandatory spending to be used for 15000 vouchers for the elderly these vouchers were to be given to states to subsidize units developed under the lowincome housing tax credit program4 the house bill included 660 million for the section 202 program for fy2000 the same level as the fy1999 appropriation in its report the house committee expressed concern with the future crisis facing housing for the elderly but it did not 4 for further information on lowincome housing tax credits see crs report rs20337 the lowincome housing tax credit current issues and proposed legislation by richard bourdon crs15 recommend the funding of assisted living facilities through the section 202 program the report endorsed the continuum of care approach of providing services to residents of assisted housing to enable lowincome and frail elderly to obtain decent housing and the services they require the senate version of the bill added 50 million to the requested amount approving 710 million for the elderly under this program the administration also requested 194 million for housing for the disabled section 811 for fy2000 the same amount as provided for fy1999 to assure flexibility and choice in housing for the disabled less than 25 but more than 50 of the funding was to be used to provide the disabled with tenantbased vouchers the house bill included the requested 194 million for the section 811 program in fy2000 although its report states concerns about huds proposal to expand the percentage of funding directed to tenantbased rental assistance the report directs hud to use more than 25 of section 811 funding for tenantbased assistance in fy2000 the senate approved 201 million for the disabled after 7 million was added by floor amendment the conference report added new title title v to the vahud appropriations bill which amends housing authorization laws title v authorizes funding of 911 million for housing for the elderly and disabled in fy2000 710 million is authorized for section 202 supportive housing for the elderly and 201 million is authorized for section 811 supportive housing for the disabled title v also authorizes 50 million to repair and convert housing projects for the elderly into assisted living facilities and 50 million to renew all grants made in previous years for service coordinators and congregate services in public housing for fy2000 this 100 million is to be taken from the 710 million appropriated for the section 202 program title v does much more than authorize appropriated funds for the elderly and the disabled it combines provisions of three bills hr 202 hr 1336 and hr 1624 and is consistent with number of provisions in the senate bill s 1319 these bills all sought to secure affordable housing for the elderly disabled and lowincome families in the 21st century title v is intended to protect existing residents of federallyassisted housing from being forced to move out of their homes in the face of market rate rent increases it provides for the development of affordable assisted living facilities from section 202 public housing and section 236 projects and it encourages the preservation of affordable housing by renewing section 8 contracts at marketrate rent levels when necessary for more information on housing for the elderly see crs report rl30247 housing for the elderly legislation in the 106th congress by susan vanhorenbeck homeless assistance grants the presidents budget requested 1025 billion for homeless assistance including 5 million for demonstration project except for the 5 million project these funds would be used for competitive homeless assistance grants and represent an increase of 45 million or 44 over that enacted for fy1999 hud estimated that with this proposed budget there would be 150000 transitional beds funded by the end of 2000 in addition to 80000 permanent beds all linked to supportive services crs16 the final bill provides 102 billion for homeless assistance grants virtually the same as the administrations request this is the same as proposed by the senate but 50 million more than the amount the house had recommended conferees require that at least 30 of the appropriations be used for permanent housing as proposed by the senate in addition 25 match would be required by grantees for funding for services as proposed by the senate the final bill also accepts the senates language that directs hud to review any previously obligated amounts of assistance that remain unspent and to deobligate the funds if the contracts are unlikely to be performed under final language in the bill hud would merge all of the balances from separate homeless assistance program accounts of past years including emergency shelter grants supportive housing shelter plus care section 8 moderate rehabilitation single room occupancy supplemental assistance for facilities to assist the homeless and innovative homeless initiatives demonstration accounts into one homeless assistance grants account to more efficiently utilize recaptured funds and streamline the department up to 1 of appropriated funds could be used for technical assistance to help grantees overcome variety of problems as proposed by the senate the conferees direct hud to ensure that state and local jurisdictions pass on at least 50 of all administrative funds to the nonprofit organizations administering the homeless assistance programs housing for persons with aids hopwa the president requested 240 million for hopwa in fy2000 15 million more than provided for the program in fy1999 hopwa provides grants to states localities and nonprofit organizations to meet the housing need of individuals with hivaids and their families the administration contends the funding increase is necessary to support the program in several jurisdictions that become newly eligible in fy2000 for assistance under the program formula it estimates that 240 million would support approximately 43990 housing units the house bill provided 225 million for hopwa in fy2000 15 million below the administrations request and level with the fy1999 appropriation the senate version provided 232 million for hopwa including 7 million added by senate floor amendment the home investment partnership program the home program makes funds

conference report the conferees directed hud to develop process for measuring the performance of housing counseling agencies urging hud to include performance measurement requirements into future notices of funding availability for the housing counseling program absent information on the use of funds and the performance of grantees the crs17 conferees noted that in future years the program may be subject to further funding reductions the appropriation also included 5 million for management information systems as proposed by the house the administration had requested 7 million and the senate did not include funding for this category the appropriation does include an earmark of 2 million for the national housing development corporation to demonstrate innovative methods of preserving affordable housing the administration had requested 25 million for the creation of the regional affordable housing initiative as pilot program to address critical housing needs in targeted regions this proposal was not funded native american block grants under the native american block grant eligible indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities receive funds which can be used for

superfund program the administrations proposed fy2000 levels in the state and tribal assistance grants would have provided onethird less for capitalizing state and local wastewater needs thereby prompting considerable controversy during hearings before epas appropriators this year two factors drove this interest the programs widespread popularity among all states and many localities and major remaining capital needs epa estimates these remaining needs to be in the 100 billion to 200 billion range the association of metropolitan sewerage agencies judges the needs to be roughly 300 billion the controversy did not extend to the other major activity capitalizing state drinking water funds which would have increased under the proposal from 775 million to 825 million funding for special
