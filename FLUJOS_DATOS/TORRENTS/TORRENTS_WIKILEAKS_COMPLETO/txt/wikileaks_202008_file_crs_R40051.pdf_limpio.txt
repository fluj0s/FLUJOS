3839bb1 and was reauthorized and amended in both the 2002 and 2008 farm bills1 the current whip authority extends through fy2012 the purpose of whip is to enable eligible participants to develop habitat for upland wildlife wetland wildlife threatened and endangered species fish and other types of wildlife in an environmentally beneficial and costeffective manner usdas natural resources conservation service nrcs establishes national priorities that reflect national wildlife concerns these priorities along with other resource factors are used at the national level to allocate funding to states the current national priorities set in 2008 by nrcs are as follows promote the restoration of declining or important native wildlife habitats protect restore develop or enhance wildlife habitat of atrisk species candidate species and state and federally listed threatened and endangered species reduce the impacts of invasive species on wildlife habitats and protect restore develop or enhance declining or important aquatic wildlife species habitats nrcs also works at the state and local level to set wildlife priorities each state develops whip plan to establish priorities and coordinate nrcs activities with those of other agencies and groups state technical committees advise nrcs state conservationists 2 on whip priorities and the state whip plan this coordination also encourages the leveraging of other state federal and private sources of funding to address state and local wildlife concerns generally states select two to six priority habitat types which consistently include one or more upland and riparian habitats priorities set at the national state and local levels are factors in deciding which contracts will be accepted

recommendations for habitat improvements through various practices and becomes the basis of the contract between nrcs and the participant examples of practices authorized under whip include native grassland seeding prescribed burns hardwood planting and fish passage structure installation nrcs provides costshare payments based on the implementation of practices identified in the contract these payments can cover up to 75 of the cost of implementing the practice contracts usually vary in length from 5 to 10 years depending on the number and type of practices being installed in fy2008 more than 646000 acres were enrolled through more than 3000 contracts3 whip also provides additional costshare up to 100 of the cost to landowners who are willing to enter into contracts of 15 years or longer for practices affecting essential plant and animal habitat the 2002 farm bill limited funding for these contracts to more than 15 of the amount authorized annually for whip this limit was increased in the 2008 farm bill to more than 25 of the authorized annual funding nrcs reports that on average it reimburses participants approximately 14900 for each longterm contract lasting 15 years or longer between fy2004 and fy2007 longterm contracts totaled close to 500 accounting for almost 4 of whip contracts and 10 of whip acreage shortterm contracts less than 5 years are also allowed but

highlights these states and their funding between fy2003 and fy2008 why these particular states receive the highest level of funding from year to year may be due to veral different factors one factor could be the regional equity provision in the 2002 farm bill which mandates that each state receive annually minimum aggregate amount of funding for specified conservation programs 8 in fy2007 all four states that received the highest level of funding fell under this provision second factor could be the location of speciesspecific initiatives since fy2004 nrcs has conducted series of

of 85 million annually as shown in table 1 the authorized funding level has remained at 85 million annually since fy2005 however annual appropriations acts have reduced the actual funding levels by almost onehalf 10 with the 111th congress facing tighter budget constraints similar cuts to whip could be considered either in the appropriations process or if budget reconciliation is required

eligible acres in traditionally high participation states language was added requiring whip to be used for the development of wildlife habitat on private agricultural land nonindustrial private forest land and tribal lands the addition of this language reverses the previous interpretation by nrcs which extended eligibility to all privately owned land tribal land statelocal government land or federal land 11 by previously offering support for wildlife habitat projects on all land and aquatic areas wh ip provided an assistance option to landowners who were unable to meet the specific eligibility requirements of other usda conservation programs the new requirement of agricultural production will likely shift financial assistance for whip contracts away from the traditionally large allocation states see table 2 and figure 1 to more agriculturally intensive states the impact of the change in eligibility cannot fully be analyzed until nrcs releases revision of whip rules and policy 10 fy2008 is an exception because congress passed several extension bills allowing the program to continue operation at full authorized funding levels until the 2008 farm bill pa ssed funding levels authori zed in extensions were not reduced by appropriations 11 state and local government land could only be used on limited basis and federal lands were only eligible when the primary benefit was on private lands and the project could not meet its objectives without involving the federal land

one reason for this funding expansion was the sizable number of pending applications that exceed available funding limitations on funding in annual appropriations have reduced this authorized increase and contributed to the continuing backlog of unfunded applications 12 table 3 shows the percentage of total contracts funded for fy200 3fy2008 though the backlog gap is narrowing whip continues to have backlog of over 1600 applications13 some considered the large unfunded application backlog strong argument for additional funding in the 2008 farm bill however authorized levels remain at 85 million annually if congress again limits annual funding through appropriations or budget reconcil iation the actual level of funding could be significantly less than the authorized level and increase the backlog on the other hand the recent eligibility changes from the 2008 farm bill will reduce the number of eligible acres for whip and possibly reduce the backlog of unfunded applications 12 the backlog of unfunded applications does not include applications that are incomplete or rejected applications in the backlog represent complete and eligible applications that could be ranked and funded at the state level if funding were available 13 at the conclusion of fy2008 states with the highest average of unfunded applications are oklahoma 397 iowa 143 arkansas 136 kentucky 103 and alabama 103

species or habitat other organizations representing broader wildlife interests eg association of fish and wildlife agencies are supportive of localized priority funding levels with the occasional national speciesspecific focus the interest of these organizations in additional speciesspecific or habitatspecific funding was partially addressed in the 2008 farm bill through additional language regarding priority for certain conservation initiatives the farm bill encourages but did not require usda to give priority to whip projects that address issues raised by state regional and national conservation initiatives 14 the farm bills conference report hrept 110627 further directed usda to c onsider the goals and objectives of wildlife conservation initiatives15 when establishing state and national program priorities scoring criteria focus areas and other special initiatives and to work with other state and federal agencies to complement wildlife conservation initiatives through usda programs the extent to which usda will follow this directive language remains to be seen however any progress will likely be monitored by several interested wildlife organizations 14 whip has history of funding speciesspecific habitat initiatives beginning in fy2004 with salmon habitat restoration initiative national speciesspecific initiatives have dropped off in r ecent years while state and local level initiatives have continued 15 hrept 110627 listed examples of state regional and national conservation initiatives including the north american waterfowl management plan the national fish habitat action plan the greater sagegrouse conservation strategy the state comprehensive wildlife conservation st rategies also referred to as the state wildlife action plans the northern bobwhite
