lrh congress lecture successes i had finally hit wall i had more solutions for anything i had tried them all and i just couldnt see any way forward im usually pretty good at working things out in my life but i had finally hit wall i had more solutions for anything i had tried them all and i just couldnt see any way forward i told my husband tomorrow morning we are listening to the new lectures referring to the universe processes congress and we are going to do the processes there we were early in the morning i played the second cd with ron delivering the auditing after 12 hour of objective processing ron then starts to talk about being the problem and then unbeing the problem well my husband and i started laughing right there we were certainly being the problem everything in our lives was one great big ridge we followed the commands of the process and then all of sudden i could feel myself expanding beyond the problem not lot but tiny 12 inch above what i had been stuck in i felt little free and i could feel the shift in viewpoint for the first time in weeks i could tell that i would be able to start solving what i had conceived as unsolvable i had pushed myself until everything was one great big ball and now i was finally getting free i was ever so grateful for getting these tapes and started getting things going in good direction again thank you so much lrh ah the ta has been moving majorly in my life since i started these i just finished the 11th lecture and the ta has been moving majorly in my life since i started these i didnt realize how much until i would listen to the next and see it was exactly what ive been running into in life about halfway through i noticed my level of operation was changing and it struck how different i had become i was floored that the data felt like high level auditing the group processing isnt for the faint hearted and you begin to operate as thetan more and more and it really lets you drill in using some theta perceptions and you become more able to direct flows in the physical universe as result the data on granting beingness has also given some tools to help my auditors and tech terminals audit with more affinity and care for others which will help to crack any case matter how rough with good tech and arc alone i feel with all the data and processing in these lectures we can all move towards granting life to all things in manner as lrh did which lets us become more ourselves ch 2006 bridge publications inc all rights reserved click here for copyright and trademark information mailed from bridge publications 4751 fountain ave angeles ca 90029
