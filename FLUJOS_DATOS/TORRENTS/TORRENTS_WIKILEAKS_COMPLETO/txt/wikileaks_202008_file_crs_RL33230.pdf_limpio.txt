proposals have been made to extend the combat zone income tax exclusion to civilian employees who are on active service in combat zone under present tax law the designation of an area as combat zone confers tax benefits only to military personnel serving in the co mbat area comparable provision under present tax law provides tax relief for civilian or c ontract employees serving in combat however certain income tax exclusions exist for us citizens who work overseas as an example the proposed combat zone exclusions in the federal employee combat zone tax parity act hr 1974 and s 1166 would grant added tax relief to federal civilians who are not eligible for existing exclusions in the case of extending an exclusion to federal civilian employees or civilian contract employees serving in combattype zone the primary issues revolve around the purpose of the extension which s not been stated by proponents the purpose could be to provide additional compensation for certain individuals serving in combat and thus facilitate recruitment for such work alternatively the purpose could be one of equity to make civilian employee benefits equal to those of the armed forces if the purpose of the extension is to provide additional compensation to individuals serving in combat than question of efficiency arises as to whether tax subsidy is more appropriate than direct payment direct spending programs are often more successful at fulfilling policy objectives than indirect subsidies made through the tax system if the purpose of extending the combat z one exclusion to civilians is to make civilian benefits equal to those of the ar med forces then the distinctions between military service and civ ilian employment beco important in the analysis of the policy in that context it has been observed that military personnel cannot resign when facing danger they cannot refuse assi gnment they are considered to be on duty 24 hours day every day and they may be required to work until the job is done with specific relationship to comp ensation whereas military personnel must perform those duties civilian employees may or may not depending on for whom they work or the contracts they have negotiated and those c ontracts could include monetary and other incentives for working in combat zones not available to military personnel also there are distinctions between civilian dod employees and civilian contractors that complicate the issue of equalization this report provides inform ation about the tax treatment of both the earned income of members of the armed

provisions while other states tax laws address the matter differently for instance in the state of michigan all military pay is exempt however in the state of mississippi enlisted service members may

the existing exclusions us federal civilian employees who work overseas can exclude certain special allowances under section 912 of the internal revenue code irc the allowances are primarily for the general cost of living abroad housing education and travel section 911 of the irc permits other us citizens nonfederal employees to exclude up to 82400 in foreign earned income and certain housing expenditures the exclusion of income earned abroad depends on several factors some of which may or may not apply to civilians in combat zones in particular to qualify for the income tax exclusion person must be us citizen must have his or her tax home in foreign country and must be re sident of that foreign country or have lived abroad for at least 330 days out of any 12 consecutive months if person qualifies for the exclusion for only part of th tax year then only part of the exclusion can be claimed5 all us citizens can credit foreign taxes paid against their us income taxes however federal employees are us ually exempt from foreign taxes the tax treatment of income earned by us citizens abroad is often justified by proponents by pointing to the differences in the cost of living and income tax rates that us citizens experience overseas6 these differences in cost of living cause the tax liabilities of us citizens working ab road to differ from the tax lia bilities of individuals with identical incomes who live and work in the united states individuals working overseas may face high foreign taxes in which case the foreign tax credit can be used to offset that expe nse for those indi viduals who experience low foreign taxes the tax credit can reduce the amount of us taxes paid proposals for change in recent congresses proposals were made to modify the income tax exclusion to apply to federal civilian employees employed in combat zones in the 110th congress the federal employee combat zone tax parity act hr 1974 and s 1166 has been introduced the proposal would expand the current armed forces income tax exclusion to include federal civilians employed in combat zones in the 109th congress hr 294 proposed to exclude from gross income compensation earned

applied to the spouse if married 8 in the 108th congress several proposals were made to modify the combat zone income tax exclusion in ways other than extending the pr ovision to civilian personnel for instance s 394 and s 721 proposed to expand the combat z one income tax exclusion to include income for the period of transit to the combat zone and to remove the income limitation on the exclusion for commissioned officers s 2824 proposed to exclude from income certain wages and selfemployment income of spouses of members of the armed forces for any month while serving in combat zone

th proposal follows current law by limiting the exemption amount so as not to exceed the maximum amount for enlisted personnel proposed legislation in the 108th congress hr 117 and hr 1133 included provisions that proposed to extend the co mbat zone tax trea tment to civilian employees of dod serving in combat z ones amendments were proposed to accompany hr 878 to extend the combat zone exclusion benefits to dod civilians working in combat zone8 policy arguments current legislation proposes extending th combat zone income tax exclusion to civilian dod personnel but other proposals ve been made in the past that would also extend the exclusion to civilian contract ors thus the analysis in this section includes both civilian dod employ ees and civilian contractors the combat zone income exclusion is federal subsidy that treats income earned by personnel serving in combat favorably compared to other income typically this kind of subsidy can infl uence how economic act ors behave and how the economys resources are employed yet the rationale for this military tax benefit was based on desire to reduce the tax burdens of military pe rsonnel during wartime rather than an incentive to encourage taxpayers to be employed in combat zone9 efficiency generally tax incentives are used to encourage more activity than would otherwise be undertaken according to ec onomic theory in most cases an economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33230crs5 10 for more detailed information about market failures see crs report rl32162 the size and role of government economic issues by marc labonte best satisfies the wants and needs of its participants if markets operate free from distortions by taxes and other factors market failures however may occur in some instances and economic efficiency may act ually be improved by tax distortions market failures occur when market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently in particular market trans actions are inefficient when the marginal benefits are less than the marginal costs market failures may be due to variety of circumstances including th presence of externalities and common resources public goods imperfect competition andor asy mmetric or incomp lete information10 if there is market failure and tax subsidy remedies that failure then there is economic justification for the subsidy because of its efficiency gains but tax benefit lowers efficiency if it distorts behavior in the absence of market failure the combat zone income tax exclusion does not address ma rket failure and as such does not improve economic efficiency at the same time the exclusion is unlikely to distort behavior and thus may not lower efficiency economic theory suggests that the efficiency of most tax incentives can be determined by examining their success in causing an intended response or degree of response by recipients of the tax incentiv yet the combat zone income tax exclusion is not designed to cause res ponse such as encouraging more individuals to serve in combat instead the provision is simply an additional benefit received by members of the armed forces in the case of extending an exclusion to federal civilian employees or civilian contract employees serving in combat zone the primary issues revolve around the purpose of the extension which has not b een stated by proponents the purpose could be to provide additiona l compensation for certain individuals serving in combat and thus facilitate recruitment for such work alternatively the purpose could be one of equity to make civilian employee benefits equal to those of the armed forces efficiency additi onal compensation to individuals serving in combat if the intent of the exclusion is to provide additional compensation to individuals serving in combat then question of efficiency arises as to whether tax subsidy is more appropriate than direct payment subsidy in the form of an income tax exclusion benefits individua ls differently based upon their household characteristics that influence their taxable income and liability this variance in benefit is not related to the purpose of the subsidy yet influences its value nonetheless economists consider this ine fficient direct spending programs do not have this unintended variance in benefit in the case of the combat zone income tax exclusion an alternative subsidy could be to increase income earned while in combat examples of existing incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33230crs6 11 hazardous duty incentive pay is available for members of the armed forces who perform certain duties including parachute duty flig ht deck duty demolition duty toxic fuels or propellants duty and certain others imminent danger pay is special rate of pay for members of uniformed service who are subject to hostile fire or explosion of hostile mines on duty in an area in which there wa s imminent danger of being exposed to hostile fire or explosion of hostile mines killed in jured or wounded by hostile fire explosion of hostile mine or any other hostile action or on duty in foreign area in which there was threat of physical harm or imminent danger on the basis of civil insurrection civil war terrorism or wartime conditions 12 as reported by the internal revenue service website httpwwwirsgovpubirssoi 01in53usxls visited january 9 2006 13 the example assumes that the deduction does not drop the taxpayer into the next lower tax bracketsubsidies for combat include hazardous duty pay and imminent danger pay11 increases in one or more of these type s of income would however have adverse budgetary effects by increasing the cost of appropriations for military spending although the implementation of tax benefit would also increase the cost of military spending these costs do not require an ppropriations process nd therefore tend to receive less scrutiny equity among taxpayers an exclusion refers to an item of income specifically excluded from the determination of adjusted gross income an exclusion results in the subtraction of portion of gross income before arriving at adjusted gross income the beneficiaries of income tax exclusions like most tax incentives vary by type of taxpayer taxpayers differ by income marital status and number of dependents and as result the same tax incentive can affect taxpayers differently married individuals filing joint returns comprise d 391 of all tax returns in 2001 the most recent year for which those data are available while single filers were 446 and heads of households were 14412 these differences in hous ehold composition along with differences in the number of dependents lter the distribution of taxes among income groups which can affect the degree of fairness in the tax code our income tax system is based on progressivity simply stated the more taxable income taxpayer has the greater the percentage of income imposed as taxes because of this the value of an exclusion from taxation increases with marginal tax rates and income that is to say the tax liability of an individual in the 10 tax bracket the lowest federal income tax rate would be reduced 10 for each 100 of excluded income in contrast th tax liability of an individual in the 35 tax bracket the highest federal ta x bracket would be reduced 35 for each 100 of excluded income13 the lowestpaid personnel because of current personal exemptions the standard deduction amount and other federal tax provisions such as the earned income tax credit may owe little or nothing in federal taxes and thus would not benefit greatly from an exclus ion those persons notably commissioned officers making the largest salaries how ever benefit the most from an exclusion however as mentioned previously there is limit on the amount of the exclusion for officers and that limit also would apply to civilianshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33230crs7 14 while there are combative military operations in iraq war has not been declared and as such the ucmj does not currently apply to civilians in iraq see crs report rl32419 private security contractors in iraq background legal status and other issues by continuedthe international tax provisions that benefit us citizens working overseas may benefit certain civilians serving in combat but not all civilians as mentioned previously federal civilians cannot be nefit from the 82400 income tax exclusion though they can exclude the value of hous ing and certain other allowances they receive nonfederal civilia ns benefit from the income exclusion to the degree that they meet the rules of the provision in particular if private sector civilians are located overseas for all or most of the 330 days out of 12 months required by the income exclusion they may claim all or most of the exclusion an income tax exclusion for nonfederal civilians serving in combat zones would benefit two type s of individuals those unable to meet the requirements for the existing foreignearned income exclusi on and those who earn more than the 82400 allowable amount of the existing exclusi on thus proposal to extend the combat zone tax exclusion to nonfederal civilians to the extent that it would benefit primarily highincome households would d iminish the progressivity of the income tax system the foreign tax credit however was designed to offset the income taxation of individuals working abroad and alle viate double ta xation not as an economic incentive or subsidy personnel serving in combat are not subject to foreign taxes on the income earned while in the region and thus do not require an income tax credit to offset foreign taxes paid equity among individuals serving in combat if the intent of extending the combat zone exclusion to civilians is to make civilian benefits equal to those of the ar med forces then the

of expanding the income tax exclusion to civilians note that such change would act as an expression of nati onal concern and gratit ude to all individuals serving our nation in dangerous situations

contractor personnel contr actor technical representativ war correspondents and members of labor units or civilian services contributing to the welfare of armed forces certain civilians work close to hostilities often wearing uniforms and carrying weapons which makes them likely to appear as combatants to opposition forces supporters of an extension of the income tax exclusion to civilians in combat assert that individuals in such dangerous situations are as likely as uniformed military personnel to become casualties of the operation it may be more appropriate to argue that certain civilians but not all have likelihood of becoming casualties of war for instance of the 2363 fatalities of the iraq war as of december 2005 five were civilian dod employees those five civilia n dod fatalities were in contrast to the fatalities of 2145 members of the armed forces and 110 contractors during the same time period15 as shown in table 1 85 of all individuals in service in iraq are

already receive benefits like danger pay allowances that provide additional compensation for hazardous working conditions thus civilia ns do not require dditional income tax incentives because they r

employees for service at places in foreign areas where there ex ist conditions of civil insurrection civil war terrorism or wartime conditions wh ich threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or wellbeing of an employee16 in the case of civilian dod employees th amount of imminent danger pay varies between rates of 15 20 and 25 of basic compensa tion based on the determined level of danger and the presence of non essential personnel nd dependents located in the area of assignment17 those who oppose extending income tax ex clusion to civilian contractors could argue that civilian contractors receive signif icant differences in salary that serve as risk premium for service in combat zones thus in this view the income tax exclusion is unnecessary and an erosion of potential tax revenue for the government also exempting civilian income from federal income taxation could make civilian service in combat zone more financially attractive in comparison to military service in combat zone this could in turn have negative effect on military recruitment and retention cnn article that examined the use of private contractors in iraq reported that private contracts paid from 350 to 1500 day although some justify these salaries on the basis that priv ate contractors supplement the work of the military others argue that such lucrativ salaries which can exceed 100000 year deplete the ranks of the armed forces by attracting experienced military personnel18 brookings institution report indicated that former military personnel working for private sector security firms typically make between two to 10 times what they would have made if they were in the military as an example former green beret can make up to 1000 day in iraq as priv ate contractor as mentioned
