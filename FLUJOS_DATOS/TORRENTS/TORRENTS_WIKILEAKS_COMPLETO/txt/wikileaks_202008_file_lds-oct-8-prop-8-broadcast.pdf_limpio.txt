with the wishes of our heavenly father i ask you to let this hour that were together be as though we were sitting in my living room having confidential talk about this serious concern first presidency direction we convey the deep love of president monson his counselors and the quorum of the twelve under the first presidencys direction weve been asked to bring you together to spend some time discussing things that are critical and important in day when temptation and increased pressure is being placed on each of you i hope youll sense the spirit with which we will share our thoughts this evening and will take the time to ponder and consider these messages carefully each of you is in unique position to influence the world for good your ability to impact society is greater than ever you are mighty army in you i see the future of the c hurch in the years ahead youll be caring for and protecting the kingdom youll be responsible for holding true to the doctrines of the c hurch and raising future generations that will be prepared for the coming of our savior we thank you for your commitment and dedication in the battle for truth and right i focus my remarks on the importance of family and marriage proclamation to the world in 1995 the c hurch issued proclamation to the world proclamations in the c hurch are not an every day occurrence they are relatively rare the first presidency and c ouncil of the 12 apostles clearly declared the churchs position on the family and marriage marriage between man and woman is ordained god and the family is central to the creators plan for the eternal destiny of his children all human beings male and female are created in the image of god each is beloved spirit or daughter of heavenly parents and as such each has divine nature and destiny gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose recent church proclamations now elder russell m nelson made this very clear to the whole church sunday afternoon in his talk at general c onference in the last several weeks the church has again provided additional insight through an article titled the divine institution of marriage you can find it under the newsroom portion of the c hurchs website marriage between man and woman is central to the plan of salvation the sacred nature of marriage is closely linked to the power of procreation only man and woman together have the natural biological capacity to conceive children this power of procreation to create life and bring gods spirit children into the world is sacred and precious misuse of this power undermines the institution of the family and thereby weakens the social fabric strong families serve as the fundamental institution for transmitting to future generations moral strengths traditions and values that sustain civilization these are truths these are eternal principles upon which the core doctrines of the restored gospel of jesus c hrist are based although many in the world may question them we cannot walk away from them or alter them these doctrines of family and marriage were established from the beginning and are part of our heavenly fathers great eternal plan the plan of happiness it was initiated in mortality on this earth with father adam and mother eve the scriptures are replete with insight concerning eternity and the plan of happiness the prophet alma in the book of mormon talked of why we are asked to live by certain standards therefore god gave unto them commandments after having made known unto them the plan of redemption in the pearl of great price the majesty and the purpose of our father in heavens work is explained the heavens they are many and they cannot be numbered unto man but they are mine and as one earth shall pass away and the heavens thereof even so shall another come and there is end to my works neither to my words for behold this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man porn and divorce marriage and the family are cornerstones of his great plan today the pressures and forces working to destroy the divine institution of the family and marriage are many divorce rates are growing and out of wedlock births continue to increase and the scourge of pornography is destroying that which is sacred providing prophetic counsel president thomas s monson said in his first address in general conference after being sustained in solemn assembly my friends be strong the philosophies of men surround us the face of today often wears the mask of tolerance do not be deceived behind the facade is heartache unhappiness and pain you know what is right and what is wrong and disguise however appealing can change that the character of transgression remains the same if your socalled friends urge you to do anything you know to be wrong you be the one to make stand for right even if you stand alone have the moral courage to be light for others to follow theres friendship more valuable than your own clear conscience your own moral cleanliness and what glorious feeling it is to know that you stand in your appointed place clean and with confidence that you are worthy to do so proposition 22 i ask you to heed the words of president monson we need to stand up for that which is right we can take moral stand on an issue and do it in respectful way today we face the ramifications of movement to legalize same sex marriage just eight years ago many worked to pass proposition 22 which prohibited same sex marriage in c alifornia several months ago the california supreme c ourt ruled against the vote of the people and legalized same sex marriage we are again participating with coalition of churches organizations and individuals sponsoring the november ballot issue known as proposition 8 the amendment would change the c alifornia constitution to ensure that only marriage between man and woman would be legally recognized we know that it is not without controversy yet let be clear that at the heart of this issue is the essential doctrine of eternal marriage and the role it plays in our father in heavens plan matter of morality not civil rights president gordon b hinckley addressed the churchs involvement number of years ago in similar issues in this way he said some portray legalization of socalled samesex marriage as civil right this is not matter of civil rights it is matter of morality others question our constitutional right as church to raise our voice on an issue that is of such critical importance to the future of the family we believe that defending this sacred institution by working to preserve traditional marriage lies clearly within our religious and constitutional prerogatives indeed we are compelled by doctrine to speak out we encourage technological conversation how do we go about that you are critical in this effort because so many of you are connected you are engaged in conversations through the use of technologies that were the dreams of science fiction in my day as most of you know we encourage members to join in the conversations many of you will text message blog make phone calls walk your neighborhoods or just talk to friends associates and neighbors these methods of engaging will be major elements of informing people of the issues and of the coalitions position hate the love the sinner as you do this please do so in sensitive manner our approach must always be with respect for others and their positions and opinions president hinckley counseled i wish to say that our opposition to attempts to legalize samesex marriage should never be interpreted as justification for hatred intolerance or abuse of those who profess homosexual tendencies either individually or as group we love and honor them as sons and daughters of god be strong in defending our position let us be strong in defending our position yet when we approach others please let us remember the need for understanding honesty and civility we must act in the spirit described by elder robert d hales in his conference address on sunday morning and proceed with love kindness and humanity towards all people we ask you to prayerfully consider your involvement in this effort and remember that strong stable families headed by father and mother are the anchors of civilized society the final paragraph of the proclamation on the family reads we call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society this is our goal and purpose it is our doctrine please remember the importance you play in teaching these important concepts today and for the benefit of future generations now my beloved brothers and sisters may our heavenly father bless you in every way as you move forward in this most important work i bear you my testimony that what were about is the work of the lord and he will bless us and he will bless you as you do your part in the name of jesus c hrist amen elder quentin l cook im from california my brothers and sisters i begin by mentioning that i have lived much of my adult life in california my wife and i came to c alifornia to go to law school at stanford we stayed for 33 years and raised our family in c alifornia we only left because i was called as general authority i love c alifornia and its people again we love everyone as elder ballard has so clearly and eloquently stated marriage is sacred institution ordained by god to trifle with it is not in accordance with his plan before going further i want to make clear that we are talking about protecting the divine institution of marriage please understand that the central message of the savior is to love all of our brothers and sisters remember there are good people who disagree with the churchs teachings on marriage others are unsure of where they stand be respectful of their opinions as you share your message nothing we say here can be used as an excuse to treat those with same gender attractions partially or disrespectfully gay templeworthy members there are faithful templeworthy members of the church who struggle with this great challenge often in silence fear and great pain our hearts go out to these good brothers and sisters even as we uphold the divine truths the lord has revealed about marriage tolerance does not mean tolerating transgression i would like to say few words however about tolerance for many including some of our own members contemporary view of tolerance has become value that overrides important principles taught by the savior the divine institution of marriage found on the church website as elder ballard mentioned contains the following those who favor homosexual marriage contend that tolerance demands that they be given the same right to marry as heterosexual couples but this appeal for tolerance advocates very different meaning and outcome than that word has meant throughout most of american history and different meaning than is found in the gospel of jesus c hrist the savior taught much higher concept that of love love thy neighbor he admonished jesus loved the sinner even while decrying the tolerance as gospel principle means love and forgiveness of one another not tolerating transgression in todays secular world the idea of tolerance has come to mean something entirely different instead of love it has come to mean condone acceptance of wrongful behavior as the price of friendship jesus taught that we love and care for one another without condoning transgression but todays politically palatable definition insists that unless one accepts the he does not tolerate the sinner as elder dallin h oaks has explained tolerance obviously requires noncontentious manner of relating toward one anothers differences but tolerance does not require abandoning ones standards or ones opinions on public policy choices tolerance is way of reacting to diversity not command to insulate it from examination tolerance is not live and let live as you can see the concept of tolerance has come to mean that we live and let live that we accept behavior and practices contrary to our own beliefs and standards however is that the saviors instruction to us is that how he would have us as his disciples behave read the sermon on the mount carefully the savior was very direct about immoral conduct and our responsibility to both be an example and teach the sermon on the mount listen to these words from the sermon on the mount ye are the light of the world the city that is set on hill cannot be hid neither do men light candle and put it under bushel but on candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven the savior continues more directly in verse 19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven officially fighting gay marriage since 1994 we have the privilege and obligation of letting our voice be heard on important matters in 1994 the first presidency stated with amazing foresight we encourage members to appeal to legislatures judges and other government officials to preserve the purposes and sanctity of marriage between man and woman and to reject all efforts that give legal authorization or other official approval or support to marriages between persons of the same gender think of the prophetic timing of this call to action by the first presidency it predated nearly every effort to legalize same sex marriage for our time it was an unprecedented comprehensive call to action specific support for prop 8 more recently and for this monumental undertaking in c alifornia the first presidency concluded its letter to us with this clear call to action we ask that you do all you can to support the proposed constitutional amendment by donating of your means and time to assure that marriage in c alifornia is legally defined as being between man and woman our best efforts are required to preserve the sacred institution of marriage proclaim the yes on prop 8 message with love there are those who vigorously promote beliefs and practices contrary to our own they have the right of free speech granted in our constitution so do we we can vigorously promote our beliefs and practices we can do so with great conviction and also with great love just as our missionaries experience rejection in sharing the message of the restoration of the gospel of jesus christ we will experience rejection as we faithfully proclaim this message if we always share our message with love and compassion we will be in accordance with the saviors teachings inevitable conflicts some ask what is wrong when marriage is granted to those of the same gender as was done by the c alifornia supreme c ourt ive already stated one reason it is contrary to gods plan in addition the courts decision will inevitably lead to conflicts with religious liberties freedom of association and free speech rights the freedom of families to raise children in an atmosphere that values and supports the unique importance of marriage between man and woman will be lost society will become more and more hostile to traditional beliefs about marriage and family people inside of institutions with beliefs that oppose same sex marriage will increasingly be labeled as intolerant and subjected to legal penalties or social ostracismand this will not limited to c alifornia as its powerful influence is felt across the country three concerns public schools teaching gay marriage three examples will illustrate this concern first curriculum in public schools nearly all public schools provide education about health and sexuality by law health education includes the legal and financial aspects and responsibilities of marriage and parenthood by law sex education includes ageappropriate instruction in grades k12 that teaches respect for marriage the c alifornia supreme c ourt has declared that samesex unions must be given equal dignity under the law thats unless proposition 8 passes children in public schools likely will be taught about samesex marriages and that such unions should be respected as the equal of traditional marriages c hildren will also likely receive ageappropriate information about sexual relations within heterosexual and homosexual marriages religious adoption agencies second religious adoption agencies after samesex marriage was imposed in massachusetts the state tried to force c atholic charities in boston to disregard its religious beliefs and place children with homosexual couples rather than abandon its faith c atholic c harities discontinued its adoption services c alifornias religious adoption agencies will likely face the same choice under californias rigorous antidiscrimination laws religious taxexempt status third religious tax exempt status pressure will mount to revoke the tax exempt status of religious organizations and other charities that refuse to recognize samesex marriages or open their facilities for the performance of such marriages the argument will be that the government shouldnt subsidize discriminatory beliefs with tax exemptions most americans dont want gay marriage the majority of americans share the concerns that have prompted the coalition to protect marriage to move forward with proposition 8 at this time twentyseven states already have constitutional provisions similar to proposition 8 these are shown in red on this chart twentyone additional states have statutes or court decisions that define marriage as being between man and woman only massachusetts and c alifornia allow same sex marriage in both cases this was imposed by the courts you should also know that six other state supreme courts have reached the opposite decision from c alifornia and massachusetts when presented with similar constitutional arguments both vice presidential candidates in the debate last thursday indicated that they support traditional marriage between man and woman love compassion and humility my dear brothers and sisters let reemphasize the need for love compassion and humility as we move forward in this important cause this is especially true for families in the wards you attend who face special challenges as result of this issue we take great confidence that our loving father in heaven has inspired the first presidency to raise prophetic voice in defense of marriage between man and woman we ask the lords blessings to be upon you as you attempt to protect our father in heavens plan for his children in the name of jesus c hrist amen elder m russell ballard you twitter blog and

building the kingdom of god and for good uses elder quentin l cook sundaybest tribute to president hinckley let give you an example on sunday january 27th of this year president gordon b hinckley passed away at the age of 97 on monday morning thousands of latterday saint students were getting ready for school they were dressing in their sunday best in tribute to president hinckley these young men and women were responding to flood of text messages from teens in at least six states who decided to wear their best clothing as symbol of respect for someone they had come to love and deeply admire the original source of the message is unknown but cell phone service providers in some areas noticed an increase in traffic as our youth quote engaged holly high school student said i received mass of text messages and several phone calls and not just messages from my friends here but from other schools too parent from arizona was surprised to find his daughter up early ironing skirt for mondays classes what change from the usual mad dash to the door in jeans or other casual clothes going viral i believe he referred to messages being sent so quickly and in such quantities as going viral three major talks have been given by elder ballard on this subject one in hawaii to the students there one at byu idaho and one in washington dc to the byu management societythis last one appeared in the ensign today there are many conversations going on about the c hurch these conversations will go on with or without our involvement you can be such positive force with thousands and even millions as we take stand for something that doctrinally is so critical to our beliefs it is my hope that you will engage it is my hope that you will go viral partners in our new media world we

tools ill have to be frank i dont understand how all of this works but you do and you must of course understand why we believe that you can do something that perhaps some of us that are older cant do you must take time to prepare please study the scriptures and carefully review the materials we of the coalition provide then prayerfully seek the guidance of our father in heaven as you participate please remember that youre member of the saviors church and we need to reflect in all that we do his example of love be careful in the workplace you know in proverbs we read soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger theres need for hurtful cutting exchanges there are certain people who disagree with the churchs teachings on marriage others are unsure of where they stand be respectful of all of their opinions as you share your message be especially careful in the workplace and in other settings where discussions of social issues might result in inappropriate tension or conflict lets simply have respectful conversation with our friends and our neighbors and our fellow employees now lets work together brothers and sisters to share these messages and protect that which is most sacred to our father in heaven weve asked elder c layton who has worked his heart out as chairman of this effort from the general authoritieshes member of the presidency of the seventyand weve asked him now to give you some additional resources that you can consider to use when you have these conversations and participate in this good work elder c layton we appreciate all that youve done elder l whitney clayton thank you elder ballard and thank you elder c ook as well for those inspired words im very happy to offer few thoughts now the campaign to pass proposition 8 id like to focus on the campaign to pass proposition 8 and explain something about the timing of the campaign between now and election day we invite you to consider helping the efforts that ill mention so very much will happen in the next four weeks the time between now and election day will be sprint instead of marathon after much preparation and groundwork now is the time for us to shine in this magnificent cause grassroots efforts this campaign is now concentrating on what is called grassroots efforts this needs little explanation on the screen youll see rough outline on what needs to be done as the grassroots level or local level between now and the election as you will see the campaign is divided into three wellrecognized and proven campaign phases this organized approach actually works and thats why we are doing these things as part of the coalition supporting proposition 8 three phases phase one this is the voter identification phase which consists of canvassing to identify voter preferences so that phases two and three can focus on those likely to vote for proposition 8 phase two phase two is the advocacy and persuasion phase in which we seek to educate and persuade those voters who are undecided phase three phase three is the get out the vote phase in which voters are encouraged to actually go to their polling place and vote yard signs will be blossoming now with these three phases in mind here is an outline of activities between now and election day first the week of october 6th whats going to be ongoing or continuing during this week well phase one canvassing identifying voter preferences phase two will also continuethats the advocacy and persuasion phase that also includes voter registration and yard signs will be blossoming that means theyll

people in each ward as you can see much remains to be accomplished we have been asked that at least thirty people in each ward and branch in c alifornia be asked to donate four hours each week between now and the election think of the good that will come from this level of participation between now and november 4th hope for the family because you are here tonight there is hope for the family for your family the one you have and pray to hold onto or the one you pray to form long after many of us who are here tonight have gone to the next life c alifornia will still be yours and your childrens

request to you young singles or young married adults who are proficient in using the internet the c hurch has prepared several multimedia pieces that will help you better understand this issue and what you can do to defend and protect marriage and perhaps more importantly they will also help you inform and even persuade others whom you are close toyour friends and your familyto join in this noble cause these multimedia pieces include videos web site and internet sharing tools we hope that as elder ballard has suggested you will post these materials on your own blogs social media sites and elsewhere we would like to show you just few of the videos that have been produced elder david bednar with young adults the first video features discussion with elder david bednar of the quorum of the twelve and group of young adults discussing this issue eldar bednar answers some of the same questions you and your friends may have watch the video here httpwwwpreservingmarriageorgvideo_02html judicial decisions massachusetts as already legalized samesex marriage id never heard about it until c alifornia is now having this issue with proposition 8 in some places you have courts that are making judicial decisions that are impacting what takes place within particular state whats happening in c alifornia is that the citizens of the state majority indicated that they wanted marriage defined as between man and woman the courts in c alifornia overturned that so now its going back for the people to express their point of view should it be between man and woman or should it be between various types of partners and relationships people view the church as intolerant elder bednar i think lot of people view the c hurchs stance on this issue as an intolerant stance and basically labeling our views as immoral when were really taking stance for morality how do we address that argument if tolerance is the premise then its not oneway tolerance nor tyranny of tolerance it goes both ways and people can talk they can appreciate each other and they can have divergent and very different points of view and they can still get along and they can even still love each other one of the things that can occur over time is that if marriage is defined as relationship between two of the same gender there can be decreasing tolerance for our beliefs as members of the church of jesus c hrist of latterday saints this very label of bigotry from people who dont want to be labeled would likely be used more frequently and with even greater intensity so one of the potential consequences growing out of this is that we may find decreasingly tolerant environment for our beliefs as members of the c hurch of jesus c hrist of latterday saints im nineteen why do i care i am almost nineteen im not married and i dont have any kids so what effect does this have personally for well people say is all we want is our opportunity it has effect on you but there are people who push on the edges of what is legally allowable and they use the courts to try to make additional progress to their particular point of view therefore if you have church and it does not recognize samegender marriage then that is discriminatory and you should not be allowed to do that it is not just wild and crazy to suggest that there could be sanctions against the teaching of our doctrine because we focus on marriage between man and woman and would not place on equal standing marriage between man and man or woman and woman samegender couples would lose nothing my understanding of prop 8 is that its to clear up the language the definition of marriage so what would be the impact on the homosexual population if it passed or if it didnt pass well in c alifornia samegender couples have variety of protected rights so they dont lose anything if this particular proposition goes down its not as though they have rights or responsibilities or benefits that will be removed this is simply an attempt to have the definition of marriage expanded to include samegender couples but they would lose nothing its just title and they dont get any new rights from this at all its just the title that theyre given if prop 8 does not pass well what you do is that you redefine marriage and then the uncertainty is what happens is that people begin to push the limits of that new definition thats the uncertainty that poses real risk clash between religious liberty and free speech so if it wasnt to pass like would the ability for us to i guess to live our religion or preach our religion could we not do that any more yeah thats why i used the concept of the tyranny of tolerance it seems to be tolerant but it only goes in one direction so youre going to have the possibility of inevitable clashes between religious liberty and free speech and if your religious doctrine is such that you believe marriage between man and woman is the only definition of marriage then that smacks up against free speech because if marriage is defined in more broad way between members of the same gender then you cant talk about that now im not suggesting that in one fell swoop thats what happens but if you throw rock in pond the ripples extend out for very long way this argument is not just about the rock hitting the water and the initial ripple you also have to consider the extended ripples over time and you get some sense of what can happen by looking at other places in other countries where samegender marriage has been adopted legally and you begin to see some of those potential ripples consequences to the children so what would the consequences be to the children well lets say for example that if samegender marriage becomes legally the norm then its pretty clear that youre going to have to treat equally in publicschool curriculum various forms of marriage relationships heterosexual marriage and homosexual marriage would have to be treated equal footing so what you then will have is an environment where children coming from your home where you believe that marriage between man and woman is ordained of god and that the family is central to the fathers plan for the divine destiny of his children your children will go to school those will be placed on equal footing that to is very troubling and uncertain consequence of what were talking about and that would infused into the school curriculumthat would be mandated why it is important to so i have question so youve been married you have kids and grandchildren what is itwhat do you feel personally about prop 8 why is it important to you i mean whats the most important thing to you why do you feel so strongly about it having children having grandchildren i go back to very simple doctrinal foundation marriage between man and woman is ordained of god sister bednar and i have nine grandchildren eight of them are little girls and one is little boy and the greatest joy in life comes in marriage and as children come into your home and i just simply feel this passionate because for our children for our grandchildren and for our grandchildrens children my desire is that they would have the happiness of the family and marriage between man and woman as the central feature of the fathers plan his plan is called the plan of happiness its called that for reason and everyone who has happiness in mortality it comes in variety of ways but all of those ways focus on and lead to the marriage between man and woman and if theyre blessed to have children the rearing and nurturing those children thats what its all about and i dont want that disrupted i dont want that redefined i dont want that altered for our children and grandchildren church members who support prop 8 this next piece illustrates what some c hurch members are doing to support proposition 8 watch the video here httpwwwpreservingmarriageorgvideo_01html random people in this video my name is jill and i support proposition 8 the yes on 8 campaign i support proposition 8 my name is jennie lynn and i support proposition 8 i want to protect traditional marriage i want to protect religious freedom i want to stand up for children and families surfer dude supports prop 8 my name is dane and im in favor of proposition 8 im in support of proposition 8 once i decided hey this is something i want to get involved in all of the sudden i realized there were bunch of other people my age that felt exactly the same way there are whole lot more that would be in support of proposition 8 if we were just able to educate them its not just letting people do their own thing that wont affect us this is going to have huge effect on society samesex domestic partnerships already have all the civil and legal rights and benefits of marriage this is not really about that this is about the actual definition of marriage and as what we as society agree marriage is and should be about mom thinks childrens rights are affected my name is rachel and i am very much in support of proposition 8 first of all i think religious freedoms are at stake here i think that peoples ability to believe in marriage as divine institution of god and to preach that and to follow their conscience and incorporate that into their everyday lives that is very much risk and i think also that the rights of children are affected children have right to be raised by mother and father prop 8 party free food come on in you ready for this yeah you guys hungry were networking with other single adults throughout the state of c alifornia getting the word out getting them energized behind proposition 8 well i think that one of the greatest things weve done as group is that weve talked to each other about the process to become in support of proposition 8 as other people talk about why its important to them it strengthens why its important to fight for religious freedom well i feel that its important for my childrens future i dont want my children to grow up in genderless society this is my opportunity to fight for religious freedom when you talk to the phone on somebody and they say oh well i didnt know about that then they start to think that maybe this is something that they need to vote yes on im calling up old friends and asking them to get involved and when they hear about the issue and when they realize how its going to affect not only c alifornia but the entire country theyre very concerned prop 8 makes feel american the fact that there were four judges that went and made this decision after sixtyone percent of the population of c alifornia said actually we define marriage as between man and woman and then to go and to flip it i have hard time with that when i vote for something i expect that that law is going to remain on the books until the people say you know never mind and so for to be able to stand up and say i dont agree with what four judges did and im going to put my foot down about that that makes feel american i mean call it cheesy but it really does because i recognize that theres power in our vote and theres power in our voice im an internet guy im kenny and i support proposition 8 thats what we do yeah we stay up late and now im not political as the next guy im not but you can be and on issue that really hits home to you you should be to get involved i think all that matters is that you want to i noticed big lack on the internet of just real information about prop 8 about samesex marriage like just articles and editorials and viewpoints from different religions there wasnt really one place and so we made that everyone can do really well in their own field and so they should do what they do to promote prop 8 for example im an internet guy i can make web sites so i made web site somebody else might be into film somebody else might be an artist somebody else might just like to talk so talk you know write blog put it out there make youtube video or send letter to the editor of the local newspaper if all you can do is take sharpie and write yes on prop 8 and pin it to your bag do it extending our nets the internet is such great resource we can really extend our nets that way the more we talk about it the more information that gets out there i think thats going to swing it towards the yes if everyone stays quiet i think it would go it would favor the on this issue if we were to let this fail this can be big hit on the family we have friends that are gay we dont discriminate we have friends that are gay its just that we believe and we want to stand up for family i definitely believe this is going to be key moment in history where are you going to be on the sidelines or are you going to be in the game participating and so you can really have say so read it up study because when you know about something you can talk about something most importantly when you know about something you can make your own decision about it and when youve decided it will be all that much easier to share your opinion four things you should do i would say that there are four things that you can and should do number one if you live in california make sure that youre registered to vote at your current residence so that you can go and vote in november number two educate yourself read articles read the opinions find out whats being said find out what the issues are number three go to protectmarriagecom and register to help there are so many different ways to help c alling and taking surveys to find supporters walking around precincts or talking to the undecided getting on your blog and talking about it whatever it may be there are so many different ways and someone will contact you to help you learn whats available in your area and then the fourth thing is is talk to your friends see what they know if they dont know direct them to the resources youve looked into educate them on the issues this is going to be personal battle that everyone needs to talk to the people around them and make sure that those people are informed and vote with knowledge not based on the faulty premises that are out there right now most important thing of our generation this is the most important thing that our generation will do because it will determine the structure of our society for the rest of our lives more videos to come more of these videos are available now on preservingmarriageorg new web site and additional videos will be posted in the days to come we invite you to share these materials with others our brothers and sisters in c alifornia id love to share with you my testimony that god lives that jesus is the c hrist and that this c hurch is his church god loves us all of us and so does the savior were delighted to have this time with you this evening i share my testimony with you in the name of jesus c hrist amen wed now like to provide some time for some final thoughts from elder ballard and elder c ook first well hear from elder c ook and then from elder ballard following elder ballards remarks we will end this broadcast and ask that local leaders close this meeting with hymn and prayer thank you for your time this evening and for your dedication and commitment to the gospel of jesus c hrist elder c ook elder quentin l cook we dont support political parties there have been some very specific requests that are made of you this evening as church we do not get involved in supporting candidates or political parties but when there are moral issues the first presidency has always felt that it was important for our members to stand up and support those that are significant to the gospel of jesus c hrist and the restored church we ask you to give your best and so we without concern go to the membership of the church after the call of the first presidency to ask you to give your best to this most significant effort to support in every way possible the sacred institution of marriage as we know it to be i want to leave you with my witness and my testimony of the divinity of the church of the divinity of the institution of marriage the traditional marriage and i say this in the name of jesus c hrist amen elder m russell ballard coalition with the catholics and evangelicals well now brothers and sisters thank you for the time youve given us this evening i think youd like to know that weve received an invitation from the c atholic c hurch and from many of the evangelical churches to join with them in the coalition that has been formed all of what youve heard tonight is being done by other organizationsthe c atholic c hurch is involved the evangelical churches are involved other organizations that care about this matter are involvedand were all trying to enlist the help and the effort of our own people so that this effort of the coalition will bring about the positive result that we retain marriage in c alifornia as being between man and woman talk to nonmembers and lessactive and one of the things that i would suggest to all of you is to think through who you know that feels about marriage as you do that are not members of the c hurch and ask them to join you in this great effort the wonderful thingi dont know how many we have assembled here tonight but id guess thered be thousands of youjust think if each one of you got one or two others who are not here tonight or who are less active in our church or who are members of other churches and you rallied them to join with you in this great effort well have many more hands to get this work done and thats the true purpose thats the true objective of the work of the coalition which we are very happy to be part of because marriage is so deeply important as it pertains to the doctrines of the c hurch of jesus c hrist of latterday saints children can only happen through marriage now in closing let just remind you that our heavenly father when the time came gave us the privilege of creating this earth the earth was created with the primary purpose that his spirit childrenhis sons and his daughters whom he loves as his spirit childrenwould have the opportunity to come to the world and experience mortality to go
