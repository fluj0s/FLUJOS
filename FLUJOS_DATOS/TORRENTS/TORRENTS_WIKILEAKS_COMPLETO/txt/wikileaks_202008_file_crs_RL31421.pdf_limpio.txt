domestic efforts against terrorism former governor tom ridge of pennsylvania close friend and political ally of the president was appointed to head the ohs such highlevel unit it was hoped could bring direction and coherence to federal homeland securityrelated activities that were spread among more than 40 di fferent departments nd agencies yet ohs has been controversial almost since its inception despite some highprofile results such as highlighting priorities in the presidents fy2003 budget and negotiating border security accord with canada ohs remains very much an organizational work in progressone seeking to carve out unique identity and mission critics have focused on the offices informal structure and special relationship with the white house its lack of statutory authority th

homeland security ohs and the homeland security council hsc chaired by the president1 the ohss preeminent mission as defined in the order is to develop comprehensive na tional strategy to safeguard the united states against terrorism the white house has made clear that this strategy should extend from federal agency coordination into the full range of homeland security activities across federal state and local jurisdictions the offices designated functions are to coordinate the executive branchs efforts to detect prepare for prevent protect against respond to and recover from terrorist attacks within the united states and also to work with states and localities as well as private industry in accomplishing these tasks the simultaneouslycreated homeland security council was described as an interagency mechanism for coordinating and implementing homeland security policies at the federal level subsequent presidential directive hom eland security presidential directive 1 hereafter

coordination of federal programs to combat terrorism4 the studies advanced various proposals for reconfiguring the federa l governments decisionmaki ng processes vis vis the terrorist threat the ohshsc framework reflected and incorporated the reformist thrust of these proposals at least with re spect to domestic security policy as if to underscore the distinctive character of ohs in the policy process the terms coordinate and coordination or variants of them were repeated less than 34 times in executive order 13228 the ohshsc structure t hough seemed to be both more and less than what advocates of reorganization had hoped some had envisioned more powerful organizationa homeland security agencywith directline administrative authority to secure the nations borders and improve domestic preparedness others questioned whether ohs could lead and oversee th vast range of homeland security activitiesreportedly spread across more than 40 federal agencies and an estimated 2000 separate congressiona l appropriations accounts5 also controversial was the scope of ohs responsibilities its mandate appeared to reach inward to coordinate across broad spectrum of federal state and local agencies but various proponents of reorganization favored reaching outward as well so as to integrate foreign and domestic counterterrorism into single strategic plan6 still other observers saw ohs as adding little to planning and coordination mechanisms that already existed within the federal g overnment including those mandated by congress these various concerns carry number of implications for the definition and organization of ohs functions they can be grouped into four major issue areas these areas are expected to receive careful consideration by congress and the administration in the months aheadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31421crs4 7 march ohs interview 8 president george w bush securing the homeland strengthening the nation washington dc february 2002 p 8 for

organization and staffing concerns over the effectiveness au thority and performance of ohs and its director governor tom ridge are widespr ead in congress as insistent demands for ridges testimony in public hearings attest yet evaluation is difficult because ohs is very much an organization in flux as of marchapril 2002 only 90 of projected 180 fulltime personnel slots had been f illed most were detailees from other agencies rather than direct hires so of the 11 aforementi oned policy coordination committees had not yet convened others were in the process of formation7 also noteworthy is the prevalence of dual allegiance for instance the senior directors for intelligence and detection and for rd report to superiors in respectively the nsc and the office of science and tec hnology policy as well as in ohs7 partly because of staffing problems the centerpiece of the ohs mission statement comprehensive national strategy for homeland security has not yet materia lized it is not projected for completion until june 2002 nine months af ter the september 11 tragedy at that time the document would be sent to the president when it would be disseminated to the public is not clear ohs and the administration have produced budget calling for 377 billion in homeland security spending in fy 2003 but as its architects admit the budget did not attempt to address the totality of the homeland security agenda and did not equate to national strategy rather it focused on disparate policy initiativessuch as bioterrorism and border security that were deemed so imperative and urgent th at they

security spending panel one of hearing of the senate appropriations committee april 30 2002 p 2the fact that ohs is not yet fully st affed and operational might account for its reluctance to be responsive especially vis vis the legislative branch its fy2003 budget is not an integrated budget item unlike other executive office of the president eop entities such as the nsc the office of science and technology policy and the drug czars office rath er ohs is aggregated with funding for other white house functions such as physi cal and information technology security in the eop and compensation of the president and the white house office9 gaining appointments with ohs officials has been difficult for congressional staff recent testimony by the comptroller general of the united states notes i must say that we have experienced some access problems in connection with our ohsrelated efforts the reference here is to the general ccounting offices response to congressional request to conduct audits and reviews in the area of homeland security10 also significant in the eyes of congress is ohs director tom ridges refusal to testify before congressional committees about public spending on homela nd protection the white house has invoked the separation of powers doctrine as reason and also has contended that the president rather than congress oversees presidential adviser who is not confirmed by the senate also white house aides do not regularly testify before congress although they have done so some 20 times since 1944 according to recent analysis11 nevertheless given ohss relatively high profile the administrations position has been cha llenged by congress senator robert byrd chairman of the senate appropriations committee and senator ted stevens the ranking republican member of the committee have asked for ridges testimony byrd sees ridge as having unique res ponsibility to integrate the many complex functions of the various federal agencies involved in formulating homeland security policy12 in 1300word letter to ridge in april 2002 senator byrd wrote the decisions which you make as direct or of the office of homeland security undoubtedly will play large role in thousands of funding decisions in the coming years there is simply rational reason for avoiding the committee which has to review and recommend expe nditures from the us treasury to the full senate and the american people13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31421crs6 14 pl 105277 october 21 1998 112 stat 2681 title vii office of national drug control policy reauthorization for discussion see gao drug control ondcp efforts to manage the national drug control budget gaoggd9980 may 1999 pp 113a related question is whether ohs in its present organizational makeup can muster the necessary personnel and clout to reconcile the complex functions of agencies involved in homela nd protection to many observe rs the current staff size of 90 seems small relative to the herculean task of determinin g how funds currently are being spent in multitude of agencies and setting new homeland security requirements and priorities others argue that size need not correlate with effectiveness an additional concern is the large percentage of detailees on the ohs staff by comparison only about onefi fth of the approximately 145 employees of the office of national drug control polic often seen as an organizational counterpart for the ohs were assigned from other agencies the danger may exist that these assignees who are paid by and responsible to their parent organizations would pull for their organizations own pr iorities funding nd programs possibly compromising ohss leadership and oversig ht functions in coordinating federal agency activities it can be argued that ohs will need to both create more staff slots and increase the relative weight of st aff employees in the organizational mix authority ohss formal authority over programs and budgets established by executive order rather than by statute is relativel circumscribed the or der states that the director shall review and pr ovide advice to the heads of departments and agencies for homeland securityrelated programs advise the office of management and budget omb on the level of funding for such programs and before omb forwards the prepared annual budget to the president for transmittal to congress certify to omb funding levels deemed n ecessary for homeland securityrelated and appropriate activities of the executive branch the order established criteria or set of procedures for not certifying an ag encys homeland security budget also the wording of the order implies that certificati on occurs late in the budget cycle after omb has vetted agencies budget submissions and passed them back in interim or final form suggesting that this step may be little more than formality comparison can be drawn with th budgetary authority of the office of national drug control policy ondcp an eop tity often mentioned as possible model for coordination of federal antiterrori st activities ondcps authority is based in statute 112 statute sec 704 and is fairly explicit14 ondcp for instance can transfer funds between agencies subject to the approval of the head of each affected agency and must approve any requests for reprogramming of funds of more than 5 million key difference with ohs lies in th review and certification of agencies drug control budgets ondcp immerses itsel f in the process early on reviewing agencies total budget requests in early summer and issuing socalled precertification letters specifying changes that should be made final certification or decertification decisions are made in the fall in the event of decertification the affected department or agency is require d to

in the precertification phase are considerable the sole case involved 1997 dispute between ondcp and the department of defense dod over funding levels for certa in drug program initiatives specifically ondcp wanted an increase of 141 million in dods drug budget which dod resisted as an encroachment on its warfi ghting functions ondcp appealed to omb and the president and the result was negotiated compromise in which dod agreed to spend an additional 73 million on drugrelated ac tivities in fy1999 15 divergence of opinion exists on wh ether ohs like ondcp should have statutory foundation and whether its direct or should be subject to confirmation by the senate proponents see statute and confirmation procedure as conferring legitimacy on the office and strengthening its role in the budget process also increased congressional oversight is considered by some as desirable in its own right given the significance of ohss duties others interviewed for this report including ohs staffers are skeptical of the need for statute citing informal levers of power as the key to performance of the offices functions16 according to the latter viewpoint the biggest lever is ohs director ridges proximity to the president which confers extraordinary influence as ridge noted in speech to the national press club in february some of my frie nds in congress think its very important for this office to be legisl ative office ive been in town four months now and ive had at least 38 billion worth of budget authority in four months thats not so bad17 on the other hand presidential access might not transfer so easily from the incumbent director to successor possible argument for institutionalizing ohs through legislation furthermore ridges authority in washington may be gradually undermined unless protected by legisla tion number of commentators argue that ridge is losing out in various turf dis putes with the justice department the pentagon and other agencies of the

best if not the only way for ridge to gain the stature he needs to get the job done19 mission and responsibilities for guiding national security policy related to terrorism scope formal governmentwide definition of homeland security has emerged since the creation of the ohshsc structure20 nevertheless genera lizations can be made about what ohs planning and coordi nation responsibilities do and do not cover first ohss purview mostly excludes nont errorist threats to the security of americans at home for instance ohs is not involved in coordinating drug interdiction efforts defending against ballistic missiles or managing the consequences of natural di sasters furthermore as defense secretary donald rumsfeld has pointed out in testimony ohs also will not exercise oversight authority vis vis dods new northern command for homeland defense or over its military missions to defend the people and territory of the united statessuch as combat air patrols maritime defense or even cases of terrorist threats of attacks21 second while ohs is assigned ma jor role in protection of critical infrastructure telecommunications ener gy transportation links and the like its role in cybersecurity is limited executive order 13231 of october 10 2001 established critical infrastructure protection board cipb which is to recommend policies and coordinate programs for protecting information systems for critical infrastructure seemingly this meant that ohs would oversee protection for physical assets while the board would be responsible for their information components22 third ohss focus is on terrorist threats on the territory of the united states ohss prevention function for example is defined narrowly in terms of border control rather than broadly in terms of international initiatives

security santa monica calif rand corp issue paper ip 220oea 2002 p 11seems based on mission of homeland secur ity seen largely through the prism of civil defense23 however this leaves unres olved the important and potentially contentious issue of how much atten tion and resources should be focused on domestic security efforts and how much on operations against terrorist networks abroad that directly threaten the us homeland ohs and nsc efforts to delineate ohss sphere of responsibility run some risk of oversimplification the ohs the cipb nd the nsc have distinct responsibilities in the area of counterterrorism but th functions and memberships of these organizations partly overlap and lines of au thority are intertwined for example the presidents advisor for cybersecurity rich ard clarke reports to both nsc advisor condoleezza rice and to governor ridge the nscs national director and deputy national security advisor for controlling terrorism who is the presidents principal advisor on combating global terrorism also reports to both ridge and rice ohss linkages with the nsc are especially complex for instance some ohs officials such as the senior director for intellig ence and detection hold dual appointments in the ohs and the nsc ohs and the nsc share responsibility for coordinating border security functions and for setting priorities for the collection of intelligence outside the united states regarding threats of terrorism within the united states ohs and the nsc have issued joint classi fied reports on the smart and secure border system with ca and on global tran sportation security24 nevertheless ohs and nsc operate in distinct spheres the executive order creating ohs specified that the homeland s ecurity council would be responsible for administering policy for national security emergency preparedness with respect to terrorist threats and attacks within the united states and that it would be the principal forum for consideration of policy related to such threats and attacks this amends executive order 12656 of novemb er 18 1988 which had assigned such responsibilities to the nsc for any occurre nce including natural disasters military attack technological emergenc that seriously threatens the national security of the united states25 number of observers view ohss crea tion as reinforcing traditional barriers between foreign and domestic counterterrorism policy the nature of the terrorist threat gives rise to operational imperatives that are now at cross purposes with the organizational incentive for ohs writes 2002 rand

intelligence deterrence prevention preemption crisis management and consequence management27 what emerged in the wake of the september 11 attacks however was bifurcated approach to overall coordi nation ohs would coordinate responses to domestic terrorist threats and the nsc would do the same for global terrorism some experts viewed this dichotomy as unfortunate intelligence law enforcement and military operations at home and abroad n eed more integration not less said the aforementioned rand study us coast guard expert an advocate of point of origin border controls argues that reduc ing the risk and consequences of attacks directed against the united states cannot be accomplished simply by tweaking the role and capabilities whose writ reach only to the nations shores28 the example of drug control strategy an analogy can be drawn between international terrorism and the international drug trade which also crosses borde rs the ondcps national drug control strategy comprises both foreign and domes tic elements ranging from eradication of coca bushes in colombia to prosecuting street dealers in the united states while the strategy has not succeeded in the sense of reducing availability and consumption of drugs in the us market strategic planning process that views the drug trade as borderless phenomenon seems applicable to the war on terrorism as well border security similarly the seamless quality of the terrorist threat is forcing us government agencies to redefine their concepts of border security the us customs chief robert bonner for example advocates pushing the border outward to allow us inspections of travelers and goods in overseas ports which in turn could give officials more time to detect and react to possible terrorist attacks bonner emphasizes

have significant policy imp lications much of the federal effort to combat terrorism as the general ccounting office has noted has been based on vulnerabilities rather than on analysis of credible threats30 separating homeland security and national security functions seems likely to reinforce this tendency indeed the preface to the administrati ons fy2003 budget document securing the homeland strengthening the nation states that the need for homeland security is not tied to any specific terrorist threat instead the need for homeland security is tied to the underlying vulnerability and the f act that we can never be sure when or where the next terrorist conspiracy against us will emerge31 the converse argument is that american societys vulnerabilities ar essentially infinite and that threat assessment is needed to guide strategy and justify resource investments otherwise says gao fede ral agencies will use improbable worst case scenarios to plan and develop progra ms such assessments of necessity would derive from thorough analysis of the terro rist actors themselves including their intentions and capability to launch attack s this argument would support more expansive

between ohs and onp thus ppears to exist although ohs as the architect of broad national strategy fo r homeland security can be viewed as consumer of information supplied by onp rather than as competitor35 information coordination similarly ohs in the words of its director aims to tear down the information stovepipes that stand in the way of information sharing within the federal government36 yet data sharing in such areas as border security and foreignorigin terrorist threats is fairly well advanced case in point is the interagency border inspection system ibis database used by both us customs and the immigration and naturalization service ins which also interfaces with the state departments consular and support system class37 sharing of intelligence of terrorist threats beyond us borders occurs via the count erterrorism community threat warning system based in the cias counterterrorism center ctc the latter distributes warnings assessments and advisories on re gular basis through classified channel to intelligence components of more than 45 federal agencies the cia and the fbi often viewed as organizational rivals interact closely on terrorism intelligence matters although recent revela tions regarding advance indi cations of the september 11 attacks dramatize the need for improvement38 for example cia official heads the ctc but the deputy head is from

improvements have ccurred since september 11 independently of the activities of ridges office the usa patriot act of october 26 2001 pl 10756 mandated increased sharing of information between law

terrorist tracking task force designed to ensure that federal agencies coordinate programs to keep aliens that engage in or support terrorist activity out of the united states or to deport such aliens that already are in the country41 the new task force would be staffed by expert personnel from state the ins the fbi cu stoms and other agen cies its director would report to the deputy attorney ge

alternately depicts the ohss policy proposals to date as either lacking in novelty or overly ambiti ous federal agencies for example take credit for the smart and secure border plan with canada which is designed to facilitate crossborder communication while improving screening for passengers and goods in transit well before the ridge manley accord we had started meeting with our canadian

document was already on the table and close to having something done about it42 similar comments have come in response to one of gover nor ridges other priorities the creation of the homeland security advisory system yet the system unveiled with great fanfare in mid march 2002 after months of planning was modeled closely on and functionally similar to one already in use in the defense department and the intelligence community43 meanwhile the fbi continues to issue its own specific threat warnings albeit with concurrence of other government agencies and the ohs recent exampl was statement of

agencies on host of concerns regarding different attack scenar ios critical issues in this dialogue are costsharing for new homeland security initiatives who pays for what insurance and reinsurance in the event of mass casualty attacks and dissemination of threat information50 in grappling with these novel and complex challenges ohs may be able to project stronger image of its organizational awareness and establish more secure bureaucratic footing than it has had to date particularly significant and contentious issue cerns information sharing between different levels of government horizontal intelligence sharing at the federal level is reasonably wellde veloped and crossagency linkages and databases reportedly have improved since the septem ber 11 catastrophe one fairly successful paradigm referred to above is the operations of the community counterterrorism board with respect to foreignorigin terrorist threats furthermore the fbi maintains its own national threat warning system ntws which disseminates threat information to approximately 21 federa l agencies the ntws also provides information in abbreviated and sanitized form to state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide through an uncla ssified channel the national law enforcement telecommunications system51 yet vertical sharing between federal and state and local agencies by and large is limited state and local agencies make the point that to function as partners in homeland security they will need steady and accurate flow of intelligence about terrorist threats threat information assembled by government agencies often is classified for reasons of national security and few people in the state and local target audience possess the required security clearance to receive it threat information must be declassified and repackaged to protect the sources of the information and methods of collecting it at the same time sanitized threat warnings standing alone may lack sufficient detail texture and credibility to prompt action by state or local authorities especially economicallyor politicallydisruptive steps like closing major bridges or power plants or evacuating parts of

the nation states having the right system of communication content process and infrastructure is critical to bridging existing gaps between federal state and local governments as well as the private sector ultimately though questions of info rmation sharing who gets what how much when and under what ci rcumstances require complex political choices especially when attempting to bridge the federal nonfederal divide many observers appear to favor more empowerment and access at least for state authorities though proposals for doing th is vary widely for example us intelligence specialists interviewed for this report recommended setting up secure communications facilities in state capitals c onfigured to receive topsecret threat assessments and warnings from intelligence community components in this scenario such centers would be staffed by retired cia defense intelligence agency or other government personnel with th requisite highlevel secu rity clearances at the same time the elected top officials of the states including the governors lieutenant governors and the states attorneys general would receive clearances ex officiothat is by virtue of their elevated political positions 54 other proposals would go further to democratize the flow of information bills introduced in the house and senate hr 3285 and s 1615 would permit sharing of foreign intelligence information with senior law enforcement officials of state or political subdivision of state subject to whatever guidelines the attorney general might use to protect confidentiality55 the ohs tendency to date has been to view information sharing for homeland security less in terms of expanding the circle of potential customers that is politically than in term s of modernizing technology and infrastructure the section of the presidents budget proposal on using 21st century technology to defend the homeland re flects this tendency56 in that context ohss principal achievement in meeting state and local demands for more access to threat information has been the aforementioned national alert system with its five color codes that system though while described as step in the right direction by some provides only general guidance as to what commun ities are supposed to do as risks escalate the entire united states for example is cu rrently designated as in yellow alert mode

issue of providing specific detailed timely and credible threat information remains challenge nonetheless governor ridges offices potential role as an information broker could be vast esp ecially in developing new protocols for disseminating federal level intelligence to the states and localities alternative models for managing the war on terrorism the role and effectiveness of ohs in developing and coordinating national policy for homeland security activities are still in their formative stages there appears to be growing consensus in congress shared by some federal agencies that modifications are needed various alternatives which are not mutually exclusive have been proposed one alternative focuses on the basis of ohss authority that it be established through legislation to ensure the offices legitimacy and sustainability and that the head of the office be subject to confirma tion by the senate second theme is that the scope of responsibility of the office be expanded to encompass foreign as well as domestic terrorist threats that would imply integrating national security and homeland security planning functions third proposal is to replace ohs with homeland security superagency to exer cise direct operational authority over agencies performing domestic security func tions and possibly with coordinating role vis vis counterterrorism activities beyond u s borders fourth alternative is to retain the ohshsc structure mission and relationship to the white house largely intact though possibly with fe w organizational refinements these organizational scenarios may be the subject of careful consideration and debate by congress nd within the administration wh at happens to ohs clearly has important implications both for the definiti on of homeland security itself and for the parameters of the overall us counterterrorism effort statutory issues perhaps the most frequent point of c ontention is whether ohs authority should be based on statute or presidential directive the argument is sometimes made that statutory basis and senate confirmation ar necessary because of the high profile of the office and because of congresss need to execute oversight over such nationally important function as homeland security related argument is that the presidential order establishing ohs violates the spirit of comity between the branches58 others however maintain that the more relevant question is whether statute and increased congressional supervision will enhance the performance effectiveness of the officehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31421crs19 59 statement in

performance effec tiveness view would be the above mentioned case of ondcp compared to ondcps limited statutory powers governor ridges informal budget influence is generally consider ed to be enormous stemming from his special relationship with and proximity to the president and also from the strong antiterrorism consensus that developed in the wake of the september 11 attacks on the other hand some analys t argue that because of the presidents wideranging foreign and domestic respons ibilities such support will not always be forthcoming as former white house chief of staff leon panetta noted in recent congressional testimony the agencies nd departments know ve ry well that unless the president is calling on every issue that th homeland security director is trying to enforce they can basically nod say ye s and walk away and nothing happens59 much of course would depe nd on the statute itself and the nature of the powers and responsibilities that it conf ers the statute for the drug czars office provides ondcp with some provisional authority to in tervene in the budget process and delay finalization of agency budgets in add ition ondcp enjoys single unambiguous power to approve agency reprogramming re quests of more than 5 million yet key coordinating power assigned to ondcpin teragency transfers of funds to fill perceived needs and gapsre quires approval of the heads of the respective agencies and in any case it cannot exceed 3 percent of the drug control budget of the agency from which funds would be transferred60 also certain provisions of the ondcps st atute may tend to weaken rather than enhance the offices credibility fo r example secti on 706 development submission implementation and assessment of national drug control strategy establishes specific targets that might be viewed as unrealistic and unrealizable they mandate reduction of unlawfu l drug use to 3 percent of the population of the united states or less by december 31 2003 the

reached an alltime high of nearly 1000 tons in 200161 also it is not clear whether increasin g the accountability of the office would improve its performance receiving the imprimatur advice and consent of the senate carries with it the cost of increas ed reporting requirement s including demands for testimony by the ohs head whethe r reporting is drag on performance or salutary check on it

and possibly decisive argume nt for greater congressional involvement lies in the offices need for institutional legitimacy and longt erm financial support62 congress specific authority to mandate government agencies implies that ohs cannot function indefinitely without legislative basis for example title 31 section 1347 of the united states code states that an agency in existence for more than one year may not use amounts otherwise available fo r obligation to pay its expenses without specific authorization or specific appropriation by law63 furthermore consensus is growing on capitol hill that empowerment by congress is essential to give ridges office or some alternative organizational arrangement the requisite power and tools to lead the dom estic fight against terrorism changing the mandate at issue is an interagency planning and coordinating process spearheaded by ohs that largely excludes international aspects of the war on terrorism one important question is how resources will be allocated between domestic and foreign counterterrorism activities most analysts are uncertain whethe r ohss forthcoming national strategy can resolve this issue another question is whether the separation of counterterrorism planning into distinct foreign and domestic halves might distort the budgetary process leading to an overe mphasis on americas ssentially infinite vulnerabilities rather than threat assessments in making resource allocation decisions arguments for vulnerabilitydriven threat assessments emphasize that threats from terrorists especially from lessor ganized ad hoc groups are essentially unpredictable the ramzi yousef cabal that masterminded the 1993 world trade center bombing can be cited as an example on the other hand it is argued that more precise assessment of the nature dimensions and intensity of the terrorist threat is both possible and necessary gao study points to th tendency of intelligence officials to exaggerate if by default th likelihood of terrorists use of chemical biological radiological or nucl ear cbrn weapons or agents in our view some of the public statem ents intelligence community officials have made about the terrorist cbrn threat do not include important qualifications to the information for example terrorists would have to overcome significant technical and operational challenges to successfully make and release chemical and biological agents of sufficient quality and quantity to kill or injure large numbers of people without substantial assistance from foreign government sponsor64httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31421crs21 65 organizing for homeland security p 14 toward national strategy p 12 the proposed office would have sufficient budget authority and programmatic oversight to influence the resource allocation process nd ensure program compatibility the relevant legislation includes s 1449 graham et to establish the national office for combating terrorism and hr 3026 the office of homeland security act of 2001 the latter called for setting up an office of homela nd security within the executive office of the president not unlike its current namesa ke yet the proposed office would develop national strategy to include all aspects of pr evention and response to terrorist activitiesthe same can be said of nuclear weapons terrorists almost certainly lack the expertise to build one even if they could acquire significant quantities of fissile nuclear materials while reports abound of qaedas efforts to obtain nuclear weapon from unsecured russian stockpiles it is questionable whether that group could muster sufficient connections insi the russian defense establishment to consummate such deal the argument about ohss ppropriate role is partly an argument about the proper use of threat and risk assessments in combating terrorism case can be made especially in the light of recently reported advance communication failures regarding the september 11 attacks for stronger ro for ohs in intern ational counterterrorism especially perhaps in overseeing intelligence efforts to track and analyze terrorist threats series of questions then aris would an expanded role make for better intelligencegathering and threat assessments would improved intelligence result in national strategy to combat terrorism would an enhanced strategy then lead to more sober calculation of the resources act ually needed to confront the terrorist menace there are clear answers ohs of cour maintains linkages to the national security community yet some observers call for more pronounced integration of the intelligence and foreign policy agencies into the homeland security effort admittedly to reconfigure ohs in this fashion would be major organizational undertaking yet three of the major co mmission studies by the gilmore and hart rudman commissions and the national co mmission on terrorism proposed it the hartrudman commission and the nati onal commission saw the coordinating role as being performed by the nsc the gilmore commission proposed creating new national office for combating terrorism th director of which would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the nate the gilmore approach was embodied in bills sponsored in the house and senate65 viewed in this light possible organizational solution other than an ohs with rampedup responsibilities would be simply to fold ohs into the nsc corollary move might be to resuscitate the nscs national coordinato r for security infrastruct ure and counterterrorism this position was established by presiden tial decision directive 62 in 1998 but it was rendered obsolete by the creation of th posts of ohs direct or special advisor for cyber security and national director for combating terrorism refurbished national coordinator provide d with

efficiencies or synergies in the fight against terrorism these involve in varying degrees the creation of unified command structure to address the perennial problem of coordination nd have varying implications for the current ohshsc framework for example some schemes unde r consideration that would consolidate two or more border control agencies or subun its of them are more or less compatible with the continued existence of ohs nd presumably would ease its coordination burden ohs itself proposed such reorga nization in the abovementioned border security white paper prepared in d ecember

modest merging of customs and in s border control and enforcement units into single agency under the contro l of the justice department more ambitious reorganization options though could supersede or embrace at least by implication the coordination role performed by ohs such plans would integrate number of federal agencies pe rforming domestic security functions for example bills intr oduced by senators joseph lieberma n and arlen specter in october 2001 s 1534 month after the attacks on th world trade center and the pentagon would create new department of homela nd security with secretary appointed by the president by and with the cons ent of the senate the departments responsibilities would cover bor der security and emergenc preparedness and would range beyond counterterrorism to act as focal point regarding natural and manmade crises the new department would assume control over the authorities functions personnel and assets of several entities fema the customs service the border patrol the coast guard and different ffices of the fbi and the department of commerce virtually identical legislati on proposed month earlier by representative mac thornberry would establish nati onal homeland security agency hr 115866 similarly the hartr udman commission in january 2001 had recommended in addition to coordinating foreign and domestic counter terrorism operations setting up national homeland security agency with fema as the necessary core and including the customs service the border patrol and the coast guard67 even more expansive reorganizations have been contemplated one such concept would establish new core agency homeland security agency hsa along the lines of that proposed by hr 1158 and hartrudman the hsa however would also coordinate the activities nd budgets

4660 envisage creating both fe deral department of national homeland security and national office for combating terrorism the former would contain directorates for example for critical infrastructure protection and prevention similar to those of the cu rrent ohs the secretary and director of these respective organizations would be coresponsible for drafting national strategy for combating terrorism and ho meland security response the national office would have broad re sponsibilities in the international sphere including coordinating the implementation of the strategy by military intelligence law enforcement and diplomatic assets and making budget recommendations for these agencies additionally that office would have the authority to review and decertify these agencies budgets us ing procedures similar to t hose established in ondcps statute all such proposals for organization reform have sparked controversy there is little unanimity on the desirable scope or appropriate extent of reorganization advocates of radical change see the need for single center of gravity for homeland security activities critics tend to see the pr ocess of consolidating agencies as costly timeconsuming and potentially disruptive in certain cases such as the customs service part of the treasury department and the fbis national infrastructure protection center nipc the pieces are not entirely distinct and separate from the core missions of the parent organizations questions arise bout the nonenforcement functions of certain agencies for example what happens to customs collection of import tariffs and the coast guards sear ch and rescue opera tions additionally consolidation proposals still fail to encompass organizations that play crucial role in homeland security such as the centers for disease control which are responsible for detecting and responding to biological ttacks the fbi which is responsible for crisis management and dod which concei vably could become the lead federal agency in cases such as terrorist att ack where normal measures are insufficient to carry out federal functions69 finally the scope of th new national office appears to coincide partly with that of the ns c creating the possibility of conflict between these entities congress will need more speci fic information about what problems will be solved and created by proposed agency mergers and other organizational changes almost certainly bureaucratic reorgani zation especially involving the mega solutions described here is unlikely in the immediate future this suggests to some continuing need for coordinator or c onflictresolution mechanism such as the ohs and the hsc success in coordinating federal antiterrorism efforts turns on the ability to foster better sharing of information and

116their state and local counter parts and at the minimum ohs and hsc have served as vital stimulus to that purpose status quo finally arguments can be made for retaining the present ohshsc structure and for allowing it to concentrate on its dom estic counterterrorism responsibilities even in this limited sphere the organization might be able to exercise coordination function especially if the president is prepared to intervene personally as one commentator observes70 key issue is the definition of coordination an ohs staffer interviewed sees this process as essentially nonconfront ational building consensus among agencies to follo w particular course of action71 this could work if the president is willing to underwrite the ohs directors core positions in the face of opposition from agencies jealously guardi ng their turf and prerogatives yet this could cause great difficulties to the extent that it pitted the white house against agencies belonging to the presidents cabin et alternatively administrative measures may be taken to strengthen ohss now weak formal role in the budgetary process recommendation by the abovementioned br ookings study would be to appoint single person to serve both as ridges budget chief and as new associate director of omb for homeland security under such dualhatting arrangement argues the study ohs would have not only the overarching budgetary view that only coordinating office like ohs can have but by being an integral part of the omb process it can exert major if not decisive influence on the final outcome72 disadvantage of such step though is that it could increase th existing separation between domestic and foreign policy aspects of counterterro rism budgeting and decisionmaking pressure is increasing for formalizing the offices powers and for making the ohs director accountable to congress yet the question arises as to whether greater institutional legitimacy in those terms would facilitate ohss coordination task or conversely decrease its flexibility to re spond to new situations the brookings institution study which favors statute cautions that such legislation should give maximum operating flexibility to the president to design its organization and mission73 summary and conclusion in response to the september 11 2001 terro rist attacks president bush created the office of homeland security by execu tive order as federal focal point for planning and coordinating dom estic efforts against terrorism ohss mandate was to bring direction and coherence to homeland s ecurity at the federal level and also to integrate the full range of such activities across federal state and local jurisdictionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31421crs25 establishment of ohs was initially welcomed as an important step toward improving americas domestic response to terrorism nevertheless consensus is growing in congress and in some federal agencies that ohss basis and scope of authority need modification in the eyes of some the entire homeland security effort should be structured along different lines critics argue that the office lacks the power to effectively coordinate the informa tion and resources necessary to protect the country against domestic terrorist threats ohs director tom ridge despite his special access to the president is increasingly depicted as the loser in various turf disputes with the justice department th pentagon and other government agencies still other observers question the overall need for and relevance of ridges office arguing that it adds little value to interagency coordination mechanisms that predated the september 11 attacks or that were put in place after the attacks the essentially domestic focus of ohss responsibilities also has drawn criticism in this view the internati onal mobility and conn ectedness of terrorist organizations dramatized by the events of september 11 has effectively blurred distinctions between domestic and foreign antiterrorism policy ohss mandate as presently defined tends to separate these spheres and this is seen as complicating national planning and res ource allocation for the overa ll counterterrorism effort various remedies have been proposed to address these perceived problems one frequentlymentioned alternative is to enhance the ohss basis of authority with statutory underpinnings and effective c ongressional oversight such step it is argued would provide ohs with the ins titutional legitimacy necessary to ensure effective performance of its coordina tion functions another theme is that coordination mechanisms per are not nough and that homeland security director should exercise administrative line author ity over policies and funding of agencies involved in protecting the american hom eland third recommendation is that ohs play stronger role in international c ounterterrorism especially in coordinating intelligence efforts to track and analyze foreign terrorist threats such change would imply integrating national security and hom eland security planning functions and possibly absorbing ohs into the current nsc structure proposals for reorganizing the us counterterrorism effort are becoming progressively more elaborate legislation recently introduced in the senate and the house of representatives addresses broad range of concerns the bills would consolidate entities responsible for border s ecurity and conseque nce management into single cabinet department they woul d also create new coordination mechanism that unlike ohs would be largely concer ned with he international aspects of counterterrorism policy the heads of the newly created entities would be co responsible for creating single integrat ed strategy and budget for fighting domestic and global terrorism yet the fate of such proposals is uncertain critics view the process of amalgamating agencies as costly timeconsuming and potentially disruptive turfconscious bureaucratic acto rs seem likely to fight reorganization creation of unified nationa l strategy to address all aspects of terrorism while perhaps inherently desira ble could to be complex and difficult undertaking nonetheless the concept of ohs director as an intelligence broker working to provide nonfederal agencies with be tter window on the world of international terrorism and to increase the upward flow of relevant information from the local tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31421crs26 the federal level may have intrinsic appeal even to the offices critics some organizational changes at the margins such as adding professional intelligence officers to ohss director ate of intelligence and tection step now being contemplated might strengthen the offices capability to perform this broker function in any case the crux of ohss valuea dded as coordinato r may lie less in its federal oversight role than in its success in addressing the relatively novel challenge of empowering the states and localities in the fight against terrorism
