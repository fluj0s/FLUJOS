legislation in the 107th congress m angeles villarreal analyst in industrial organization resources science and industry division summary the orphan drug act pl 97414 was signed into law on january 4 1983 the act provides incentives for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop drugs biotechnology products and medical devices for the treatment of rare diseases and conditions these products are commonly referred to as orphan products incentives for orphan product development include marketing exclusivity for orphan drug sponsors tax incentives and research grants since the act was passed in 1983 the food and drug administration fda has approved 183 new orphan products critics of the act argue that because the act relies on marketoriented strategies to promote orphan drug development overpricing of drugs can limit patient access to orphan drug treatment especially among those who lack health insurance others argue that the act has been very successful in finding new treatments for rare diseases and conditions and that any changes to the incentives provided in the law would suppress research and development legislation has been introduced in the 107th congress to modify marketing exclusivity provisions and to accelerate and expand tax benefits for orphan drug manufacturers background the orphan drug act pl 97414 was signed into law on january 4 19831 the purpose of the law was to address congressional concerns about the lack of pharmaceuticals to treat rare diseases and conditions according to the national organization for rare disorders nord2 about 25 million people in the united states suffer from an estimated 6000 conditions known as orphan diseases the orphan drug act provides incentive for drug manufacturers to develop orphan drugs for the treatment of rare diseases and conditions incentives for orphan product development include 1 for more information see fda office of orphan products development program overview httpwwwfdagovorphanprogovwhtm 2 for more information see the nord website httpwwwrarediseasesorg congressional research service the library of congress crs2 marketing exclusivity for orphan drug sponsors tax incentives and research grants these drugs are commonly referred to as orphan drugs3 because prior to the act few drug companies were willing to adopt products to treat these diseases before the early 1980s very few orphan products had been developed because pharmaceutical companies had few financial incentives to develop products for treating small target patient populations in addition firms faced further difficulties in recruiting sufficient number of subjects for clinical trials amendments to the orphan drug act were passed by congress in 1984 1985 and 1988 the original purpose of the 1983 orphan drug act was to provide incentives in the development of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases that would normally be unprofitable or unpatentable initially to qualify for orphan drug status manufacturers had to demonstrate that the development of particular orphan drug would be unprofitable an amendment to the act in 1984 established numeric prevalence threshold to the definition of rare disease or condition to qualify for orphan drug status rare disease or condition was defined as any disease or condition 1 affecting less than 200000 persons in the united states or 2 affecting more than 200000 persons in the united states but for which there is reasonable expectation that the sales of the drug treatment will recover the costs4 prior to this amendment drug sponsor was required to provide financial information regardless of the size of the proposed target patient population with the amendment sponsor could still seek orphan drug designation by demonstrating that the financial criteria of the law were applicable but was not required to do so if the target patient population was less than 200000 in 1985 the act was amended again this time to extend marketing exclusivity for both patentable and unpatentable products the purpose was to protect those products that were patentable but whose patents would expire before or shortly after marketing approval many of these drugs were biotech drugs that had difficulties in obtaining patents the earlier assumption about most orphan drugs being unpatentable was found to not always be true patents had been issued for many potential orphan products but because of prolonged research the patent protection had sometimes expired before marketing approval was obtained5 in 1988 an amendment to the act changed the requirement for submitting applications for orphan drug status under the revised act the application for orphan drug designation now has to be made prior to the submission of an application for marketing approval new drug application nda or product license application pla6 prior to the1988 amendment the designation request could be filed at any time 3 congress did not use the term orphan drug in the actual text of the law instead the statute focuses upon definitions of and treatments for rare diseases and conditions 4 pl 98551 5 shulman sheila bienztadmor brigitta seo pheak dimasi joseph and lasagna louis

application to the fda office of orphan products development oopd which was created as part of the act the oopd administers the acts incentives of the act reviews sponsors applications for orphan designation and administers the orphan products grant program approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements for obtaining marketing approval the act provides various incentives for manufacturers in the development of orphan drugs including marketing exclusivity for sponsors of designated orphan drugs tax incentives and research grants8 after obtaining marketing approval by the fda for designated orphan drug sponsor has seven years of marketing exclusivity for that product9 marketing exclusivity may be the most motivating incentive provided by the act without marketing exclusivity unpatentable products could face competition from lowerpriced generic versions of the drug the period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the fda and applies only to the indication for which the drug has been designated the fda could approve second application for the same drug for different use the fda cannot however approve the same drug made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the marketing exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities manufacturers may claim tax credit of up to 50 for clinical research performed for designated orphan drugs congress extended the tax credit permanently in august 1997 pl 10534 the internal revenue service administers the tax credit provisions of the act another financial incentive for orphan product development is research grants program administered by the oopd in which researchers may compete for grants to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of orphan drugs the objective of the grants program is to fund clinical research that will accelerate or assist in the approval of unapproved products or unapproved new uses for marketed products that demonstrate promising uses for rare diseases or disorders the grants program may also fund studies leading to publications on the safety and efficacy of designated orphan drugs10 6 continued drug approval process primer by blanchard randall iv june 1 1961 7 oopd program overview p 1 8 ibid pp 23 9 market

review process orphan product production the orphan drug act has led to the development of new products for the treatment of rare diseases and conditions such as cystic fibrosis complications affecting hiv infected people gauchers disease hemophilia and rare forms of cancer since the passage of the act the number of orphan product designations and marketing approvals has risen considerably to date the fda has granted marketing approval to 217 orphan products and designated orphan product status to 1090 products including drugs biologics and medical devices11 by contrast in the ten years prior to the enactment of the act the number of orphan products that were marketed by manufacturers was 34 with only ten of these products developed by the pharmaceutical industry the remainder came from research and development funded by the federal government12 the low number of marketed orphan drugs that existed prior to the act is usually attributed to the lack of financial incentives for manufacturers to develop drugs that would treat small target patient population the small size of the market for rare diseases combined with the difficulty in predicting the cost of development created few market incentives for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop orphan drugs the unfavorable expected return on investment did not encourage much interest in investing in the development of these products in addition the issue of product liability may have also limited potential interest in developing orphan drugs the risk of adverse effects in orphan drugs may be somewhat higher than for other prescription drugs because of the smaller number of participants in clinical trials according to one report in 1991 liability claims had been filed against nearly onefifth of industrysponsored orphan products however because of the lack of comparable data there is conclusive evidence that orphan drugs have higher liability risk than other prescription drugs13 in addition to seven years of market exclusivity manufacturing firms that develop orphan products face regulatory restrictions in setting prices for the product like other pharmaceutical products prices are determined by market conditions because of the limited size of the market and the high research and development costs associated with some orphan drugs the manufacturing process can lead to very high per unit costs also the limited market size often prevents companies from acquiring economies of scale in the production process 11 for complete list of orphan product designations and approvals see

1991 p 893 13 ibid p 894 crs5 accurate data on the prices sales and profit margins for orphan products are very limited and vary by source because of the lack of available data it is not possible to provide an accurate analysis on total sales price ranges or profit margins of orphan products some reports claim that orphan drugs are among the pharmaceutical industrys biggest money producers14 these reports point out that certain blockbuster drugs such as replacement enzyme treatment for pompe disease which has treatment cost of 170000 to 340000 per year can be very costly such cases have received media attention over the years however other reports claim that most orphan drugs have relatively low revenues while only very few produce extremely high revenues some of the smaller biotechnology companies that have been successful in producing orphan products for the treatment of diseases such as narcolepsy cystic fibrosis and fanconi anemia have yet to make profit15 1991 report stated that 75 percent of orphan drugs earned less than 10 million in their first year of marketing while 20 percent had sales of more than 26 million two products had sales in excess of 100 million the report found that orphan drug sales had highly skewed distribution that was similar to the distribution of sales revenues for other pharmaceutical sales16 the financial incentives provided by the act appear to have engendered only limited interest from the large pharmaceutical firms according to john mccormick md deputy director of the oopd only 15 percent of applications for orphan drug designation have come from the larger pharmaceutical companies he believes that the provisions of the act have encouraged the creation of small companies involved in orphan drug production especially in the american biotechnology industry17 policy issues and concerns over the years congress has debated several amendments to the act that would prevent companies from using orphan drug status as means to charge excessive prices or make excessive profits some critics of the orphan drug act argue that because the law relies exclusively on marketoriented strategies to promote orphan drug development it has led to overpricing of drugs they argue that many orphan drugs are often overpriced which can limit patient access to affordable treatment especially for those patients who do not have health insurance coverage critics also argue that the definition of an orphan drug one that will treat disease affecting 200000 people or less does not necessarily mean that the drug will not be profitable in response other analysts have said that dramatic changes to the acts incentives would suppress research on orphan drugs which in the long run would lead to fewer drugs being developed to treat rare diseases18 they also argue that any retroactive termination of orphan exclusivity by congress would 14 denise gray in quest to cure rare diseases some get left out the new york times on the

considered amending the orphan drug act on several occasions in the late 1980s and early 1990s proposed amendments to the act addressed concerns that orphan products developed with federal assistance were producing excessive profits for drug companies proposed changes to the act included sales cap provisions but these were not passed some analysts cautioned that such changes could damage the incentives and success of the act20 one proposal which limited market exclusivity was passed by congress in october 1990 it was subsequently vetoed by president bush who believed that it would weaken the exclusivity provision and discourage the development of orphan drugs the amendment would have allowed more than one manufacturer of the same drug to share market exclusivity of the drug and terminated market exclusivity if the prevalence of the disease increased to more than 200000 people21 the president believed that changing the provisions on population limit would send troublesome signal of unilateral rule change to developers22 legislation in the 107th congress in the 107th congress measures have been introduced to modify some provisions of the orphan drug act the orphan drug program improvement act of 2001 hr 386 was introduced to amend the federal food drug and cosmetic act to require that an orphan drugs designation and approved labeling conform with each other and to modify the scope of marketing exclusivity for clinically superior orphan products the bill would require that the description of the disease or condition on the labeling for an orphan product be the same as the description on the oopd list of orphan drug designations in addition the bill would limit marketing exclusivity awarded to clinically superior product so that the exclusivity would apply only to the characteristic or feature that rendered the drug clinically superior to previously approved drug the bill was referred to the house subcommittee on health the orphan drug tax credit act of 2001 hr 1298 was introduced to amend the internal revenue code to move up the date for which the developer may claim the credit for clinical testing of orphan drugs from the date of designation to the date the application for designation was filed another measure the american breakthrough research act of 2001 hr 2153 and s 1049 would provide manufacturers the option to exchange researchrelated tax benefits for refundable tax credit hr 1298 and hr 2153 were referred to the house ways and means committee s 1049 was referred to the senate finance committee 19 implementation of the orphan drug act
