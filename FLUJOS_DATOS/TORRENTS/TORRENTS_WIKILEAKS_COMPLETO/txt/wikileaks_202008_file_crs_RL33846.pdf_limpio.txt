introduction climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at th national level in 1992 th united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the l ead in reducing the six primary greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 20001 for more than decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have b een proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of powe r plant carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources however carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase in 2001 president george w bush rej ected the kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by devel oped countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions2 he also rejected the concept of mandatory emissions reductions since then the administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhous gas emissions in contrast in 2005 the senate passed sense of the senate resolution on climate change declaring that congress should enact legislation establis hing mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the ited states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations3 number of congressional proposals to dvance programs designed to reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress these have generally followed one of three tracks the first is to improve the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions to provide basis for res earch and development and for any potential future reduction scheme th second is to enact ma rketoriented greenhouse gas reduction program along the lines of the tr ading provisions of the current acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments the thirdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33846crs2 4 for discussions of relevant ergy legislation see crs report rl34294 energy independence and security act of 2007 summary of

d yacobucci proposed legislation in 110th congress in the 110th congress members have introduced 12 bills that include provisions to impose or permit some form of market based controls on emissions of greenhouse gases general descriptions of those bills follow beginning with s 2191 which was reported with amendments on ma 20 2008 by the senate committee on environment and public works5 the major provisions of the seven senate bills are compared in appendix the major provisions of the five house bills are compared in appendix b s 2191 as introduced october 18 2007 by senators lieberman and warner would cap greenhouse gas emissions from th electric generation industrial and transportation sectors for facilities that emit more than 10000 tric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent mtco2e as introdu ced the cap is estimated by the sponsors to reduce emissions to 15 below 2005 vels in 2020 declining steadily to 63 below 2005 levels in 2050 the program would be implemented through an expansive allowance trading program to maximize opportunities for costeffective reductions credits obtained from increas in carbon sequestration and acquisition of allowances from foreign sources could be used to comply with 30 of allowance requirements the bill would also establ ish carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary for recent action on s 2191 and for modifica tions to the provisions see the next section s 3036 introduced by senator boxer on may 20 2008 is id entical to the reported version of s 2191 except that s 3036 contains budget amendment aimed at making the bill revenueneutral this would entail devoting percentage of auction revenues increasing from 61 in 2012 to 1599 in 2031 and thereafter to offset budget deficits that are projected to occur due to the capandtrade program6 this bill was considered by the senate the week of june 2 2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33846crs3 s 280 introduced january 12 2007 by senator lieberman would cap emissions of the six greenhouse gases speci fied in the united nations framework convention on climate change at reduced levels from the electric generation transportation industrial and commercial sectors s ectors that account for about 85 of us greenhouse gas emissions the reductions would be implemented in four phases with an emissions cap in 2012 based on the affe cted facilities 2004 emissions for an entity that has single unit that emits more than 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent the cap stead ily declines until it is equal to onethird of the facilities 2004 levels the program would be implemented through an expansive allowance trading program to maximize opportunities for costeffective reductions and credits obtained from in creases in carbon sequestration reductions from noncovered sources and acquisition of allowances from foreign sources could be used to comply with 30 of reduction requirements the bill also contains an extensive new infrastructure to enc ourage innovation and new technologies s 309 introduced january 16 2007 by nator sanders would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis beginning in 2010 beginning in 2020 the countrys emissions would be capped at their 1990 levels and then proceed to decline steadily until they were reduced to 20 of their 1990 levels in the year 2050 epa has the discretion to employ marketbased allowance trading program or any combination of costeffective emission reduction strategies the bill also includes new mandatory greenhouse gas emission standa rds for vehicles and new powerplants along with new energy efficiency performance standard the bill would establish renewable portfolio sta ndard rps and new low carbon generation requirement and trading program s 317 introduced january 17 2007 by senator feinstein would cap greenhouse gas emissions from electric gene rators over 25 megawatts beginning in 2011 affected generators would be cappe d at their 2006 levels declining to 2001 levels by 2015 after that the emissi on cap would decline 1 annually until 2020 when the rate of decline would increase to 15 the allowance trading program includes an allocation scheme that provides for an increasing percentage of all allowances to be auctioned with 100 au ctioning in 2036 and thereafter the cap andtrade program allows some of an entitys reduction requirement to be meet with credits obtained from foreign sources and variety of other activities specified in the bill s 485 introduced february 1 2007 by senator kerry would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis beginning in 2010 beginning in 2020 the countrys emissions would be capped at their 1990 levels after 2020 emissions economywide would be reduced 25 annually from their pr evious years level until 2031 when that percentage would increas to 35 th rough 2050 the allowance trading system includes an allocation scheme that requires an unspecified percentage of allowances to be auctioned the b ill also includes new mandatory greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles along with new energy efficiency performance standard the bill would establish rene wable portfolio standard rps increase biofuel mandates under th renewable fuels sta ndard and mandate new infrastructure for biofuels finally the bill expands and extends existing tax incentives for alternative fuels and advan ced technology vehicles and establishes manufacturer tax credit for advanced technology vehicle investment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33846crs4 s 1766 introduced july 11 2007 by sena tor bingaman would set emissions targets on most of the countrys gree nhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emitting activities such as methane emissions from landfills coal mines animal waste and municipal wastewater projects along with nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soil management wastewater treatment and manure management are not included under the targets although credits for use by covered entities are available or may be generated by verified ghg reductions in these areas beginning in 2012 covered entities would have emissions targets set at their 2006 levels in 2020 the emissions targets would decline steadily until 2030 when the emission target would be set at the entities 1990 levels compliance can be secu red either through an allowance trading program or by paying safety valve pri ce called technology accelerator payment or tap under the trading program allowances are allocated according to various categories including covered entities eligible facilities such as coal mines and carbonintensive industries st ates and sequestration activitie s initially 24 of all allowances are auctioned percentage that increases over time the tap is set at 12 metric ton of carbon dioxide equivale nt it increases 5 annually above the rate of inflation the bill also requires c ountries that do not take comparable action to control emissions to submit special allowances or their foreign equivalent to accompany exports to the united states of any covered greenhouse intensive goods and primary products hr 620 introduced february 7 2007 by representative olver is substantially modified version of s 280 using the same basic structure as s 280 the emission caps under hr 620 are more stringent reductions from affected sectors electric generation transportation industrial nd commercial would be set at 2004 levels in 2012 and then steadily dec line until the cap is equal to about one fourth of facilities 2004 vels although hr 620 pe rmits affected entities to comply with the reduction requirements with credits from foreign sources sequestration and re ductions from noncovered entities these credits are limited to 15 of the sources reduction requirement hr 1590 introduced march 20 2007 by representative wa xman is similar to s 485 hr 1590 would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis beginning in 2010 beginning in 2020 the countrys emissions would be capped at their 1990 levels after 2020 emissions economywide would be reduced by roughly 5 annually from their previous years level through 2050 when emissions levels would be capped at 80 belo w 1990 levels the allowance trading system includes an allocation scheme that requires an unspecified percentage of allowances to be auctioned the bill also includes new ma ndatory greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles along with new energy efficiency performance standard the bill would also establish rene wable portfolio standard hr 4226 introduced november 15 2007 by representative gilchrest is modified version of hr 620 using the same basic structure as hr 620 emission limitations are based on per centages of 2006 emission vels reductions from affected sectors electri c generation transportation industrial nd commercial would be set at 2006 levels in 2012 and then steadily decline until the cap is equal to about onefourth of f acilities 2006 levels in 2050 the bill provides that the president may establish program to re quire importers to pay the value of ghgs emitted during the production of goods or services imported into the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33846crs5 from countries that have comparable emi ssion restrictions to those of the united states the programs requirement ma not be imposed on countries until negotiations to achieve agreement on such restrictions have been attempted in addition the bill also establishes carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary hr 6186 introduced june 4 2008 by representative markey would cap emissions from covered sources at 930 million mtco2e in 2050 of the longterm reduction targets in the capandtrade bills this is among the most stringent hr 6186 would auction 94 of its emission llowances in 2012 increasing to 100 by fy2020 almost 60 of the auction revenue s would be distributed via tax credits and rebates to low and middleincome households th bill would direct epa to develop emission performance standards fo r noncovered entities which may include coal mines landfills wastewater treatment operations and animal feeding operations in addition new s defined in the bill coalfired power plants would be required to capture and geologically quester not less than 85 of their co2 emissions within specified time frame hr 6316 introduced june 19 2008 by representative doggett would cap emissions from covered sources at 348 million mtco2e in 2050 of the longterm reduction targets in the capandtrade bills this is the most stringent in addition the bill would direct epa to develop regulations that prevent growth in emissions from noncovered entities hr 6316 would auc tion 85 of its emission allowances in 2012 increasing to 100 by fy2020 approx imately 54 of th auction revenues would be distributed for consumer assist ance of this allotment 66 would fund healthcare coverage program established by subsequent legislation the remainder would provide rebates and tax relief to low and m oderateincome households domestic offsets and international allowances could combine to contribute up to 25 of covered sources allowan ce requirements similar to other bills carbon market efficiency board would observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary the bill would also require countries that do not take comparable action to control emissions to submit special allowances or their foreign equivalent to accompany exports to the united states of any covered primary product legislative action in the 110th congress on may 20 2008 the senate committee on environment and public works subcommittee on private sector and consumer solutions to global warming and wildlife protection reported out revised version of s 2191 as reported from subcommittee s 2191 is estimated to re duce greenhouse gas emissions 19 below 2005 levels by 2020 up from 15 as in troduced and 63 below 2005 levels by 2050 the increase in the estimated reductions in 2020 is the result of amended text that includes greenhouse gases from all na tural gas uses under the overall emissions cap other amendments approved included modifications to eligibility requirements for the advanced technolog vehicles manufacturing incentive program and the advanced coal generation technology dem onstration program modifications were also made to the proposed allocation of allowances to help tribal communitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33846crs6 respond to climate change and to encour age international fo rest carbon activities along with 1 of allowances reserved for rural cooperativ and corresponding reduction in allowances allocated to the re st of the electric power industry the revised bill also added two new recipients of auction revenues bureau of land management emergency firefighting f und 300 milli on and forest service emergency firefighting fund 800 million on december 5 2007 the full committee orde red reported out revised version of s 2191 by an 11 to 8 vote the b ill was reported by the committee on may 20 2008 srept 110337 the revised bill expands the greenhouse gas reduction program coverage by replacing the previous definition of covered facility based on the electric power transportation and i ndustrial sectors with comprehensive upstream definition for oil refineries natura l gas processing plants and downstream definition for coal consumers among the amendments agreed to by the full committee were new low carbon fuel standa rd lcfs that would require the carbon intensity of transportation fuel to be frozen in 2011 and then reduced by 5 in 2015 and 10 in 2020 other amendments agreed to would increase incentives for states to modify their utility regulatory structures to encourage energy efficiency and would broaden the ability of states to use their allowance allocations to mitigate adverse economic impacts resulting from the bills implement ation as ordered reported s 2191s emissions cap is estima ted by its sponsors to require 71 reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 from cove red entities estimated by the sponsors to account for 87 of total us greenhouse gas emissions overall the sponsors estimate that s 2191 would reduce total u s greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66 from 2005 levels by 2050 in april 2008 proposed amendment to s 2191 was submitted by the committee to the congressional budget office cbo to be included in the scoring of the bill the amendment would provide for some of the auctioned revenues to be put aside for deficit reduction purposes senator boxer introduced s 3036 on may 20 2008 this proposal combined the reported version of s 2191 with the

appendix c common terms allocation schemes upstream and downstream regulatory approaches to allocating allowances as pposed to auction schemes can choose different points and participants along the production proce ss to assign allowances and the resulting compliance responsibility upstream allocation schemes establish emission caps and assign allowances at pr oduction importation or distribu tion point of products that will eventually produce greenhouse emissi ons further down the production process for example in the natural gas sector emission caps could be established and allowances assigned at processing facilities where facilities and participants shrink from about 400000 wells and 8000 companie s to 500 facilities and 200 companies in contrast downstream allocation schemes establish emission caps and assign allowances at the point in the process where the emissions are emitted in the case of the natural gas industry to achieve the same coverage as th upstream scheme this would involve assigning allowa nces to natural gasfired electric generators industry and even residential users thus so downstream proposals choose either to exempt certain sectors such as residen tial use from capandtrade program or to employ hybrid allocation scheme where some of the allowances are allocated upstream and others downstream s uch as the electric generators allowance an allowance is generally defined as limited authorization by the government to emit 1 ton of pollutant in the case of greenhouse gases an allowance generally refers to metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent although used generically an allowance is technically different from credit credit represents ton of pollutant that an entity has reduced in excess of its legal requirement however the terms tend to be used inte rchangeably along with others such as permits auctions auctions can be used in mark etbased pollution control schemes in several different ways for example title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments uses an annual auction to sure the liquidity of the credit trading program for this purpose small per centage of the credits permitted under the program are auctioned annually with the proceeds returned to the entities that would have otherwise received them private parties are also allowed to participate second possibility is to use an auction to raise revenues for re lated or unrelated program for example the regional gr eenhouse gas initiative rggi is exploring an auction to implement its public benef it program to assist consumers or pursue strategic energy purposes third possibility is to use auctions as means of allocating some or all of the allowances establishe d under ghg control program obviously the impact that an aucti on would have on cost would depend on how extensively it was used in any ghg control program and to what purpose the revenues were expended banking although allowances are generally allocated on an annual basis most capandtrade programs do not require participants to either use the allowance that year or else lose it under many pr oposals allowances can be banked by the receiving participant or traded to another participant who can use or bank it to be used or traded in future year banking reduces the absolute cost of compliance by making annual emission caps flexible ove r time the limited ability to shift

equipment construction schedules and respond to transi ent events such as weather and economic shocks bubble bubble is regulatory device th at permits two or more sources of pollutants to be treated

second market in pollution licenses ie allowances between polluters is the most costeffective means of reducing emissions to the level of the cap this market in allowances is designed so that owners of allowances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for future use or sale in the case of the sulfur dioxide program contained in the 1990 clean air act amendm ents most allowances were allocated free by the federal governme nt to utilities according to statutory formulas related to given facilitys historic fuel use and emissions other allowances have been reserved by the government for periodic auctions to ensure market liquidity carbon tax carbon tax is generally ceived as levy on natural gas petroleum and coal according to their carbon content in the appr oximate ratio of 06 to 08 to 1 respectively however propos als have been made to impose the tax downstream of the production process when the carbon dioxide is actually released to the atmosphere in contrast to capandtrade program in which the quantity of emissions is limited and the pr ice is determined by an allowance marketplace with carbon tax the price is limited and the quan tity of emissions is determined by the participants based on the cost of c ontrol versus the cost of the tax coverage coverage is the breadth of econo mic sectors covered by particular greenhouse gas reduction program as well as the breadth of covered entities within covered sector emissions cap mandated limit on how much pollutant or greenhouse gases an affected entity can release to the atmosphere caps can be either an absolute cap where the amount is specified in terms of t ons of emissions on an annual basis or ratebased cap where the amount of emissions pr oduced per unit of output such as electricity is specified but not the absolute amount rel eased caps may be imposed on an entity sector or economywide basis generation performance standard gps also called an outputbased allocation allowances are allocated gratis to entities in proportion to their relative share of total electricity generation in recent year grandfathering grandfathering generally re fers an allocation scheme in which allowances are distributed to affected entities on the basis of historic emissions these allowances are generally distributed freeofcharge by the government to the affected entities grandfathering can also refer to entities thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33846crs26 because of age or because they have met an earlier standard or other factors are exempted from new regulatory requirement greenhouse gases the six gases recognized under the united nations framework convention on climate change are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o sulfur hexafluoride sf6 hydrofluorocarbons hfc and perfluorocarbons pfc hybrid program generally greenhouse gas reduction program that allows emitters to choose between complying with the reduction requirement of capand trade program or paying set price safety valve price to the government in lieu of making reductions leakage decreases in greenhouse gasrelate d reductions or benefits outside the boundaries set for defining project s or programs net greenhouse gas impact resulting from mitigation activities for example emissions could be reduced in an area with greenhouse gas controls by movi ng an emitting industry to an area without such controls regrets policy regrets policy is one of establishing programs for other purposes that would have concomitant greenhouse gas reductions therefore only those policies that reduce greenhouse ga s emissions at additional cost are considered offsets offsets generally refer to emission credits achieved by activities not directly related to the emissions of an ffected source examples of offsets would include forestry and agricultural activities that absorb carbon dioxide and reduction achieved by entities that are not regula ted by greenhouse gas reduction program revenue recycling some greenhouse gas reducti on programs create revenues through auctions compliance penalties or imposition of carbon tax revenue recycling refers to how program dispos of those revenues how program handles revenues received can have signif icant effect on the overall cost of the program to the economy safety valve devices designed to prevent or to respond to unacceptably high compliance costs for greenhouse gas reductions generally triggered by prices in the allowance markets safety valve approaches can include 1 set price alternative to making reductions or buying allowances at the market price 2 slowdown in tightening the emissions cap and 3 lengthening of the time allowed for compliance depending on the interplay between the missions cap and safety valve and actual compliance costs safety valve can affect the integrity of the emissions cap sequestration sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide from emission streams or from the atmosphere and then storing it in such way as to prevent its release to the atmosphere
