congress is presently examining idea again and hr 1350 108th congress passed the house on april 30 2003 by vote of 251 to 1713 in the senate s 1248 was in troduced by senators gregg and kennedy and referred to the senate health education labor and pensions committee on june 12 2003 the b ill was reported out of co mmittee on june 25 20034 and placed on the senate legisla tive calendar under general orders on november 3 2003 currently s 1248 is scheduled for the senate floor the week of may 10 2004 in their introductory st atements senators gregg and kennedy emphasized that s 1248 was bipartisan bill senator gregg stated that the bill strikes the appropriate balance between pr otecting the educational rights of children with disabilities while simultaneously making idea less litigious and compliance based5 the bill does not address the issue of full funding senator gregg noted that senator kennedy and i decided at the very outset to postpone that issue to the floorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs2 6 id senator kennedy stated we will have an opportunity to debate this issue and others in our committee and in the senate in the weeks ahead 7 the us department of educations id ea regulations at 34 cfr 300313a permit states to determine whether developmental delay applies to children ages 3 through 9 or subset of that age range eg ages 3 through 5 8 the esea definition lists english reading or language arts mathematics science foreign languages civics and government economics arts history and geography as core academic subjects 9 these services would include for example adjustments to the learning environment modifications to instructional methods and adaptations of the curriculumsince that is an issue that merits the ttention and active participation of the entire senate6 definitions and allocation formula provisions definitions the definitions in current law are fo r the most part unchanged by s 1248 however s 1248 would amend the definiti ons of assistive technology device and related services to eliminate coverage of surgically implanted medical devices the postsurgical maintenance programming or replacement of such devices or external devices connected with the use of surgically implanted medical device the routine maintenance and monitoring of an external device at the same time the child is receiving idea services is permitted the bill would add language to the definition of child with disability with respect to child ages three to nine years of age current law permits state or local educational agency lea to include child in this age group in the definition if he or she is experiencing development delays and therefore needs special education and related services s 1248 would add the phrase or any subset of that age range ie ages 3 to 9 including ages 3 through 5 this would appear to codify practice permitted under current id ea regulations of providing flexibility to states in determining which children in the age group 3 to 9 the term developmental delay applies7 s 1248 adds definition of core acad emic subject by reference to the definition of that term in section 9101 of the elementary and secondary education act esea8 this helps to align idea with the new requirements for teacher qualifications in the child left behind act nclba in addition s 1248 adds an extensive definition of highly qualified and consultative services again to align idea with nclba requirements with respect to the qualification of edu cational personnel while taking into account differences between special education and general educa tion teachers for example if special education teacher provides only consultative services9 to secondary school teacher teaching core academic subjects to children with disabilities the specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs3 10 for further information on nclb t eacher requirements see crs report rl30834 k12 teacher quality issues and legislative action 11 for further information on idea grant formulas under current law see crs report rl31480 individuals with disabilities education act idea state grant formulas 12 maximum state grants the basis of fu ll funding for idea are calculated based on 40 of the national average per pupil expenditure appe times the number of children with disabilities the state serves 13 these percentages parallel the weights given to and the age ranges for population and poverty in the grantstostates formula age ranges for population and poverty vary according to the age ranges for children with disabilities in the various states 14 s 1248 would make change in funding for the freely associated states of the republic of the marshall islands the federated states of micronesia and the republic of palau under current law these entities receive idea part b funds through competition funded as part of the setaside for outlying areas nd the freely associated states under s 1248 each of these entities would receive grant equal to the amount received for fy2003 under part b for fy2003 the total amount for these entities is about 66 millioneducation teacher to meet th definition of highly qualifie d must meet the standards of the definition for all special education teachers that is be fully certified in the state as special education teacher and demons trate the knowledge and skills necessary to teach children with disabilities but need not meet standards with respect to the academic subjects being taught as the regular teacher must do to be highly qualified under nclba10 formula allocation provisions s 1248 would make minimal changes in cu rrent idea state and substate grant formulas none of which would appear to change how idea funds are currently allocated the senate bill would simplify the language of the part b grantstostates formula for example by eliminating language on the interim formula which had been in effect before the permanent formula became effective in fy2000 after that date the interim formula would neve r become effective again s 1248 retains the permanent ie current formula language with the technical change that funds permitting states first are allocated the amount received for fy1999 and then remaining funds are allocated by the populationpoverty formula11 fy1999 is the effective base year amount under current law so this should not change idea allocations s 1248 would continue the au thorization for part b at such sums as may be necessary part b including section 619 which au thorizes state grants for idea preschool programs would conti nue to be permanently authorized s 1248 would specify calculation of the maximum amount available for awarding grants under this part for any fis cal year this total would be calculated based on the total number of children with disabilities served for school year 2002 2003 times 40 of national averag per pupil expenditure appe12 the total amount for each successive year would be determined by increasing this amount by an annual factor derived 85 from overall growth in child population and 15 from overall growth in childre n living in poor families13 this amount would presumably be distributed to states outlying areas14 and the bureau of indian affairs according to currentlaw provisions thus s 1248 apparently would eliminate the provision inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs4 15 this minimum amount is also inflationindexed under current law 16 current maximum state setasides vary fro m 83 to 115 of state grants based on data from the us department of ducation ed budget service 17 s 1248 apparently repeals lea capacity building and improvement grants the so called sliver grants 18 state for which the maximum reserve for state administration is 800000 would be permitted to reserve up to 12 of their tota l grant after subtracting the amount for administration for fy2004 and fy2005 for other statelevel activitiescurrent law determining states maximum state grant at 40 of appe times the number of children with disabilities the state serves this provision would have impact on states allocation until the stat became eligible for its maximum grant the presumed eventual impact of this ch ange would be to remove incentives for states to overidentify children with disabilities to increase their maximum grants it is important to note that such limitation on child count for the purposes of determining maximum state grants has impact on who must be served under part b of idea s 1248 would make certain changes in pr ovisions governing state reserves for administration and other statelevel activities under current law the maximum amounts states may reserve from their part b grants for stat elevel activities are determined by increasing the prioryear reserve by the lesser of the rate of inflation or the percentage increase if any in states grant since appropriations for the part b grantstostates program have been grow ing at rates well above inflation the state reserves have been increased from year to year by inflation ie at rates well below growth rates of overall grants to states of the amount reserved states may designate for state administration 20 or minimum of about 57000015 whichever is greater currently these provisions mean that states can retain for state purposes on average about 10 of their state grants and about 2 of state grants on average for administration but these percentages vary somewhat from state to state and under current law will almost certainly change probably decreasing in the future16 the amount remaining from the total state reserv after subtracting the amount for state administration can be used for other statelevel activities such as direct services provided by states and assistance to leas in meeting personnel needs17 s 1248 would permit states to reserv for state administration the maximum reserved for fy2003 or 800000 whichever amo unt is greater apparently these amounts would be increased by inflation each year with the exception of the increased minimum for administration states administrative reserves should be the same as those under current law s 1248 would change the maximum amount states could reserve for other state activities and would enlarge the scope of those activities for fy2004 and fy2005 states could reserve up to 10 of their total grants after subtracting the amount reserv ed for state administration18 beginning in fy2006 the maximum amount for other state activities would adjusted by the rate of inflation this approach would continue through fy2009 under the senate proposal amounts for other state activities could be appreciably larger than under current law for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 for the next 4 fiscal ears the growth rate would be the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs5 19 if future growth rates in part b grants to states are below infla tion growth in state set asides under s 1248 would be greater than unde r current law which pegs setaside growth rate to the lesser of inflation or states overall grant growth rate 20 the applicable appe for school year 20022003 is about 7500 21 526 us 66 1999 22 for more detailed discussion see crs report rs20104 cedar rapids community school district v garret f the individuals with disabilities education act and related services 23 20 usc 1412aas the currentlaw growth rate if overall st ate grants grow at rates above inflation19 however these growth rates would be pplied to higher base than under current law as noted above s 1248 would increase th scope of other st atelevel activities presumably justifying increased maximu m state setasides for these purposes in addition to variety of required and per mitted uses of these funds states would be required to use 2 of the states total gr ant after reserving an amount for state administration to assist leas to addr ess the needs of highneed children with disabilities the senate bill defines highneed child as one for whom providing free appropriate public education fape costs more than 4 times the national average per pupil expenditure appe20 states would distribute funds to approved leas to pay 75 of the special education and related services costs that exceed 4 times appe this provision addresses the issue of educating children with low incidence high cost disabilities this issue gained increased prominence when the supreme court decided the case cedar rapids community school district v garret f21 garret f was child paralyzed from the neck down as result of motorcycle accident but who retained his mental ab ilities his family had arranged for his physical care during the day for number of years but eventually they requested the school to accept financial responsibility for his health care services during the school day the supreme court interpreting the definition of related services held that the extensive services required by garret f mu st be provided by the school as long as they were not medical services that must be provided by physician22 state and local eligibility in general section 612a of idea provides for stat eligibility if the state demonstrates to the satisfaction of the secretary that the state has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets each of the followi ng conditions these conditions include the core requirements of idea for the provision of fape and an individualized education program iep23 s 1248 would change the language of section 612a by striking demonstrates to the satisfaction of and inserting submits plan thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs6 24 s 1248 would make similar change to section 613 regarding lea eligibility 20 usc 1413a 25 20 usc 1412a14 and 15 26 s 1248 would permit parent to complain to the state educational agency sea if he or she believed staff were not highly qualified as defined by the act but would not create right of action on behalf of an individual student if parent claimed that staff person were not highly qualified that is the parent w ould have the right to complain to the sea but would not have the right to seek remedies through the courts 27 apparently s 1248 would require separate reporting on drop out rates and graduation rates for children with disabilities nclba requires that graduation rates be reported as part of the ayp requirements but does not exp licitly require that they be disaggregated by subgroups of students such as children with disabilitiesprovides assurances to th secretary of education s interpreted current law to require the states to submit documents to support procedural checklist this change would eliminate these administrative procedural requirements24 personnel standards and student assessment although many of the state eligibility requirements in section 612 would not be changed under s 1248 the bill would make so notable changes in many cases to bring idea into alignment with and to elaborate on requirements under nclba s 1248 would amend requirements for state pe rsonnel standards and performance goals and indicators to align them with nclba re quirements for exam ple states would be required to ensure that each special education teacher in the state who teaches in an elementary middle or secondary sc hool is highly qualified not later than the 20062007 school year see above the propos ed definition of highly qualified s 1248 would change the provision that stat have policy requiring leas to make an ongoing good faith effort in recruitin g and hiring appropria tely and adequately trained personnel to requiring leas to tak measurable steps to recruit hire train and retain highly qualif ied personnel s 1248 would apparently remove requirements regarding state comprehens ive system of personnel development and regarding hiring and retraining personnel to meet highest state personnel standards25 s 1248 would require that providers of re lated services such as physical therapy and counseling services meet standards that are consistent with state requirements that apply to the professional discipline in which related services are being provided26 s 1248 would align idea performance go als and indicators with requirements for adequate yearly progress ayp27 standards and assessments under nclba in general children with disabilities would be required to participate in state and districtwide testing programs as under nclb as determined by the individualized education program iep team depending on each childs needs he or she could take assessments with or without accommodations eg alternative sting environments such as quieter location than the regular classroom such assessments must be aligned with the states challenging academic content and academic

academic achievement standards or with states content standards but with alternative achievement standards private schools the state eligibility sections of idea contain provisions relating to children with disabilities in private schools incl uding when these children are unilaterally placed in private schools by their parents nd when they are placed in private schools by public agencies under current law when children with disabilities are unilaterally placed in private sc hool by their parents the states must spend proportionate am ount of idea funds on these children special education and related services may be provided on the premises of private schools including parochial schools and the re quirements regarding child find are applicable to such children28 currently idea provides that when ch ildren with disabilities are placed in or referred to private schools by public agencies the costs are to be paid by the public agency29 and under current law court or hearing officer may require an educational agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of the enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made fape available to the child in timely manner prior to the enrollment30 current law allows for limitations on reimbursement in certain situations such as notice that parents are required to provide or when there is judicial termination of unreasona bleness with respect to actions taken by the parents31 current law also provides for exceptions to this notice requirement where the cost of reim bursement may not be reduced or denied for failure to provide notice if 1 the parent is illiterate 2 compliance would result in physical or serious emotional harm to the child 3 the school prevented the parent from providing such notice or 4 the parents had not received the notice that the educational agency wa s required to provide32 s 1248 would make changes in the curre nt law regarding children enrolled in private schools by their parents currently idea states that to the extent consistent with the number and location of children with disabilities in the state who are enrolled by their parents in private elem entary and secondary schools provision is made for the participa tion of those children33 s 1248 would add the phrase in the school district served by local educational agen cy after the phrase secondary schools in addition s 1248 would add phrase to the current law indicating that the funds expended for parentally placed private school children include direct services to these children and requiring thes services to the extent practicable s 1248 also would add detailed provisions concerning record keeping and child findhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs8 34 as in current law this option is not ava ilable to an lea that the state determines is unable to establish and maintain programs of free appropriate public education that meet the requirements of this subsectionincluding consultation process with the lea and representatives of children with disabilities parentally placed in private schools and compliance procedure that would give private school fficial the right to complain to the sea that the lea did not engage in meaningful and timely consultation or did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official pr ivate school official would also have right to complain to the secretary of education the current law regarding children with disabilities who are placed in private schools by public agencies would remain unchanged in s 1248 however changes would be made to the current law regard ing payment for the education of children who are enrolled in private schools without the consent of the public agency these changes would involve the exceptions to the limitation on reimbursement s 1248 would require that reimburseme nt shall not be reduced due to the parents failure to provide notice if the school personnel pr evented the parent from providing such notice or the parents had not received noti ce of the notice requirement in addition s 1248 would provide that the cost of re imbursement may in the discretion of court or hearing officer not be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate and cannot write in english or compliance with the notice requirement would likely have resulted in physical or serious emotional harm to the child local eligibility section 613 contains requirements that leas must meet to be eligible to receive idea funds among these requirements ar certain financial conditions to ensure that federal funds increase spending on speci education rather than substitute for state and local spending leas must ensure that part b funds are used to supplement not supplant sns other sp ecial education funding and that with certain exceptions leas cannot decrease spending for special education from one year to the next the maintenance of effo rt moe requirement under current law one exception to these requirements is that leas can use up to 20 of the increase in their idea grants from one year to the next for meeting sns and moe requirements s 1248 would significantly change this exception by permitting leas to treat as local funds for the purpos of meeting sns nd moe requirements up to 8 of their total part b grants once state received its maximum grant discussed above leas in that state coul d treat up to 40 of their grants as local funds presumably the purpose of these provisions is to provide leas with the potential of using funds otherwise required for special educati on for other purposes34 under current law the treat as local exception to sns and moe is available only to leas not to states s 1248 woul d provide similar exceptions for states that fund at least 80 of the nonfederal cost of educating children with disabilities and for states that are the sole provider of free appropriate public education or direct service for children with disabilities such states may treat idea funds as general funds available for supporting educational purposes in the case of states it would be the secretary of education who w ould prohibit states from exercising thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs9 35 this provision presumably responds to criticism of the socalled discrepancy model for identifying children with learning disab ilities see for example reid

fordham foundation and the progressive policy institute may 2001exceptions based on the inability to pr ovide adequate free appropriate public education s 1248 would add certain local uses for idea funds the senate bill would allow leas to use idea funds for t echnology to implement case management activities the senate bill would permit leas to use up to 15 of their part b grant for prereferral services these servi ces could be provided to students from kindergarten to 12th grade but emphasizing those in kindergarten to 3rd grade who have not been identified as needing special education or related services but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in general education environment activities that could undertake include provision of educational and behavi oral services and support in cluding scientif ically based literacy instruction and professional development fo r teachers to provide such services the senate bill notes that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to either limit or create right to free appr opriate public educa tion under this part evaluations and individualized education programs ieps provisions relating to evaluations nd assessments and the iep would be amended by s 1248 current law requires informed parental consent prior to the evaluation to determine whether child qua lifies under idea it also provides some leeway to an lea if parent does not consent but it is deemed necessary to evaluate the child s 1248 would expand the leas flexibility if the parent does not provide consent or the parent does not respond to request from the lea to provide consent in those cases the lea may proceed with an initial evaluation in addition if the parent does not provide consen t for idea services or fails to respond to the leas request the lea shall not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make available free appropriate public education to the child for the failure to provide the special educati on and related services for which the local educational agency requested such informed consent with respect to the determination of whether child has specific learning disability an lea would not be required to take into consideration whether ch ild has severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability35 s 1248 would make certain changes in th iep some of these changes would be related to assessments and standards and would help align the iep with state requirements under nclba requi rements discussed above for example the iep would contain statement of any individual appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the academic achievement and functional performance of the child on state and dist rictwide assessmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs10 36

introduction idea contains detailed pro cedural safeguards designed to ensure the provision of fape one of the goals of s 1248 is to alleviate the stress in disagreements between schools and parents36 and to further this goal some changes were made in the procedural safeguards section of idea statute of limitations and procedural safeguards notice s 1248 would add two new provisions re garding statutes of limitations there is statute of limitations requirement regarding the filing of due process complaint and statute of limitations requirement regarding filing civil action after the decision of hearing officer the statute of limitations regarding the right to present complaints would require that parent or public agency request an impartial due process hearing within two years of the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the lleged action that forms the basis of the complaint however if the state has an explicit time limitation for requesting such hearing under this part in such time as the state law allows in ddition the senate bill would provide for exceptions to the statute of limitations the statute of limitations does not apply if the parent was prevented from requesting the hearing due to 1 the failure of the local educational agency to provide prior written or procedural safeguards notices 2 false representations that the local educational agency was attempting to resolve the problem forming the basis of the complaint or 3 the local educational agencys withholding of in formation from the parents s 1248 also requires that party filing civil action shall have 90 days from the date of the decision of the hearing officer to bring such an action or if the state has an explicit time limitation for bringing such action in such time as the state law allows the senate bill would also change the current requirements regarding when copy of procedural safeguards is given to the parents of child with disability generally the senate bill would require that copy of the procedural safeguards available be given to the parents only one time year except that copy would also be given 1 upon initial re ferral or parental reque st

conduct in question was the result of the childs disability or 2 if the conduct in question resulted from the failure to implement the iep or develop and implement behavi oral interventions if either

ligible for special education and related services current law provides that ch ild who has not been determined to be eligible for special education nd related services nd who has engaged in behavior that violated any rule or code of conduct of the local educational agency may seek the protections of idea if the local educational agency had knowledge that the child was child with disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred the current law sets forth certain situations where local educational agency shall be deemed to have knowledge that child is child with disability54 s 1248 would amend this provision in part by adding new situation where the lea is deemed to ve knowledge where the child has engaged in pattern of behavior that should have alerted lea personnel that the child may be in need of special education and related services in addition the senate bill would add an exception where the lea is deemed not to have knowledge that the child has

provides for judicial review if state is dissatisfied with the secretarys final action with respect to the ligibility of the state under section 61257 s1248 would make substantial changes to these provisions s 1248 would require the secretary to monitor implementation of this act through oversight of the states exercise of general supervision using focused monitoring which would concentrate on improving educational re sults and functional outcomes for all children with disabilities while ensuring compliance with program requirements with particular emphasis on those require ments that are most closely related to improving educational results for children with disabilities the bill would require the secretary and the states to monitor pr iority areas the provision of fape in the least restrictive environment the provision of transition services state exercise of general supervisory authority and over representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education the secr etary also may examine othe r relevant information and data the senate bill would require the secretary to implement and administer system of required indicators that measures the progress of states in improving their performance using these indicators the secretary would review the performance of children with disabilities in the state on assessments dropout rates and graduation rates and compare these results to the performance and rates for all children s 1248 also would require the state to have compliance plan developed in collaboration with the secretary under the senate bill the secretary would be required to examine relevant state information and data annually to determine if the state is making satisfactory progress toward improving educational results for children with disabilities and is in compliance with the provisions of idea if the secretary determines that state is not making satisfactory prog ress one or more actions must be taken including directing the use of state level funds for technical assistance nd withholding between 20 and 50 of the amount state may re tain for statelevel activities if the secretary determines that state has failed to meet the benchmarks in the state compliance plan and make sa tisfactory progress in improvi ng educational results at the end of the fifth year after the secretary has approved the compliance plan the secretary may take further actions including suspending payment to recipient however s 1248 also provides that if the secretary determines that state is not in substantial compliance with any provision of this part add itional actions would be required such as requiring the prep aration of corrective action plan or improvement plan imposing special cond itions on the states grant and further withholding of funds for state level activities in additi on to this graduated approach to sanctions s 1248 also contains pr ovision for egregious noncompliance at any time that the secretary determines that state is in egregious noncompliance or is willfully disregarding the provisions of idea the secretary may take the actions specified above and may also institute cease and desist action and refer the case tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31971crs18 the officer of the inspector general if action is taken regarding an egregious violation or after five years from the approval of the compliance plan the secretary would be required to report to congress on the specific action taken and the reasons for the action s 1248 would give the secretary discre tion when withholding payments to limit the withholding to programs or projects or portions thereof that are affected by the failure if state is dissatisfied with th secretarys final ac tion the state may seek judicial review in

of devel opmental delay part c aims to serve infants and toddler s experiencing delay in physical cognitive and other areas of development current law requires states to determine definition of developmental delay as criterion for eligibility for part c grants but leaves it to states to determine their own definition s 1248 would require at minimum that the definition include all infants and toddl ers experiencing developmental delay of 35 or more in one area of development or delay of 25 or more in two or more areas of development another addition to part c under s 1248 would be the
