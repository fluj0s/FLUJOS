from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to susansolomonnoaagov susan solomon susansolomonnoaagov kevin trenberth trenbertcgducaredu subject re after the fod date thu jan 6 151331 2005 cc martinmanningnoaagov susan thanks for the quick reply kevin might have thoughts but ill give it some thought over the next few months it isnt crucial till well after our second meeting kevin can relay our thoughts on references next week and we can come up with specific suggestions here if these need to be discussed with wg2 and wg3 before all the second lead author meetings i know we can reduce our number of references with more work but i suspect we will be requested at the time of the fod and sod and maybe the zod to consider many others lot of nmss university depts and research institutes measure success as seeing their work cited by ipcc i reviewed knmi this time last year and they did exactly this this shouldnt be measure but we will likely be under pressure to cite many more papers for this reason cheers phil at 1358 06012005 susan solomon wrote phil happy new year to you too its good to hear that your chapter is progressing well ill see kevin next week at the ams meeting and perhaps we can discuss its high points along with the more basic issue of references etc youve raised number of concerns that are always an issue not only for ipcc but also for other assessments and even for our own individual key papers at times but you have made suggestions as to how to deal with them could you please let know if you have any suggestions to put forward thanks susan susan happy new year im working hard on the chapter that kevin has put sterling efforts on over the christmas break itll be with you by jan 14 hopefully earlier ive been talking to keith briffa here and there is lot of email traffic from the skeptics about the last 1k years also senator inhofes speech from jan 4 is doing the rounds i know youve probably thought all this through but there will be number of key issues in ar4 likely candidates that im aware of are the msu issue where we seem to be making some progress and the last 1k years where we might be but as this is about paleo it does take time well the issue is once the fod goes out to all in say septoct 05 what will stop the drafts getting onto web sites in the media etc and the whole thing blowing up then instead of being properly aired in 2007 i know we wont have an spm but those that want will say they are only referring to papers that endorse their views and they are not referring to scientists with contrary ones ar4 will get bad press only half way through its development i know you will have phrases like draft only and not for distribution but can we really police this once the zod is in kevin and will be sending you some ideas about referencing formats abbreviations smaller fonts etc we currently have about 3 times what we allowed for 7 pages of 70 cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
