peter folger and deborah d stine resources science and industry division capturing co2 from coalfired power plants challenges for comprehensive strategy summary any comprehensive approach to substantially reduce greenhouse gases must address the worlds dependency on coal for quarter of its energy demand including almost half of its electricity demand to maintain coal in the worlds energy mix in carbonconstrained future would require development of technology to capture and store its carbon dioxide emissions this situation suggests to some that any greenhouse gas reduction program be delayed until such carbon capture technology has been demonstrated however technological innovation and the demands of carbon control regime are interlinked technology policy is substitute for environmental policy and must be developed in concert with it much of the debate about developing and commercializing carbon capture technology has focused on the role of research development and deployment technologypush mechanisms however for technology to be fully commercialized it must also meet market demand demand created either through price mechanism or regulatory requirement demandpull mechanisms any conceivable carbon capture technology for coalfired powerplants will increase the cost of electricity generation from affected plants because of efficiency losses therefore few companies are likely to install such technology until they are required to either by regulation or by carbon price regulated industries may find their regulators reluctant to accept the risks and cost of installing technology that is not required the department of energy doe has invested millions of dollars since 1997 in carbon capture technology research and development rd and the question remains whether it has been too much too little or about the right amount in addition to appropriating funds each year for the doe program congress supported rd investment through provisions for loan guarantees and tax credits congress also authorized significant expansion of carbon capture and sequestration ccs spending at doe in the energy independence and security act of 2007 legislation has also been introduced in the 110th congress that would authorize spending for carbon capture technology development other legislation introduced invokes the symbolism of the manhattan project of the 1940s and the apollo program of the 1960s to frame proposals for largescale energy policy initiatives that include developing ccs technology however commercialization of technology and integration of technology into the private market were not goals of either the manhattan project or apollo program finally it should be noted that the status quo for coal with respect to climate change legislation isnt necessarily the same as business as usual the financial markets and regulatory authorities appear to be hedging their bets on the outcomes of any federal legislation with respect to greenhouse gas reductions and becoming increasingly unwilling to accept the risk of coalfired power plant with or without carbon capture capacity the lack of regulatory scheme presents numerous risks to any research and development effort designed to develop carbon capture technology ultimately it also presents risk to the future of coal contents introduction coal and greenhouse gas emissions 1

with coal number projected to increase steadily over the next 25 years overall coal is responsible for about 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions1 with respect to carbon dioxide co2 the most prevalent greenhouse gas coal combustion was responsible for 41 of the worlds co2 emissions in 2005 11 billion metric tons2 coal is particularly important for electricity supply in 2005 coal was responsible for about 46 of the worlds power generation including 50 of the electricity generated in the united states 89 of the electricity generated in china and 81 of the electricity generated in india3 coalfired power generation is estimated to increase 23 annually through 2030 with resulting co2 emissions estimated to increase from 79 billion metric tons per year to 139 billion metric tons per year for example during 2006 it is estimated that china added over 90 gigawatts gw of new coalfired generating capacity potentially adding an additional 500 million metric tons of co2 to the atmosphere annually4 developing means to control coalderived greenhouse gas emissions is an imperative if serious reductions in worldwide emissions are to occur in the foreseeable future developing technology to accomplish this task in an environmentally economically and operationally acceptable manner has been an ongoing interest of the federal government and energy companies for decade but commercial device to capture and store these emissions is currently available for largescale coalfired power plants 1 pew center on global climate change coal and climate change facts 2008 available

assuming plants would operate in baseload mode with 70 capacity factors crs2 arguably the most economic and technologically challenging part of the carbon capture and sequestration ccs equation is capturing the carbon and preparing it for transport and storage5 depending on sitespecific conditions the capture component of ccs system can be the dominant costvariable and the component that could be improved most dramatically by further technological advancement as indicated in table 1 capture costs could be 510 times the cost of storage breakthrough technologies that substantially reduce the cost of capturing co2 from existing or new power plants for example by 50 or more would immediately reshape the economics of ccs moreover technological breakthroughs would change the economics of ccs irrespective of regulatory framework that emerges and governs how co2 is transported away from the power plant and sequestered underground table 1 expected costs of ccs technology elements ccs element metric ton of co2 capture 4080 storage 38 monitoring and verification 0210 source s julio friedmann carbon capture and sequestration as major greenhouse gas abatement option november 2007 p 11 note capture and storage costs are very sitespecific these estimates reflect the magnitude of difference between capture and storage costs actual sitespecific costs could vary substantially from these estimates estimates do not include any transportation costs in contrast the cost of transporting co2 and sequestering it underground is likely less dependent on technological breakthroughs than on other factors such as the costs of construction materials and labor in the case of pipelines for co2 transport the degree of geologic characterization required to permit sequestration the requirements for measuring monitoring and verifying permanent co2 storage the costs of acquiring surface and subsurface rights to store co2 costs of insurance and longterm liability and other variables driving the cost of transportation and sequestration6 that is not to say that the transportation and storage components of ccs are independent of cost and timing depending on the degree of public acceptance of 5

and cost uncertainties by paul w parfomak and peter folger crs3 largescale ccs enterprise the transportation and sequestration costs could be very large and it may take years to reach agreement on the regulatory framework that would guide longterm co2 sequestration but the variables driving cost and timing for the transportation and storage of co2 are less amenable to technological solution this report examines the current effort to develop technology that would capture co2 first the paper outlines the current status of carbon capture technology second the paper examines the role of government in developing that technology both in terms of creating market for carbon capture technology and encouraging development of the technology finally the paper concludes with discussion of implications of capture technology for climate change legislation background what is carbon capture technology and what is its status major reductions in coalfired co2 emissions would require either pre combustion combustion modification or postcombustion devices to capture the co2 because there is currently over 300 gw of coalfired electric generating capacity in the united states and about 600 gw in china retrofittable post combustion capture device could have substantial market depending on the specifics of any climate change program the following discussion provides brief summary of technology under development that may be available in the nearterm it is not an exhaustive survey of the technological initiatives currently underway in this area but illustrative of the range of activity funding for current government research and development activities to improve these technologies and move them to commercialization are discussed later postcombustion co2 capture postcombustion co2 capture involves treating the burner exhaust gases immediately before they enter the stack the advantage of this approach is that it would allow retrofit at existing facilities that can accommodate the necessary capturing hardware and ancillary equipment in this sense it is like retrofitting post combustion sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox or particulate control on an existing facility simplified illustration of this process is provided in figure 1 crs4 figure 1 simplified illustration of postcombustion co2 capture source scottish centre for carbon storage figure available at httpwwwgeosedacuk sccscapturepostcombustionhtml postcombustion processes capture the co2 from the exhaust gas through the use of distillation membranes or absorption physical or chemical the most widelyused capture technology is the chemical absorption process using amines typically monoethanolamine mea available for industrial applications pilot plant research on using ammonia also an amine as the chemical solvent is currently underway with demonstration plants announced these approaches to carbon capture are discussed below numerous other solventbased postcombustion processes are in the benchscale stage7 monoethanolamine mea the mea co2 carbon capture process is the most proven and tested capture process available the basic design common to most solventbased processes involves passing the exhaust gases through an absorber where the mea interacts with the co2 and absorbs it the now co2rich mea is then pumped to stripper also called regenerator which uses steam to separate the co2 from the mea water is removed from the resulting co2 which is compressed while the regenerated mea is purged of any contaminants such as ammonium sulfate and recirculated back to the absorber the process can be optimized to remove 9095 of the co2 from the flue gas8 although proven on an industrial scale it has not been applied to the typically larger volumes of flue gas streams created by coalfired powerplants the technology has three main drawbacks that would make current use on coalfired powerplant quite costly first is the need to divert steam away from its primary use generating electricity to be used instead for stripping co2 from mea second related problem is the energy required to compress the co2 after its captured needed for transport through pipelines which lowers overall powerplant efficiency and increases generating costs recent study by the massachusetts institute of technology mit estimated the efficiency losses from the installation of mea from 7

introduction to co2 capture and sequestration technology utility engineering may 2008 p 3 crs5 2528 for new construction and 3642 for retrofit on an existing plant9 this loss of efficiency comes in addition to the necessary capital and operations and maintenance cost of the equipment and reagents for new construction the increase in electricity generating cost on levelized basis would be 6070 depending on the boiler technology10 in the case of retrofit plants where the capital costs were fully amortized the mea capture process would increase generating costs on levelized basis by about 22025011 third drawback is degradation of the amine through either overheating over 205 degrees fahrenheit f in the absorber or through oxidation from oxygen introduced in the wash water chemical slurry or flue gas that reacts with the mea for example residual so2 in the flue gas will react with the mea to form ammonium sulfate that must be purged from the system12 this could be serious problem for existing plants that do not have highly efficient flue gas desulfurization fgd or selective catalytic reduction scr devices or none requiring either upgrading of existing fgd and scr equipment or installation of them in addition to the mea process chilled ammonia alstom an approach to mitigating the oxidation problem identified above is to use an ammoniabased solvent rather than mea ammonia is an amine that absorbs co2 at slower rate than mea in chilled ammonia process the flue gas temperature is reduced from about 130 degrees f to about 3560 degrees f this lower temperature has two benefits 1 it condenses the residual water in the flue gas which minimizes the volume of flue gas entering the absorber and 2 it causes pollutants in the flue gas such as so2 to drop out reducing the need for substantial upgrading of upstream control devices13 using slurry of ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate the solvent absorbs more than 90 of the co2 in the flue gas the resulting co2rich ammonia is regenerated and the co2 is stripped from the ammonia mixture under pressure 300 pounds per square inch psi compared with 15 psi using mea reducing the energy necessary to compress the co2 for transportation generally around 1500 psi14 the chilled ammonia process is proprietary process owned by alstom in collaboration with american electric power aep and rwe ag the largest electricity producer in germany alstom has announced plans to demonstrate the 9 massachusetts institute of technology the future of coal an interdisciplinary mit study 2007 p 147 hereafter

plans to install the technology at its 450 mw northeastern station in oologah ok early in the next decade the captured gas is to be used for enhanced oil recovery eor the target is for full commercialization in 2015 ammonia powerspan second ammoniabased regenerative process for co2 capture from existing coalfired facilities does not involve chilling the flue gas before it enters the absorber using higher flue gas temperatures increases the co2 absorption rate in the absorber and therefore the co2 removal however the higher flue gas temperatures also mean that upgrades to existing fgd devices would be necessary17 this process is being developed by powerspan18 called eco2 two commercial demonstrations designed for 90 co2 capture have been announced with projected operations to begin in 2011 and 2012 the first will use 120 mw slipstream from basin electrics antelope valley station in north dakota the second will be sited at nrgs wa parish plant in texas and use 125 mw slipstream the captured co2 is to be sold or used for eor precombustion co2 capture currently requirement for the precombustion capture of co2 is the use of integrated gasification combinedcycle igcc technology to generate electricity19 there are currently four commercial igcc plants worldwide two in the united states each with capacity of about 250 mw the technology has yet to make major breakthrough in the us market because its potential superior environmental performance is currently not required under the clean air act and thus as discussed above for carbon capture technology its higher costs can not be justified see the virginia state corporation commission decision discussed below carbon capture in an igcc facility would happen before combustion under pressure using physical solvent eg selexol and rectisol processes or chemical solvent eg methyl diethanolaimine mdea simplified illustration of this 15 slipstream refers to pilot testing at an operating power plant using

technology in which pulverized coal is not burned directly but mixed with oxygen and water in highpressure gasifier to make syngas combustible fluid that is then burned in conventional combinedcycle arrangement to generate power crs7 process is provided in figure 2 basically the igcc unit pumps oxygen and coal slurry into gasifier to create syngas consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen the syngas is cleaned of conventional pollutants so2 particulates and sent to shift reactor which uses steam and catalyst to produce co2 and hydrogen because the gases are under substantial pressure with high co2 content physical solvent can separate out the co2 the advantage of physical solvent is that the co2 can be freed and the solvent regenerated by reducing the pressure process that is substantially less energyintensive than having to heat the gas as in an mea stripper figure 2 simplified illustration of precombustion co2 capture source scottish centre for carbon storage figure available at httpwwwgeosedacuk sccscaptureprecombustionhtml from the capture process the co2 is further compressed for transportation or storage and the hydrogen is directed through gas and steam cycles to produce electricity mit estimates the efficiency loss from incorporating capture technology on an igcc facility is about 19 from 384 efficiency to 31220 this loss of efficiency comes in addition to the necessary capital and operations and maintenance cost of the equipment and reagents for new construction the estimated increase in electricity generating cost on levelized basis generally ranges from 2225 with american electric power estimating the cost increase at 4121 there is lot of activity surrounding the further commercialization of igcc technology and in the

httpwwwemergingenergycom combustion co2 capture attempts to address co2 during the combustion stage of generation focus on increasing the co2 concentration of the flue gas exiting the boiler the more concentrated the co2 is when it exits the boiler the less energy and cost is required later to prepare it for transport or storage the most developed approach involves combusting the coal with nearly pure oxygen 95 instead of air resulting in flue gas consisting mainly of highly concentrated co2 and water vapor using existing technology the oxygen would be provided by an airseparation unit an energy intensive process that would be the primary source of reduced efficiency the details of this oxyfuel process are still being refined but generally from the boiler the exhaust gas is cleaned of conventional pollutants so2 nox and particulates and some of the gases recycled to the boiler to control the higher temperature resulting from coal combustion with pure oxygen the rest of the gas stream is sent for further purification and compression in preparation for transport andor storage23 depending on sitespecific conditions oxyfuel could be retrofitted onto existing boilers simplified

australia the vattenfall project is 30mw pilot plant being constructed at schewarze pumpe and scheduled to begin operation soon the captured co2 will be put in geological storage once siting and permitting processes are completed24 the callide project is being sponsored by cs energy who with six partners is retrofitting 30 mw boiler at its callidea power station with an oxyfuel process operation of the oxyfuel process is scheduled for 2010 with transport and geological storage of the co2 planned for 201125 numerous other bench and pilotplant scale initiatives are underway with specific work being conducted on improving the efficiency of the airseparation process mit estimates the efficiency losses from the installation of oxyfuel at 23 for new construction and 3140 for retrofit on an existing plant depending on boiler technology26 this loss of efficiency comes in addition to the necessary capital and operations and maintenance cost of the equipment and reagents for new construction the increase in electricity generating cost on levelized basis would be about 46 in the case of retrofit plants where the capital costs are fully amortized the oxyfuel capture process would increase generating costs on levelized basis by about 17020627 doesupported technology development as summarized in table 2 co2 capture technology is currently estimated to significantly

available and costeffective incorporate price mechanism such as carbon tax that provides the necessary longterm price signal to direct research development demonstration and deployment efforts called

of the plants output equivalent to about 100000 metric tons of co2 per year beginning in 2010 crs11 or marketpull mechanisms31 developing such price signal involves variables such as the magnitude and nature of the market signal and its timing direction and duration in addition studies indicate combining sustained price signal with public support for research and development efforts is the most effective longterm strategy for encouraging development of new technology called technologypush mechanisms32 as stated by richard d morgenstern the key to long term research and development strategy is both rising carbon price and some form of government supported research program to compensate for market imperfections33 the various roles the government could take in encouraging development of environmental technologies are illustrated in figure 5 the federal role in the innovation process is complex one reflecting the complexity of the innovation process itself the inventive activity reflected by government and private research and development efforts overlap with demand pull mechanisms to promote or require adoption of technology shaping the efforts likewise these initiatives are facilitated by the government as forum for feedback gained through both developed and demonstration efforts and practical application the process is interlinked overlapping and dynamic rather than linear attempting to implement one role in vacuum can result in misdirected funding or mistiming of results this section discusses these different roles with respect to encouraging development of carbon capture technology including 1 the need for demandpull mechanism and possible options 2 current technologypush efforts at the us department of energy doe and the questions they raise and 3

technological forecasting social change july 2005 p 699 the need for demandpull mechanism economists note that the driving force behind the development of new and improved technologies is the profit motive however market forces will provide insufficient incentives to develop climatefriendly technologies if the market prices of energy inputs do not fully reflect their social cost inclusive of environmental consequences even if energy prices reflect all production costs without an explicit greenhouse gas policy firms have incentive to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions per beyond the motivation to economize on energy costs for example utility would happily find way to generate the same amount of electricity with less fuel but without policy that makes carbon dioxide emissions costly it would not care specifically about the carbon content of its fuel mix in choosing between say coal and natural gas for firms to have the desire to innovate cheaper and better ways to reduce emissions and not merely inputs they must bear additional financial costs for emissions34 much of the focus of debate on developing carbon capture technology has been on research development and demonstration rdd needs however for technology to be fully commercialized it must meet market demand demand created either through price mechanism or regulatory requirement as suggested by the previous discussion any carbon capture technology for coalfired powerplants 34 carolyn fischer climate change policy choices and technical innovation resources for the future issue brief 20 june 2000 p 2 crs13 will increase the cost of electricity generation from affected plants with increase in efficiency therefore widespread commercialization of such technology is unlikely until it is required either by regulation or by carbon price indeed regulated industries may find their regulators reluctant to accept the risks and cost of installing technology that is not required by legislation this sentiment was reflected in recent decision by the virginia state corporation commission in denying an application by appalachian power company apco for rate adjustment to construct an igcc facility the company asserted that the value of this project is directly related to 1 potential future legal requirements for carbon capture and sequestration and 2 the proposed igcc plants potential ability to comply cost effectively with any such requirements both of these factors however are unknown at this time and do not overcome the other infirmities in the application the legal necessity of and the capability of costeffective carbon capture and sequestration in this particular igcc plant at this time has not been sufficiently established to render apcos application reasonable or prudent under the virginia statute we must follow35 at the same time there is reluctance to invest in technology that is not required the unresolved nature of greenhouse gas regulation is affecting investment in any coalfired generation36 the risk involved in investing in coalfired generation absent anticipated greenhouse gas regulations is outlined in the carbon principles announced by three wall street banks citi jp morgan chase and morgan stanley in february 2008 as stated in their paper the absence of comprehensive federal action on climate change creates unknown financial risks for those building and financing new fossil fuel generation resources the financial institutions that have signed the principles recognize that federal co2 control legislation is being considered and is likely to be adopted during the service life of many new power plants it is prudent to take concrete actions today that help developers investors and financiers to identify analyze reduce and mitigate climate risks37 similarly lack of regulatory scheme presents numerous risks to any rdd effort designed to develop carbon capture technology unlike missionoriented research effort like the manhattan project to develop an atomic bomb where the ultimate goal is victory and the cost virtually irrelevant research efforts focused on 35 state corporation commission application of appalachian power company case pue200700068 richmond april 14 2008 p 16 36 as stated by doe regulatory uncertainty for ghg legislation is key issue impacting technology selection and reliability of economic forecasts returns on investment for conventional plants including supercritical can be severely compromised by the need to subsequently address co2 mitigation higher capital costs incurred for igcc may make such new plants less competitive unless their advantage in co2 mitigation is assured doe national energy technology laboratory tracking new coalfired power plants june 30 2008 p 14 37 citi morgan chase and morgan stanley the carbon principles fossil fuel generation financing enhanced environmental diligence process february 2008 p 1 crs14 developing commercial device need to know what the market wants in product and how much the product is worth at the current time the market value of carbon capture device is zero in much of the country because there is market for carbon emissions or regulations requiring their reduction38 all estimates of value are hypothetical dependent on reduction program or regulatory regime that doesnt exist with market or regulatory signals determining appropriate performance standards and costeffectiveness criteria investment in carbon capture technology is risky business that could easily result in the development of white elephant or goldplated technology that doesnt meet market demand while the threat of carbon regime is stimulating rdd efforts and influencing decisions about future energy particularly electricity supply the current spread of greenhouse gas control regimes being proposed doesnt provide much guidance in suggesting appropriate performance and costeffectiveness benchmarks for solution with respect to coalfired generation for example isolating just one variable in the future price of carbon under capandtrade program tonnage reduction requirement the future value of carbon reductions can vary substantially39 as illustrated by figure 6 three possible reduction targets in 2050 maintaining current 2008 levels 287 billion metric tons bmt reducing emissions to 50 of 1990 levels 203 bmt and reducing emissions to 20 of 1990 levels 167 bmt result in substantially different price tracks for co240 without firm idea of the tonnage goal and reduction schedule any deployment or commercialization strategy would be highrisk venture as suggested by the previously noted virginia state corporation commission conclusion 38 exceptions to this would include areas where the carbon dioxide could be used for eor or where state or region has enacted greenhouse gas controls such as california and several northeastern states 39 for fuller discussion of the uncertainties involved in estimating the cost of capandtrade programs see

demandpull mechanism there are two basic approaches to demandpull mechanism 1 regulatory requirement and 2 price signal via marketbased co2 reduction program these approaches are not mutually exclusive and can serve different goals for example regulation focused on new construction such as the new source performance standard under section 111 of the clean air act41 could be used to phase in deployment of carbon capture technology and prevent more coalfired facilities from being constructed without carbon capture or ensure they would be at least ready for carbon capture later at the same time carbon tax or capandtrade program could be initiated to begin sending market signal to companies that further controls will be necessary in the future if they decide to continue operating coalfired facilities creating demand through regulatory requirement an example from the so2 new source performance standards it is an understatement to say that the new source performance standards promulgated by the epa were technologyforcing electric utilities went from having scrubbers on their generating units to incorporating very complex chemical processes chemical plants and refineries had scrubbing systems that were few feet in diameter but not the 30 to 40foot diameters required by the utility industry utilities had dealt with hot flue gases but not with saturated flue gases that contained all sorts of contaminants industry and the us epa has 41 the clean air act section 111 42 usc 7411 crs16 always looked upon new source performance standards as technologyforcing because they force the development of new technologies in order to satisfy emissions requirements42 the most direct method to encourage adoption of carbon capture technology would be to mandate it mandating performance standard on coalfired powerplants is not new idea indeed section 111 of the clean air act requires the environmental protection agency epa to develop new source performance standards nsps for any new and modified powerplant and other stationary sources that in the administrators judgment causes or contributes significantly to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public heath or welfare nsps can be issued for pollutants for which there is national ambient air quality standard naaqs like carbon dioxide43 in addition nsps is the floor for other stationary source standards such as best available control technology bact determinations for prevention of significant deterioration psd areas and lowest achievable emission rate laer determinations for nonattainment areas44 the process of forcing the development of emission controls on coalfired powerplants is illustrated by the 1971 and 1978 so2 nsps for coalfired electric generating plants the clean air act states that nsps should reflect the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which taking into account the cost of achieving such reductions and any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements the administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated45 in promulgating its first utility so2 nsps in 1971 epa determined that 12 pound of so2 per million btu of heat input performance standard met the criteria of sec 111 standard that required on average 70 reduction in new powerplant emissions and could be met by lowsulfur coal that was available in both the eastern and western parts of the united states or by the use of emerging flue gas desulfurization fgd devices46

one of which would be retired by the end of the year47 this number would increase rapidly not only because of the nsps but also because of the promulgation of the so2 naaqs the 1973 supreme court decision preventing significant deterioration of pristine areas48 and state requirements for stringent so2 controls which opened up market for retrofits of existing coalfired facilities in addition to the nsps focus on new facilities indeed most of the growth in fgd installations during the early and mid1970s was in retrofits taylor estimates that between 1973 and 1976 72 of the fgd market was in retrofits49 by 1977 there were 14 vendors offering fullscale commercial fgd installation50 however despite this growth only 10 of the new coalfired facilities constructed between 1973 and 1976 had fgd installations in addition the early performance of these devices was not brilliant51 in 1974 american electric power aep spearheaded an ad campaign to have epa reject fgd devices as too unreliable too impractical for electric utility use in favor of tall stacks supplementary controls and lowsulfur western coal52 this effort was ultimately unsuccessful as the congress chose to modify the nsps requirements for coalfired electric generators in 1977 by adding percentage reduction requirement as promulgated in 1979 the revised so2 nsps retained the 1971 performance standard but added requirement for 7090 reduction in emissions depending on the sulfur content of the coal53 at the time this requirement could be met only through use of an fgd device the effect of the scrubber requirement is clear from the data provided in figure 7 based on their analysis of fgd development taylor rubin and hounshell state the importance of demandpull instruments results indicate that

margaret r taylor op cit 74 that government policy could force the development of technology through creating market should not suggest that the government was limited to that role or that the process was smooth or seamless on the latter point shattuck et summarize the early years of fgd development as follows the standards of performance for new sources are technologyforcing and for the utility industry they forced the development of technology that had never been installed on facilities the size of utility plants that technology had to be developed and number of installations completed in short period of time the us epa continued to force technology through the promulgation of successive regulations the development of the equipment was not an easy process what may have appeared to be the simple application of an equipment item from one industry to another often turned out to be fraught with unforeseen challenges55 the example indicates that technologyforcing regulations can be effective in pulling technology into the market even when there remains some operational difficulties for that technology the difference for carbon capture technology is that for longterm widespread development new infrastructure of pipelines and storage sites may be necessary in addition to effective carbon capture technology in the shortterm suitable alternatives such as enhanced oil recovery needs and insitu geologic storage may be available to support early commercialization projects without the need for an integrated transport and storage system likewise with economics more favorable

2005 p 697 55 shattuck et p 15 crs19 new construction to introduce carbon capture technology might be one path to widespread commercialization as an entry point to carbon capture deployment regulatory approach such as nsps may represent first step as suggested by the so2 nsps example above creating demand through price signal carbon taxes allowance pricing and auctions much of the current discussion of developing marketpull mechanism for new carbon capture technology has focused on creating price for carbon emissions the literature suggests that this is an important component for developing new technology perhaps more important even than research and development as stated by the congressional budget office cbo analyses that consider the costs and benefits of both carbon pricing and rd all come to the same qualitative conclusion nearterm pricing of carbon emissions is an element of costeffective policy approach that result holds even though studies make different assumptions about the availability of alternative energy technologies the amount of crowding out caused by federal subsidies and the form of the policy target maximizing net benefits versus minimizing the cost of reaching target56 two basic approaches can be employed in the case of marketbased greenhouse gas control program carbon tax and capandtrade program the carbon tax would create longterm price signal to stimulate innovation and development of new technology this price signal could be strengthened if the carbon tax were escalated over the long run either by statutorily determined percentage or by an index such as the producer price index carbon taxs basic approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions is to supply the marketplace with stable consistent price signal signal that would also inform innovators as to the cost performance targets they should seek in developing alternative technologies designed appropriately there would be little danger of the price spikes or market volatility that can occur in the early stages of tradeable permit program57 capandtrade program creates price signal for new technology through market price for carbon permits called allowances an allowance is limited authorization to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent co2e in cap andtrade system these allowances are issued by the government and either allocated or auctioned to affected companies who may use them to comply with the cap sell them to other companies on the market or bank them for future use or sale the resulting market transactions result in an allowance price this price on carbon 56 congressional budget office evaluating the roles of prices and rd in reducing carbon dioxide emissions september 2006 p 17 57 in addition some of the revenue generated by the tax could be used to fund research development demonstration and deployment of new technology to encourage the longterm transition to lesscarbonintensive economy crs20 emissions however can be both uncertain and volatile58 in addition low allowance price may be insufficient to encourage technology development and refinement for example the 1990 acid rain control program effectively ended the development of fgd for retrofit purposes by setting an emission cap that resulted in low allowance prices and that could be met through the use of lowsulfur coal noting that only 10 of phase 1 facilities chose fgd to comply with its requirements taylor et state the 1990 caaa however although initially predicted to increase demand for fgd systems eroded the market potential for both dry and wet fgd system applications at existing power plants when the so2 allowance trading market returned lowsulfur coal to its importance in so2 control as result research in dry fgd technology declined significantly in this case the flexibility provided by the 1990 acid rain regulations discouraged inventive activity in technologies that might have had broader markets under the traditional commandandcontrol regimes in place prior to 199059 footnotes from original text omitted capandtrade program need not have such result for example to more effectively promote carbon capture technology the price signal under greenhouse gas reduction program could be strengthened by requiring the periodic auctioning of substantial portion of available allowances rather than giving them away at cost the so2 program allocated virtually all of its allowance at cost to affected companies auctioning substantial portion of available allowances could create powerful price signal and provide incentives for deploying new technology if structured properly60 the program could create price floor to facilitate investment in new technology via reserve price in the allowance auction process in addition the stability of that price signal could be strengthened by choosing to auction allowances on frequent basis ensuring availability of allowances close to the time of expected demand and making any potential shortsqueezing of the secondary market more difficult61 58 for fuller discussion see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker

to cover their short position and cut their losses crs21 one positive aspect of the acid rain capandtrade experience for encouraging deployment of technology was the effectiveness of bonus allowances and deadline extensions as incentives to install fgd specifically about 35 million of the allowances were earmarked for phase 1 powerplants choosing to install 90 control technology such as fgd such units were allowed to delay phase 1 compliance from 1995 to 1997 and receive two allowances for each ton of s02 reduced below 12 lb per mmbtu level during 19971999 the 35 million allowance reserve was fully subscribed and was major factor in what fgd was installed during phase 1 of the program this experience may bode well for proposed ccs bonus allowance provisions in several greenhouse gas

to give high priority to projects that include greenhouse gas capture capability under the same title of epact2005 certain projects employing gasification technology67 would be eligible to receive up to 650 million in tax credits and these projects would also receive high priority from the secretary of the treasury if they include greenhouse gas capture technology encouraging technology development in the absence of market issues for current carbon capture rdd policy each of the funding mechanisms described above appropriations loan guarantees and tax credits are examples of government pushing carbon capture technologies the upper left arrow in figure 5 via direct spending and through private sector incentives thus far however these activities are taking place in vacuum with respect to carbon market or regulatory structure lacking price signal or regulatory mandate it is difficult to assess whether governmentpush approach is sufficient for longterm technology development68 some studies appear to discount the necessity of price signal or regulatory mandate at least initially and place higher priority on the successful demonstration of largescale technological economic and environmental performance of technologies that comprise all of the components of an integrated ccs system capture transportation and storage69 so far however the only federally sponsored fully integrated largescale ccs demonstration project called futuregen see box failed in its original conception which may have been due in part to the lack of perceived market doe announced it was restructuring the futuregen program because of its rising costs which are difficult to assess against the projects benefits without monetary value attached to those benefits ie the value of carbon extracted from the fuel and permanently sequestered carbon market would at least provide some way of comparing costs against benefits one could argue that the benefits of ccs 67 under title xiii of epact2005 gasification technology means any process which converts solid or liquid product from coal petroleum residue biomass or other materials which are recovered for their energy or feedstock value into synthesis gas composed primarily of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for direct use in the production of energy or for subsequent conversion to another product 68 see quote by morgenstern above in that analysis governmentsupported research is needed to compensate for market imperfections in the current situation there is market and thus its imperfections are moot 69 mit the future of coal p xi crs25 accrue to the amelioration of future costs of environmental degradation caused by greenhouse gasinduced global warming although it may be possible to identify overall environmental benefits to removing co2 that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere assigning monetary value to those benefits to compare against costs is extremely difficult trying to pick winner futuregen on february 27 2003 president bush proposed 10year 1 billion project to build coalfired power plant that integrates carbon sequestration and hydrogen production while generating 275 megawatts of electricity enough to power about 150000 average us homes as originally conceived the plant would have been coal gasification facility and produced between 1 and 2 million metric tons of co2 annually on january 30 2008 doe announced that it was restructuring the futuregen program away from single stateoftheart living laboratory of integrated rd technologies single plant to instead pursue new strategy of providing funding for the addition of ccs technology to multiple commercialscale integrated gasification combined cycle igcc power plants70 in the restructured program doe would support up to two or three demonstration projects each of at least 300 mw71 and that would sequester at least 1 million metric tons of co2 per year in its budget justification for fy2009 doe cited new market realities for its decision namely rising material and labor costs for new power plants and the need to demonstrate commercial viability of igcc plants with ccs72 policy question that emerged following the does decision to scrap the original futuregen concept was whether such concept can be viable without long term price signal for carbon futuregen supporters have indicated that the rise in futuregens projected costs were consistent with the rise in global energy infrastructure projects due to inflation implying that rising costs are not unique to futuregen73 nevertheless the reasons given by doe in its decision to cancel the original concept are prima facie evidence that lack of price signal for carbon in the face of known and rising costs for plant construction created too much uncertainty for the agency to continue the project it is unclear whether longterm price signal would have supported the futuregen concept anyway given the projects other uncertainties such as its choice of capture technology and disagreements over the private costshare agreement74 70 see httpwwwfossilenergygovnewstechlines200808003doe_announces _restructured_futureghtml 71 see

several studies underscore the value of longterm price or regulatory signal to shape technological development and presumably to help determine level of federal investment needed to encourage commercialization of an environmental technology such as carbon capture as stated by fischer with respect to rd for specific applications such as particular manufacturing technologies or electricity generation governments are notoriously bad at picking winners eg the breeder reactor the selection of these projects is best left to private markets while the government ensures those markets face the socially correct price signals75 despite the lack of regulatory incentives or price signals doe has invested millions of dollars since 1997 into capture technology rd and the question remains whether it has been too much too little or about the right amount in addition to appropriating funds each year for the doe program congress signaled its support for rdd investment for ccs through provisions for tax credits available for carbon capture technology projects in epact2005 and through loan guarantees authorized in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 pl 110 161 congress also authorized significant expansion of ccs spending at doe in the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 which would authorize appropriations for total of 22 billion from fy2008 through fy2013 although eisa places an increased emphasis on largescale underground injection and storage experiments the legislation authorizes 200 million per year for projects that demonstrate technologies for the largescale capture of co2 from range of industrial sources legislation has also been introduced in the 110th congress that would authorize specific amounts of spending for ccs and capture technology development notably the carbon capture and storage early deployment act hr 6258 if enacted would authorize distribution utilities76 to collect an assessment on fossilfuel based electricity delivered to retail customers the assessment would total approximately 1 billion annually and would be issued by corporation established by referendum among the distribution utilities as grants or contracts to private academic or government entities to accelerate commercial demonstration or availability of co2 capture and storage technologies and methods this legislation contains elements that resemble in many respects recommendations offered in the mit report77 some bills introduced in the 110th congress include incentives such as tax credits debt financing and regulations to promote co2 capture technology 75 carolyn fischer climate change policy choices and technical innovation resources for the future climate issue brief 20 june 2000 p 9 76 distribution utility is defined in the legislation as an electric utility that has legal regulatory or contractual obligation to deliver electricity directly to retail customers 77 mit the future of coal p 102 crs27 development for example s 3132 the accelerating carbon capture and sequestration act of 2008 provides tax credit of 20 per metric ton of co2 captured and stored78 s 3233 the 21st century energy technology deployment act would establish corporation that could issue debt instruments such as bonds for financing technology development priority cited in s 3233 is the deployment of commercialscale co2 capture and storage technology that could capture 10 million short tons of co2 per year by 2015 bill aimed at increasing the us production of oil and natural gas while minimizing co2 emissions s 2973 the american energy production act of 2008 would require the promulgation of regulations for clean coalderived fuels facilities that process or refine such fuels would be required to capture 100 of the co2 that would otherwise be released at the facility other legislation introduced invokes the symbolism of the apollo program of the 1960s to frame proposals for largescale energy policy initiatives that include developing ccs technology79 the relevance and utility of largescale government projects such as the apollo program or the manhattan project to developing carbon capture technology are explored in the following sections should the federal government embark on crash research and development program some policymakers have proposed that the united states invest in energy research development and demonstration activities at the same level of commitment as it invested in the past during the manhattan project and the apollo program as analogues to the development of technologies to reduce co2 emissions and thwart longterm climate change the manhattan project and apollo program are imperfect at best they both had shortterm goals their success or failure was easily measured and perhaps most importantly they did not depend on the successful commercialization of technology and its adoption by the private sector nevertheless both projects provide funding history for comparison against co2 capture technology cost projections and as examples of large governmentled projects initiated to achieve national goal the manhattan project and apollo program are discussed briefly below the federal governments efforts to promote energy technology development in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s and early 1980s may be richer analogy to co2 capture technology development than either the manhattan project or apollo program after the first oil crisis in 1973 and with the second oil crisis in the late 1970s the national priority was to reduce dependence on foreign supplies of energy particularly crude oil through combination of new domestic supplies eg oil shale energy efficiency technologies and alternative energy supplies such as solar among others the success of these efforts was to have been determined in part by the commercialization of energy technologies and alternative energy supplies and 78 s 3132 would also provide 10 per metric ton credit for co2 captured and used as tertiary injectant in an enhanced oil and natural gas recovery project 79 for example hr 2809 the new apollo energy act of 2007 and hr 6385 the apollo energy independence act of 2008 crs28 their incorporation into american society over the longterm similarly many analysts see the development of ccs technology as necessary step needed over the next several decades or halfcentury to help alleviate humaninduced climate change which is itself viewed as global problem for at least the next century or longer as discussed more fully later the outcome of the federal governments efforts to promote energy technologies in the 1970s and 1980s may be instructive to current approaches to develop ccs technology the manhattan project and apollo program the manhattan project took place from 1942 to 194680 in july 1945 bomb was successfully tested in new mexico and used against japan at two locations in august 1945 in 1946 the civilian atomic energy commission was established to manage the nations future atomic activities and the manhattan project officially ended according to one estimate the manhattan project cost 22 billion from 19421946 21 billion in 2007 dollars greater than the original cost and time estimate of approximately 148 million for 1942 to 194481 the apollo program encompassed 17 missions including six lunar landings that took place from fy1960 to fy197382 although preliminary discussions regarding the apollo program began in 1960 congress did not decide to fund it until 1961 after the soviets became the first country to send human into space the peak cost for the apollo program occurred in fy1966 when nasas total budget was 45 billion and its funding for apollo was 30 billion83 according to nasa the total cost of

carter administration priorities on conservation and development of alternative energy supplies crude oil prices fell during the 1980s and the reagan administration eliminated many energy rd programs that began during the oil crisis years figure 10 shows the rise and fall of funding for doe energy technology programs from 1974 to 2008 comparisons to co2 capture rd at doe current doe spending on ccs technology development discussed above is far below levels of funding for the manhattan project and apollo program and for the energy technology rd programs at their peak spending in the late 1970s and early 1980s the development of co2 capture technology is of course only one component of all federal spending on global climate change mitigation however the total annual federal expenditures on climate change including basic research are still far less than the manhattan project and apollo program although similar to doe energy technology development programs during their peak spending period87 for comparison the fy2008 budget and fy2009 budget request for does energy technology rd is approximately 3 billion per year see figure 10 even if spending on co2 capture technology were increased dramatically to manhattan project or apollo program levels it is not clear whether the goal of developing commercially deployable technology would be realized as mentioned above commercialization of technology and integration of technology into the private market were not goals of either the manhattan project or apollo program for the manhattan project it did not matter what the cost was in one sense if consequence of failing to build nuclear weapon was to lose the war for co2 capture the primary goal is to develop technology that would be widely deployed and thus

careful study of one of the federal projects initiated in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s and early 1980s the synthetic fuels corporation sfc may provide valuable comparison to current thinking about the federal role in co2 capture technology development the governments attempt to develop synthetic fuels industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s is case study of unsuccessful federal involvement in technology development in 1980 congress established the synthetic fuels corporation sfc quasiindependent corporation to develop largescale projects in coal and shale liquefaction and gasification most of the projects centered on basic and conceptual work that would contribute to demonstration programs in later stages although funds were expended on several prototype and fullscale demonstration experiments formed in response to the 1970s energy crisis the sfc was intended to support projects that industry was unable to support because of technical environmental or financial uncertainties federal loans loan guarantees price guarantees and other financial incentives totaling 20 billion were authorized to spur industry action although sfc was designed to continue operating until at least 1992 the collapse in energy prices environmental concerns lack of support from the reagan administration and crs31 administrative problems ended the synthetic fuels program in 198688 citations from original text omitted one of the primary reasons commonly cited for the failure of the sfc was the collapse of crude oil prices during the 1980s although other factors contributed89 without stable and predictable price for the commodity that the sfc was attempting to produce in specific mandated quantities the structure of the sfc was unable to cope with market changes the failure of the federal governments effort to create synthetic fuels industry yields valuable lessons about the role of government in technology innovation the synthetic fuels program was established without sufficient flexibility to meet changes in market conditions such as the price of fuel public unwillingness to endure the environmental costs of some of the largescale projects was an added complication an emphasis on production targets was an added complication an emphasis on production targets reduced research and program flexibility rapid turnover among sfcs highlevel officials slowed administrative actions the synthetic fuels program did demonstrate however that largescale synthetic energy projects could be build and operated within specified technical parameters90 citations from original text omitted it may be argued that the demise of does futuregen program as originally conceived see box above was partly attributable to the projects inflexibility in dealing with changing market conditions in this case the rise in materials and construction costs and the doubling of futuregens original price estimate however the analogy between futuregen and the sfc is limited although the sfc failed in part because of collapsing oil prices the costs of the sfc program could be measured against the benefits of producing oil for futuregen the value of co2 avoided ie the benefit provided by the technology was not even calculable for comparison to the costs of building the plant because there is real global price for co2 the market conditions that contributed to the downfall of the sfc however could be very different from the market conditions that would arise following the creation of price for co2 emissions the stability and predictability of the price signal would depend on the mechanism carbon tax allowance pricing or auctions mechanism that allowed for longterm price signal for carbon would likely benefit co2 capture

canadas experience with producing synthetic fuels specifically oil sands development has differed from the us experience for more information see crs report rl34258 north american oil sands history of development prospects for the future by marc humphries 90 ibid p 59 crs32 implications for climate change legislation any comprehensive approach to reducing greenhouse gases substantially must address the worlds dependency on coal for quarter of its energy demand including almost half of its electricity demand to maintain coal as key component in the worlds energy mix in carbonconstrained future would require developing technology to capture and store its co2 emissions this situation suggests to some that any greenhouse gas reduction program be delayed until such carbon capture technology has been demonstrated however technological innovation and the demands of carbon control regime are interlinked therefore technology policy is substitute for environmental policy and must be developed in concert with it91 this linkage raises issues for legislators attempting to craft greenhouse gas reduction legislation for the demandpull side of the equation the issue revolves around how to create the appropriate market for emerging carbon capture technologies table 3 compares four different price signals across five different criteria that influence their effectiveness in promoting technology magnitude what size of price signal or stringency of the regulation is imposed initially direction what influences the direction up or down of the price signal or stringency of the regulation over time timing how quickly is the price or regulation imposed and strengthened stability how stable is the price or regulation over time duration how long is the price or regulation imposed on affected companies in general the criteria suggest that regulation is the surest method of forcing the development of technology price is not necessarily direct consideration in decisionmaking however regulation is also the most limiting technologies more or less stringent than the standard would have limited domestic market although foreign opportunities may be available and development could be frozen if the standards are not reviewed and strengthened periodically in contrast allowance prices would provide the most equivocal signal particularly if they are allocated free to participants experience has shown allowance prices to be subject to volatility with swings both up and down the experience with the so2 capandtrade program suggests the incentive can be improved with bonus allowances however the eligibility criteria used could be perceived as the government attempting to pick winner 91 carolyn fischer climate change policy choices and technical innovation resources for

price source congressional research service crs34 in contrast carbon taxes and allowance auctions particularly 100 auctions with reserve price provide strong marketbased price signals carbon tax is the most stable price signal providing clear and transparent signal of the value of any method of greenhouse gas reductions substantial auctioning of allowances also places price on carbon emissions price that can be strengthened by incorporating reserve price into the structure of the auction however each of these signals ultimately depends on the environmental goal envisioned and the specifics of the control program 1 the stringency of the reduction requirement 2 the timing of desired reductions 3 the techniques allowed to achieve compliance the interplay of these factors informs the technology community about the urgency of the need for carbon capture technology the price signal informs the community what costperformance parameters are appropriate for the emerging carbon market the nature of that price signal regulatory market stability informs the community of the confidence it can have that it is not wasting capital on white elephant or on project that the market does not want or need the issues for technologypush mechanisms are broader and include not only the specifics of any reduction program and resulting price signal but also international considerations and the interplay between carbon capture technology storage and the potential need for co2 transport groups as diverse as the pew center the electric power research institute doe and mit have suggested roadmaps and other schemes for preparing carbon capture technology for pending greenhouse gas reduction program92 generally all of these approaches agree on the need for demonstrationsize 200300 mw projects to sort out technical performance and cost effectiveness and identify potential environmental and safety concerns the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 reflected congress desire for more integrated demonstration projects and does restructured approach to futuregen purportedly provides incentives for integrating capture technology on igcc plants of 300 mw or greater finally it should be noted that the status quo for coal with respect to climate change legislation isnt necessarily the same as business as usual the financial markets and regulatory authorities appear to be hedging their bets on the outcomes of any federal legislation with respect to greenhouse gas reductions and are becoming increasingly unwilling to accept the risk of coalfired power plant with or without carbon capture capacity this sort of limbo for coalfired powerplants is reinforced by the mit study which makes strong case against subsidizing new construction allowed for igcc under the epact2005 without carbon capture because of the unattractive costs of retrofits 92 for example see pew center on global climate change coal and climate change facts 2008 available at

of coal pp xixv crs35 coal plants will not be cheap to retrofit for co2 capture our analysis confirms that the costs to retrofit an airdriven scpc supercritical pulverized coal plant for significant co2 capture say 90 will be greater than the costs to retrofit an igcc plant however the modifications needed to retrofit an igcc plant for appreciable ccs are extensive and not matter of simply adding single simple and inexpensive process step to an existing igcc plant consequently igcc plants without ccs that receive assistance under the 2005 energy act will be more costly to retrofit and less likely to do so the concept of capture ready igcc or pulverized coal plant is as yet unproven and unlikely to be fruitful the energy act envisions capture ready to apply to gasification technology citation omitted retrofitting igcc plants or for that matter pulverized coal plants to incorporate ccs technology involves substantial additional investments and significant penalty to the efficiency and net electricity output of the plant as result we are unconvinced that such financial assistance to conventional igcc plants without ccs is wise93 emphasis in original as noted earlier lack of regulatory scheme or carbon price presents numerous risks to any research and development effort designed to develop carbon capture technology ultimately it also presents risk to the future of coal 93
