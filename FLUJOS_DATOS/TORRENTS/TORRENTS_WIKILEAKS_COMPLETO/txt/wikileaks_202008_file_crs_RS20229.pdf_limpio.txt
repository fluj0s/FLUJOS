on the united states after five years arlene wilson specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the main economic benefit of the north american free trade agree ment nafta is that over time it is expected to increase productivity and incomes in the unite d states mexico and canada in the near term some reallocation of resources occur s within each country generating gains for some producers and workers and costs fo r others since the mexican and canadian economies are small relative to the us economy both the longterm benefits and s hortterm adjustment costs of the nafta to the united states are expected to be small the data suggest that nafta has had positive but small effect on us trade with mexico and that us direct investment in mexico remains very small relative to total us investment abroad the number f workers displac ed by import competition with canada and mexico or production shifts to those countries is estimated to be very small compared with total us employment this report will be updated annually the nafta has been in effect since january 1 1994 some anecdotal evidenc suggests that the nafta has been highly beneficial to the united states while othe r accounts imply that import competition from mexico has led to substantial us unemployment neither of these claims are supported by the available evidence thi s report begins with brief discussion of the benefits and adjustment costs of free trade followe d by empirical evidence suggesting that over time trade is beneficial to l countries the discussion then focuses on the naftas eff ect on the united states given the relativel small size of the mexican economy and the data which show the naftas effects in the aggregate to be very small why trade matters the basic economic argument for international trade is that nations can by producing more efficiently expand the amount of goods and servic they produce and consume by importing goods that are relatively costly to produce domestically and exchanging them for exports which it can produce most efficiently it is argued that each country ca nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20229crs2 the theory and practice of free trade federal reserve bank of dallas economic review 1 fourth quarter 1993 p 4 of course other factors such as education levels political stability and access to technology are also importantproduce and consume more goods with trade than in isolation that is by specializing in producing thos goods and services in which each country has comparative advantage producti vity is improved for all countries moreover by providing access to large r market free trade may allow some industries to take advantage of economies of scale plants can specialize in producing fewer product lines at lower costs the economy can be thought of as pie trade expands the size of the pie importantly all countries gain one countrys gains are not another countrys losses free trade also can enhance the investment clima improve the rate of technological development stimulate firms to become more competitive and raise the economys rate of growth consumers in particular benefit considerably from lower prices and wider choice of products these dynamic gains are often of greater longterm significance than the benefits of comparative advantage neverth eless as countries engage in trade labor and capital may have to shift from one industry to another as resources are reallocated from an industry whose costs are relatively high to one whose costs are relatively low some jobs disappear and others are created this process occurs regularly and necessarily in market economy with r without foreign trade and ultimately results in rising living standard importantly trade does not affect the total number of jobs in the economy but it may affect the composition of jobs trade m ay also affect the distribution of income within an economy by increasing the demand for those products which are produced most efficiently wages for worker s and the reward to capital t hat produce those products tend to rise similarly demand for the products produced least efficiently falls reducing wages of workers and the return to capital in those industries empiric evidence suggests that international trade when restricted inhibit s economic growth and when liberalized stimulates economi c growth economists believe for example that the smoothawley tariff which rai sed tariffs to an alltime high in 1930 led to retaliatory trade restrictions by other countries which ser ved to deepen and lengthen the worldwide depression of the 1930s in contrast the postwor ld war ii process of trade liberalization under the auspices of the gener agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and its successor the worl d trade organization wto has been accompanied by large increase in world outpu t gdp and an even larger growth of world trade recent experience of the developing countries supports the hypothesis that trade liberalization is associated with highe r economic growth those developing countries which liberalized trade such as hon g kong and singapore grew much faster than those that restricted trade such as nigeri and ghana 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs202294295998511 mexico canada united states0200040006000800010000 09188 to mexico to canada to world0246810crs3 office of the united

first the us economy is very larg relative to that of canada an d mexico mexicos gdp i n 1998 of 429 billion was onl 5 that of the united state s see figure 1 expresse d another way the mexica n economy is roughly the size f the economy of new jersey or the angeles metropolitan area even canadas 1998 gdp of 599 billion was only 7 of us gdp another way of looking at it is to examine us trade with mexic and canada even though mexico is the second largest us export market us xports to mexico were less than 1 of us gdp in 1998 see figure 2 us exports to canada the largest us trading partner were 18 of us gdp even if the nafta substantially increase d trade flows they would still be relatively small in relation to us gdp second tariff s were already low or nonexistent between th three countries when the nafta went into effect and hav continued to decline under the canadaus free trad agreement which wa s superceded by the nafta some tariffs were eliminated n january 1 1989 and the

billion in 1998 it accounted fo r 15 of the total us merchandise trade deficit in 1998 however the trade dat reflect muc h more than the effects of the nafta although t shown in figures 3 and 4 us trade with canada and mexic was increasing before 1994 suggested that some of the post nafta trade increases are continuation of an ongoing trend moreover in the shortrun exports and imports and the trade deficit are strongly influenced b exchange rate changes and the level of economic activity in each country for example in 1998 the robust us economy and the relatively high us dollar visavis the canadian dollar and mexican peso likely were important causes of the increased us trade deficit with both countries in 1998 section 512 of the nafta implementation act pl103182 required the president to provide comprehensive assessment of the operation and effects of nafta to th congress by july 1 1997 the main findings of this report which covers the first three years of nafta 1994 through 1996

increased the most in the following sectors textiles transport equipment and electronic goods and appliances under the nafta mexicos tariffs declined substanti ally in these three sectors stimulating increased us exports cin apparel the us share of imports from mexico which have high u s content grew from 44 to 96 while the share from china hong kong taiwan and korea fell us apparel imports from mexico apparently displaced apparel imports from the far east investment during the nafta debate much concern was expressed that us firms might relocate plants to mexico to take advantage of its low wages others argued that wages are only one factor in the cision to invest abroad in particular productivity in most industries in mexico is lower than in the united states and mexico s transportation nd infrastructure are not as well developed as those of the united states the available data sugges t that us direct investment i n mexico is currently smal l4 relative to total us direc t investment abroad in 1997 the latest data available the us direct investment position th cumulative amount or the stock in mexico was 254 b illion only 30 of the us direc t investment position in l countries of 8607 billio n figure 5 even the us direc t investment position in canada is only 116 of the total us direct investment position abroad furthermore the amount of ne w investment in mexico is relatively low looking at investment flows us direct investment in mexico was 30 billion in 1995 27 billion in 1996 and 59 billion in 1997 by c omparison us domestic investment in us plant and equipment was 8649 billion in 1997 in other words us investment in mexico5 was less than 1 of all us domestic investment in plant and equipment in 1997 this suggests that even if the nafta directly caus ed all these investment flows the naftas effect is very smallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20229crs6 for fuller discussion see crs report 9452 epw adjustment assistance for worker s6 dislocated by the north american

trade trends after 4 ½ years by mary jane bolle employm ent as noted earlier the nafta may cause some workers to gain jobs and others to lose them as the economy reallocates its resources since it takes time to shift resources and since some resources are not easily adaptable to other types f production some indust ries and workers will find it difficult to adjust at the same time other industries would benefit from increased demand creating new jobs the implementing legislation for the nafta pl 103182 included transitional adjustment assistance taa program which provides employment services training income support and job search and relocation allowan ces to eligible workers to receive6 benefits workers must be cer tified by the us secretary of the labor as having lost their jobs or been threatened with job loss by increased import competition from mexico or canada or by production shifts to mexico or canada one byproduct of the taa program is that it provides data on the estimated number of workers covered by certification it is important to emphasize that the number f workers covered by certification is not the same as the number of jobs lost as result of nafta some of the workers covered by certification were never laid off from their jobs while some displaced workers may not have applied for assistan ce nevertheless since the taa numbers re the only available data they provide an indication of the magnitude of the adjustment costs of nafta in the 5 years ending december 31 1998 350011 workers were covered b certification of which about 34 were in the apparel and electronics industries the7 350011 workers covered by certification is relatively small about threetenths of percent of total us employment of 1325 million at the end of december 1998 from another perspective the average number of jobs created per month between march 1991 when the current economic expansion began and december 1998 has been abou t 165000 moreover since mid1994 the us economy has been near if not above what most economists consider to b fullemployment suggesting that displaced workers may have found jobs elsewhere or dropped out of the labor force
