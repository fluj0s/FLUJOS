provision to eliminate the double tax on corporate earnings measure largely aimed at dividend tax relief the plan would create excludable di vidend amounts edas whose purpose would be to identify income that has been subject to the corporate income tax and allow only that income to be eligible for dividend relief or capital gains basis adjustment at the individual income tax level the joint committee on taxation estimates that the plan would cost 396 billion over fiscal years 2003 to 2013 the sign of the presidents dividend relief proposal would produce some side effects it could significantly reduce the value of existing corporate tax subsidies as result it is likely that there will be decrease in corporate investment in some subsidized areas the largest corporate subsidies include accelerated depreciation export subsidies exclusion of interest on public purpose statelocal bonds and research and development expenditures activities that rely heavily on corporate tax preferences could be negatively affected one area that has received attention is low income housing which re lies heavily on the low income housing credit preference restrictions could also undermine the temporary investment stimulus enacted in 2002 the mechanics causing these reductions in value are relatively straightforward under current law the actual tax saving s from corporate tax subsidy are passed through and taxed at the i ndividual level whether as dividends or capital gains income under the presidents proposal the corporate income that generated the tax subsidy would be passed through nd taxed at the individual level the rationale for restricting corporate tax preferences in the proposal is not stated the efficiency argument that economists use to justify corporate tax integration is not necessarily consistent with reducing corporate tax benefits it is possible that the treatment of corporate preferences was adopted to minimize revenue loss such rationale was used in 1992 treasury study of integration the reduction in the value of corpor ate subsidies depends on the value of preferences relative to the corporati ons income the corporations dividend distribution policy and the tax rate of the shareholder in some circumstances the reduction in the value of the s ubsidies could be substantial dividend tax relief could be designed so as to pass th rough the benefits of any or all corporate tax preferences if revenue is an issue one approach could be to allow partial exclusions for both divide nds and capital gains income which would eliminate the need to calcula excludable dividend amounts this paper provides an economic anal ysis of the proposal to establish excludable dividend amounts it does not tr ack legislative developments and will not be

issu the different forms of corporate double tax relief and other issues associated with the dividend plan can be found in crs report rl31597 the taxation of dividend income an overview and economic analysis of the issues by gregg esenwein and jane g gravelle the effect of the presidents dividend relief proposal on corporate tax subsidies centerpiece of the presidents economic growth package is provision aimed at eliminating the double ta x on corporate dividends1 the guiding principle of this proposal is that corporate income should be taxed only once so if it is taxed at the corporate level it should not be taxed at th individual level thus the presidents plan allows corporate income that has been taxed at the corporate level to be tax free at the individual level if the previously taxed corporate income is distributed as dividends then when the dividends are dist ributed they would not be subject to tax at the individual level if the previously taxed corporate income is retained then shareholders would be allowe d an adjustment increase in the basis of their stock holdings so that the previously taxed co rporate income would not be subject to individual capital gains taxes when the sh areholders sell their corporate stock the presidents proposal would signif icantly reduce the combined taxes corporate and individual on corporate source income however the proposals design would produce some side affects the presidents plan contains feature called excludable dividend amounts edas whose basic purpose would be to identify income that has been subject to the corporate income tax and allow only that income to be eligible for dividend relief or basis adjustment at the individual income tax level this proposal has been slightly modified in hr 2 bill incorporating the presidents tax plan to allow carry over of edas in excess of dividends the presidents approach would reduce the value of existing corporate tax subsidies and preferences the joint committee on taxation estimates that the presidents plan to eliminate the double taxation of corporat earnings would cost 396 billion over fiscal years 2003 to 2013 the first section of this report explai ns how these excluda ble dividend amounts edas work and how they affect the value of corporate tax preferences the second section of the report details alternative pproaches and their effects on corporate tax subsidies the next section of the report explores the rationale for edas the final section concludes with review of gene ral policy issues including discussion of the general types of corporate tax prefer ences currently allowed and discussion of possible alternative approaches httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs2 how edas affect corporate tax preferences under the presidents proposal corporation would compute an excludable dividend amount eda cor poration could distribute the eda to its shareholders and the shareholders would not have to pay indi vidual federal income taxes on the distributions alternatively corporations could retain all or some portion of their eda in which case the ba sis of the shareholders corporate stock would be increased to reflect the fact that portion of the stocks value the undistributed eda had already been s ubjected to the corporate income tax to calculate the eda corporations would convert their prior year us corporate income taxes into an amount that is equivalent to the amount of prior year corporate income that was taxed at 35 tax rate for this calculation us corporate income taxes would be calculated on pretax credit basis with respect to the foreign tax credit and the credit for the corporate alternative minimum tax corporate taxes would be calculated on posttax credit basis with respect to all other tax credits the following formul shows how corporations eda would be determined eda corporate income taxes 35 corporate income taxes for example if corporation paid 35 in corporate income taxes in the first year then its eda for the next year would be 65 3535 35 essentially edas are designed so that corporate income is taxed only once at either the corporate or individual level if the income is subject to tax at the corporate level then use of the eda would ensure that it is not subsequently taxed at the individual level this formula is quivalent to 1857 times the tax consequence of this approach howev er is that edas reduce the value of corporate tax subsidies this occurs whether the subsidy takes the form of reduction in corporate taxable income or as credit against corporate income tax liability it also occurs whether the eda is distributed to shareholders or retained and used to adjust the basis of shareholde r stock holdings the following simplified examples using tax credits as the corporate tax subsidies show how this effect occurs consider case under current law where corporation has 100 of net income with corporate tax rate of 35 the co rporation would owe 35 in federal income taxes on this income further assume that the corporation is eligible for corporate tax credit of 10 the final tax owed at the corporate level would be 25 35 tax less 10 credit and the corpor ation would have 75 in afte r tax income that it could distribute to its shareholders if the corporation distributed the tire 75 to its shareholders and it is assumed that the average tax rate at the individual level is 25 then individuals would pay an additional 1875 worth of ta x on this corporate source income in effect individual income tax is assessed on both the after tax income of the corporation 65 and the pa ssed through savings from the corporate tax credit 10 the total tax assessed on this 100 of corporate source inco at both the corporatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs3 and individual levels woul d be 4375 25 of corporate income tax plus 1875 of individual income tax in the absence of the 10 corporate tax credit the corpora tion would have paid 35 in corporate income taxes and would ve been able to distribute only 65 to its shareholders 100 income less 35 corporate income taxes at 25 tax rate individuals would have paid 1625 in individual income taxes on their 65 of corporate dividends so in the absence of the 10 corporate tax credit the total tax paid at both the corporate and individua l levels on 100 of corporate source income would have been 5125 35 of corporate income tax plus 1625 of individual income tax as this example demonstr ates the current law value of the 10 corporate tax credit is actually 750 once the added effect of assessing tax at the individual level is factored into the equation total taxes both corporate and individual paid on 100 of corporate source income is 4375 with the credit versus 5125 without the credit that is the tax is 750 5125 minus 4375 less with the 10 credit now consider what happens to the va lue of 10 corporate tax credit when edas are employed with 10 corporate tax credit corporation that had 100 of net income would pay 25 in corporate taxes 100 income at 35 corporate tax rate less the 10 credit the corporation w ould have 75 in after tax income that it could distribute to its shareholders but portion of this dividend distribution the excludable dividend amount eda would not be taxable at the individual level substituting the values from this example into the formula for calculating edas produces eda 2535 25 eda 4643 hence of the 75 that the corporati on pays out as dividends only 2857 75 in distributed dividends minus the 4643 that is excludable is subject to tax at the individual level assuming 25 rate at the individual level then the taxes owed at the individual level would be 714 the total tax paid at both the corporate and individual level on this 100 of cor porate source income would be 3214 25 in corporate level taxes plus 714 in individual income taxes in the absence of the 10 corporate tax credit the corporation would pay 35 in corporate income tax on 100 of net inco and could distribute 65 in dividends to its shareholders substituting these values into the formula for calculating edas yields eda 3535 35 eda 65 the entire 65 in dividend income would be excluded from tax at the individual level the total tax paid at both the co rporate and individual level on the 100 of net corporate income would be 35 35 at the corporate level and 0 at the individual level hence with edas the value of the 10 corporate tax credit is only 286 total taxes both corporate and individual pa id on 100 of corporate source income ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs4 3214 with the credit versus 3500 without the credit the value of the 10 tax credit falls from 750 under current w to 286 3500 minus 3214 under the presidents proposal the value of th credit is reduced by almost 62 after tax value of 10 corporate tax credit assuming all corporate after tax income distributed to shareholders as dividends and average shar eholder tax rate is 25 current law presidents proposal using edas 750 286 the mechanics causing these results are relatively straightforward under current law the actual tax savings from corporate tax subsidy are passed through and taxed at the individual vel whether as dividends or capital gains income the 10 credit in the examples illustrated above under the presidents proposal the corporate income that generated the tax s ubsidy is passed through and taxed at the individual level 2858 which is the cor porate tax credit 10 divided by the statutory corporate tax rate 35 the result is reduction in the value of the subsidy the percentage reduction in the value of the corporate tax subsidies will depend on the shareholders actual tax rates if the example above were computed using the top permanent individual marginal tax rate of 35 then the value of the corporate tax credit would fall from 650 under curre nt law to 0 under the presidents proposal or 100 reduction conversely if the shareholders were tax exempt eg corporate stock was held in an ira then there would be reduction in the value of the corporate subsidies under the presidents plan the reduction in the current law value of corporate tax subsides under the presidents proposal will be ss if corporations retain th income in excess of their edas rather than paying it out as dividends to their shareholders this occurs simply because the amounts that exceed the eda that are retained by the corporation are subject to capital gains tax rates when shareholders sell their corporate stock effective capital gains tax rates are lower than the individual tax rates applicable to distributed dividend income that exceeds the eda because the statutory tax rates on capital gains are lower the taxes on capital gains income are deferred until sale of the asset and some capital gains are never ta xed because they are passed on at death the presidents proposal to end the doubl taxation of corporate source income is tax cut corporate shareholders will see significant reduction in their combined corporate and individual income taxes under the presidents plan the effects on the value of corporate tax s ubsidies will also be significant the value of all corporate tax subsidies will fall as result it is likely that there will be decrease in corporate investment in some subsidized activities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs5 alternative approaches and their effects on corporate tax preferences the issue of the passthrough of corpor ate tax preferences has been discussed in previous studies of corporate doubletax relief when proposal s to relieve one of the levels of tax are made either the corporate or individual level how the relief is structured will determine the degree to which corporate tax preferences are preserved if the object were to eliminate the corporate level of tax some met hods of double tax relief would automatically eliminate the benefits of corporate tax preferences unless special measures were taken to preserve them for instance providing credit against individual income tax liability to individual shareholders for corporate taxes paid on their corporate source income would eliminate all of the benefits of corporate tax preferences providing relief by taxation on partne rship basis on the other hand would have the opposite effect by eliminating the corporate level tax and reflecting preferences in the allocable taxable income of the partners and allocable credits the preferences would be preserved this pproach would treat corporate shareholders the same way as unincorporated busin esses are treated under current law when the individual level of tax is to be eliminated there are several approaches that could be employed distributed corporate dividends and capital gains on corporate stock sales could be excluded from individual taxable income such an approach would preserve the corporate level of tax with all its preferences it would however be very costly and somewhat in efficient because it would eliminate taxes on all the accumulated capital gains on existing assets creating windfall for individual stockholders if the proposal simply excluded dividends then firms especially closely held ones would be able to pay out dividends have them reinvested in the firm which increases the basis of the stock and eliminate accumulated capital gains in that way because of the revenue and windfall gain concerns most plans for dividend relief at the individual level of tax have some method of dealing with the problems of accumulated earnings by restricting eith er dividend relief or basis adjustments there are two approaches that address th concerns both of which use approaches similar to edas one passes through corporate tax preferences and one does not as illustrated earlier the current propos for dividend tax relief using edas does not pass through the full value of co rporate tax preferences in january 1992 the treasury department issued report on corporate tax integration in which an approach was proposed that was very similar to the one currently under consideration apparently the reason that approach did not pass through corporatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs6 2 see michael graetz and alvin c warren interaction of the co rporate and individual income tax an introduction to the issues in integration of the us corporate and individual income taxes arlington va tax analysts 1998 the treasury integration study published in january 1992 was quite sim ilar to the current proposal although it did not provide benefits for income taxed by foreign governments but not by the us system while the current proposal does in cember 1992 the outgoing bush administration proposed more generous system that ba sically excluded all dividends and provided benefits for retained earnings reflecting broader measure of income 3 us department of treasury general explanation of the administration s fiscal 2004 revenue proposal february 2003 p 11 tax preferences was because of revenue losses2 in fiscal year 2003 corporate tax subsidies were approxima tely 65 of total co rporate tax revenues however the treasury subsequently pr oposed dividend relief plan that did include the passthrough of corporate tax pr eferences in this version which was proposed by the outgoing george h w bush administration in december of 1992 all dividends were excludable from taxati on at the individual level but dividends paid in excess of amounts deemed nontaxa ble would reduce the basis of corporate stock with such rule there is advantage in paying out past accumulated earnings as dividends and reinvesting them because any increase in basis would be offset by the basis reduction rule th accounts would be the sum of taxable corporate income plus permanent preferen ces such as tax exempt interest minus taxes paid before credits what is the rationale for edas aside from revenue concerns what are th justifications for not providing passthrough of preferences this assessm ent depends on the rationale for providing double tax relief in the first place although some have argued for divi dend relief on the grounds of fairness among investors this argument is not consistent with economic analysis which suggests that after tax returns are equated ne t of risk by market forces there is need to provide dividend relief to be fai r to investors in corporate stock as opposed to other forms of investment th market will produce that result left on its own economic arguments for provi ding relief to dividends tend to rest on efficiency grounds corporate equity investment is s ubject to higher taxes than noncorporate investment or debt financed capital and the resulting misallocation of capital causes economic inefficiency thus efficiency is the central rationale for considering dividend relief indeed economic efficiency is stated as the principal rationale for double tax relief in the treasury discussion of the presidents dividend tax reduction proposal3 it is not clear that the efficiency rationale justifies restrictions on the pass through of corporate preferences tax preferences will still be available forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs7 unincorporated businesses so tax diffe rentials would remain with respect to preferentially treated income in the co rporate versus the non corporate sector from an efficiency viewpoint by choosin g to reduce the value of corporate tax preferences this approach maintains differential tax treatment between the corporate and noncorporate sectors in fact the administrations proposal actually further expands tax benefits for small unincorporated businesses by raising the limit on expensing so at the same time it is trying to insure that corporate income is subject to at least one level of tax ot her elements of the administrations plan expand opportunities for investments in th noncorporate sector to escape tax altogether the proposal also expands be nefits available to corporations whose value will be reduced perhaps substantially by the eda approach the limit on corporate preference passthr ough undermines the incentive effects of those tax subsidies if those subsidies were desirable in the first place it seems appropriate to continue them in full stre ngth of course the change could improve overall economic efficiency if corporate tax preferences are undesirable s till more effective approach would be to re peal the preferences outright one rationale may remain and is alluded to in the treasury analysis some tax reductions arise from tax sheltering activities that are not intentional preferences these tax shelters are difficult to detect and prevent in this case limiting the passthrough of preferen ces may be desirable effects of edas on incentives magnitude of effects as noted above the reduction in the valu of the corporate subsidy depends on whether dividends are less than or greater than the eda the size of the eda is itself affected by the size of corporate subsidies the reduction in subsidy values therefore depend on the tax rate the pa yout ratio and the ratio of subsidies to income which govern at what payout ra tio the dividends will exceed eda table 1 provides calculations of the percentage decrease in the value of the subsidy depending on payout rate and size of subsidy relative to income in the case of 25 tax rate table 2 provides the estimates for 35 rate both assume capital gains effective rate of 10 for firms that retain all earnings the reduction in the value of the subsidy is approximately 21 the re duction gets smaller as mo re dividends are paid out because taxes are higher under existing law but there is consta nt tax penalty under the dividend relief proposal there is sh arp break between the effect on marginal dollar of subsidy as dividends begin to ex ceed the eda when the value of additional dollars of subsidy holding pa yout ratios constant falls substantially when all after tax income is paid out as dividends the reduction in the value of the tax subsidy is extremely large and the entire subsidy disappears when the shareholder is in the same tax bracket as the firm 35 table 2 in that case what is saved at the corporate level is repaid as tax at the indi vidual level thus the firms that would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs8 most affected by the presidents proposal are those with high payout ratios

more than half of stocks are held by taxpayers who would not benefit from the presidents proposal for double taxation relief either because they are already tax exempt pensions iras stocks held by non profits or because they are not eligible foreign shareholders if all of these taxpayers are weighted together the effects would probably be about half of some amount between those in table 1 and table 2 if on the margin however shareholders are in high marginal income tax brackets then the effects could be larger if corporate managers who own stock give particular weight to their own circumstances then the effects on incentives could also be more pronounced economic activities affected what types of economic activ ities that currently receive subsidies might be most affected by the reduction in value of preferences table 3 lists the largest corporate tax subsides for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 by far the largest tax expenditure 119 billion was the value of accelerated depreciation this cost is particularly large because it reflects the temporary expensing provision enacted in 2002 to stimulate inves tment because this benefit is timing benefit with current loss offset by future gain its magnitude is overstated the temporary expensing provision was widely ag reed upon to be the most effective way to stimulate investment4 in fact it is possible that the undermining of this provision could cause the dividend package to be contractionary initially another set of provisions that would be significantly affected are two associated with export subsidies exclusion of extrat erritorial income nd inventory property source rules which together total ove r 55 billion most economists however would suggest that export subsidies do not add to economic efficiency provisions that economists are more likely to s upport are those relating to research and experimentation tax credit and ex pensing which sum to 40 billion also significant are revenue losses from tax exempt interest of state and local governments provisions favorin g investment abroad and i nvestment in puerto rico in addition to the variety of provisions liste d in the table many of which are specific to certain industries there are many smaller tax subsidie s that may affect smaller set of activities the actual effects on particular activity will depend on how important tax preferences are to that activity and how they benefit from the general dividend tax relief except for possible timing effect the reduction in preferences on accelerated depreciation would be more than offset by the general benefit to investment from relief of double taxation simila rly many firms export and would receive benefits for dividend relief on the taxed portion of ex port income that offset or more than offset the disincentive from reduction in the value of the preferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31782crs10 5 ernst and young llp the impact of the dividend excl usion proposal on the production of affordable

role could experience significant contractions one area of preferentially treated activity that has received some public attention is low income housin g recent study predicted significant adverse effects because housing tax credits are large source of low income housing finance and are heavily supplied by corporations5 the study also argued that state and local governments ability to provide their share of financing would be adversely affected by the direct loss of benefits to tax exempt bonds held by corporations as well as the general diversion of investme nt out of tax exempt bonds by individual investors who shift to corporate stock and by the loss of tax revenue to states that base their income tax system on the federal income tax base the analysis

woul d fall by about 35 although apparently the treasury questions that estimate6 in general subsidized activities earn lower pretax return and the reduction in the subsidy reduces the scope of investme nt projects which are viable in some cases corporations participate in broa der market where reduced activity may not materially alter those returns or may not alter them enough to make investment viable an example of this activity is tax exempt bonds where both individuals and corporations invest and which pay lower in terest rates because they are not taxable in such market it is possible that corporate participants would withdraw entirely possible revisions the presidents dividend relief proposal could be revised to eliminate its adverse impact on corporate tax subsidies if there is desire to preserve the benefits of particular credits then one could base the eda on tax liability prior to credits in fact all legislated subsid ies could be passed through which would result only in reduction in the value of uni ntended tax benefits ther are also ways to pass through corporate preferences in general to the individual level as was done in the december 1992 proposal if revenue is an issue then it might be possible to provi partial relief provision without restricting preference passthrough and indeed without setting up accounts at all for example if dividends were taxed at least as much as capital gains then there would be way to save revenue by paying out and reinvesting dividends one possibility would be flat 50 exclusion for both dividends and capital gains capital gains are already close to 50 exclusion for the top tax bracket and gains are heavily concentrated in these brackets so that large revenue loss might not result from the capital gains exclusion appendix this appendix formalizes the treatme nt of preferences under the eda and explains how the treatment reduces the value of preferences in this example we capture all tax preferences that deviate fro m economic income as credit equivalent c this amount may actually be credit or it can be construed as the tax saving from deduction or exclusion under current law after tax income which can be either paid to shareholders as dividends or retained for reinvestment is 1 after tax corporate income y1u cwhere is economic income before tax u is the corporate tax rate and c is the
