certain health care practitioners and entities immune from medical malpractice liability 42 usc 233g and the first was added to the public health service act by the federally supported health centers assistance act of 1992 the second by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 this report will refer to them as the 1992 amendment and the 1996 amendment g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g22g152g155g157g561g5g149g138g146g150g156g561g3g140g157g561 before we discuss the 1992 and 1996 amendments we must discuss the federal tort claims act ftca 28 usc 1346b 26712680 to which they implicitly refer state law generally makes employers liable for the torts of their employees committed within the scope of their employment the ftca waives sovereign immunity to make the united states similarly liable in accordance with the law of the state where tort occurs for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligen t or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment 28 usc 1346b 1 it also makes federal employees immune from all lawsuits arising under state law for torts committed within the scope of their employment the ftca does not prevent federal employee from being sued for violating the constitution or federal statute that authorizes suit against an individual sometimes congress wish to immunize private organization or its employees or volunteers from tort liability one way it may do so is to enact statute declaring that the organization or its employees or volunteers shall be deemed federal employees for purposes of the ftca that is what the 1992 and 1996 amendments do 2 although they provide immunity apparently only from medical malpractice liability and not from all liability under state tort law g343g351g351g344g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561 this provision reads an entity described in paragraph 4 and any officer governing board member or employee of such entity and any contractor of such an entity who is physician or other licensed or certified health practitioner subject to paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be an employee of the public health service for purposes of medical malpractice liability 3 paragraph 4 defines the entity in question as public or nonprofit private entity receiving federal funds under section 254b of this title section 254b is the health centers consolidation act of 1996 pl 104299 4 which authorizes grants for health centers which it defines as entities that serve population that is medically underserved or specially medically 1 the ftca however contains exceptions under which the united states may not be held liable even if under state law private employer may in addition the ftca does not permit punitive damages against the united states regardless of state law see crs report 95717 federal tort claims act by henry cohen and vanessa k burrows 2 at least 50 other federal statutes do so as well these statutes are listed in crs report 97579 making private entities and individuals immune from tort liability by declaring them federal employees by henry cohen which also suggests pros and cons of providing immunity in this way 3 42 usc 233g1a department of health and human services regulations under the 1992 amendment appear at 42 cfr part 6 4 prior to 1996 254b

agricultural workers the homeless and residents of public housing paragraph 5 referred to in the above quotation from the 1992 amendment defines contractor for purposes of the 1992 amendment in other words it sets forth which contractors are deemed employees of the public health service for purposes of liability the 1992 amendment continues the remedy against the united states for an entity described in paragraph 4 and any officer governing board member employee or cont ractor subject to paragraph 5 of such an entity who is deemed to be an employee of the public health service and thus of the united states pursuant to this paragraph shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding to the same extent as the remedy against the united states is exclusive pursuant to subsection of this section 5 subsection provides that the remedy against the united states provided by the ftca or by alternative benefits provided by the united states for damage for personal injury including death resulting from the performance of medical surgical dental or related functions by any commissioned officer or employee of the public he alth service while acting within the scope of his office or employment shall be exclusive of any other civil action6 what this means is simply that an entity or individual described in the 1992 amendment cannot be sued for medical malpractice that an individual committed in the scope of his duties any medical malpractice claim that in the absence of this provision could have been brought against such an entity or individual may instead be brought ag ainst the united states under the ftca or under statute that provides alternative federal benefits g343g351g351g348g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561 the 1996 amendment gave to free clinic health professionals the same protection that the 1992 amendment gave to entities officers governing board members employees and contractors the 1996 amendment provides that free clinic health professional shall in providing qualifying health service to an individual be deemed to be an employee of the public health service 42 usc 233 o1 it also provides subsection g of this section ie the 1992 amendment and other subsections apply to health care practitioner for purposes of this subsection the 1996 amendment to the same extent and in the same manner as such subsections apply to an officer governing board member employee or contractor of an entity described in subsection g4 of this section 42 usc 233 o57 in other words free clinic health professionals have the same immunity as the entities and individuals covered by the 1992 provision8 note that the 1996 amendment unlike the 1992 amendment grants immunity only to individuals not to entities 5 42 usc 233g1a 6 the 1992 amendments incorporation of subsection with its reference to medical surgical dental or related functions appears to indicate that the immunity provided by the 1992 amendment does not extend to torts other than medical malpractice 7 the 1996 amendment appears to use professional and practitioner interchangeably 8 this appears to indicate that it provides immunity only for medical malpractice not for other torts see footnote 6 supra

free clinic means health care facility operated by nonprofit private entity meeting the following requirements i the entity does not accept reimbursement from any thirdparty payor including reimbursement under any insurance policy or health plan or under any federal or state health benefits program ii the entity either does not impose charges on the individuals to whom the services are provided or imposes charge according to the ab ility of the individual involved to pay the charge 9 the term qualifying health service means any medical assistance required or authorized to be provided in the program under title xix of the social security act10 title xix of the social security act is medicaid 42 usc 1396 et seq the 1996 amendment thus grants immunity to health professionals who at free clinics provide medical assistance required or authorized to be provided under medicaid however because free clinic by definition may not accept reimbursement under federal or state health benefit program and medicaid is such program it appears that the 1996 amendment does not apply to health professionals who provide medical assistance at clinics that accept medicaid funds the type of medical assistance for which they are immune in other words is defined by reference to medicaid but apparently does not include medical assistance reimbursed under medicaid 11 what is health professional under the 1996 amendment the term is not defined but health professional like free clinic may not receive any compensation for the service from the individual or from any thirdparty payor he or she however may receive repayment from the free clinic for reasonable expenses 42 usc 233 o2d the 1996 amendment does not state that health practitioner may not receive other compensation from the free clinic but it seems to imply it as there would seem to be reason for the statute to specify that practitioner may receive repayment if he or she could receive other compensation 12 the health practitioner must also be sponsored by the free clinic this means that the free clinic must submit an application to the secretary of health and human services and the secretary must determine that the health care practitioner is deemed to be an employee of the public health service 42 usc 233 o5c in short health care practitioner must be approved by the secretary in order to receive immunity under the 1996 amendment13 9 42 usc 233 o3a 10 42 usc 233 o4 11 the conference report says eligible health professionals must provide qualifying services ie otherwise available for medicaid reimbursement at free clinic or through programs conducted by the clinic hrept 104736 104th cong 2d sess 279 1996 emphasis added 12 language in the conference report supports this interpre tation this provision extends federal tort claims act coverage to certain medical volunteers in free clinics health professionals must meet certain conditions before they are deemed employees of the public health service act sic they must be licensed or certified in accordance with applicable law and they must be volunteers they may not receive compensation for the services in the form of salary fees or thirdparty payments however they may receive reimbursement from the clinic for reasonable expenses hrept 104736 104 th cong 2d sess 278279 1996 in addition the title of 42 usc 233 is volunteer

health resources and services administration of hhs issued program information notice titled federal tort claims act coverage of free clinic volunteer health care professionals 14 the 1996 amendment had authorized to be appropriated 10 million for each fiscal year for purposes of making payments for judgments against the united states pursuant to this section arising from the acts or omissions of free clinic health professionals15 congress however did not appropriate funds for this purpose until fy2004 when it appropriated 485000016 it appropriated 100000 to carry out the provisions of 42 usc

the volunteer protection act vpa 42 usc 1450114505 which was enacted in 1997 provides immunity for ordinary negligence to volunteers acting within the scope of their responsibilities in nonprofit organizations or governmental entities provided that if appropriate or required the volunteer was properly licensed certified or authorized by the appropriate authorities the immunity does not apply to willful or criminal conduct gross negligence reckless misconduct or conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer this liability limitation does not apply to nonprofit organizations or governmental entities they may be held liable for the ordinary negligence of their volunteers even if volunteers are immune nonprofit organizations and governmental entities may however sue their volunteers the vpa unlike the 1996 amendment does not make the united states liable for the torts of the volunteers whom it immunizes from liability the vpa contains definitions of nonprofit organization and of volunteer which are not necessary to quote for present purposes it suffices to say that clinic could apparently qualify both as free clinic under the 1996 amendment and as nonprofit organization under the vpa and that volunteer physician could also be covered under both 20 but if volunteer physician who is covered under both statutes is negligent in the performance of his duties which statute would apply the volunteer physician would be immune under either but the nonprofit organization could be liable under the vpa while the united states under the 1996 amendment could be liable under the ftca as practical matter the volunteer physician it seems would first claim immunity under the 1996 amendment this is because if the court found him immune under the 1996 amendment it would dismiss the case against him without trial to determine whether he had committed malpractice if the physician did not qualify for immunity under the 1996 amendment because for example he had not been sponsored by the free clinic then the injured party could still seek to prove gross negligence and thereby hold the physician liable continued when

vpa 20 the vpa however defines volunteer to include persons who receive thing of value in lieu of compensation not in excess of 500 per year thing of value might be deemed compensation under the 1996 amendment thus making practitioner ineligible for immunity under that statute

injured party could also sue the clinic and recover even if the physician were guilty only of ordinary negligence but could not sue the united states suppose that clinic at which malpractice allegedly occurred were both free clinic under the 1996 amendment and nonprofit organization under the vpa but the clinic longer existed and so could not be sued and the volunteer physician who worked for it had malpractice insurance or significant personal assets in that case the injured party in addition to the physician would benefit from the 1996 amendment because it would enable the injured party to sue the united states could the united states however claim that in order for it to be liable the plaintiff would have to prove gross negligence the argument of the united states would be that if the plaintiff proves only ordinary negligence then the physician would be immune under the vpa and if the physician were immune under the vpa then it the united states could not be liable either this argument would not appear valid because the 1996 amendment holds the united states liable under the ftca and the ftca makes the united states liable for the negligent not merely grossly negligent wrongful act or omission of federal employee or one deemed federal employee under the 1996 amendment or other statute in other words if the 1996 amendment applies the vpa apparently drops out of the picture even if on its face it could also apply 21 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the 1992 amendment to the public health service act provides that public or nonprofit private entity receiving federal funds under the health centers consolidation act of 1996 and any officer governing board member or employee of such entity and any contractor of such an entity who is physician or other licensed or certified health practitioner shall be deemed federal employee and thus immune from liability for purposes of medical malpractice suits the 1996 amendment when it took effect on september 24 2004 extended this immunity to free clinic health professionals which are unpaid volunteers approved by the secretary of health and human services who provide medical assistance of the sort required or authorized under medicaid in clinics that receive reimbursement from insurers or federal or state health benefits programs being totally immune from medical malpractice liability such individuals would not need the partial immunity of the v olunteer protection act 21 principle of statutory construction appears to support this analysis if two statutes such as the 1996 amendment and the vpa relate to the same subject matter but one statute deals with subject in general terms and another deals with part of the same subject in more detailed way the two should be harmonized if possible but if there is any conflict the latter will prevail regardless of whether it was pa ssed prior to the general statut unless it appears that the legislature intended to make the general act controlling norman j singer s tatutes and statutory construction vol 2b 5105 6th ed 2000 the 1996 amendment though enacted prior to the vpa deals with specific categories of volunteers whereas the vpa deals with all volunteers as defined in the vpa and nothing in the vpa suggests that it was meant to supersede the 1996 amendment therefore it appears that if volunteer by the terms of the 1996 amendment and the vpa could fall under both statutes the 1996 amendment would govern
