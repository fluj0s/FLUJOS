ambassador craig r stapleton for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary ambassador stapleton and national economic council director allan hubbard met with interior minister nicolas sarkozy on august 1 sarkozy expressed his admiration for president bush and said he looked forward to the opportunity to tackle frances economic and social problems with the same directness for which the president is justly famous sarkozy confirmed that he would be running for president of france in 2007 he said his own struggle to rise to high office as the of immigrants challenging entrenched elites in part explained his deep admiration for americas values he said he would stress opportunity and making deep break with the past by proposing significant change to frances social model in his 2007 campaign on economic issues sarkozy reprised many of his now familiar policy themes frances economic model holds back growth people need to work more and be rewarded for doing so and people need to be told the truth about the economic situation he was upbeat about frances future if the country seized the opportunity that reforms could bring he also tossed out few of the policy zingers for which he is well known notably the european central bank confuses strong currency with strong economy and france needs to do what reagan did in the us thatcher in britain and gonzales in spain end summary 2 u ambassador stapleton and allan hubbard director of the national economic council met with frances minister of interior nicolas sarkozy on 1 august sarkozy is also the president of the union for popular movement ump party coalition of centerright parties founded by president chirac in 2002 the meeting took place in sarkozys office at the ministry of the interior and was also attended by sarkozy chief of staff claude gueant and interior ministry staffer cederic goubet embassy econ counselor poloff and economic analyst as interpreter accompanied mr hubbard and ambassador stapleton admiration for president bush 3 c sarkozy expressed his admiration for president bush sarkozy said that like the president he too was committed to keeping his word and to dealing honestly with the real problems of the country unlike the rest of those politicians throughout the hourlong meeting sarkozy returned again and again to the importance of leveling with people he illustrated his point by saying the french people have to be told the truth and they want to hear it he added that most politicians and specifically president chirac just keep stringing the people along with their constant tergiversating economic council director hubbards presentation of the presidents direct and principled tackling of americas major domestic challenges taxes social security education drew the high compliment from sarkozy that he too would like to tackle the same problems in the same way for france disagreeing with versus undercutting the us 4 c sarkozy lamented the troubled state of usfrance relations during recent years he drew sharp distinction between disagreeing with friends and undercutting them he said we should always be able to disagree calling it something he would never do he cited president chiracs and thenforeign minister villepins use of frances security council veto against the us in february 2002 as an unjustifiable and excessive reaction to difference of views he added that he would have advised the us not to undertake the invasion and occupation of iraq but that that didnt prevent him from feeling it personally when american soldiers die in combat he proudly pointed out how at the height of antiamerican feeling and antius demonstrations contemporaneous to sarkozys first stint as minister of the interior 2002 2004 he took it as personal responsibility to see to it that us embassy or consulate was so much as touched by demonstrators identifying with americas values 5 c they call sarkozy the american he said they consider it an insult but i take it as compliment sarkozy stressed how much he recognized himself in americas values he recalled how as boy he told his father that he wanted to grow up to be president he said his hungarianborn father retorted in that case go to america because with name like sarkozy youll never make it here proving that wrong sarkozy said was touchstone for his efforts both to succeed and to transform france into place where outsiders like him could also enjoy opportunity untrammeled by prejudice comment very much unlike nearly all other french political figures sarkozy is viscerally proamerican for most of his peers the us is sometimes reviled or admired but decidedly foreign other sarkozy identifies with america he sees his own rise in the world as reflecting an americanlike saga end comment fighting frances elite 6 c sarkozy pointed to his own political career as an example of both his success and the difficulty of achieving it im not member of the eliteim someone who wants to speak for the france that gets up every morning and works he said as he recalled his own rise from knowing nobody and beginning as simple party supporter and climbing every step in the ladder to his current bid for the presidency with some vehemence sarkozy insisted on his having had to challenge those stronger than every step of way confirming he will run 7 c sarkozy confirmed his intention to run for president to ambassador stapleton and nec director hubbard saying i am going to be candidate in 2007 outlining his campaign strategy sarkozy said we are going to propose change to the french people im convinced that it can workpeople want to believe they can succeed sarkozy then touched on many of his specific proposals for providing more opportunity for the able and more support for the disadvantaged tax cuts labor law reform affirmative action immigration reform and monetary policy that recognizes that the currency is an instrument for supporting strong economy recalling reagan thatcher and gonzales 8 c on economic affairs sarkozy repeated his oftenstated assertion that the french economic model is bad france needs to do what spain the uk and other successful countries have done over the past twenty years take the best of what they have done and adopt those policies in france in response to mr hubbards question on what sarkozys economic vision for france was sarkozy said that the french people have to understand that they need to work more and that the government must make it more profitable for people who do so he said that france needed to go through period similar to the us under reagan the uk under thatcher and spain under gonzalez france is not an old country he said but right now its acting like one incentives for taking initiative 9 c sarkozy explained his theory that unemployment benefits should be higher than they currently are for people immediately after they are laid off however they should quickly phase out to provide an incentive for people to look for work unemployed people should be required to look for work now they are not required to echoing comments made by finance minister breton sarkozy said people are ready for the politics of truth he added that his directly expressed assessments of frances economic problems and his insistent advocacy of work innovation and entrepreneurship in fact contribute to his popularity some people told never to say such things people will hate you clearly they dont hate he observed overvalued euro and alan greenspan 10 c on the deficit sarkozy said that for 25 years france has been living beyond its means now it is paying the price for that he said that the us had two advantages that france did not have greenspan and the dollar he said that france was suffering from longer having control of its own currency and observed that european central bank ecb president trichet was pursuing exactly the wrong policies he confuses strong currency with strong economy europe needed progrowth ecb not one focused on fighting inflation only the us he observed has often had its strongest economy when the dollar was at its weakest turning to chairman greenspan sarkozy said he is genius genius he has pursued exactly the right policies frances economic challenges 11 c returning to his priorities for france sarkozy noted that frances biggest challenges were outsourcing lagging research sector savings that are too static and dont really help move the economy and lack of profitable midsize companies we have lots of big ones and lots of really small ones but few in between he sees natural strengths for france in the health agriculture and food transportation communication and nuclear energy sectors working together at the wto 12 c responding to mr hubbards observation on the need for the doha trade round to move forward this autumn sarkozy agreed and noted that the eu needed to reach better understanding with the us on agricultural issues he said that us and eu officials were talking but prescribed much more intensive discussion so that common understanding could be reached if that happened he believed the upcoming hong kong ministerial could be success comment 13 c for many years nicolas sarkozy has been frances most popular politician current polls show his approval ratings holding steady at around 60 percent and defeating any probable opponent in 2007 by experience and conviction his experience as interior minister and his liberal freemarket oriented convictions he seems particularly wellsuited to lead france in meeting the key challenges it now faces security in this era of global terrorism and prosperity in this era of adapting to economic globalization in addition sarkozys deep identification with american values opportunity initiative competition society that sustains individual liberty as much as it supports national power make him frances best hope for catalyzing the shift in social values that the french need to make if they are to take full advantage of globalization comment continued 14 c sarkozys vision for france is powerful one and as his popularity reflects it resonates with big part of the electorate however resistance to social change is particularly strong in france attachment to the benefits and advantages that most of them receive in one way of another from the state the substance of the french social model is very strong among ordinary french people sarkozys popularity may be reflection of change the french would like to make but are too conservative to in fact undertake end comment stapleton
