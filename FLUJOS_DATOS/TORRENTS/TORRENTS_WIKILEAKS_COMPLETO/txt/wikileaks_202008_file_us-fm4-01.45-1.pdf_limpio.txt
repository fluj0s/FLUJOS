3258 i1 chapter i troop leading proceduresplanning considerations introduction there is such thing as an administrative move in combat zone tactical convoy is delibera tely planned combat operation to move personnel andor cargo via group of ground transp ortation assets in secure manner to or from target destination under the co ntrol of single commander in permissive uncertain or hostile vironment tactical convoys should always have access to the common operat ional picture and be characterized by an aggressive posture agility and unpredictabilit b tactical convoys are combat operations and should be viewed as tactical road march although contact with enem organizeduniformed ground forces is not anticipated security against antiu s forces enemy sympathizers and ieds is maintained and the convoy is prepared to take immediate action against an enemy threat to accomplish this tactic convoys require additional planning and coordination beyond normal linehau l operations due to the noncontiguous nonlinear battlefield of today one of the main enemy tactics of the nonlinear battlefield is to target the convoys lines of comm unication supplies and other government resources to defeat this tactic each tactical convoy must be prepared to take offensive action in the face of am bush and defeat enemy forces once contact is gained thus retaining the initiativ and deterring future attacks c training experience and unit standard operating p rocedures sop will accelerate tactical convoy preparation espe cially when time is short while each convoy regardless of the type or size may be diff erent the troop leading procedures tlp used in preparing for the movement are the same and must be trained and constantly rehear sed while tlps are standardized they are tailore d here to specifically fit tactical convoy operations note the drawings depicted in the following pages are simplified illustrations and should not be taken literally with respect to v ehicle interval

the standard military aspects of terrain for combat operat ions known as ocoka observationfields of fire cover and concealment obstacles key terrain avenues of approach while this traditional approach is occasionally nec essary during convoy operations the primary focus should be the route this analysis cannot be accomplished using only map combat imagery base cib products and unmanned aerial vehicle uav imagery available through in telligence s2 imagery channels are additional tools but nothing replaces thorough ground reconnaissance ccs take detailed notes pertaining to navigation trafficability congestion and the threat the primar method for providing information to convoy leaders concerning the route is th strip map these sketches are easily developed refined and produced strip maps for l ong haul routes should be constructed at high levels of command but maps for local short haul routes are ideally produced at battalion or lower levels app endix provides detailed example and discussion of information that should b included on strip map ccs should issue these maps to every vehicle in the convoy b weather terrain and weather analysis are inse parable the effects of weather should be factored in during th review of the terrain in this sub step weather analysis evaluates the we athers direct effects on convoy operation the military aspects of weather include visibility winds precipitation cloud cover temperature humidity light data ccs should collect and review the foll owing information concerning light data prior to each operation the effects of light

civilian the law of armed conflict imposes strict limitations on the use of civilian personnel in the combat envi ronment dod serv ice and combatant commander guidance will dictate policy limi tations and restrictions for civilians supporting military forces heavy civilian presence in operational areas will be major complicating factor along any convoy route the potential interference may vary when

key informati on required may be requested through higher headquarters cc should request information in advance to allow for sufficient time for planning b reconnaissance 1 map reconnaissance is made first followed by physical ground or air reconnaissance if possible when making the map reconnaissance other available information such as engineer intelligence military policesecurity force information civilians supporting military eg s ecurity contractors and military contracted vehicle operators and overhead photos should be used since route conditions are susceptible to change in relatively short time due to enemy action or weather physic reconnaissance is highly beneficial if time and the security situation permit 2 groundphysical reconnaissance should be conducted in concert with the supporting engineer element this is part icularly critical when gap crossings and route construction may be required aerial reconna issance may be conducted visually using overhead

are battle drills that require ext ensive rehearsals 2 route reconnaissanceanalysis is cr itical to determine ahead of time where these techniques will be used 3 blocking vehicles are designated during mission pre paration 4 blocking vehicles should not be the front or rear scort vehicles 5 block left or block right commands indicate p articular side of the road 6 in large convoys blocking trucks can be relieved i n place by subsequent blocking trucks from within the convoy to maintain order of march 7 blocking requires extensive comm and and control and experienced teams 8 command is given by designated vc or cc for designa ted vehicles to bump up to location to block 9 road intersections figure iii10 convoy reduces speed as it approaches the intersec tion b convoy reduces
