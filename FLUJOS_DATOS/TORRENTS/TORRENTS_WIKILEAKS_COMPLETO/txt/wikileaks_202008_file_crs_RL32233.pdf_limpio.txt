general assistance listed under both cash and medical ai d could be viewed as single program cash and noncash benefits for persons with limited income eligibility rules recipient and expenditure data fy2000fy2002 introduction more than 80 benefit programs provide cash and noncash aid that is directed primarily to persons with limited income these benef it programs cost 5222 billion in fy2002 record high this sum was up 453 billion 95 from the previous peak of fy2001 and it equaled 5 of the gross domestic product gdp federal funds provided 715 of the total hi gher medical spending accounted for 328 billion of the years net increase and 54 cents out of every welfare dollar went for medical benefits federal welfare outlays represented 186 of the federal budget with 8 attributed to medical assistance see table 1 for fy2000fy2002 summary after adjustment for price inflati on 2002 welfare spending was up 382 billion 79 from that of 2001 the previous peak real spending increases 2002 dollars were dominated by medical assistance up 291 billion other increases were education benefits 41 billi on food benefits 33 billion housing 23 billion and services 12 billion outlays for cash aid dropped by 12 billion and for jobs and training by 05 billion spending for human capital progra ms ones providing education and employment and training activities accounted for 73 of all welfare dollars compared with 196 for cash assistance this report consists of catal og of 85 needbased programs1 for each program the report provides the funding formula ligibility requirements and benefit levels at the back of the report summary table 14 gives expenditure data federal and statelocal and recipient data for fy2000 fy2002 by program two programs are new to this series of reports farmers market nutrition programs formerly treated as component of the food stamp prog ram and housing assistance for special populations elderly and disabled histor ical tables have been revised to account for these additionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32233crs2 most of these programs base elig ibility on individual household or family income but some use group or area income tests see table 7 page 16 and few offer help on the basis of presumed n eed most provide income transfers that is they transfer income in the form of cash goods or services to persons who make payment and render service in re turn however in the case of the job and training programs and so educational bene fits recipients must work or study for wages training allowances stipends gr ants or loans further the tanf block grant program requires adults to commence work defined by the state after period of enrollment the food stamp program im poses work and training requirements and public housing programs require recipi ents to engage in selfsufficiency activities or to perform community service finally the earned income tax credit eitc is available only to workers this report excludes income maintenance programs that are not incometested including social insurance and many vetera ns benefits and all but two taxtransfer programs thus it excludes social security cash benefits unemployment compensation and medicare outlays fo r the oldage survivors and disabi lity insurance programs social security cas h benefit programs in fy2002 totaled 456 billion financed primarily from payroll ta x collections the report also excludes payments even though financed with gene ral revenues that may be regarded as deferred compensation such as vetera ns housing benefits and medical care for veterans with serviceconnected disability the report includes two taxtransfer programs the eitc for lowincome workers with children and the child tax credit the eitc reduces the taxes of working families with gross income below specified limits and makes direct payments refunds to those whose income is below the tax threshold or whose tax liability is smaller than their credit befo re the 2001 tax law the child tax credit was refundable only to some taxpayers with three or more children but it now is refundable up to certain limits for thos with earnings above 10000 this report treats the direct payment component of th credits but not the reduction in tax liability as welfare expenditure other tax benefits are excluded from the report because they are not refundable make dir ect payments further in most cases they impose income test for eligibility examples of these other tax benefits are the deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes on owneroccupied homes equivalent to outlays of 633 billion and 218 billion respectively in 2002 these tax transfers increase families disposable income by reducing their tax liability and are known as tax expenditures the standard deduction and personal exemption in the income tax code also decrease families taxable incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32233 crs3 table 1 expenditures of major needtested benefit programs by form of benefit and

individual states in structuring their medicaid programs determine who is actually eligible for medicaid in given state some groups ar mandatory meaning all states must cover them others are optional in general federal law places limitations on the categories of individuals that can be covered and tablishes specific eligibility rules for groups within those broad categories traditionally medicaid eligibility was limited to the following categories lowincome families with dependent children in which one parent was absent incap acitated or unemployed lowincome persons with disabilities and lowincome elderly in addition certain individuals with higher income especially those facing large costs for medical care were eligible as medically needy beginning in the 1980s additional coverage groups were added to medicaid for higher income children nd pregnant women other coverage groups are identified in statute as needing special protection against the high cost of medical care3 over 50

program are financial criteria medicaid is meanstested entitlement program to qualify applicants income and resources4 must be within certain limits most of which are determined by states again within
