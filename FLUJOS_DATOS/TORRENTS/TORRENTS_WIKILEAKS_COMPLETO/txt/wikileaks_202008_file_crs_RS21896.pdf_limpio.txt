fr eddies charters the fannie mae charter provides fannie mae the authority to issue ob ligations upon the appr oval of the secretary of the treasury and have outstanding at any one time obligations having such maturities and bearing such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by fannie mae with the approval of the secretary of the treasury4 the treasury secretary has the same authority over freddie macs securities issuances5 the treasury secretary has traditi onally although not exclusively6 exercised the approval authority with regard to fannies nd freddies debt issuances not to prevent them from issuing such debt but rather to time such issuances so that they do not conflict with the department of the treasurys own debt issuances in other words the department of the treasury has traditionally acted as traffic cop with regard to fannie and freddie debt issuances as part of an overall effort to c oordinate the federal governments debt issuances as mentioned above however reports have circulated that the treasury department may seek to exercise its approval authority to regulate the amount of debt that fanni and freddie can issue7 analysis the supreme court held in chevron inc v natural resources defense council8 that courts should defer to reasonable agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency is charged with administering later cases have clarified the scope of chevron for example the chevron deference is available onl to interpretations of an agency to which congress has delegated the au thority to make rules carrying the force of law9 generally then chevron deference is warranted for agency interpretations after formal adjudication or noticeandcomment rulemaking10 actions pursuant to less formal interpretations are entitled to respect under an earlier case skidmore v swift co11 because it is not clear how or even if the treasury department will issue an interpretation we will analyze the strength of the treasury departments reported proposed interpretation under both chevron and skidmorehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21896crs3 12 see eg state v duckett 130 340 sc 1925 approval implies knowledge and exercise of discretion after

1983chevron deference chevron analysis requires twostep inquiry first the court must ask if the statute is ambiguous if not then the court simply rules according to the clear meaning of the st atute however if the stat ute is ambiguous the court must determine whether the agencys interpretation is reasonable if the interpretation is reasonable the court must then defer to that interpretation here it would seem that the analysis would end after the first prong th statute is not ambiguous it vests approval authority in the secretary of the treasury the language in both statutes clearly gives the treasury secretary approval aut hority over fannies and freddi debt issuances there appears to be nothing in the statutory langua ge to suggest that this approval authority is limited to the traffic cop role through which the secretary has traditionally exercised this power the statutory language in both fannie maes and freddie macs charters conditions the issuance of debt obligations upon the approval of the secretary of the treasury the power to approve seems clearly to imply the concomitant power to disapprove 12 indeed the power to approve would be power at all if an agency did not have the ability to withhold that approval there is one notable supreme court case where the court faced with clear statutory language used superceding congressional and agency action to find ambiguity under the first chevron prong in fda v brown williamson tobacco corp 13 the fda had interpreted its statutory mandate to regulate drugs and devices to give the agency the power to regulate tobacco the supreme court however looked at the fdas long history of disclaiming authority over tobacco nd the fact that congress had legislatively addressed tobacco regulation parately six times to find congressional intent contrary to the agencys proposed interpretation14 there appears to be such history here which would force reviewing court to look beyond th language of the statute congress has passed legislation evincing different congressional intent from what the language indicates further congress has not created separate regulatory scheme for the regulation of fannies and fr eddies debt issuances moreover unlike the fda in brown williamson the treasury department has never disclaimed or receded fro m its authority to regulate in this area although the department has not ge nerally exercised this authority to stop fannie and freddie from issuing debt the statutory authority to do so remains given that the treasury department has this authority there appears to be nothi ng to prevent the department from exercising it in different way as the supreme court has held agencies must be allowed to adapt their rules and policies to the mands of changing circumstances15 although it seems doubtful that court using the chevron analysis would even get to the second prong of that analysis the treasury departme nts reported proposed exercise of authority would very likely be legal under chevron s second prong under this highly deferential prong court must accept an agencys interpretation so long as thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21896crs4 16 323 us at 140 17 see jim rossi

f2d 1020 9th cir 1988interpretation is reasonable whether or not the court agrees with it for the same reasons discussed above it appears di fficult to imagine bases upon wh ich court would find the treasury departments reporte d proposed interpretation here to be unreasonable if congress had wanted to limit the treasury departments approval authority congress could have done so because congress chose instead to use broad language in describing treasurys authority it follows that broad in terpretation of that authority would likely be judged to be reasonable skidmore deference although chevron requires court to defer to an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute so long as the interpretation is reasonable an agency interpretation under skidmore is merely guidance the weight of the agencys interpretation depends upon va riety of contextual factor s including the thoroughness evident in the agencys consideration of th interpretation the validity of its reasoning its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements and ll those factors which give it power to persuade if l acking power to control16 in essence under the skidmore analysis the court will determine the statute s meaning merely taking into account the agencys interpretation as one tool among th many statutory interpretation tools used by courts unless the agency can convince the court that the agency has some special body of knowledge warranting greater deference 17 one of the most basic premises of stat utory construction is that the statutory language itself should be the initial touchsto ne for analysis the supreme court has consistently stated that the meaning of the statute must in the first instance be sought in the language in which the act is framed and if that is plain the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms18 as mentioned above the statutory language at issue here unambiguously grants approval power to the secretary of the treasury without any qualifying language limiting the exercise of this power in any way further as the supreme cour t has stated legislative history is irrelevant to the interpretation of an unambiguous statute19 although the general rule is that extrinsic aids such as legislative history are only to be used when statute is unc lear and ambiguous there appear s to be rule that forbids court from examining legislative history of clear language20 courts have on occasion allowed the admission of legislative history to interpret unambiguous statutes if that history clearly expresses legislative intent contrary to the language21 it is important then to examine the legislative history and see if it points strongly against the interpretation that the language appears to commandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21896crs5 22 act of june 27 1934 ch 847 title iii 304 23 pl 83560 201 24 broad interpretation of this authority would also be consistent with the significant role assigned by congress in the 1954 legislation to th secretary of the treasury in ensuring the success of fannie maes transition to mixed entity see eg conf rep 2271 83rd cong 2d sess 1954 reprinted in

hrept 10154 iii 1989 reprinted in 1989 usccan 86 386fannie mae has been authorized to issue obligations since 193422 however it was not until 1954 when congress rechartered fannie mae as mixed government and private sector entity that congress inserted into fannie maes charter the aforementioned language conditioning the issuance of debt ob ligations on the secretary of the treasurys approval23 although the legislative history is s ilent as to why the secretary of the treasury was given this authority or how congress expected him to use it the clear language suggests that the power is broad one24 the statutory language indicat broad authority vested in the secretary of the treasury to regulate fannie maes debt issu ances however the secretary has generally used this power not to disapprove of proposed issuances but rather to coordinate these issuances so as not to conflict with the treasury departments debt issuances25 one house committee had this in mind in 1989 when congress gave freddie mac powers similar to those held by fannie mae to issue debt26 although the house report that accompanied that legislation stated that one of the overarching purposes of the statute was to give freddie mac powers and authority parallel to those enjoyed by fannie mae27 part iii of the house report sub mitted by the committee on banking housing and urban affairs also offered very different picture of how the committee expected the secretary of the treasury to exerci the approval authority the title also grants the secretary of the treasury certain approval authorities over freddie macs issuance of unsecured bt obligations and mortgagerelated securities treasury already possesses such powers over fannie mae the committee intends that the treasury shall use these powers solely to ensure that freddie macs financing activities are conducted in way that promotes freddie macs statutory purpose in fulfilling this responsibility and as is the case with fannie mae the committee expects that tr easury will function largely as traffic cop to assure that securities issued or guaranteed by freddie mac are marketed in an orderly way in appropriate coordination with the financing activities of the treasury and other governmentsponsored enterprises gses28 emphasis added at first glance it appears possible that congress had different intent in mind when it granted this approval authority to the secr etary of the treasury put simply although the statutory language concerning the treasur secretarys authority here is clear one could argue that congresss understanding of that authority may have changed between the time that it was granted over fannie mae and when it was granted to freddie machttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21896crs6 29 see tva v

workers v national labor relations board 814 f 2d 697 712 dc cir 1987because of the way that the department of the treasury had traditionally chosen to exercise this authority for variety of reasons however the abovequoted report language from 1989 would not likely be enough to convince cour t that the secretary of the treasurys power is limited here first and foremost the language represents the opinion of one committee not the entire congress the supreme court has made it clear that committees direction cannot be quated with statute passed by congress29 under the constitution federal statutes must pass both houses of cong ress and be signed by the president to have legal effect as the supreme court has stat ed unenacted approvals beliefs and desires are not laws30 this is not to suggest that committee reports are not important interpretive tools on the contrary these reports are am ong courts favorite sour ces of interpretation such sources however cannot be divorced fro m the statutory language courts have authority to enforce principle gleaned solely from legislative history that has statutory reference point31 in this case congress could have chosen to enact language explicitly limiting the treasury secretarys authority to the traffic cop function described above congress c hose not to do so however even if the report language were to be given greater weight however the language itself does not evince an intent completely to constrain the treasury secretarys authority the language describes an expectation that concerning securities and debt issuances the department w ould function largely as traffic cop th is use of the word largely as opposed to only suggests that there are other unenumerated ways in which treasury could exercise that authority consequently the legislative history doe s not provide clear congressional intent that courts should depart from the clear st atutory language in addition to the clear language as mentioned above reviewing court using the skidmore analysis would give weight to the treasury departments opini on that the treasury secretary possesses the power to regulate debt issuances by fannie and freddie the likely final result under the skidmore analysis then appears to be the same as that under chevron deference
