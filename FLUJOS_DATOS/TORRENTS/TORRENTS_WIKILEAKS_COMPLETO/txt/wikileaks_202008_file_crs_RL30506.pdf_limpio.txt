issues the conference agreement does not include language on national monuments which had been one of the most controversial issues in interior funding after series of floor amendments the initial housepassed bill ultimately would have allowed agencies to use funds in the bill for planning and managi ng national monuments created by the president since 1999 under the antiquities act of 1906 however the language was not clear as to whether it 1 allowed funds to be used for planning and management of the lands generally and as national monuments or 2 only with respect to planning and management generally but not as national monuments the senatepas sed bill did not contain language on national monuments generally the senate narrowly defeated an amendment 4950 designed to prohibit the president from using his authority to create or expand national monuments after july 17 2000 notwithstanding other provisions of law the amendment would have allowed monuments to be created or expanded only by an act of congress proponents of the amendment decried presidenti creation of monuments without congressional and public input opponents countered that presidents since 1906 have enjoyed the autho rity to create monuments and that adoption of the amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs7 would provoke veto of the bill for more on national monuments generally see crs report rl30528 national monuments and the antiquities act section 332 of the conference agreement limits funds in the bill from being used to issue record of decision implementing the interior columbia basin ecosystem management project icbemp until the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of the interior submit particular report to congress icbemp would amend several dozen blm and forest service land use plans in the northwest the required report is to evaluate the effect on the area of the wildfires in 2000 and the presidents initiative for managing the impact of wildfires on communities and the environment this conference language is modification of controversial housepassed provisions which were not entirely clear taken together they appear to have limited the use of funds in the bill for issuing record of decision or policy implementing icbemp unless evaluations of the effects on small businesses were completed for more information on the national monument and icbemp provisions see crs report rs20625 provisions on national monuments and the interior columbi basin ecosystem management project in the fy2001 department of the interior appropriations bill section 116 of the conference agreement contains the senatepassed version of provision on grazing permits and leases that expire or are transferred the language would automatically renew grazing permits and leases issued under 43 usc 1752 and certain provisions of the california desert protection act that expire or are transferred during fy2001 until the permit renewal process is completed under applicable laws and regulations including any necessary environmental analyses the terms and conditions in the expiring permit or lease would continue in effect under the new permit or lease until the secretary of the interior completes the renewal process senate floor amendment to strike this section was defeated 3862 the initial housepassed bill contained similar provision which would have permitted the renewal of such permits and leases but did not automatically extend them also the measure stated that terms and conditions in expiring permits and leases may continue in effect until the renewal process is completed the provision could be interpreted as allowing the secretary to change the terms and conditions of permits and leases that are renewed pending the completion of the renewal process these renewal provisions were advocated as necessary to address heavy agency workload in processing the grazing permits and leases that were up for renewal some members argued that delays in processing renewals threatened ranchers bank loans opponents including the administration argued that there was longer backlog of permits and leases needing renewal and feared that blm could continue permits with possibly detrimental terms or conditions in july 10 2000 statement of administration policy on the senatepassed bill the administration cited the grazing language as among the damagin g and objectionable provisions which would lead the presidents advisers to recommend that the president veto the bill section 311 of the conference agreement would retain the moratorium contained in previous appropriation laws on accepting and processing applications for patents for mining and mill site claims on federal lands however applications meeting certain requirements that were filed on

the surface management part of hardrock mining regulations except to make changes that are consistent with the recommendations of the national research council nrc and with law the provision added in conference is intended to clarify congressional intent regarding 357 of the fy2000 interior appropriations law pl 106113 pertaining to hardrock mining regulations the solicitor of the department of the interior had interpreted the fy2000 language as allowi ng the blm regulations to address subjects other than those included in the specific recommendations of the nrc provided the nrc recommendations were not directly contradicted the joint explanatory statement states that the committee does not agree with the solicitors opinion implying that the secretary is limited to publishing

over fy2000 congress continued strict limit set in law not report language on funding for the listing function which is 64 million in the fy2001 conference agreement the language limits the discretion of the agency to transfer funds for additional listings eg if lawsuits mandate agency action on listing certain species delisting and downlisting are not covered by the cap inclusion of this language in the law means that court order to carry forward listing decision on particular species makes listing zero sum game at least at fiscal level it causes the listing of some species or designation of

payments to local governments in recognition of reduction of the local tax base due to the presence of federal land the fy2000 law provided 1074 million the conference agreement approved 114 million the payment levels have been controversial since the small additions of land to the national wildlife refuge system over the last several years mean that dollars already reduced by inflation must be spread still further the situation has produced calls for congress to increase the appropriation especially since local governments often incorrectly view the payments as entitlements even though they are actually subject to annual appropriations payments under pilt see blm above benefit some counties with land in the national wildlife refuge system however those lands that are acquired rather than reserved from the public domain are not eligible for pilt payments western refuge lands are primarily reserved from the public domain eastern refuges are primarily acquired lands land acquisition for

service nps currently manages the 379 separate and very diverse units that compri the national park system including 56 full or actual national parks widely considered the premier units of the system in addition to the national parks the park system includes other unit designations such as national preserves recreation areas reserves monuments battlefields historic sites seashores and number of other categories the systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs11 has grown to more than 83 million acres in 49 states and the district of columbia and several us territories in recent years park recreation visits annually have totaled nearly 290 million the services mission adopted with its establishment in 1916 provides for the continued protection and preservation of the national parks for the benefit of and enjoyment by the public in perpetuity the nps mission of facilitating use and serving park system visitors while protecting and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to it is inherently contradictory protecting the parks for and from the people and constantly challenging to its professional staff according to the administration and park advocacy groups the park service has operated with tight budgets over recent decades during this period congress restricted appropriations to operate and maintain the park system while expanding management responsibilities and continuing to add new units to the system it was asserted that restricted funding combined with increased visitation stretched personnel impaired operations and generated multibillion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance however spending for the nps now enjoys significantly higher priority temporary closure of nps units part of federal governmentwide shutdown during the budget debates of late 1995 and early 1996 helped galvanize public support for expanding nps funding congress heeded the expressed desire of the public to more adequately care for the national parks system and funding has increased annually since fy1996 once again the administration requested substantial increases in spending for park service managed programs in its fy2001 budget request the administrations fy2001 request for the nps was 204 billion to operate and protect parks and preserve their natural and cultural historic resources the request was 2384 million above the 18 billion fy2000 enacted level the house passed bill proposed total fy2001 appropriation for the nps of 181 billion 234 million less than the administrations request or 46 million more than fy2000 enacted the senatepassed bill also proposed 181 billion up 87 million from fy2000 enacted and 230 million below the budget request the final conference agreement provided 194 billion in total nps spending or 134 million above fy2000 enacted the conference agreement states that through combination of appropriated funds recreational fee demonstration project revenues partnerships and other sources the national park system has unprecedented levels of funding available to it to address critical resource protection and visitor service requirements and congressional overseers have pointedly advised the nps of the importance of applying prudent and sound financial management practices in the care and operation of park systems lcpii the conferees provided the park service with substantial additional money through large new conservation program title viii added to hr 4578 the fy2001 interior appropriations bill the new title known as the land conservation preservation and infrastru cture improvement program lcpii among other things provided an extra 50 million for nps maintenance 20 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs12 additional for uparr see below as well as stilltobedetermined portion of 229 million in federal land acquisition money park operations are by far the largest component of the fy2001 budget request at 138 billion accounting for nearly threefourth of the total nps request it covers resource protection visitor services and major park programs the 254 million proposed increase emphasized park operating needs and resource management this increase included 24 million to address specific needs at 77 park system units these funds would be directed to parks experiencing severe threats to natural and cultural resources with new responsibilities and with high priority facility operation and maintenance needs the house agreed with the administrations request with respect to specific needs however the senatepassed bill proposed an increase above base operations of 255 million or 15 million more than the budget request both the house and senatepassed bills proposed 2 million for high priority projects within the nps operations budget to be carried out by the youth conservation corps the housepassed bill proposed 143 billion for nps operations 138 million more than for fy2000 enacted or 48 million more than the administrations request the senatepassed bill proposed total of 137 billion for nps operations 80 million more than fy2000 enacted and 103 million below the budget request the conference agreement provided 139 billion for nps operations or 254 million above fy2000 enacted under the nps operations line item the conference agreement provided 4697 million for maintenance instead of 4466 million as proposed by the house and 4492 million as proposed by the senate an fy2001 request of 486 million proposed for national recreation and preservation one of the services major appropriation line items would fund expanded support of parks and greater partnership opportunities through added regional office support and added assistance to partner organizations because the administration request would have added 18 million additional for urban park and recreation recovery grants see below the total for this line was distorted showing 152 million increase in fy2000 uparr got 2 million the hous epassed bill proposed 48 million for national recreation and preservation the senatepassed bill proposed 612 million for this line item the conference agreement provided 584 million for this line or 696 million above fy2000 enacted and breaks out uparr as separate account see below the nps land acquisition and state assistance appropriation request was 2975 million 1767 million major increase in the interior departments land legacy initiative which is now in its second year the fy2000 appropriation for this line item was 121 million acquisition funds are slated for protection of landscapes and resources at the mojave national

336 million below the fy2000 enactedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs13 level the conference agreement provides 1105 million for land acquisition and state assistance or 101 million less than fy2000 enacted however the nps will receive portion of the new 229 million lcpii money to be divided among interior agencies the budget request seeks 18 million for the natural resources challenge an nps program that emphasizes protection of natural resources often in competition with visitation rights the 18 million would constitute the second year of fiveyear program to provide 100 million to identify and contain environmental hazards the program is also designed to give the park service better fix on offhighway vehicle use overflights and personal watercra ft so as to argue more persuasively for reduction in those activities in fy2000 the administration requested 1976 million for the program and congress approved 1474 million an amendment to the senate commi tteeapproved bill to block the national park service decision to enforce existing regulations that would substantially limit snowmobile use in national parks was withdrawn from floor consideration during conference language was also offered to delay nps enforcement of snowmobile limits this item was immediately withdrawn because of veto probability maintenance backlog the park system has formidable maintenance burden with an infrastruct ure that includes thousands of miles of roads and thousands of permanent structures many of these historic bridges tunnels employee housing units water and waste systems etc it is argued that park assets should all be maintained at an operational level that ensures continued serviceability and use by the public the nps has valued its assets at over 35 billion but without adequate care and maintenance they are subje ct to deterioration mounting concerns about the buildup of multibillion dollar backlog of unmet maintenance needs in the first half of the last decade prompted congress to seek new funding sources and to attack the maintenance backlog in response to congressional appropriation leaders the fy2000 budget propos highlighted an interior departmentwide campaign to prioritize maintenance over five year period proposed funding for construction and major maintenance programs for fy2001 was 180 million with an emphasis on projects that address the most critical health and safety needs of parks key goal of the interior departments safe visits to public lands program the proposed funding represents 462 million decrease compared to fy2000 this decrease is in area that has received special priority in recent years however there was more than 450 million for maintenance in the operations component of the nps request and the anticipation of revenues of approximately 148 million in fy2001 from the congressionally authorized recreational fee demonstration program see below which is to be used to reduce the agencys backlog of health and safety deficiencies as well as resource protection and programs in existing park facilities in addition the congress has historically increased construction appropriations as member projects have been added near the end of the appropriations process in hearings before the house subcommittee on appropriations for the department of interior and related agencies march 29 2000 members warned the national park service director not to lowball maintenance needs requests with the expectation that feedemo revenues will make up the shortfall the members reiterated their desire that feedemo monies be used to supplement not replace appropriated maintenance monies so that major reductions in the backlog could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs14 accomplished also at issue is the size of the current nps maintenance backlog park service officials agreed to provide the subcommittee with an updated estimate within two weeks of the hearing the park service subsequently provided the subcommittee with current nps maintenance backlog figure of 43 billion the conference agreement requires the nps to report by april 2001 on how and when it will provide parkbypark comprehensive listing with cost estimates of deferred maintenance affecting all facilities in the nps the housepassed bill proposed 141 million for construction and major maintenance 39 million less than the administrations 180

fy2000 enacted as expected the conference agreement greatly expanded the nps construction account as member earmarks were added the agreement provided 2422 million or 209 million above fy2000 enacted of local interest 22 million to rehabilitate glen echo md park facilities was provided recreatio nal fee demonstration program feedemo the nps coordinated feedemo program being tested by the nps and three other federal land management agencies began in fy1996 to allow higher entrance and recreation user fees with most of the added fees being retained by the unit wher the money is collected eg 80 of feedemo goes back to the collecting unit and 20 goes to the agency previously all park fee revenue went to the treasury department general fund under the existing program each agency is allowed to test up to 100 fee projects each year it was hoped that the additional fees would be incentives to agency managers to be more aggressive in pursuing selffinancing for operating and maintaining their units the program participants in addition to the park service include blm fws and the forest service supporters of federal system of recreation lakes would also like the corps of engineers and the bureau of reclamation included the interior department agencies and the forest service combined collected 88 million in fees in fy1996 which are projected to increase to 18565 million in fy2001 in fy2001 the park service is projected to bring in the most fee money by far 1484 million the administration again the same request was made the last two years asked congress to make the feedemo program permanent for the four federal land management agencies the program is authorized through fy2002 and the administration wanted to lock it in place this year however the conference managers once again decided to defer action on feedemo until perceived problems in the program could be fixed but did extend the program for one additional year in related development interest groups are reportedly circulating draft legislation that would extend fee demo through september 30 2004 while substantially altering and expanding the program urban park and recreation recovery uparr this costsharing park

of major line item national recreation and preservation instead of as previously as freestanding program the conference agreed to 2 million for uparr as part of this larger park service appropriation line item and this amount was included in the final conference package the fy2001 request of 20 million for uparr also under the national recreation and preservation line item represented significant

contentious debate ensued over when to implement the new oil valuation rule the senate appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs23 committee approved an amendment by senator domenici rnm to further postpone the release of the oil valuation rule until june 30 2001 senator hutchison rtx offered floor amendment to extend the moratorium on the rules release through fy2000 filibuster by senator boxer dca to prevent the moratorium amendment on the rules release stalled the interior appropriation bill until second cloture vote 6039 limited debate on the amendment the senate voted 5147 to extend the moratorium conference negotiators sustained the moratorium but only for not more than six months pending general accounting office review and report to congress on the proposed oil valuation rule the president threatened to veto the interior bill because of the rules moratorium among other issues however negotiators settled on implementing the new oil valuation rule on march 15

bids offered in wyoming and is expected to take several years to complete the house supported the committee amendment that would allow the mms to use portion of its revenues to administer the rik pilot program now underway however floor amendment limited the use of mms revenues to pay for transportation to wholesale market centers and for processing rather than the committee recommen dation to pay for gathering and any contractor costs as well this would allow mms to receive greater value for its rik product at the market center on separate issue legislation was enacted pl 104185 in the

debated in some depth but was extended in several areas the extension was continued through fy1999 it was supported by the house and the senate for fy2000 and was continued in the fy2000 appropriations law in the fy2001 spending bill the moratoria is supported by the house and the senate in previous appropriations since the early 1980s the moratoria had been approved annually without

interior appropriations bill the senate added and the conference committee retained sense ofthesenate provision urging the secretary of the interior to work with the office of management and budget to secure repayment to the fund from agencies other than the bia and ihs to allow the bia and tribes to address the contract support costs problem and to allow gao to study the issue congress imposed oneyear moratorium on self determination contracts and selfgovernance compacts for fy199 9 the gaos report offered four alternative methods for funding contract support costs and recommended that bia

gaorced99150 congress dropped the moratorium on contracts and compacts for fy2000 the house restored the morat orium for fy2001 but the senate and the conference committee again dropped the moratorium reorganization the bia has been under pressure from tribes the administration and congress to reorganize but proposals from the three sources have not always been in agreement under the clinton administrations national performance review reinventing governm ent initiative the bia had planned to pursue restructuring and downsizing through the tribal shares process in which tribes and the bia determine first which bia functions are inherently federal and which are available for tribal management and second what each tribes share of funds is for the latter functions but the bia has indicated that the interior solicitor has advised against such procedure congress through appropriations committee reports pressed the bia to develop reorganization and consolid ation plans in respons the bia has reduced the number of both its agencies and employees congress also approved the bias commissio ning of 1999 study of bia administration and management by the national academy of public administration napa entitled study of management and administration the bureau of indian affairs the study concluded that the assistant secretaryindian affairs lacked necessary staff support and that the bia needed improvements in planning budgeting human resources management and information resource management for fy2000 congress directed the secretary of the interior to reorganize the bia based on the napa recommendations and provided 52 million for this purpose for fy2001 the administration requested 92 million for continued implementation of the napa recommendations the house agreed to this sum as did the senate and the conference committee funding distribution the issue of the equitable distribution of bia fundingoften referred to as meanstestinghas two aspects one relating to how funds are distributed the other relating to whether tribes other financial resources are taken into account first much if not most bia funding even while serving tribal needs is not required to be distributed on national per capita or other formula basis second tribes own nonbia resources especially business revenues are not always required to be taken into account 1998 gao study of tpa distribution found that twothirds of fy1998 tpa funds were distributed based on historical levels and one third was distributed based on formulas that tpa distribution per capita variedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs28 widely across bia areas and that tribal governments reporting of their revenues were inconsistent in including or excluding nonfederal revenues supporters of tpa funding redistribution based on meanstesting of tribes claim that bia funding is inequitably distributed that poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding that tribal tpa funds received per capita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need that only 30 percent of tpa funding is based on formulas and that some rich tribes got more tpa funds in fy1998 than tribes with outside revenues opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty that bia funding is insufficien t to meet tribal needs and that meanstesting tpa funding would penalize tribes who still have severe needs would violate the federal trust responsibility to tribes and would be unfair since it is not required of state or local governments receiving federal assistance congress debated several proposals for reallocating tpa funding during its consideration of the fy1998fy2001 appropriation bills for fy1998fy1999 congress authorized tribalfederal workgroup on tpa allocations and tribal needs assessment required that each tribe receive certain minimum amount of funding and directed the bia to develop tpa reallocation proposals the biatribal workgroups report in july 1999 concluded that variation in tribes circumstances made formula distribution problematic that tpa fundin g resulted from history geography and policies that current funding did not meet identified needs and that measures of tribal need and revenue were not fully available the workgroup recommended that base tpa funding should not be redistributed for fy2000 congress authorized but did not direct the secretary of the interior to redistribute tpa funds to alleviate tribal funding inequitieswithout reducing any tribes tpa share more than 10 except in certain situationsand directed the bia to distribute funds to its two postsecondary instit utions based on formula the house retained these provisions for fy2001 while the senate kept only the postsecondary education provision the conference committee retained both of these provisions in addition the senate approved new provision prohibiting alaska native tribes with fewer than 25 members from receiving tpa funds in fy2001 the funds would be transferred to each tribes regional native nonprofit corporation the conference committee also approved this provision trust asset management the bia has historically mismanaged indian trust funds and

funds for indian country would flow through both the bia and the department of justice the funds would provide additional law officers police facilities and equipment and jails and detention centers

dilapidated with health and safety deficiencies the bia estimates the backlog in education facility repairs is 802 million education construction funding was historically low and congress had not accepted various proposal s for alternate funding mechanisms for fy2000 the administration proposed and congress funded 74 increase in education facility construction before internal transfers for fy2001 the administration also proposes another large increase in education construction funding within the fy2001 bia education construction budget is proposed school construction bond initiative where 30 million of the proposed appropriations would help tribes participate in the presi dents school construction modernization initiative under this initiative tribal bonds can be issued to help meet the large backlog in school construction the house appropriations committee recommended funding for the school bonding initiative until enactment of tax credit provisions needed to give tribes the authority to issue such bonds the senate appropriations committee did not discuss the tribal bonding initiative but the senate more than doubled bia educatio n construction funding and the conference committee recommended an even higher figure the conference committee also recommended funding of 7 million for new tribal school construction demonstration project under which tribe and the bia would pay 50 of the cost of replacing the tribes triballycontrolled school other issues number of additional indian issues have arisen in congressional consideration of recent interior appropriations bills and may be proposed this year among the major issues have been state taxation of retail sales in indian country to nonmembers tribal sovereign immunity from suit and regulations regarding state tribal gaming compacts congress has in past years defeated proposals to restrict the taking of land into trust for indian tribes unless the tribe agreed to state taxes and to waive tribal sovereign immunity if the tribe accepted tpa funds controversial indian gaming regulations propos ed by the secretary in 1998 for considering and approving gaming compacts where states had invoked immunity from tribal suit over compact negotiations were delayed by congress until the second half of fy1999 when the regulations were then promulgated in april 1999 they were immediately challenged in court by several states congress considered prohibiting fy2000 funds to implement the regulations but dropped the provision when the interior secretary assured congress that he would not implement the regulations until federal courts ruled on their legality for fy2001the house defeated proposed amendment that would have prohibited implementation of the regulations until final adjudication of their legality but the senate approved prohibition on funding for publication ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs30 procedures necessary to implement the regulations the conference

onethird of the federal assistance provided to insular areas the amount appropriated for fy2000 905 million exceeded the amount provided in recent years roughly 88 million each year and the 886 million requested by the administration the discretionary and current mandatory funding request for fy2001 is 944 million an increase of 39 million or 44 the house approved an amount 902 million slightly below the fy2000 appropriation and 45 below the request the senate approved total of 89 million conferees agreed to the house funding levels but added funds for technical assistance resulting in total discretionary funding of 962 million for fy2001 this represents an increase of 57 million 63 increase over fy2000 funding select ed issues perhaps the most significant issue of debate concerns the amount to be allocated to mitigate the effects of immigration from the three freely associated states referred to as compact impact the term compact impact has been used to descri be the burdens incurred by guam and other islands including hawaii as noncitizens notably from the fsm relocate in search of job opportunities due to the lack of basic industry and substantial economic development advocates contend that guam and other islands need assistance to provide social services associated with the population influx legislation enacted in 1996 see 48 usc 1804c1 reallocates 46 million each year fy1996fy2001 from the cnmi to guam for compact impact needs such as hospital constru ction education and social services the fy2001 request includes an additional 54 million in compact impact money for guam for fy2000 congress appropriated an additional 3 million in technical assistance grants for guam for this purpose doi news release on the fy2001 budget request notes that the 54 million increase is major priority of the clinton administration the house and the senate appropriations committee have rejected the 54 million increase contending that funding levels for compact impa ct aid should be decided in the ongoing compact renegotiations instead of targeting impact aid to guam the house approved an appropriation of 76 million for technical assistance grants that will implement financial and government reforms in the territorie s the same amount requested by the administration and an increase of 1 million over the fy1999 funding level the senate committee recommended 66 million for technical assistance grants the deteriorating financial condition of the insular governments has been identified as matter of great concern in the fy2001 budget request all these entities remain dependent on federal assistance despite past economic development initia tives for example the governor of the us virgin islands signed memorandum of understanding with the secretary of the interi or in october 1999 that established financial controls and performance standards to be achieved the fy2001 budget request includes an advance appropriatio n of 10 million for the virgin islands which would become available in fy2002 should the standards be met in fy2001 the virgin islands would be expected to provide 50 match also of note pursuant to the fy2000

agency proposed to shift from benefitting function allocations where project funds can be allocated to several line items to primary purpose allocations where funds are allocated to the one primary purpose of the project also general administration would be eliminated with the costs allocated across all other budget line items the house senate and conference agreed to these proposed changes finally the agency proposed collapsing the 20 budget line items for the national forest system into 3 lines ecosystem assessment and planning ecosystem conservation and public services and uses and the 6 budget line items for reconstruction and maintenance into 3 lines eliminating the distinction between maintenance and constructionreconstruction the house and senate committees and the conference agreed to modify the budget structure by reducing the national forest system to 10 line items by combining rangeland and forest vegetation management with watershed management and water soil and air operations under vegetation and watershed management and by renaming reconstruction and construction as capital improvements and maintenance the agencys budget request also included many performance measures to attempt to inform congress on what is being purchased with the appropriations the house and senate committee reports note concerns that the agency still lacks strong and

the proposed fy2001 sale levels 3178 bbf in total are above the fy1999 results 2300 bbf in total the house and senate reports direct continuing the fy2000 sales level and the both committee reports note that the committees are discouraged by the agencys failure to meet congressional timber sale targets on the house floor the wu amendment to transfer 147 million from forest products to fish and wildlife management was defeated in the senate the bryanfitzgerald amendment to reduce timber sale funds by 30 million and increase wildland fire management by 15 million was similarly defeated the senate and conference included 5 million in addition to its normal allocation for preparing timber sales in the national forests in alaska forest health and forest fires one foresthealth related provision has been included in recent appropriations acts including the fy2001 act the 10 roads and trails fund has been altered annually to allow its use to improve forest health conditions and repair or reconstruct roads bridges and trails emphasizing the wildlandurban interface and areas with abnormally high risk from potential wildfires on the senate floor members debated whether increasing timber sales could improve forest health or would lead to further deterioration however actions on timber sales ensued from the debate following from the cerro grande fire an escaped prescribed fire that destroyed more than 200 homes in alamos nm the house adopted provision prohibiting further use of prescribed burning until the agencies implement all provisions of the 1995 federal wildland fire policy the senate took different approach senator domenici offered substitute for senator craigs amendment requiring review of the administrations proposed roadless area conservation rule see below the domenici substitute was passed by voice vote as title iv providing 120 million to the forest service and 1203 million to the blm to reduce hazardous fuels in the urban wildland interface area and requiring 1 the agencies to report on urban wildland interface communities and projects and 2 the forest service to publish its cohesive strategy for protecting people and sustaining resources in fireadapted ecosystems and explain how various existing plans and initiatives are consistent with or differ from this strategy on september 8 2000 following senate passage of title iv the administration proposed new program in managing the impact of wildfires on communities and the environment report to the president in response to the wildfires the proposal was to add 16 billion to the fy2001 request for wildfire operations 770 million for fuels treatment and burned area restoration 390 million for fire preparedness340 million and for programs to assist local communities 88 million the proposal applied to blm lands as well as to forest service lands as noted above the conference increased the funding under titles ii and iv and added provision to title iv directing expedited nepa review procedures and endangered species act consultations for hazardous fuel reduction and burned area treatmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs37 land management plan ning management of the federal lands has been controversial for decades increasing conflicts among users in the 1960s and early 1970s led congress to enact the national forest management act of 1976 nfma and the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma to establish and guide land and resource management planning for the national forests and blm lands despite the goals of these laws the public participatory planning processes have not led to harmonious land management bills to improve planning some emphasizing forest health have been introduced in both houses in several congresses but none have been enacted the house and senate bills directed the forest service to continue management under existing plans with numerous exceptions and not revise those plans until new final or interim final rules are issued but the provision was deleted by the conference in addition the bill as reported in the house would have prevented the forest service and blm from completing the interior columbia basin ecosystem management plan icbemp an amendment to provide funding was initially accepted but later overturned for more see the above discussion under the blm the senate bill did not contain comparable icbemp language but would require regulatory flexibility analysis for the white river co national forest draft plan the conference modified this provision to require an analysis of the impacts of the fires and of the president s proposed response to the fires on the interior columbia area before issuing record of decision to implement icbemp on october 5 1999 the forest service proposed new planning regulations with greater emphasis on ecosystem management and protection of biological diversity the budget request descri bes this as part of the agencys program for sustainable forest ecosystem management the public comment period on these regulations is closed and the draft regulations are being revised forest roads road construction in the national forests continues to be controversial some interests oppose new roads because roads increase access to areas they believe should be preserved in pristine condition because roads are major source of erosion stream sedimentation and other environmental degradation and because road funding is asserted to be corporate subsidy for the timber industry supporters argue that access roads are needed for forest protection eg from wildfire and for timber harvesting and other onsite uses and maintain that roads can be built without causing significant environmental problems the change in the budget structure includes combining construction funds with maintenance funds so distinguishing money for road construction is longer feasible the administration proposed decrease of 2 million 1 for road funding the house increased this 449000 and the senate increased the house amount by nearly 10 million 5 the conference agreed to road funding of 236 million 17 million more 8 than the house and 7 million more 3 than the senate in separate initiative the administra tion announced on october 13 1999 new approach to managing roadless areas that may prohibit new roads in inventoried roadless areas and extend

legislation to create new trust fund healthy investments in rural environments hire from existing trust funds the new fund would emphasize reducing the backlog of maintenance identified at nearly 9 billion reconstruction and forest health projects while continuing to perform some of the tasks of the existing trust funds the proposal does not identify which trust funds would be affected the request also announces the intent to develop legislation for land acquisition reinvestment trust fund for land acquisition to be funded from expanded authority to sell national forest lands and for facilities acqu isition and enhancement fund for constructing new improvements and acquiring environmentally sensitive land to be funded from new authority to sell unneeded facilities buildings constructed features and land legislative proposals to enact these ideas have to date not been made available in addition the conference report hrept 106914 included new title vi to the bill the cabin user fee fairness act of 2000 this replaces narrow specific provisions enacted in previous interior appropriations acts the conference language 607 would keep the fee at 5 of the market value of the

ion pl 93531 as amended was the end result of dispute between the hopi and navajo tribes involving land originally set aside by the federal government for reservation in 1882 pursuant to the 1974 act lands were partitioned between the two tribes members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribes land were to be relocated onhir classifies families as relocated when they occupy their replacement home most relocatees are navajo large majority of the estimated 3477 navajo families formerly on the land partitioned to the hopi have already relocated under the act but the house appropriations committee estimates that 410 families almost all navajo have yet to complete relocation including about 71 navajo families still on hopi partitioned land some of whom refuse to relocate the remaining 339 families are not on hopi partitioned land but are in various stages of acquiring replacement housinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs45 negotiations had gone forward among the two tribes the navajo families on hopi partitioned land and the federal government especially regarding hopi tribe claims against the united states the united states and the hopi tribe reached proposed settlement agreement on dec 14 1995 attached to the settlement agreement was separate accommodation agreement between the hopi tribe and the navajo families which provided for 75year leases for navajo families on hopi partitioned land the navajohopi land dispute settlement act of 1996 pl 104 301 approved the settlement agreement between the united states and the hopi tribe not all issues have been resolved by these agreements however and opposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the navajo families navajo families with homesites on hopi partitioned land faced march 31 1997 deadline for signing the leases accommodation agreements according to onhir 70 of the 73 families on hopipartitioned land had signed accommodation agreements by the end of september 1999 the hopi tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against navajo families without leases like the fy1997fy2000 interior appropriations acts the fy2001 interior appropriations bill proposed by the president contained proviso forbidding onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home is provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating navajo families since onhir has large backlog of other families that need homes the settlement agreement approved by pl 104301 however allows the hopi tribe under certain circumstances to begin quietpossession actions against the united states after feb 1 2000 if navajo families on hopi partitioned land have not either relocated or entered into leases with the hopi tribe congress has in the past been concerned by the slow pace of relocation and by relocatees apparent low level of interest in moving to the new lands acquired for the navajo reservation for relocatee use appropriations committees have from time to time considered termination of the relocation program but committee reports have not discussed this option since fy1999 for fy2000 onhir received appropriations of 8 million for fy2001 the administration proposed 15 million an increase of 875 the house approved 8 million the same as fy2000 the senate and the conference committee approved 15 million the same as the administrations proposal other related agencies one of the pervasive issues for the programs and agencies delin eated below is whether federal government support for the arts and culture is an appropriate federal role and if it is what should be the shape of that supp ort if the continued federal role is not appropriate might the federal commitment be scaled back such that greater private support or state support would be encouraged each program has its own unique relationship to this overarching issue smit hsonian the smithsonian institution si is museum education and

year for construction of the national museum of the american indian nmai on the mall 8695 million was requested for the cultural resources center and for operations research and exhibition planning for the nmai museum on the mall initially the nmai was controversial opponents of the new museum argued that the current smithsonian museums needed renovation repair and maintenance of the collection with an estimated 141 million items more than the public needed another museum on the mall proponents argued however that there had been too long delay in providing museum in washington to house the indian collect ion private donations to the smithsonian and fundraising campaign focusing on individuals foundations and corporations totaled 367 million representing onethir d of the total cost and the amount required to meet the nonappropriated portion of project funding of this amount an estimated 15 million came from the indian community directly the final fy2000 interior appropriations

the physical plant in fact the report of the commission on the future of the smithsonian concluded that total of 50 million each year for the next decade would be necessary to assure that present facilities are restored to the point of being safe for people and collections and considering the national zoo separately it would need 10 million year for the next 5 years the fy2001 budget request

but has been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law since that time the 104th congress established the institute of museum and library services imls under pl 104208 among the questions congress has considered is whether funding for the arts humanities and museums is an appropriate federal role and respon sibility some opponents to arts support argue that nea and neh should be abolished altogether contending that the federal government should not be in the business of supporting arts and humanities other opponents argue that culture can and does flourish on its own through private support proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue that the federal government has long tradition of such support beginning as early as 1817 with congressional appropriations for works of art to adorn the us capitol some spokesmen for the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts some argue that abolishing nea and neh would curtail or eliminate the programs that have national significance and purpose such as touring theater and dance companie s radio and television shows traveling museum exhibitions etc the presidents committee on the arts released publication creative america that recommends that federal funding be restored for nea neh and imls to levels adequate to fulfill their nation roles the goal expressed was that appropriations should have equaled 200 per person by the year 2000 for all three agencies the administrations fy2001 budget proposed 150 million

vagueness principles congress enacted nea reform measures in the fy1998 interior appropriations act pl 10583 among them were increases in funding allocations from 35 to 40 to states for basic state arts grants and for grants to under served populations in addition language emphasizing arts education was included the legislation placed 15 cap on nea funds allocated to each state exempting only

issue the lands legacy initiative the clinton administration reintroduced its lands legacy as part of the fy2001 budget proposal this initiative would provide funding totaling 14 billion to 21 resource protection programs including the land and water conservation fund lwcf in the departments of the interior commerce and agriculture fy2000 funding for these programs was 727 million majority of the fy2001 request would be funded through interior appropriations legislation including the department of the interior portion 735 million and the department of agriculture portion all of which would support us forest service activities that are funded under title ii of the interior appropriations 236 million this initiative was initially announced on january 12 1999 and proposed in the fy2000 budget submission the administration had sought just over 1 billion for the component programs an increas of 571 million from the preceding year but congress provided 727 million for both fy2000 and fy2001 the administration did not suggest any legislative language to authorize new programs redirect existing programs or increase authorization ceilings for existing progra ms the fy2001 proposal adds 3 programs and deletes 3 programs when compared with the initial proposal numerous related bills to increase and provide more certain funding for wide range of resource protection activities have been introduced in both chambers in the house hr 701 often referred to as cara passed after two days of debate by vote of 315102 in the senate the committee on energy and natural resources completed action on substitute to hr 701 which combines parts of housepassed hr 701 with provisions in s 2181 introduced by senator bingaman on july 25 and reported the bill on september 14 2000 srept 106413 further action on these bills is widely reported to be highly unlikely during the 106th congress one component of this legislation addressed entirely in interior appropriations is to fully fund the land and water conservation fund lwcf at 900 million the lwcf is the principal source of federal land acquisition funding and provides grants to states in its fy2001 budget request the administration had sought total of 600 million for lwcf the house and the senate both approved smaller amounts for land acquisition for each of the four agenc ies than the president had requested the house and senate responses the administration requests and the levels provided by the conference committee were as follows 19 million and 11 million for blm instead of 61 million the conference committee provided 31 million 30 million and 46 million for fws instead of 112 million the conference committee provided 63 million 104 million and 87 million for nps including state grants instead of 297 million the conference committee provided 111 million andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs52 52 million and 76 million for fs instead of 130 million the conference committee provided 102 million other components of the lands legacy initiative which would fall under the jurisdiction of interior appropriations include 1 providing grants to states and localities to acquire land and plan for open space 2 expanding funding for other resource protection efforts on forest land and range land and in urban areas 3 funding land and resource restoration and 4 funding smart growth partnerships funding

programs the request for fy2001 is 150 millionbincludes 20 million for land acquisition which was not allocated to specific agencyc may not add up exactly due to rounding the conference committee added new title viii titled land conservation preservation and infrastructure improvement to fund the lands legacy proposal the new title would appropriate 16 billion for various programs in fy2001 it would also provid increasing funding growing to 24 billion in fy2006 of the fy2001 total 12 billion would be funded through the interior appropriations and the remainder would be funded through commerce appropriations all funding would be subject to the appropriations process each year none of the funding is mandatory the interior funding categories and totals would be 540 million for federal and state lwcf 300 million for state and other conservation programs 160 million for urban and historic preservation programs 150 million for public land maintenance and 50 million for the payment in lieu of taxes program three of these categories are also funded in other titles of the bill for example the lwcf would receive 311 million in title i for blm fws and nps and title ii for fs and 229 million under this title the final two categories maintenance funding and payment in lieu of taxes would be funded only under this title unlike the cara proposals none of the funding for this initiative is linked directly to federal revenues from offshore oil and gas developm ent the legislation uses what its proponents characteri ze as fencing structure to limit any efforts to shift funds among categories at the level of the first year 16 billion and also to set these funds apart from all other funds allocated for interior appropriations any appropriated amounts above this level in future years would not be subject to the fences also any funds not appropriated in one year could be appropriated in subsequent year httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30506crs54 prior to the conference committee the fy2001 lands legacy initiative proposal received little recogn ition or support from congress the house appropriations committee did not comment on it directly and provided less or funding for programs in it amendments referenced to any of the lands legacy proposals were adopted on the house floor the senate appropriations committee report included lengthy discussion of the initiative as in the house amendments referenced to any of the lands legacy proposals were adopted on the senate floor this process is similar to how congress responded to the initiative in fy2000 when both the house and senate appropriations committee generally opposed these proposals but when the interior appropriations bill became part of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 new title vi was added to interior appropriations to provide additional funding of 1975 million for lands legacy programs most but not all of these funds were dedicated for land acquisitions for
