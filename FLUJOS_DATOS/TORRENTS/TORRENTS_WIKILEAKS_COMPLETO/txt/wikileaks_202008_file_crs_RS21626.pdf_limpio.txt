history with 115 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves iraq has the worlds s econdlargest endowment of oil amounting to 11 of the global total only 17 of 80 il fields have been developed the most significant are kirkuk in the north and rumaila in the south there has been virtually exploration for many years suggesting that iraq may have much more oil than currently estimated iraq also has significant proven natural gas reserves virtually all are undeveloped as point of re ference saudi arabia at 260 billion barrels of proven oil reserves has the largest rese rve base and can produce as much as 105 million barrels per day mbd iraqs peak production was realized just be fore its invasion of kuwait in july 1990 output reached 35 mbd before exports were lted by an international boycott after the first gulf crisis oil producti on fell to about 500000 barrels per day an amount sufficient for domestic consumption with the star t of the oilforfood program under resolution 986 first implemented in decem ber 1996 oil exports increased althoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21626crs2 1 iraq country analysis brief aug 2003 p 4 2 iraq country analysis brief dec 2005 p 3 3 international

current situation production virt ually halted during th hostilities but began to recover after the fighting stopped duri ng 2005 stated output varied between 19 and 24 mbd exports were as high as 16 mbd but averaged considerably less as yearend difficulties reduced the flow to just over 10 mbd security issues periodically disrupted the flow of crude to the export terminal in the persian gulf and exports via turkey were virtually closed and remain so by rep eated attacks on the pipeline from kirkuk to ceyhan iraqi reserves were they more intens ively developed could easily support much greater production amounts three times greater than iraqs highest output rivaling saudi arabias production coul d potentially be achieved with the application of upto date geophysics and substantia l investment in field devel opment and infrastructure the department of energy doe estimates that the cost of bringing oil production on line in iraq is among the worlds lowest about 35 billion per mbd of output2 such potential productivity reiterated by doe in subsequent country reports suggests that iraq offers one of the worlds best longterm petroleum prospects with substantial output potentially flowing from relatively few highyield wells in contrast to mature oilproducing province such as the united states where 521000 wells produce about 58 mbd3 iraqi output comes from only 1600 wells potentially able to produce almost 3 mbd th comparison us wells average about 10 barrels per day while iraqi wells can aver age several thousand points up the prolific nature of iraqs hydrocarbonbearing ge ology and points toward easily realized production increases with the application of cu rrent reservoir management techniques the drilling of additional wells and infrastructure improvements recent production in iraq after the regime change production which virtually halted during the fighting bega n to increase deferred maintenance and damage to wells gathering facilities refineries and mainline transport facilities slowed the effort to restart production security issu and difficulties with electric power supply have proven to be hindran ces some oil about 200000 to 300000 barrels per day is being reinjected into wells because of local refining and transport constraints in the northern fields around kirkuk in some instances refineries were stripping gasoline and propane fractions from crude and reinjecting the leftove r petroleum among other considerations this unusual measure poses difficulty in determining how much net production is taking place there are several sources of data on ir aqs oil output and exports which are discussed below they show somewhat differing amounts suggesting some uncertainty about exactly how much is being produced nd how much is being sold internationally for cash earningshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21626crs3 4 iraq weekly status report mar 23 2005 see figure 4 p 18 5 countrybycountry breakdown of production platts oilgram

19 mbd during 2005 but platts oilgram news reported that output began to decline after reaching 22 mbd during october falling to 18 mbd in february 20055 platts currently estimates output at 185 mbd6 among other factors the declin in output reflects pipeline security issues in the kirkuk area northern iraq which have halted exports via turkey this crude would ordinarily be expor ted via the mediterranean port of ceyhan or used in local refineries pipeline in frastructure has been ffline since december 20047 with the exception of few very small shipments thus exports are limited to the output of southern oilfields around basra shippe d by way of ports on the arab gulf the platts article also cites challenging operational conditions at these facilities noting that iraqs southern loadings have ex perienced repeated delays because of rough weather conditions electricity outages and pipeline problems leading to buildup of vessels waiting to lift basra light the department of

million per month not including government subsidies that re sult in 10centpergallon pump price doe estimates that direct and indirect fuel subsidies cost iraq 8 billion per year with indication as to when this problem might be resolved9 despite iraqs costly efforts to s upply the civilian population through domestic refining and imports th department of state10 reports snapshot of the fuel supply situation in march 2006 showing shortfalls of some critical supplies and surpluses of others by late march an increased flow of imports resulted in targ et supply levels being reached for each of the four key fuels diesel kerosene gasoline and lpg while this is positive indication national stock levels targeted at 15 days of supply for each fuel to minimize shortfalls have not increased and remain well belo w the amounts called for11 with the exception of kerosene and diesel more than half the fuel consumed was imported long lines at gas stations are common co mpounded by subsidized prices prices at governmentowned stations are set at about 10 cents per gallon prices this low result in higher gasoline demand than would be seen were prices to be unregulated and the combination of politically unpopular long lines and low official prices results in thriving black market since much of this fuel is imported by the government the cost of subsidizing fuel prices may well be genuine outofpocket cost to the iraqi government northern oil exports iraqs oil fields lie in both the northern and southern part of the country the northern fiel ds are located in the kurdish populated part of the nation the iraqi national oil company has historica lly been divided into northern and southern operating entities southern oil has been exported via basra and northern oil has been shipped to the mediterranean port of ceyhan if and wh the connecting pipeline is operational the 600mile kirkukceyhan pi peline is actually two pipes 40inch diameter pipe with nominal capacity of 11 mbd although doe reports that 900000 barrels per day was its practical maximum and parallel 46inch pipe with nominal capacity of 500000 barrels per day it does not appear that the second line was ever used on commercial basis but taken together the theoretical capability of transporting 16 mbd of iraqi crude to westofsuez oil markets exists the pipeline to ceyhan was an important export route during the

still required subsequent events caused shipments to stop during december 2004 and the pipeline still remains out of service platts noted that iraq has had to rely on its southern termin als for exports because crude flows from the northern kirkuk fields have remained off line for three months there is still security in the north an iraqi oil ministry official said we are unable to protect the northern pipeline network until the pipeline is secured there will be steady northern exports12 as the new iraqi government organizes parliament has elected kurdish political leader jalal talabani as president some anal ysts see this as step toward establishing security in the regions oil fields and for th export pipeline were some of the revenues from the northern fields to be allocated to the local population which is reportedly under negotiation incentives to keep the il flowing might be sufficiently focused to elicit pipeline protection from the kurds the oil pipeline mainly flows through kurdistan democratic party kdp territory the barzani clan controls the kdp and most of the territory the pipeline crosses talabani is leader of the patriotic union of kurdistan puk different kurdish faction with the new government being formed numerous issues may be headed toward resolution including who will be minister of oil and how oil export revenues might be allocated if the export pipeline to the mediterranean were to be repaired and kept operational and the oil fields around kirkuk to produce as they have in the past substantial revenues would likely result at current wo rld oil prices now over 60 per barrel bbl for oil of this type located in the eastern mediterranean monthl revenues of up to 18 billion could result iraqi oil production potential with 115 billion barrels of proven oil reserves iraq could potentially produce far more oil than has been realized in its history given stable security situation very large amount s of capital investment and the involvement of one or more large oil companies it w ould be realistic to suggest potential output ramping up to 5 or 6 million barrels per day over period of several years but given current difficulties it would seem that this sort of eventuality is far off within the context of what might be achievable in nearer time frame we have calculated potential oil revenue s under variety of production and price scenarios that might be realized if the oil field and infrastructure security situation were to improve increased production is still pendent on resolution of secu rity issues improvement in oil production facilitie s and infrastructure upgrades table 2 below shows the results of these hypothetical calculationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21626crs6 table 2 range of possible future iraqi annual

shown in table 2 reflecting such unknowns as how quickly and to what extent iraqi oil exports could be ramped up and what the world price of oil might be at that time while the potential to earn substantial export revenues is real big revenue increases might be hard to achieve northern oil in the world oil market concluding note world crude oil prices have been extremely hi gh since the first months of 2005 at one point they reached 70 per barrel the pricing situation refl ects among other factors the balance between robust global oil dema nd and tight supply situation with little spare capacity the addition of an incremental 800000 barrels pe r day into this overheated market could have substantial price impact even though it would represent only about 1 increase in total world output this increment were it to become available under current circumstances might result in noticeable decline in crude prices
