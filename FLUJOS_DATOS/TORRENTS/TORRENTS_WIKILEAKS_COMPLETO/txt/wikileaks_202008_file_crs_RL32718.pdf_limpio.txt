had peculiar side effect accounting became front page news for the next year accounting fraud at long series of fortune 500 companies made headlines the worst cases led to spectacular bankruptcies mass layoffs and criminal prosecutions many other companies remained intact but paid millions of dollars to settle charges that their books did not correspond to financial reality the economic costs of the corporate scandals were substantial trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth lost and climate of uncertainty that may have suppressed business investment and hiring after the 2001 recession ended the barriers to corporate fraud set in place after the great depression had clearly failed to protect public investors and were put under close scrutiny congress responded by passing the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 strengthening regulation of auditors directors and corporate executives and increasing criminal penalties for fraud during the 20032004 school year professor william blacks class at the lyndon b johnson school of public affairs of the university of texas examined corporate fraud from multi disciplinary perspective rather than viewing fraud as simply securities law matter the class considered the insights of criminology sociology management science business ethics behavioral economics complex systems theory and other fields this report is the result of their investigations the report focuses on the internal controls on american corporations including corporate governance business ethics managerial structure and compensation internal counsel and whistleblowers as well as external controls government regulation external auditors and accountants and the judicial process recurring theme is the limited efficacy of many safeguards and watchdogs in cases of control fraud where fraud is directed or abetted by top management and where unethical or abusive practices may become the organizational norm it may then be easier for employees directors auditors and even government regulators to go along with the prevailing trends rather than take stand which might disrupt the smooth functioning of the business and could bring on devastating personal and organizational consequences another broad question raised by the report is whether the postenron scandals were onetime event made possible by the stock market bubble of the 1990s and several other unique historical developments which together constituted perfect storm or whether fraud is cyclical phenomenon associated with the end of long bull markets the question has policy implications if recent corporate scandals represent an unfortunate result of unique set of conditions one might conclude that the restraints now in place are sufficient to prevent outbreaks of fraud under normal circumstances on the other hand if fraud is cyclical and can be expected to reappear once stock prices begin to soar again one might conclude that the postenron scandals have revealed fundamental weaknesses in law and regulation this report provides an overview of anti fraud barriers and will not be updated

scandals of the early 21st century have sparked much speculation as to their cause and much work by legislators and regulators to set in place reforms to prevent them from recurring explanations for these events seem to rely on one of two distinct models one theory claims that collapses such as these are cyclical and may be an inevitable adjunct to prolonged bull markets when the good times are rolling virt ually all investments are buoyed by the rising market investors have less incentive to monitor the firms they invest in and regulators tend to become less vigilant when investor losses are rare in this atmosphere fraud can prosper and even established respectable firms may see little harm in embellishing their accounting results to provide the endless stream of good news that the overheated market demands eventually the party ends investor skepticism and regulatory zeal return and the markets selfcleansing forces restore the balance until the next time another explanationwhich may be called the pe rfect storm theoryholds that the confluence of several unique historical circumstances in the late 1990s enabled rogue managers and companies to commit fraud on scale far grander than the cyclical explanation would have predicted among the factors that combined to form the perfect storm were booming new technology sector based on the internet the creation and enthusiastic adoption of new financial strategies and instruments the demographic impact of baby boomers beginning to save for retirement changes in the relationship between auditors and their clients and of course stock market driven to irrational exuberance by year after year of doubledigit returns in examining these theories this report focuses on the internal controls on american corporations including corporate governance business ethics managerial structure and compensation internal counsel and whistleblowers as well as external controls government regulation external auditors and accountants and the judicial process this report surveys the barriers to corporate fraud within the context of the competing explanations the cycle vs the perfect storm the explanation one chooses will affect the preferred public policy response if the series of corporate scandals that began with enron represents an unfortunate result of unique set of market conditions one might conclude that the restraints now in place are sufficient to prevent outbreaks of fraud under normal circumstances on the other hand if fraud is cyclical and can be expected to reappear once stock prices begin to climb again one might conclude that the postenron scandals have revealed fundamental weaknesses in law and regulation this was arguably congresss frame of mind when it passed the sarbanesoxley actthe most significant amendments to securities law since the 1930sduring the worst of the scandals some observers characterize that law as an overreaction 1 while others see it as first step2 the 109th

management of corporation on behalf of the shareholders though boards normally allow managers broad latitude to conduct daytoday operations state corporate and federal securities laws mandate that directors approve certain major company decisions such as the issuance of stock distribution of dividends mergers the level of executive pay amendments to corporate bylaws and other matters in times of crisis the board can fire management and take any action deemed necessary to protect the interests of the ultimate owners of the business the shareholders shareholders elect directors to the company board with the number of votes cast usually in proportion to the number of shares held in the wake of the postenron scandals the role of the board of directors has been the subject of much legislative and regulatory activity it is clearly desirable to have the board play an active role in preventing and detecting management fraud but many observers stress the limitations of the boards monitoring capacity given that its members serve parttime and must rely heavily upon the representations of management kostant describes the situation in this way in the governance mechanisms senior inside management especially the chief executive officer selected the board of directors and while the board in theory had ultimate authority for the management of the corporation it largely deferred to the policies and practices of the senior inside managers direct challenges to the ceo by the board were rare and the board usually followed the directives of the inside managers in opposing derivative suits 3 kostant notes that management has been allowed to capture the mechanics of corporate governance and has created power dynamic relatively unchecked by weak exit and nonexistent voice4 in other words corporate actors not just employees but also advisors and contractors such as financial institutions or accountants have become more reluctant to walk away from corporation whose management is engaged in improper practices and they are even less willing to take public stand against such practices g6g146g155g142g140g157g152g155g561g21g142g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g561 shareholders normally give the slate of directors nominated by management nearunanimous vote of approval5 the usual practice for shareholders dissatisfied with companys management is to sell their shares attempts to unseat management by electing an opposing slate of directors as at disney in 2004 are rare basic criticism of boards of directors is that they provide rubber 3 peter kostant exit

hirschman on the devices that corporations use to correct lapses in productive behavior exit occurs when members leave an organization and is seen as insufficiently effective in triggering corrective action voice is any attempt to change rather than escape from an unsatisfactory situation loyalty is brake on exit causing individuals to remain when it might be rational to leave and thus may be

the selection process partly explains why this might be so directors are chosen for variety of reasons including their knowledge of the companys business their reputation or their personal and professional relationships with management many directors hold positions on number of boards which may ultimately affect boards ability to effectively carry out its duties6 active or retired ceos frequently serve as directors directors who are or have been managers of other companies may tend to make decisions much as they would for their own firms and use gove rnance tactics which they have either already found successful in their own dealings or wish to test for future use7 ceodirectors are unlikely to challenge current management and change becomes less likely as the proportion of directors who are ceos in their own right increases8 the means by which directors are selected may create social dilemma further undermining the ability to effectively monitor management board members are often appointed due to personal relationships and these directors will likely find it difficult to protest the managers actions9 corporation would nominate an outspoken critic of its management to its board similarly few prospective directors would choose to serve on the board of firm whose management they did not respect and trust the need for collegial and cordial atmosphere for the board to get its work doneboth directors and managers have other demands on their timeconflicts with the need to have board ready to ask tough and unpleasant questions when fraud is suspected scholars and practitioners argue that certain level of consensus between management and boards is necessary for company planning and the implementation of policy forcing directors into stronger monitoring role may create suspicion and discord between the groups and ultimately damage the company

scandals there was strong push to strengthen the role of independent directors those who have ties to the company or its management and can presumably exercise more impartial judgement the sarbanesoxley act requires that boards audit committee which hires oversees and pays the firms outside auditor be made up entirely of independent directors the nasdaq and new york stock exchange nyse adopted rules in 2003 that require companies whose stock is traded on their markets to have majority of independent directors on their boards the new rules included more stringent definition of independence according to nyse rule 303a02 independence tests director qualifies as independent unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has material relationship with

that independent directors do not necessarily function effectively as overseers of management of corporation increased director independence is often treated like the silver bullet that will prevent

should not be surprising therefore that the results of reform efforts have been mixed10 glassman posited that because there is easily identifiable optimal configuration of or role for board one cannot conclude that absolute independence is necessary feature of any board of directors rather when determining appropriate policy and reforms regulators need to take into account all of the different ways boards can function within corporation to that end regulators must remember that boards play dual roles in corporation as manager and as monitors therefore the goal of our regulatory reforms should be to make sure both the roles are appropriately accounted for and balanced and to avoid unnecessarily infringing on either legitimate role glassman said moreover regulators must take into account the tension that will always exist resulting from the dual roles directors hold what do we really want from directors we want board that is collegial informed and involved enough with management to provide strategic guidance we also want board that is far enough removed to ask tough questions and take decisive independent action when necessary glassman said it has been further argued that continued regulatory focus on the independence of directors will have an adverse effect both on boards ability to execute its managerial duties for the company and on the companys ability to recruit board which will best fit the individual companys needs if boards are forced to focus most heavily on the monitoring and oversight of the actions of management they risk destroying the cooperative relationship with the managers who must implement their decisions 11 requirements for independence may make the board selection process more strenuous and the possibility of increasing board member liability or responsibility for the actions of the companyeither by law or perceptionmay make otherwise valuable candidates more reluctant to step forward moreover board independence may not be advisable in companies in highly specialized industry sectors where the number of board candidates with relevant experience is limited especially if management feels it necessary to seek advice from its directors g22g145g142g561g5g7g17g550g5g145g138g146g155g150g138g151g561g21g153g149g146g157g561 perhaps the ultimate threat to board independence arises when the ceo also serves as chairman of the board the dual role has become increasingly common defenders of the practice argue the appointment of ceo as chairman eliminates the possibility that the board would not have the same information as executives holding both positions creates more streamlined corporation and helps avoid an inherent disjunction of information between the board and top management hence proponents argue that the sharing of information can unify the management and directors 12 but chairmans service in both capacities may also create problems if boards task is to monitor and potentially override the decisions

although independence requirements have been major thrust of postenron reforms it should be noted that independent directors were unable to prevent enrons collapse enrons board included skilled corporate managers and former regulators and qualified as supermajority independent boardone in which all directors came from outside the company with the exception of the ceo 14 jeffrey skilling and kenneth lay were the only enron employees to serve on the board the boards audit compensation governance and nominating committees were composed entirely of independent directors however its independence and expertise did not prevent the board from twice suspending its code of ethics to allow cfo andrew fastow to create manage and personally profit from ostensibly independent accounting entities whose real function was to hide business losses neither did the board force management to examine seriously the issues raised in sherron watkins whistleblower memo nor request to see the vinson and elkins investigative report of her concerns that was conducted at managements request 15 the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations concluded that the board acted inappropriately in number of ways including br each of fiduciary duty approval of situations putting corporate managers in conflicting positions tolerating highrisk accounting policies and the creation of excessive compensation plans16 the subcommittees report also cited lack of independence with regard to financial ties between the company and individual directors but the greatest problem with the enron board seems to have been not its actions but its inaction the board was unwilling to challenge actions by management that were ultimately devastating to the firm and its rankandfile employees except through the institution of few controls that were not closely monitored the board also failed to monitor enrons outside auditor arthur andersen 13 bruce cutting and alexander kouzmin the emerging patterns of

the enforcer of that conscience 18 with officers and managers wielding so much power in todays corporate landscape many believe that ethical corporate behavior must truly come from the top down the

managerial abuse corporate governance practice and securities law respectively take carrotandstick approach corporations have sought to eliminate conflicts of interest by creating generous financial incentives to encourage managers to focus on creation of shareholder wealth securities law on the other hand establishes fiduciary duties and responsibilities for management and provides penalties

of millions of dollars worth of stock and stock options during their tenures stockbased pay often vastly outweighs salary and bonus compensation research on whether this compensation shift has improved corporate performance and competitiveness is mixed and beyond the scope of this report the postenron scandals however suggest that executive pay policies have not reduced the propensity of corporate mangers to engage in fraud there are number of explanations for the failure of pay practices to improve ethical standards first ceos of large corporations are able to exercise significant amount of bargaining power when negotiating their employment contracts and changeincontrol contracts 20 large differential lies between ceo bargaining power and other corporate workers bargaining power the only oversight of ceo contract negotiations is provided by the board of directors which as discussed above is normally disinclined to challenge top management the principalagent problem remains according to bebchuk and fried the contracting approach of ceos in determining their compensation package can produce conflict of interest between the board of directors and top management 21 bebchuk argues that one should not assume that the board of directors main goal is to maximize shareholder value that they too may be subject to agency problems22 directors have the incentive to secure their reappointment to the board average director compensation in the 1500 largest us corporations was 102000 in 2003 23 in the case of enron directors were paid up to 380000 annually these figures exclude all the nonmonetary perks directors receive such as business and social contacts the only real consequence the board or ceos face in challenging each other is turnoverthe possibility of losing their positionsbut under current corporate practices ceos and boards tenures are mutually determined that is boards approve compensation schemes for officers and have legal authority to remove them but ceos often have significant influence in determining board membership through control of the nominations process directors represent the shareholders but the shareholders do not select directors in any meaningful sense the slate of directors proposed by management generally passes by nearunanimous vote situation where shareholders put forward slate contrary to the desire of management is exceedingly rare hence directors must stay in the good graces of management to keep their positions on the board in corporations lacking controlling shareholder most of the directors have nominal equity interest in the firm 24 this fact together with general willingness to approve everhigher levels 20 stewart j schwab and randall s thomas what do ceos bargain for an empirical

shareholder interests stockbased compensationin the form of restricted shares or stock optionshas become the norm at large us firms however stockbased compensation has not always kept corporate officers working for the best longterm interests of the company after enron there is sense that rising amounts of stockbased pay may sometimes be too much of good thing while having substantial equity stake may indeed align managers and shareholders interests when that stake grows into the hundreds of millions of dollars managers have counterincentive that is when company is in trouble managers may seek to protect their own stakes by issuing false accounting stat ements giving themselves time to sell their own stock before public investors become aware of the companys financial problems 26 this was the pattern at enron and it was repeated elsewhere at the 25 largest us businesses to declare bankruptcy during the 18 months after january 1 2001 the 25 highestpaid insiders had earned 33 billion since 1999 while over the same period shareholder value declined by 211 billion and over 94000 jobs were lost27 other problems with stock and options as an incentive tool have been observed when managers sell stock or exercise options restoring payperformance sensitivity requires giving them new options or shares stock cashouts can lead to the weakening of managers incentives or alternatively may force the firm to restore incentives to the precashout level28 though many companies have taken steps to restrict executives abilities to cash out vested equity incentives through trading windows and blackout periods these limitations are not prevalent throughout all businesses and industries and even in firms that have such restrictions managers who are privy to undisclosed bad news may still use trading windows to unload substantial amount of their holdings some argue that bonus pay based on financial performance creates incentives that are less problematic than stockbased compensation stock option pay for example may promote excessive risk taking in the pursuit of managerial wealth whereas executives whose pay is linked to annual performance targets might be expected to be more riskaverse criticism of bonus pay is that recipients may have too short time horizon and fail to make the investments that are crucial to the firms longterm growth sanders and hambrick investigate the effects of ceo pay structure on firm performance and investment and reach the counterintuitive result that reliance on bonus pay does not reduce two out of three meas ures of longterm investment furthermore they find that bonus pay does not have negative impact on subsequent firm performance 29 25 many directors are themselves current or former ceos 26 oren bargill and lucian bebchuk

find nonlinear pattern at moderate levels option plans have positive effect on the firms subsequent performance but at higher levels option pay sometimes results in significant costs to stockholders

difference between the pay that ceos actua lly receive and what they would have received under an arms length transaction is thought to reflect the imbalance of power between the ceo and shareholders managers ability to influence their pay can lead to compensation arrangements that generate worse incentives than those that arms length contracts would provide managerial influence may lead to the adoption of compensation packages that provide weak or perverse incentives these inefficiencies can lead to the reduction of shareholder value serious consequence the economic impact of ceo pay often dismissed as symbolic in the context of multibillion dollar corporation can be material studies show that ceo compensation was on average 789 of corporate profits in the 1500 firms that make up the

is public outrage during the 1990s some firms were criticized for their ceos excessive paychecks and the annual compensation of ceos of criticized firms was reduced over the following two years by an average of 27 million 32 one response is recent efforts to camouflage the executive pay package33 an example was provided by jack welch of general electric who was widely respected when he retired but was later criticized when details of his extensive retirement package which had not been disclosed to shareholders became known during divorce proceedings observers argue that major problem with the current executive compensation landscape is the frequent lack of transparency where efforts to conceal the true level of compensation exist it is not likely that pay practices will foster ethical conduct some critiques of excessive executive compen sation proceed from an egalitarian standpoint ceo pay has risen so far above rankandfile wages that some maintain that many executives view themselves as special class beyond the reach of law and regulation 34 paul v olcker former chairman of the federal reserve now speaks out frequently about the ill effects of corporate greed since the

owners the principal agent theory outlines the expectation held by shareholders that their primary interests will drive the decisions made by management these interests are often thought to be the maximization of profits for the firm some however call for an expansion of the fiduciary concept to include stakeholders other than the owners evan and freedman define stakeholders as those groups who have stake in or claim on the firmincluding suppliers customers employees stockholders and the local community as well as management in its role as agent for these groups they liken firm mismanagement in the community to crime that violates an implicit social contract and maintain that m management as corporate agents must address these issues of stakeholder protection 36 persons are responsible for the consequences of their actions through the corporation even if those actions are mediated any theory that seek s to justify the corporate form must be based partially on the idea that the corporation and its managers as moral agents can be the cause of and be held accountable for the consequences of their actions37 they hold that another principle of stakeholder management is management bears fiduciary relationship to stakeholders and to the corporation as an abstract entity it must act in the interests of the stakeholders as their agents and it must act in the interests of the corporation to ensure the survival of the firm safeguarding the longterm stakes of each group 38 the problem they maintain is that this fiduciary relationship is not kept in balance and is quite often used as justification for unethical acts the authors acknowledge the principles inherent conflict by offering that it gives instructions for magical resolution of the conflicts that arise from prima facie obligations to multiple parties39 it is left up to management to foster an environment that acknowledges all parties stake in the survival of the firm stakeholder theory holds that one group should be given primacy over another situations will occur when one group will benefit at the expense of others but relationships among stakeholders must be in balance when they are not the

professional conduct states from which the accountant receives his license can fine suspend or bar the accountant from practice the professional ethics division within the aicpa can initiate investigations into allegations of unethical or wrongful conduct if it determines guilt it can bar the accountant from aicpa membership the staff of the senate committee on governmental affairs found that these avenues of professional discipline for accountants have been criticizedparticularly in the wake of the enron scandalas fairly ineffective state boards of accountancy vary in their

certifying financial statements of those corporations they ensure that corporation has implemented effective risk management processes and internal control systems and has developed financial statements that accord with gaap benefits of effective monitoring include transparent financial statements active trading markets and the ability to use unbiased financial accounting numbers as inputs into contracts among shareholders senior claimants and management 44 auditors in effect serve as watchdogs or gatekeepers for investors and creditors the auditor provides only reasonable assurance that corporation has fairly represented its financial condition and implemented effective internal controls the auditor cannot endorse the truth of financial statement with absolute certainty because the auditor remains largely dependent on management and other corporation employees to provide the needed material to perform its function although auditors can and sometimes do obtain information independent of corporate management other sources of uncertainty include the use of estimates and inconsistencies in internal controls an audit provides only reasonable assurance against material misstatements whether intentional or unintentional in the financial statements in reality an audit does not guarantee that error or fraud has not affected the financial statements 45 investors however often perceive the audit as providing absolute assurance that corporation is not committing fraud survey in the early 1990s showed that almost half of investors believed that the certified audit guaranteed that corporation was not releasing unintentionally false financial statements and more than 70 believed that certified audit meant the corporation absolutely was not engaging in fraud as result investors expectations exceed the assurance actually provided 46 scholars argue whether or not auditors may have an incentive to certify false and misleading financial statements made by corporations one view is that maintaining high professional reputation provides sufficient incentive for auditors to not endorse questionable financial 43 ibid p 18 44 april klein economic

honesty closely followed by its reputation for careful work fees for two years audits could not approach the losses that the auditor would suffer from perception that it would muffle clients fraud the auditors partners shared none of the gain from any fraud and were exposed to large fraction of the loss it would have been irrational for any of them to have joined cause with the client wrote judge easterbrook for the seventh circuit in 199047 columbia law professor john coffee noted that having an auditor vouch for corporations statements is necessary because the market recognizes that the gatekeeper has lesser incentive to lie than does its client and thus regards the gatekeepers assurance or evaluation as more credible to be sure the gatekeeper as watchdog is typically paid by the party that it is to watch but its relative credibility stems from the fact that it is in effect pledging reputational capital that it has built up over many years of performing similar services for numerous clients 48 the opposing school of thought maintains that auditors will forgo reputational capital in favor of certifying false or misleading financial statements if that is the best means by which to secure profits despite the clear logic of the gatekeeper rationale experience over the 1990s suggests that professional gatekeepers do acquiesce in managerial fraud even though the apparent reputational losses seem to dwarf the gains to be made from the individual client49 this could occur for unintentional or intentional reasons unintentionally the auditor might make unconsciously biased judgments during the audit due to relationship with management that could permit the release of an incorrect audit matthew barrett explains that people are less willing to harm individuals that they know relative to strangers people are even less willing to harm paying clients or individuals they consider paying clients with whom they enjoy ongoing relationships 50 alternatively auditors might intentionally certify misleading audits to maintain profitable relationships such as the provision of nonaudit consulting services with the corporations they audit the auditors business interests in fostering longterm relationship with clients management encourage auditors to render clean audit opinions in an effort to reta in any existing engagements and to secure future business

nonaudit services for the contracting public corporation discussion has arisen within the accounting field as to whether or not the law and the sec should ever permit the outsourcing of an internal audit to any external audit firm even when apparent conflict of interest exists proponents of outsourcing cite improved services at lower costs as the primary reason to permit outsourcing of the internal audit58 external auditors presumably will have the most uptodate expertise in auditing practice as well as superior institutional knowledge and professional resources these advantages may often enable external auditors to perform internal audits at lower cost to the company than when the internal audit is performed by inhouse staff moreover outsourcing the internal audit permits management to concentrate on its primary task of directing the company rather than focusing on accounting matters some leaders in the field however support ban on outsourcing internal audit work to an external auditor they cite evidence that inhouse auditors are more likely than external auditors to uncover fraud within the corporation in 1998 kpmg survey of executives from 5000 large us corporations notforprofit organizations and local governments respondents consistently rated internal auditors among the entities most likely to detect fraud from within their organizations while external auditors were among the least likely according to the survey key factors in detecting fraud included customer nd employee notification and anonymous letters these factors might not be effective if someone such as fulltime internal auditor were not immediately available to receive such communications59 another survey found that external auditors were not as proactive as internal auditors in detecting fraud most of the outsourced internal audit departments we encountered appeared to have lost their focus on adding value and improving company governance the departments were often not proactive and failed to initiate change thereby allowing their service to become less relevant to the organization 60 opponents of outsourcing contend that external uditors simply do not understand the business of corporation as well as an inhouse audit department would and as result are less likely to detect fraud opponents also believe that over th long term outsourcing will not save costs given the concentration and limited price competition in the accounting industry

include nonfinancial risk management in addition to standard financial risk management this school maintains that fraud does not arise from only from the manipulation of financial statements but may appear in various types of nonfinancial reporting that encompass the entire culture of corporation we as profession must stand up for the cause of strong external audit as the best way of both detecting fraud and instilling management and financial discipline but this will not work unless we are prepared to expand the scope of the audit rather than just telling the wider 58 larry rittenberg

services for their audit clients including bookkeeping financial information systems design and implementation appraisals actuarial services internal audit services management or human resources functions legal and expert services unrelated to the audit brokerdealer investment adviser or investment banking services as well as any other service that the pcaob determines to be impermissible 63 the need to strengthen auditor independence rules was one of the key conclusions drawn by congressional investigators into the postenron scandals allowing the same firm to audit compan and provide consulting services for that company might tempt the firm to work with and please management in the audit function in order to assure itself further consulting work moreover to the extent that some of the consulting work may involve setting up internal audit systems or even helping to structure transactions the firm might end up auditing its own work perhaps leading it to be either less critical or more trusting than it should be 64 however the law continues to permit accounting firms to conduct certain nonaudit services for their audit clients provided that such services are approved in advance by the audit committee the most important such service in terms of accounting firms revenues is tax work there is debate as to whether this practice compromises the independence of the external auditor in february 2003 the joint committee on taxation published staff study of enrons tax practices and the role of financial institutions including arthur andersen in devising various tax shelters

subsequently wrote to the sec asking whether auditors should be banned from providing tax services to their audit clients another compromise of auditor independence may arise in spite of the sarbanesoxley requirement that the outside auditor be hired by the audit committee it has been argued that management ultimately will interject its own preferences into the hiring process because terms of the contract will require managements approval sarbanesoxley the sec and the nyse have sought to change the relationship between the auditor and client by giving the audit co mmittee of companys board of directors more central role and relationship with the external auditors we believe that this is naïve hope and will result in further dashed expectations with all the talk of having the audit committee hire the auditor one has talked about how fee disputes will be settled how scope questions will be answered or how repor ting and disclosure debates will be resolved corporate audit committees will turn to management for help in resolving such critical questions the audit committee is companycentric body that must work closely with company management more responsibility on the audit committee might result in few more company hands on the fiddle but the tune will substantively remain the same this needs to change 67 others see potential conflict between independence standards for audit committee members and the statutory mandate that the committee include financial expert with auditing and accounting experience inevitably large number of these financial experts will be retired partners of the big four accounting firms which perform most corporate audits 68 auditors and audit committees will therefore increasingly have to be on guard against the resulting risks of conflict of interest more company directors are likely to have an in timate knowledge of how their audit firms work have friends and contacts at the firm and working knowledge of its audit processes all of which means that should they ever stoop to such levels they will find it easier to hoodwink their auditor 69 g3g157g157g152g155g151g142g162g156g561

with state and local bar associations leading the way in promulgating ethical standards and the judiciary playing the lead enforcement role at the national level the american bar association aba plays an important role in developing the model rules of professional condu ct which many state bar associations then adopt with 400000 members the aba is the largest voluntary professional association in the world and aba members represent about half of l lawyers practicing in the united states the aba was founded in 1878 at time when most lawyers learned their trade by apprenticeship and national code of legal ethics existed today one of the 11 stated goals of the aba is to achieve the highest standards of professionalism competence and ethical conduct 70 the original canons of professional ethics were adopted by the aba in 1908 and although the canons were worded in an advisory manner courts began enforcing the canons as if they were binding legal rules71 the current aba model rules serve as an example for states and have been adopted in at least 39 states although the model rules are theoretically designed to be adopted by states in its entirety states are free to alter the aba model rules as they wish in 1997 the aba began fiveyear project to revise and examine the aba model rules additionally after the passage of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by congress the aba task force on corporate responsibility recommended changes to model rule mr 113 of the code 72 sarbanesoxley also mandated that the sec promulgate new regulations regarding attorneys who practice before that federal agency the aba may lead the way in devising model rules of ethical behavior but it rests with state bar associations and courts to adopt and enforce those rules most states have mandatory bar associations which license all attorneys in the state and provide system of professional discipline the most drastic punishment of which is disbarment additionally an injured client may sue his or her attorney for money damages in traditional malpractice action which can be based on contract tort and fiduciary principles or can be based on civil statutes attorneys are also subject to criminal prosecution if they commit fraud or otherwise break state or federal laws in the course of their representation73 so who governs lawyers the aba state bar associations including disciplinary committees the judiciary civil lawsuits state and federal criminal and civil laws and government agency 70 american bar association about the aba httpwwwabanetorgabouthomehtml 71 john f sutton jr and

attorneys and other corporate actors are addressed in other sections of this report this section will focus on ethical rules federal legislation and agency regulations

such their primary concern was maintaining the adversarial legal system paramount to this was preserving lawyerclient confidentiality 74 aba model rule 16 has governed this issue of confidentiality essentially barring attorneys from disclosing information without client consent unless it is to aid the lawyer in defending malp ractice suit to ask advice in regard to following the model rules or if the attorney reasonably believes his client is going to commit criminal act that is likely to result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm75 thus in regard to criminal activity by client financial fraud or crime would not be subject to disclosure by an attorney unless it would cause imminent death or certain substantial physical injury purely financial crimes are not violent in nature and would fall out of the purview of the original mr 16 however in august 2003 the aba amended mr 16 in reaction to corporate scandals like enron worldcom and tyco the new mr 16 allows attorneys to disclose confidential client information in two new circumstances 16b2 to prevent the client from committing crime or fraud that is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another and in furtherance of which the client has used or is using the lawyers services and 16b3 to prevent mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to result or has resulted from the clients commission of crime or fraud in furtherance of which the client has used the lawyers services 76 thus the aba has expanded the exception to tota l client confidentiality without consent to include not only substantial physical harm to person but substantial harm to anothers property or financial interests as well if client uses or has used an attorneys services to commit fraud which has caused or will cause another substantial financial injury the attorney may disclose client information without the clients consent however the new mr 16 does not require an attorney to disclose it is still the attorneys choice whether to do so however before the rule was amended in 2003 an attorney could have been subject to disciplinary action or malpractice lawsuit by client if the attorney had disclosed information relating to clients financial crime the new rule opens the door for attorneys to disclose but whether it is in the attorneys financial interest to do so remains an important question if an attorney discloses clients financial fraud under mr 16 he may have difficulty obtaining future business from corporate clients who may be concerned the attorney will disclose their confidences as well 74 based on discussions with john dzienkowski professor of professional responsibility university of

is the duty of diligent representation this duty is set forth in mr 1377 if an outside counsel is aware that corporations practices may not be in compli ance with the law the duty of diligence should dictate that the attorney advise its client of the potential illegality of these matters additionally if an outside firm is hired to investigate allegations of wrongdoing it should do so to the best of its ability of course central to diligent representation of ones client is actually identifying ones client the issue of who is the client can become very complicated for corporate attorneys both inside and outside counsel so who is the client for corporate attorney the legal entity that is the corporation the corporations shareholders the board of directors corporate officers or managers other corporate employees this i ssue remains unclear under current aba ethical rules and in actual practice several issues related to diligence of representation are raised in regard to legal representation of enron one of enrons main outside law firms vinson elkins has relied upon their attorneys lack of accounting knowledge as an excuse for not catching enrons fraud certainly corporate attorneys cannot be as skilled in the intricacies of accounting practices and maneuvers as professional accountants but in postenron age some have argued that corporate attorneys must develop better knowledge of accounting principles in order to adequately represent corporate clients however potential argument in defense of vinson elkins is that enron did not rely entirely on that firm for its outside legal representation enron farmed out its legal work to several outside firms as result of which ve arguably may not have had complete picture of enrons fraudulent activities vinson elkins share of enrons legal pie continued to shrinkto 20 of work enron farmed out in 2001 but vinson elkins remained the firm enron went to first with its most sensitive projects 78 also after enron employee sherron watkins sent her famous whistleblower memo to enron ceo kenneth lay alleging fraudulent accounting practices lay hired vinson elkins to perform an independent investigation of watkins charges the law firm accepted the task even though ve had represented enron in many transactions raising questions about the independence of their investigation enron general counsel jim derrick approved the hiring of ve to conduct the limited review which might be seen as lack of diligence by derrick to his client the corporation further ves investigation of watkins claims concluded that fraudulent acts had occurred considering the subsequent contrary findings of the powers report the collapse of enron and the criminal indictments of arthur andersen enrons outside accounting firm and several enron executives many have questioned the adequacy of the ve investigation into the watkins memo this calls into question the diligence of ves representation of enron in this matter 79 77 2002

upon one client this was not the case with ve and enron enron was vinson elkins biggest client pouring roughly 356 million into the firms coffers in 2001 78 of its revenue it seems likely that ves ability to give independent objective legal advice was affected by its desire to keep enron as client ve attorneys appear to have let some suspicious enron practices slide for example ve did not prevent enrons board of directors from waiving conflict of interest rules regarding chief financial officer andrew fastows dealings with special purpose entities spes in which he was involved 80 another conflict of interest issue is raised by ve agreeing to conduct supposedly independent review of the sherron watkins whistleblower memo instead of insisting that enron hire law fi rm with previous association with the firm conflicts of interest also abounded for enrons internal counsel one example is provided by enron attorney kristina mordaunt counsel to cfo fastow in 2000 mordaunt received return of 1 million on an investment of 5800 in an enronrelated spe after period of just few months81 it seems unlikely mordaunt could provide fastow with independent legal advice about the permissibility of enrons many spes when she was being personally enriched by an investment in them g25g146g157g145g141g155g138g160g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g6g146g156g140g149g152g156g158g155g142g561 recent changes have given corporate attorneys more freedom to report largescale financial frauds by their clients what effect these changes will ultimately have on attorney behavior remains to be seen the american bar association recently amended mr 113 organization as client this rule previously allowed attorneys for an organization including attorneys for corporation who discovered that an officer or employee of the organization was involved in illegal action or planning to engage in illegal action to report the action to the highest authority that can act for the organization generally the chairman of the board of directors or the ceo if the lawyer felt his concerns were not being addressed his only option was to withdraw from representation he was not authorized to disclose the illegal action to anyone outside the organization unless the action was one that would result in substantial physical harm under mr 16 discussed above for inside counsel withdraw from representation of ones client means resigning ones job however the amended mr 113 allows an attorney to disclose confidential client information if the highest authority in the organization does not act in timely manner and the lawyer believes the violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization again the lawyer has the choice whether or not to disclo information relating to such violation disclosure is not mandatory any disclosure that meets the criteria of the new mr 113 is exempted from the confidentiality requiremen ts of the new mr 16 attorney withdrawal provisions are discussed further by aba mr 116 mr 113 also notes that an organizational client is legal entity but it cannot act except through its officers directors shareholders and other constituents officers directors employees and 80 the spes were accounting entities used by enron to generate fictitious profits fastow r eceived 10year prison sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of securities

organizational client so at least in theory the client of corporate attorney is the corporation it self considered an independent entity of its own under the law but ambiguity still remains about what this means for corporate attorneys trying to balance obligations and dealings with shareholders directors officers and employees the sarbanesoxley act mandated that the sec make changes in its rules regarding attorneys who practice before the sec new rules 17 cfr part 205 were adopted in august of 2003 incorporating some provisions similar to th aba model rule an attorney who discovers evidence of fraud is required to report up the ladder within the client corporation if remedial action is taken by the client the sec rules as proposed would have required the attorney to make noisy withdrawal including these steps withdraw forthwith from representing the issuer indicating that the withdrawal is based on professional considerations within one business day of withdrawing give written notice to the commission of the attorneys withdrawal indicating that the withdrawal was based on professional considerations and promptly disaffirm to the commission any opinion document affirmation representation characterization or the like in document filed with or submitted to the commission or incorporated into such document that the attorney has prepared or assisted in preparing and that the attorney reasonably believes is or may be materially false or misleading the noisy withdrawal provisions were extremel controversial and were not included in the final rule the sec release accompanying the attorney rules stated section 307 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires the commission to prescribe minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the commission in any way in the representation of issuers the standards must include rule requiring an attorney to report evidence of material violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the issuer uptheladder within the company to the chief legal counsel or the chief executive officer of the company or the equivalent thereof and if they do not respond appropriately to the evidence requiring the attorney to report the evidence to the audit committee another committ ee of independent directors or the full board of directors proposed part 205 responds to this directive and is intended to protect investors and increase their confidence in public companies by ensuring that attorneys who work for those companies respond appropriately to evidence of material misconduct we are still considering the noisy withdrawal provisions of our original proposal under section 307 in related proposing release we discuss this part of the original proposal and seek comment on additional alternatives 82 many attorneys opposed the proposed noisy with drawal regulations because they would force corporate attorneys to inform the sec when th ey withdraw from representing client under circumstances of mr 113 this way the sec would be alerted to possible fraud in company what disincentives exist for attorneys regarding noisy withdrawal this rule would in effect force disclosure of largescale corporate client fraud by attorneys whereas the aba rules make disclosure voluntary many corporate attorneys are concerned about losing current and future 82 us securities exchange commission final rule implementation of standards of professional conduct for attorneys at httpwwwsecgovrulesfinal338185htm

corporate law firms have commented negatively on the noisy withdrawal rule claiming that it disturbs the delicate but necessary relationship of trust between client and an atto rney if adopted the noisy withdrawal rule would give the sec powerful tool in its investig ations of fraudulent securities filings but such rule has been formally proposed since the adoption of the august 2003 attorney conduct rules g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the role of attorneys as internal and external gatekeepers against corporate fraud is an uncertain one historically an attorneys only avenue if he suspected corporate fraud was to report his suspicions up the corporate ladder or to withdraw from representation of his client recent changes to the aba model rules of professional conduct have cleared prior hurdles to attorney disclosure of confidential client information relating to financial frauds however the revised aba model rules merely allow disclosure of financial crimes to the appropriate authorities the rules do not require such disclosure further fear of job termination or damage to professional reputation is likely to dissuade many attorneys from voluntarily reporting client financial fraud additionally the attorney rules which were adopted by the sec pursuant to sarbanesoxley merely direct attorneys to report possible securities violations or breaches of fiduciary duty up the corporate ladder the sec rule does not address fraud prevention in corporation where officers managers and even boards of directors may be involved in fraud themselves in such situation reporting up the corporate ladder will have effect the proposed but unadopted sec noisy withdr awal rule would address fraud prevention in corporations with corrupt management or boards by requiring attorneys to alert the sec if withdrawing from representation due to unaddres sed allegations of financial fraud but the outpouring of negative feedback from corporate law firms in response to the proposed rule may make final adoption by the sec unlikely the controversy caused by the proposed noisy withdrawal provision shows how problematic casting attorneys as corporate whistleblowers or as gatekeepers against corporate fraud may be at the heart of the issue is the strong tradition of attorneyclient confidentiality in us legal practice but examples of corrupt corporations like enron illustrate the tragedy that can befall corporate lawyers true client the corporation itself when attorneys and other professionals act in the interest of dishonest corporate officers and neglect the

complicity in unethical behavior is thus reduced as it is thought that individual bears responsibility for the corporate decision individuals in organizations are sometimes subjected to various pressures to comply with ethically questionable decisions corporate wrongdoers naturally do not wish to have their actions exposed individuals in positions of authority can utilize direct threats such as termination denied promotions salary stagnation undesirable transfer etc more subtle pressure can also be used such as reminders that performance reviews are imminent or that being team player is an important factor compensation packages for many depend on performance measures that would be negatively affected by revelation of wrongdoing finally regardless of its merit an organization has

markets has renewed focus on the role of government agencies in detecting and preventing corporate fraud aside from the theoretical and political debates over the appropriate role of government in regulating private enterprise there are many disagreements over how regulators should do their job once they have been vested with regulatory authority in basic terms the objective of government regulation is to change the behavior of private individuals and corporations in order to protect consumers competitors suppliers distributors and workers 87 once congress has crafted legislation and

detection and prevention through mission definition budget requests and jurisdictional clarification gpra has been criticized for its failure to identify extreme risks especially risks that would be

regulated such as foreign exchange trading government bond markets hedge fund investing the private securities market and over thecounter derivatives federal regulation of these markets is limited because small public investors who are presumed to be in need of government protection do not participateinstead all traders in the market are wealthy sophisticated andor professional and are presumed to have the incentive and the capacity to protect themselves from fraud in general these unregulated markets run smoothly and congress and regulators are wary of imposing government regulation that would raise costs for market participants without any clear public benefit when scandals occur however the normal reaction by policy makers is to consider more stringent federal oversight this happened in the 1990s in the treasury market after salomon brothers cornered bond auction and in the municipal securities market after several episodes of default or neardefault made it clear that investors needed more information about the bond issuers in the wake of enron there were legislative proposals to impose disclosure requirements and other regulations on dealers in unregulated energy derivatives 92 in recent decades us financial markets have been far from static new instruments and trading markets continue to emerge often in unregulated sectors regulatory agencies may lack clear authority to pursue fraud in these new markets or find that they are able to prosecute fraud only after the fact the disclosure and reporting requir ements that would allow them to detect some cases of fraud in advance are absent recently the sec has proposed rule that would require hedge funds to register as investment advisers on the grounds that hedge funds have grown so popular that they affect regulated securities markets and that the expanding universe of hedge fund customers raises investor protection issues93 the proposed rule was opposed by two of the five commissioners many others believe that th costs to market participants will outweigh the benefits of improvements in the secs antifraud capability there is tradeoff between free unregulated markets where some fraud will occur and government regulation which offers protection to market participants but may hinder financial innovation when massive fraud occurs policy makers adjust their costbenefit calculations and new legislation or regulation comes into being in rarer cases when proscribed activity has not been observed to cause trouble over long period regulators may move to repeal rules that were originally thought necessary to prevent fraud or manipulation 94 turf wars among regulatory agencies may also result in less potent regulatory action lack of coordination among regulatory agencies holding shared jurisdiction over specific industry often results in duplicate efforts or regulatory gaps this in turn may result in less effective enforcement programs some regulators are unsure when it is appropriate to turn over investigations of fraud activity to the department of justice in the case of enrons involvement in the california energy crisis of 2001 senate investigators found that federal

manipulations and its financial weakness but failed to intervene in part because of confusion over legal jurisdiction95 the problem of unclear regulatory jurisdiction has been much studied by congress regulators and academics common concern is that the current us regulatory structure where dozen or so agencies oversee different financial industries does not adapt well to changes in financial markets where industry borders are porous and innovation is constant96 one solution is to consolidate agencies into single regulator on the model of the japanese ministry of finance or the british securities and investments board some argue however that what critics of the present system call regulatory balkanization is really beneficial regulatory competition and that jurisdictional constraints reduce the harmful impact on innovation of the dead hand of government intervention in free markets in their report on ferc and enron the staff of the senate governmental affairs committee claimed that enron exploited regulatory gaps among ferc sec and the cftc enrons ploys succeeded in part because ferc failed to communicate with the other agencies that regulated some aspects of the quickly changing power market unfortunately it isnt enough to simply set up the market rules to fulfill its mission ferc must understand what is actually happening in the market97 with energy markets in the midst of transformation driven by deregulation and new forms of derivatives trading agency was wellpositioned to prevent fraud the cftc had full jurisdiction over futures exchange trading but very limited authority over or information about overthecounter derivatives cftcs authority over fraud and manipulation in physical commodity markets called cash or spot markets is unclear the statutes and legislative histories provide little guidance and the legal precedents are few98 ferc on the other hand was created as ratesetting agency in the days of controlled prices it was very slow to establish regulatory oversight over deregulated energy markets indeed its statutory mandate to do so was not clear several federal agencies have now brought charges against enron and other firms in connection with the manipulation of natural gas and electricity prices but as the california electricity and enron crises unfolded agency was in position to monitor trading in comprehensive or timely fashion when markets are in state of rapid evolution it is of course very difficult for regulators to set up regulatory scheme that will not quickly become outdated and cumbersome or that will not force traders to adopt market structures that may be less than optimal it is challenge for congressional oversight to ensure that regulators do not move too soon and risk choking off economically beneficial market innovat ion or wait too long and let opportunities for serious fraud arise 95 us congress senate committee on governmental affairs committee staff investigation of the federal energy

act effectively because the values nd priorities of the industry participants have become overly integrated into the values and priorities of the regulatory agency this phenomenon known as regulatory capture may oc cur over the course of many years as regulatory agency receives less and less funding to perform duties mandated by the law as the regulatory bodies lose enforcement power indust ry gains more control over the regulatory agenda ultimately industry could garner so much power as to serve as the facto leaders of the agency rather than the formal regulators laffont and tirole provide

decision makers monetary bribes are feasible although not common b more pervasive is the hopedfor future employment for commissioners and agency staff with the regulated firms or with publicinterest law firms c personal relationships provide incentives for government officials to treat their industry partners kindly d the industry may cater to the agencys desire for tranquillity by refraining from criticizing publicly the agencys management last but not least the industry can also operate indirect transfers through few key elected officials who have influence over the agency 99 regulatory agency has natural incentive to see its industry thrive if the industry shrinks so may the regulator as consequence agencies may shy away from strict letterofthelaw oversight if there will be significant negative impact on firms in the industry the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s was an example of th is rather than swiftly closing down insolvent institutions regulators and legislators sought to provide the industry with breathing space in hope of turnaround in the long run this exacerbated the problem and raised the ultimate cost to taxpayers when agencies engage in turf wars they mayconsciously or notact as proxies for their respective industries in the 1980s when both stock and futures exchanges created instruments that let investors buy and sell stock indexes the cftc and the sec fought for years over jurisdiction each agency argued that the public in terest would be best served if it regulated the new products the deadlock spilled over into congress which was unable to pass cftc reauthorization bill until three years after the cftcs 1989 sunset to outsiders the debate over who should regulate stock index products seemed arcane and of little real consequence but to the industries large sums of money were at stake if index products were judged to be securities they would be traded on stock exchanges if they were considered futures they could be traded only on cftcregulated futures exchanges g21g162g156g157g142g150g561g5g138g153g138g140g146g157g162g561 during times of tight fiscal policy or when the public and legislative mood favors the idea

particularly vulnerable is an activity colloquially known as scouting referring to investigations that arise within the agency itself rather than in response to complaints from investors or other market participants an agency that considers itself underfunded will tend to focus on highly visible cases where congress or the media is demanding answers and will be less likely to launch expensive probes into areas where the staff believes that abuses may be occurring out of the public eye ideally the scouting function is one of the most valuable an agency can perform if it results in detecting and preventing fraud in the first place the sec is one of the more notable examples of regulatory agency hampered by inadequate system capacity gao report released in march of 2002 found that around 1996 the secs workload began to increase much more quickly than the agencys staffing levels from 1991 to 2000 the number of corporate filings received by the agency increased by 59 while staff of the agency grew by only 29 100 as result only about 8 of overall filings were reviewed at all by 2000 secs limited staff resources high turnover and relatively low pay the gao said had challenged secs ability to protect investors and maintain the integrity of securities markets101 staff often lacked the time or expertise to adequately review filings and applications throughout the 1990s sec chairmen regularly asked appropriators for more funds focusing particularly on the difficulty of retaining qualified personnel who could easily command higher salaries on wall street in 2001 congress approved pay parity plan that authorized the sec to pay certain employees at the level of federal bank examiners whose salaries exceed the normal civil service scales 102 however the money to fund pay parity was not immediately appropriated the secs budget picture changed dramatically with the enron scandals in january 2002 the bush administration requested 423 million for the sec for fy2003 the sarbanesoxley actpassed in june 2002authorized appropriations of 775 million for fy2005 congress has set the secs budget at 913 million the amount requested by the administration representing 116

cannot be blamed on any one particular policy agency individual or political party rather several systemwide problems combined to prevent regulators from taking appropriate and timely action to protect the public from fraudulent and deceptive business practices future attempts to reform regulatory agencies may prove to be more effective by taking the full range of current and potential problems into account rather than looking for silver bullet to prevent future enron or california energy crisis from hurting the public once again 100 us general accounting office sec operations

have traditionally looked to research analysts employed by investment banks to help decide which stocks to buy or sell for investment banking firms in the business of selling securities to the public the temptation to use analyst reports as sales tool is clearly potential source of conflicts of interest since the 1960s sec regulations have required firms to enforce separation between investment bankers and analysts to maintain the objectivity of analysts these regulations became known as the chinese wall because they were meant to create barrier as effective as the great wall of china between the two operations 103 chinese wall arrangements limited contacts between bankers and analysts most large securities firms made sure that their investment banking and research departments were located on different floors in company headquarters in the wake of the collapse of internet and other technology stocks and the discoveries of control fraud at enron and other prominent companies in 2001 serious questions were raised about analyst objectivity not only did analysts fail to see the trouble ahead at many firms they continued to give stocks buy rating even after the issuing corporation had been publicly linked to scandal104 new york attorney general eliot spitzer launched an investigation into analyst conduct at new york investment banks spitzer took advantage of new yorks seldomused martin act which gives the attorney general broad authority to go after brokers who promote stocks beyond reasonable expectations or unwarranted by existing circumstances in april 2002 spitzer filed an affidavit in new york state court alleging that stock analysts from merrill lynch issued positive research reports on technology companies whose stock merrill was selling even though the analysts private opinion of the firms prospect was strongly negative to support his charges spitzer released internal emails by merrill analysts including henry blodgett techstock analyst who became media star during the late 1990s for his bullish predictions company that received top ratings in published research might be described inhouse as piece of junk or worse one analyst worried that regular investors are losing their retirement because of misleading advice but went along with the game 105 soon after spitzers charges against merrill lynch were made public the sec launched formal inquiry into potential conflicts of interest facing wall street analysts several states also joined spitzer and the sec in an expanded investigation of wall street firms the investigations resulted in global settlement involving dozen of the largest investment banking firms besides merrill lynch under the terms of the settlement the firms agreed to pay fines totaling about 14 billion to change their analyst compensation practices to make new disclosures in analyst reports and to institute other reforms 103 christine m bae and carlton r asher jr chinese wallsprocedures and remedies

sarbanesoxley act directed the sec to adopt new rules to restrict the prepublication clearance of research or recommendations by investment bankers not directly responsible for investment research limit the supervision and compensatory evaluation of research personnel to officials not engaged in investment activities and protect securities analysts from retaliation or threats of retaliation by investment banking staff because of unfavorable research reports the act specified that the rules must also require stock analyst to disclose the extent to which he owns stock being discussed whether he or his employer has received any income from the company whose stock is being discussed whether his employer has had any business dealings within the past year with the company and whether the analysts compensation was tied to investment banking revenue in february 2003 the sec adopted regulation analyst certification regulation ac 106 regulation ac requires that brokers dealers and certain persons associated with broker or dealer include in research reports certifications by the research analyst that the views expressed in the report accurately reflect his or her personal views and disclose whether or not the analyst received compensation or other payments in conne ction with his or her specific recommendations or views brokerdealers would also be required to obtain periodic certifications by research analysts in connection with the analysts public appearances 2004 study finds that the settlement and sec reforms have had measurable effect on analyst recommendations kadan wang and zach report th at while analysts employed by investment banks still tend to be more optimistic than independent analysts the difference is significantly less marked than before the reforms107 while analyst bias probably played very minor role in the broad scheme of corporate scandals and stock market boomandbust the issue illustrates how abusive practices can persist as an open secret among market participants the fact that spitzer with his small staff uncovered crooked practices that the sec had apparently failed to notice raised questions about whether the federal agency had become too accommodating of the securities industry was the secs lack of aggressive action the result of the hyperbolical market climate of the 1990s when stocks that traditional valuation models would have scorned continued to soar year after year or does it reflect more basic problem that regulators face by focusing on individual acts of egregious misbehavior they may miss systemic problems hidden in plain sight that gradually evolve into business as usual

that whitecollar crime is form of organized crime in 1998 the solicitor general of canada ggested the following definition of organized crime economically motivated illicit activity of two or more individuals whether formally or informally organized where the negative imp act of said activity could be considered significant from an economic social violence generation health and safety andor environmental perspective 110 this definition fits the concept of corporate fraud in several ways additional factors not found in this definition include the ongoing nature of the criminal activity the conspiracy of the individuals involved and the potential to use corruption as means other definitions distinguish organized crime from whitecollar crime by focusing on the non violent nature of the latter for example nonviolent crime for financial gain committed by means of deception by persons whose occupation status is entrepreneurial professional or semiprofessional and utilizing their special occupational skills and opportunities also nonviolent crime for financial gain utilizing deception and committed by anyone having special technical and professional knowledge of business and government irrespective of the persons occupation 111 whitecollar crime is defined as subset of organized crime characterized not by violence but by criminal acts related to the perpetrators professional skills and occupations in the context of corporate fraud it generally refers to pattern of deceitful acts not single isolated transgression

excessive risktaking due to moral hazard is not necessarily criminal but moral hazard is frequently cited as factor in corporate fraud cases how do we distinguish between moral hazard and criminal intent according to black et risktaking is activity that stays within the boundary of the law and in general is designed to increase profits or garner sufficient income to maintain solvency

be able to detect the vulnerability in the system that is attractive to criminal activity key weakness in the fight against whitecollar crime is the infrequency of prosecution because of their complexity whitecollar crimes are often difficult to detect and prosecute complex cases may involve extensive and convoluted paper trails complex financial or accounting maneuvers money laundering andor tiers of participants who may not know what the others are doing and not all of whom may have criminal intent compounding these difficulties is the recent allocation of investigatory resources to antiterrorism programs many investigators with experience in tracking the complicated financial schemes of whitecollar crime are now devoted to tracking the finances of terrorist groups as corporate structures becomes increasing complex and geographically diffuse agencies are often faced with problems relating to jurisdiction another weakness in deterrence is that whitecollar criminals tend to have access to extensive legal resources this makes successful prosecution more costly and less likely the incentive and advancement structures for most prosecutorial agencies place emphasis on success rates and efficient allocation of resources in those circumstances only crimes likely to be prosecuted successfully with minimum of cost are likely to be referred for action given the obstacles to successful prosecution agencies are often reluctant to take legal action even after whitecollar crimes have been uncovered and perpetrators have been identified whitecollar criminals are thought to be less averse to risk state by itself that makes deterrence challenging whitecollar criminals tend not to have criminal records and are often described by criminologists as high status respectable criminals if person intent on committing fraud knows there are few obstacles and consequences to scheme the only thing preventing this behavior is the individuals own conscience

frauds to continue with little deterrence and low probability of detection another possible reason why person would not be av erse to risk has sociological explanation when company employs person their perception of identity now includes their membership in the organization person integrates sense of selfworth into their identification as an employee people are assumed to be motivated to secure and maintain identities that help them gain social approval from meaningful others and inclusion in meaningful groups the goal of adopting certain organizational behavior then is to build and maintain valued business relationships if person chooses to deviate from what is accepted normal behavior for that organization the person risks isolation and ostracism but once the deviant behavior becomes normal for daily operations of the company then the groupaccepted view of deviant behavior is that which is threat to the organizations bot tom line hence whistleblowers acting for the

prosecution is growth industry which is lose proposition for politicians seeking elected office 115 the public will always vote for someone they believe will take tough stance against crime in its varied forms however the growth in prosecutions continues to be in the area of illegal drug activity according to wisenberg whitecollar crime has not been an area of growth for the average prosecutor there is limited advancement unless that person can show high rate of success in the courtroom prosecuting whitecollar crimes as noted above is difficult and uncertain an additional problem with prosecution is the increasing reliance on the federal sentencing guidelines which shifted the power to set punishment away from judges and towards prosecutors the judiciary authority and power to set sentences was inherited through english common law and supported by supreme court decisions over the past two centuries in judges hands the sentence could range from too light for serious offenses to too burdensome for minor infractions typically whitecollar criminals received very light sentences due to their higher social status congress sought to rectify this imbalance with amendments to the guidelines to more narrowly define the level of punishment judge could administer the outcome was to shift the discretion towards prosecutors this situation righted the disparity in sentencing but reduced transparency in the decisionmaking process the governments prosecution and sentencing strategies are often worked out long before the prosecutors enter the courtroom

driven largely by the publics wish to feel protected from crime extensive media coverage of bluecollar crimes especially violent ones bolsters public perceptions that crime is occurring more frequently than is supported by the data public pressure presumably based on these perceptions rewards policymakers who get tough on crime the major policy tool used to address bluecollar crimes has

corporate fraud schemes and other whitecollar crime has been extensive both the public and policymakers have been less inclined towards similar get tough strategy for dealing with these crimes this situation invites number of important research questions why has there not been call to lock up whitecollar criminals and throw away the key what are the circumstances that have created an environment that is vulnerable to white collar crime in the criminal justice system regulatory agencies and corporate governance procedures lastly what options are available to address whitecollar crime get tough tactics appear to be less effective in addressing whitecollar crime largely because whitecollar crimes involve money and not physical harm to the victims additionally white collar crime often lacks the image of the easily identified victim reducing political motivation and inhibiting mobilization of resources the economic harm of whitecollar crime is typically spread over many individuals or

what options are available to better address whitecollar crime through the criminal justice system observers have offered some possible answers to these questions including sentencing guidelines limiting the judiciarys flexibility in meting out justice have arguably caused an imbalance in the court system instead of the former disparity in sentencing some claim that there is now less transparency in the decisionmaking process since prosecutors essentially make sentencing determinations before the trial the fact that estimates of the costs of fraud are rough and imprecise this prompts some to maintain that more research and better data collection are needed to determine the real severity of the impact on american citizens in the areas of statistical reporting and research on fraud there is paucity of information existing instruments for measuring crime often fail to accurately assess whitecollar crime rates both because of survey construction and the inherent limited mechanisms of data collection

additional deterrents the government through federal and state agencies can launch civil litigation against corporations or individuals for example the sec can levy civil damages against offending ceos and bar them from gaining similar futu re employment with publiclyheld company another type of civil action is privateone brought by an individual or entity against another individual or entity for breach of contract or breach of some other legal duty the threat of civil suits by an individual plaintiff class of plaintiffs or other private entity also acts as potential deterrent to corporate fraud civil penalties from such actions can include monetary fines for damages loss of employment andor disbarment and can sometimes be more costly to an individual than criminal penalties recent trends in jurisprudence and legislation however have tended to increase the protections corporate officers and boards enjoy from civil liability it remains to be seen whether recent corporate scandals

of directors and officers vary among the states however some civil causes of action are based upon federal securities laws and as result are uniform among the states in the corporate fraud context the most common plaintiffs are shareholders an individual shareholder may bring direct suit on his own behalf for injuries he has suffered as shareholder of the corporation group of shareholders may also join together to bring classaction suit for injuries suffered by all of them as shareholders or shareholder may bring what is called derivative actionthe shareholder files an action on behalf of or as

rules related to securities trading sec rule 10b5 was promulgated by the commission in 1942 and in 1947 was established as valid basis for private litigation rule 10b5 prohibits the seller of securities from making certain fraudulent and untruthful statements the rule states it shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange 1 to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud 2 to make any untrue statement of material fact or to omit to state

operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of any security litigation under rule 10b5 became much more common until the supreme court first began limiting the scope of the rule in 1975 the rule had been interpreted very broadly to encompass many types of fraud misreporting and deception and early case law was generally very favorable to plaintiffs116 rule 10b5 was applicable to securities issued by both closelyheld and publiclytraded corporations 116 robert w hamilton and jonathan r macey cases and materials on corporations 8th ed st

the us supreme court led to several court decisions which began to limit the use of rule 10b5 in private securities litigation117 in blue chip v manor drug stores 421 us 723 1975 the court limited the type of plaintiffs allowed under rule 10b5 to purchasers or sellers of securities in 1976 case the court held that private plaintiff under rule 10b5 must prove intentional wrongdoing on the part of the defendant118 1977 supreme court ruling held that rule 10b5 only applied to cases involving deceptionnot to unfair transactions which were appropriately disclosed119 additionally the statute of limitations of rule 10b5 was uniformly established by the court in 1991 to be one year after discovery or three years after the transaction involving fraud or deception120 lastly the court ruled in 1992 that plaintiff bringing an action under rule 10b5 must show that the defendants violations of the rule actually caused the plaintiffs loss121 despite these courtimposed limitations private securities litigation under rule 10b5 continued to be common one reason was 1979 sec amendment to its disclosure policies encouraging corporations to disclose forwardlooking information and projections regarding future financial performance but in response to fears about the filing of frivolous securities lawsuits or strike suits congress acted in 1995 to limit further the filing of suits under sec rule 10b5

these financial reports 123 there is precedent for courts creating private cause of action under federal securities law in ji case co v borak the us supreme court held that civil action could be brought under 14a9 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 even though the statute did not provide for private cause of action 124 the court held that since the overall aim of the statute was to protect shareholders it made sense for shareholders to be able to bring civil actions under the statute for damages incurred also the supreme court recognized that the sec had limited resources and that allowing private cause of action would act as needed supplement to the secs enforcement of the law however since borak was decided the supreme court has tended to more strictly limit the implied creation of private causes of action by federal securities statute at present it is unclear whether section 906 of the sarbanesoxley act will give rise to private causes of action

the care that person in like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances the standard for this duty of care has changed over time and differs in each jurisdiction even when directors violate this duty of care they are often shielded by the commonlaw business judgment rule the business judgment rule acts as presumption that directors acted in good faith and forces

unwilling to attach liability to directors for standard of care that fell below the level of fraud illegality or conflict of interest but 1985 ruling by the supreme court of delaware held that directors were liable for breaching their duty of care if they acted with gross negligence125 the corporate community and state legislatures including delaware quickly reacted against this ruling by the normally influential delaware court legislatures began passing raincoat statutes to allow corporations to shield corporate directors from personal liability in cases where the directors acted in good faith did not breach their duty of loyalty to the corporation and did not derive an improper personal benefit from the transaction involved 126 so the recent trend is to shield directors from liability regarding breach of their duty of care to the corporation unless their actions involve illegality bad faith or conflicts of interest the justification for these raincoat provisions is that allowing directors to be personally liable for breaches of their duty of care would discourage many individuals from serving of boards of publiclyheld companies mbca 830 also provides that directors are entitled to rely on the opinions of experts such as corporate officers and employees auditors accountants and attorneys when making corporate decisions directors may be able to escape civil liability if reliance on these experts is warranted and reasonable the director cannot escape liability by relying on information from an expert which the director knows to be incorrect in addition to duty of good faith and duty of care directors also have duty of loyalty to the corporation under this duty directors can be held liable for selfdealing transactions transactions between director and the corporation and usurping corporate opportunities for oneself historically transactions that involved conflict sofinterest between directors and the corporation were not allowed by courts but recently courts have upheld selfdealing transactions where the terms were fair to the corporation if it is unclear whether the terms are fair or not courts have upheld selfdealing transactions where majority of uninterested directors has approved the transaction g6g158g157g146g142g156g561g152g143g561g17g143g143g146g140g142g155g156g561 officers are bound by fiduciary duty to act in the best

circumstances duty of care and 3 in manner the officer reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation section 842b also allows officers to rely on the opinions of employees and

directors and officers of corporations are protecte d from civil liability by number of provisions both statutory and based upon common law th previous section discussed the business judgment rule officers and directors warranted reliance on employee and expert information and raincoat statutes which allow corporation to shield its directors from liability in certain cases the following section will elaborate upon the business judgment rule and address the issues of indemnification insurance and the requirements of bringing shareholder derivative suits as further protections from personal liability for directors and officers background of the business judgment rule the corporate business form itself is usually sele cted by individuals who are seeking to protect themselves from civil liability especially to protect themselves from personal liability for unpaid debts should the business fail choosing to form corporation instead of partnership for example is choice made to shield oneself from civil liability major part of the protection from liability comes from common law concept called the business judgment rule as corporate law in the united states developed during the early 20 th century cases came before courts in which plaintiffs usually shareholders in corporations made arguments that alleged unsound business judgment by the directors or managers of the corporation in response the judiciary claimed it did not have the experience or the inclination to look into and closely scrutinize the business decisions made by corporate directors and managers it declined to make rulings based upon evaluating the soundness of corporations officers business judgment 127 most common law jurisprudence since has followed what has become known as the business judgment rule however the business judgment rule does not in theory act to shield corporate directors or officers from liability in instances of blatant incompetence or outright fraud but the business judgment rule has been held to excuse directors or officers from liability in regard to their exercise of the duty of care in applying the business judgment rule courts will only examine the validity and fairness of the process of corporate director and manager decisionmaking the appropriate test looks at whether 1 due care wa s used in ascertaining relevant facts and law before making the decision and 2 the decision was made after reasonable deliberation128 courts applying the rule decline to examine the correctness or prudence of the decisionmade as long as the process by which it was made was reasonable so the business judgment rule provides presumption that officers and directors acted in good faith it is up to plaintiff in civil case to prove otherwise in most circumstances indemnification and insurance indemnification and director and officer insurance act to protect directors and officers from personal expense related to lawsuits brought against them in their official capacity 129 sections 850859 of the mbca deal with the indemnification and insurance of officers and directors of corporation indemnification means that the corporation reimburses defendant officer or

paid to settle suit paid in judgment of civil suit or paid for criminal fine indemnification can also take the form of advances for expenses in which case the corporation pays expenses before final judgment is rendered in case the reasoning behind indemnification and directors and officers do insurance is that without these protections few qualified individuals would be willing to serve on corporate boards or as officers of corporations other arguments in favor of these devices are that they encourage innocent individuals to resist untrue charges and that they discourage frivolous suits by shareholders however while it is generally accepted that officers and directors should be reimbursed for expenses when they are successful in defending lawsuit indemnification when officers or directors are found civilly or criminally liable would seem to be against public policy for example the sec has taken the stance that it is against public policy for corporations to indemnify officers and directors against liabilities imposed under the securities act of 1933 indemnification is governed by state law each state sets its own limits on indemnification but most follow the general provisions of the mbca mbca 852 requires indemnification for director who is wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of proceeding this means that corporation must indemnify the legal expenses of director who successfully defends case even if his success is won on procedural not substantive basis for example director who has case dismissed because the statute of limitations has run must be indemnified by the corporation in cases where the merits are never litigated it is assumed that the director does have an underlying substantive defense that was not yet heard mbca 851 provides the conditions under which corporation may indemnify director in order to be eligible for indemnification director must have 1 acted in good faith 2 must have reasonably believed that his actions were in the best interests of the corporation if in his official capacity or at least that his conduct was not opposed to the best interests of the corporation if outside his official capacity and 3 in the case of criminal proceeding the director must have had reasonable cause to believe his conduct wa s unlawful the director also may only recover reasonable expenses in derivative suit brought against him directors may not be indemnified if found liable in suit alleging the director received financial benefit to which he was not entitled mbca 856 provides the conditions under which corporation may indemnify an officer essentially mandatory indemnification of an offi cer is required under the same circumstances as applied to director permissive indemnification is allowed as well generally under the same standards as applied to directors however if an officer is not also director the corporation may provide for further indemnification of the officer unless the officer received an undue financial benefit intentionally harmed the corporation or its shareholders or intentionally violated criminal law under the mbca director or officer is not igible for indemnification if found liable to the corporation itself under derivative suit filed by shareholder on the corporations behalf however in few states which do not follow the mbca indemnification is permitted even where the officer or director is found liable in derivative suit which would seem to fly in the face of public policies aimed at preventing fraud

liability insurance for its directors and officers do do insurance provides protection against costs and liability for negligence for misconduct not involving dishonesty or knowing bad faith and for false or misleading statements in disclosure documents however there are several exclusions from do policies they include 1 conduct that is sufficiently selfserving or egregious 2 conduct which is insurable by other types of insurance policies like bodily injury and 3 laser exclusions which apply only to certain industries recent corporate scandals and higher monetary settlements in class action suits have resulted in higher costs for do insurance premiums derivative action requirements the last protection from personal liability enjoyed by officers and directors of corporations to be discussed in this section comes from the statutory requirements connected to bringing derivative lawsuit as previously discussed derivative suit is lawsuit brought by an individual shareholder on behalf of the corporate entity itself for harm done to the corporation in contrast direct suit by shareholder would be for harm suffered directly by the shareholder derivative suits may be brought in many contexts for violation of federal and state securities laws and violation of legal duties owed by officers and directors to corporations derivative suits have been both praised as important devices to check misconduct by corporate insiders and criticized as overwhelmingly frivolous litigation brought mostly to enrich aggressive plaintiffs attorneys regardless several requirements must be met for derivative suit to be brought on behalf of corporation the bringing of derivative suits is governed by state laws and is not uniform however many states require that in order to bring or maintain derivative lawsuit shareholder must make demand essentially ask the permission of the current board of directors of the corporation this issue of making demand on the board is complex and has been the subject of much conflicting jurisprudence generally shareholder must make demand on the corporation in order to bring derivative suit if the demand to bring the suit is rightfully refused the shareholder cannot bring the suit when examining the decision by board of directors to disallow derivative suit courts in most states will apply the business judgment ruleas long as the procedures followed by the board were reasonable the decision itself will not be challenged the board of directors can also ask the court to dismiss derivative suit under the mbca 744 if the board believes the bringing of the suit is not in the best interests of the corporation under the mbca shareholder is required to make demand upon the board in order to bring derivative suit this gives great deal of power to the board if derivative suit implicates one or more directors those directors generally will not participate in the vote to determine whether the suit will be continued in some cases majority of the members of the board of directors will be implicated as defendants in the derivative suit in such cases shareholder may or may not be excused from making demand upon the board to bring the suit depending on the jurisdiction and the level of interestedness of the directors in the transaction being questioned by the derivative suit but the board may still create special litigation committee composed of uninterested directors to decide whether to allow filed suit to continue if the slc decides the suit is not in the best interests of the corporation the slc can ask to the court to dismiss the suit whether the court should apply the good faith presumption of the business judgment rule to the decision of an slc is difficult issue which varies among jurisdictions but generally the burden of proof falls on the board of directors if the majority of the board of directors is interested in the derivative litigation the burden of disproving the

the shareholder bringing the derivative action if the majority of directors on the board are not interested in the derivative litigation the modern trend in jurisprudence has been to restrict the bringing of derivative actions in virtually all cases of derivative litigation considered by boards of directors or special litigation committees since 1984 the decision by the directors has been that the suit is not in the best interests of the corporation some would argue this is the result of frivolous lawsuits being filed others would say that this shows structural bias among directors 130 in regard to the latter some academics have argued that directors when asked to decide whether to pursue derivative suit against other directors on the board suffer from structural bias131 structural bias is the tendency of directors to not pursue actions against other directors it is due to directors generally being in the same social circles and having friendly relationships as well as directors knowing that if they were implicated in the next derivative suit they would not want the suit approved by the board the argument is that the culture of boards of directors and the selfinterest of directors result in few derivative actions being pursued regardless of the causes derivative suits function to deter and remedy fraud and misconduct among corporate directors and managers over the last 20 to 30 years the number of derivative suits brought on behalf of corporations has declined some have indicated that this decline should be seen as failure in the realm of corporate governance

fraud through suits brought under state federal and commonlaw grounds however recent trends in legislation and jurisprudence have acted to restrict the filing of private lawsuits and the personal liability of corporate directors and officers one reason to restrict liability is to encourage qualified and responsible people to sit on corporate boards of directors however protections like raincoat provisions the business judgment rule reliance on expert opinions inde mnification and do insurance and the power of directors in deciding whether to allow derivative suits all limit the ultimate accountability of boards of directors and corporate management in civil litigation most corporate law is state based law but congress does have jurisdiction over companies with nationally

detect and prevent fraud in the future it is important to understand some of the reasons why the recent wave of control fraud came when it did some possible explanations that may be unique to this period in history are listed below the long bull market allowed companies to conceal financial difficulties because stock analysts regulators and above all investors were willing to believe in company financials that defied traditional rational explanation in addition the technology and internet booms created furious investor demand for new companies with rosy forecasts but revenues the conventional wisdom was if you can make money at it great the increasing acceptance of financial innovations in both the business and accounting fields created an environment in which accounting creativity was rewarded auditing was loss leader as consulting became the major profit center for big accounting firms therefore the pressure was strong for accounting companies to overlook audit irregularities in order to help sell the client their consulting services an alternative view is that accounting and management scandals are to be expected whenever long period of market exuberance winds down if the phenomenon is seen as primarily cyclical the unique circumstances of the 1990s listed above may have influenced the scope and particular features of the scandals but the underlying dynamics have appeared before and will return finally some observers whose faith in market di scipline has not been shaken by the outbreak of fraud would say that the postenron reaction is simply evidence of the system working by purging the markets of bad apples g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 mark jickling specialist in
