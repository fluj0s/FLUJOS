thumbnails once the thumbnails were created the program d eleted the fullsized originals from the server arriba altered its display format sever times in response to search query the search engine produced results page which listed of number of reduced thumbnail images when user would doublec lick these images full sized version of the image would appear from january 1999 to june 1999 the

where an image from sec ond website is viewed within frame that is pulled into the primary sites web page cu rrently when user clicks on the thumbnail the user is sent to the originating site via an out line link link that directs the user from the linkingsite to the linkedto site2 arribas crawler copied 35 of kellys c opyrighted photographs into the arriba database kelly sued arriba for copyright infringement complaining of arribas thumbnails as well as its inline and framing li nks the district court ruled that arribas use of both the thumbnails and the full sized images was fair use3kelly appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals the ninth circuits decision on appeal the ninth circuit affirmed the district courts finding that the reproduction of image s to create the thumbnails and their display by arribas search engine was fair use but it reversed the lower court holding that arribas inline display of the larger image was fair use as well4 thumbnails an owner of copyright has the exclusive right to reproduce copies of the work5to establish claim of copyright infringement by reproduction the plaintiff must show ownership of the copyright and copying by the defendant there was dispute that kelly owned the copyright to the images and that arriba copied those images therefore the court ruled kelly established prima facie case of copyright infringement6 however claim of copyright infringement is subject to certain statutoryexceptions including the fair use exception7this exception permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when on occasion it would stifle the very creativity which that statute is designed to foster8 to determine whether arribas use of k ellys images was fair use the court weighed four factors 1 the purpose and char acter of the use including whether such usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21206crs3 9the supreme court has held that the central purpose of this investigation is to see whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation or instead adds something new with further purpose or different character altering the first with new expression meaning or message it asks in other words whether and to what extent the new work is transformative campbell v acuffrose music inc 510 us 569 579 1994 1017 usc 107 11kelly 330 f3d at 818 n 14 citing campbell 510 us at 579 12kelly 330 f3d at 818 while kellys images were artistic works used for illustrative purposes and to portray scenes from the american west in an aesthetic manner arribas use of kellys images in the thumbnails was unrelated to any aesthetic purpose arribas search engine functions as tool to help index and improve acce ss to images on the internet and their related websites 13idat 819 14see id at 820 15see id while wholesale copying does not preclude fair use per copying an entire work militates against finding of fair use however the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use if the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use then this factor will not weigh against him or her idat 821 applying this principle the court found that if arriba only copied part of the image it would be more difficult to identify it thereby reducin g the usefulness of the visual search engine therefore the court concluded it was reasonable to copy the entire image 16idat 821 citing campbell 510 us at 590 see also 3 m nimmer d nimmer n immer continuedis of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes92 the nature of the copyrighted work 3 the amount and substan tiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole and 4 the ffect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work10 applying the first factor to this case the c ourt noted that the more transformative the new work the less important the other factors including commercialism become11 and held that the thumbnails were transformative because they were much smallerlowerresolution images that served an entirel different function than kellys original images 12furthermore it would be unlikelyth at anyone would use arribas thumbnails for illustrative or aesthetic purposes because larging them sacrifices their clarity the court found13thus the first fair use factor weighed in favor of arriba the court held that the second factor the nature of the copyrighted work weighed slightly in favor of kelly because the photographs were creative in nature14the third factor the amount and substantiality of the portion used was deemed not to weigh in either partys favor even though rriba copied the entire image15 finally the court held that the fourth fact or the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted wor k weighed in favor of arriba the fourth factor required the court to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant would result in substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original16the court

kellys ability to sell or license his fullsized images arriba does not sell or license its thumbnails to other parties anyone who downl oaded the thumbnails would not be successful selling the fullsized images because of the lowresolution of the thumbnails there would be way to view create or sell clear fullsized image without going to kellys websites idat 821822and use of the thumbnails would not harm th market for or value of kellys images17 accordingly on balance the court found that the display of the thumbnails was fair use
