finance division summary as the 110th congress begins to address stat and urban area homeland security matters it might opt to review activitie s funded with federa l homeland security assistance to ensure readiness for both terrorist attacks and natural disasters two potential activities that congress might choose to focus on are the certification of state and urban area homeland security plans and th conduct of exercises to test the plans the department of homeland security requires some plan s but does not certify them nor does it require regular testin g of the plans with exercises the department however has reviewed federal state and urban area emergency ope rations plans and issued report on its findings in june 2006 this crs report addresses po ssible policy questions associated with homeland security plans and exercises these issues go beyond the federal allocation of homeland security assistance to how states and urban areas use federal funding to prepare for terro rist attacks and natural disasters this report will be updated when the partment of homeland security actions warrant the department of homeland security dhs provides assistance programs such as the state homeland security grant program shsgp and the urban area security initiative uasi to states and localities to assure readiness for both terrorist attacks and natural and manmade disasters among the eligible activities for which states and localities may use dhs assistance are 1 state and local pla nning to respond to terrorist attacks and catastrophic events and 2 conduc ting exercises to test these plans dhs does not currently certify state and local pl ans and does not require regularly scheduled state and local exercises because of the lack of such requirement s congress might opt to address possible policy questions in its continuing oversight of dhs activities and identify possible steps to strengthen the nations homeland security some of the policy questions might include the

emergency operations and homeland security plans as condition of assistance should dhs require specific activities to be part of state and urban area homeland security plans should dhs require and administe r state and urban area homeland security exercises state and urban area plans since dhss inception its requi rements for state and local planning have evolved prior to fy2006 dhs required states and urban areas identified as urban area security initiative uasi recipients to provide homeland security strategy as condition of assistance the strategy consis ted of summary of the states and urban areas plans to address such issues as interoperable communications first responder protective equipment and capabilities to respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction states and urban areas were required to provide along with the strategy an implementation plan that outlined how federa l homeland security assistance funds would be used to address the issues id entified in the strategy document1 in addition to the homeland security st rategy dhs in fy2006 required states and uasi urban areas to develop capability enhancement plan that outlined how they intend to achieve the capabilities identified in the national preparedness goal in conjunction with this effort states and uasi recipients are required to submit an investment justification that explains the need for federal homeland security assistance funding and how the funding would be used to address the states or urban areas capability enhancement plan2 additionally dhs requires states and urba n areas to assess their own evacuation plans to be eligible for fy2007 homeland s ecurity funding once the assessments have been conducted dhs sends team of former state and local emergency management and homeland security personnel to visit each state and urban area to review homeland security plans including the evacuation plan s and determine indi vidual state and urban area needs for planning assistance the stat and urban area selfassessment is to include information on the current capability for ma ss evacuations catastrophic event planning the status of emergency operations plans the identification of shortterm actions to correct critical problems and description of longterm actions to build capability to address the identified critical problems states and urban areas are also required to selfcertify these homeland security plans including evacua tion plans through checklist provided by dhs3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22393crs3 4 us department of homeland security offi ce for

available at httpwwwojpusdojgovodpassessments hspd8htm visited jan 11 2006in june 2006 dhs released report following its review of federa l state and urban area emergency operations plans and the department found numer ous shortcomings including the following state and urban area emergency operati ons plans and planning processes are not fully adequate feasible or acceptable to manage catastrophic events as defined by the national response plan states and urban areas are not conducting adequate collaborativeplanning state and urban area basic plans do not adequately addr ess continuity of operations and government states and urban areas need to improve communication systems andprocedures and states and urban areas have significant weaknesses in their evacuationplans 4 policy questions two policy questions of possible interest to congress are whether dhs should certify stat and urban area homeland secu rity plans and whether dhs should require the plans to deal with sp ecific homeland security activities although dhs now requires review of state and local plans and requires states and localities to provide capability enhancement plan and an investment justification dhs does not now certify state and urban area homeland secur ity plans some might argue that without certification or accreditation of the plans dhs can not confirm the ability of states or urban areas to respond to terrorist attacks or natural disasters moreover the lack of federal certification process might result in states and urban areas having inadequate plans which in turn might result in the federal government having to bear greater share of the burden following terrorist attack or natural disaster ho wever certification of state and urban area homeland security pl ans may add an additional administrative burden dhs does not identify what homeland secur ity plans state or urban area should have dhs does provide terrori sm and natural disaster scenarios that states and urban areas should be capable of responding to nd also list of capabilities that are required in responding to the scenarios5 arguably without further guidance on what plans to develop states and urban areas might have an inadequate res ponse to terrorist attacks and natural disasters but without further guid ance states and urban areas might have the opportunity to ensure their plans are flexible to react to catastrophic events that are unique to specific geographical areas besides selfassessing and lfcertifying the plans as required states and urban areas are encouraged to use the emergency management accreditation program emap to assess and accredit their plans voluntarily emap is an independent nonprofit organization that administers voluntary assessment and accreditation

selfassessment and selfaccreditation might provide adequate guidance for emergency response planning without list of required plans however states and localities may not ssess and accredit the necessary plans for preparing for and responding to terrorist incidents and catas trophic events on the other hand this voluntary assessment and accreditation may result in guidance and assistance that is tailored to each individual state and urban area and thus avoid the possibility of dhs developing national template that does not take into account the specific needs of each state and urban

security plans separate from the voluntary emap assessment and accredita tion as condition to receive fy2006 federal homeland security assistance there is requirement to test the plans at any regular interval some observers are concerned that the lack of an exercise requirement could result in states and urba n areas being inadequately pr epared to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks and natural disasters although states and urban areas presently conduct various homeland security exercises the frequency and caliber of any exercises they may conduct are not available to crs dhs does authorize states and urban ar eas to use federal homeland security assistance to develop and conduct homeland secu rity exercises exercises conducted with this assistance are required to be thr eat
