proceeding with description and explication of espy and judicial watch and the recent civil enforcement ruling to review and understand the prior case law and how it has ffected the positions of the disputants the watergate cases in interbranch information disputes si nce the early 1980s executive statements and positions taken in justification of assertions of executive privilege have frequently rested upon explanations of execu tive privilege made by the courts to better understand the executives stance in th is area and the potential impact on those positions by the espy and judicial watch rulings crs will chronologically examine the development of the judiciarys appr oach and describe how the executive has adapted the judicial expl anations of the privilege to support its arguments in nixon v sirica 11 the first of the watergate cases panel of the district of columbia circuit rejected president nixons claim that he was absolutely immune from all compulsory process whenever he asserted formal claim of executive privilege holding that while presiden tial conversations are presumptively privileged12 the presumption could be overcom by an appropriate showing of public need by the branch seeking access to the conversations in sirica uniquely powerful albeit undefined showing was deem ed to have been made by the special prosecutor that the tapes subpoenaed by th grand jury contained evidence necessary to carrying out the vital function of determining whether probable cause existed that those indicted had committed crimes13 the dc circuit next addressed the senate watergate committees effort to gain access to five presidential tapes in senate select committee on presidential campaign activities v nixon 14 the appeals court initially determined that the staged decisional structure established in nixon v sirica was applicable with at least equal force here15 thus in order to overcome the presumptive privilege and require the submission of materials for cour t review strong showing of need had to be established the appeals court held that the committee had not met its burden of showing that the subpoenaed evidence is demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of th committees functi on16 the court held that in view of the initiation of impeachment proceedings by the house judiciary committee the overlap of the investigative

the subpoenaed materials were critical to the performance of its legislative functions18 the court could discern specific legislative decisions that cannot responsib ly be made without access to materials uniquely contained in the ta pes or without resolution of the ambiguities that the presidentially released transcripts may contain19 the court concluded that the subsequently initiated and nearly completed work of the house judiciary committee had in effect preempted the senate co mmittee more importa ntly there is indication that the findings of the hous committee on the judiciary and eventually the house of representatives itself are so likely to be inconclusive or long in coming that the select committee need s immediate access of its own20 the dc circuits view in senate select committee that the watergate committees oversight need for the requested materials was merely cumulative in light of the then concurrent impeachment inquiry has been utilized by the executive as the basis for arguing that the congress interest in executive information is less compelling when committees function is oversight than when it is considering specific legislative proposals21 this approach however arguably misreads the carefully circumscribed holding of the co urt and would seem to construe too narrowly the scope of cong ress investigatory powers the senate select committee courts opinion took great pains to underline the unique and limiting nature of the cases factual and historical context thus it emphasized the overriding nature of the events that have occurred since this litigation was begun and indeed since th district court issued its decision22 these included the commencement of impeachment proceedings by the house judiciary committee co mmittee with an express constitutional source whose investigative objectives substantially overlap those of the senate committee that the house committee was presently in possession of the very tapes sought by the select committee making the senate committees need for the tapes from ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30319crs5 23 id at 73233 24 id at 733 it is important to note that the select committee was established senate resolution 60 1973 as special investigation committee with legislative authority its sole mission was to determine the facts about the watergate breakin and its aftermath and report to the senate its findings and recommendations 25 2 the records of the constitutional conv ention of 1787 at 206 max farrand ed 1966 26 woodrow wilson congressional govern ment 195 198 meridian books

presidential conversations scrutinized by two committees simultaneously that the necessity for the tapes in order to make legislative judgments has been substantially undermined by subsequent events including the public re lease of transcripts of the tapes by the president the transfer of four of five of the original tapes to the district court and the lack of any indication that the findings of the house committee on the judiciary and eventually the house of representatives itself are so likely to be inconclusive or long in coming that the select committee needs immediate access of its own23 the appeals court conclude d by reiterating the uniquene ss of the cases facts and temporal circumstances we conclude that the need demonstrated by the select committee in the peculiar circumstances of this case including the subsequent and ongoing investigation of the house judiciary committee is too attenuated and too tangential to its functions to permit judicial judgment that the president is required to comply with the committees subpoena24 the executives position arguably ignor the roots of congress broad investigatory powers that reach back to the establishment of the constitution and which have been continually reaffirmed by the supreme court as george mason recognized at the constitutional conven tion congress are not only legislators but they possess inquisitorial power they mu st meet frequently to inspect the conduct of the public offices25 woodrow wilson remarked quite as important as legislation is vig ilant oversight of administration and even more important than legislation is the in struction and guidance in political affairs which the people might receive from body which kept all national concerns suffused in broad daylight of discussion the informing functions of congress should be preferred even to its legislative function the argument is not only that discussed and interroga ted administration is the only pure and efficient administration but more than th at that the only really selfgoverning people is that people which discusse s and interrogates its administration26 the supreme court has cited wilson favorably on this point27 moreover the court has failed to make any distinction between congress right to executive branch information in pursuit of its oversight f unction and in support of its responsibility to enact amend and repeal laws in fact the court has recognized that congress investigatory power comprehends probe s into department s of the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30319crs6 28 watkins v united states 354 us 173 187

courts very specific reasons fo r not enforcing the committees subpoena under the unique circumstance of that case and creates distinction between oversight and legislating that has yet to be embraced by the courts moreover the senate select committee panels demonstrably critical standard for overcoming presidents presumptive claim of privilege is not reflected in any of the subsequent supreme court or appellate court rulings establishing balancing test for overcoming the qualified presidential privilege two months after the ruling in senate select committee the supreme court issued its unanimous ruling in united states v nixon29 which involved judicial trial subpoena to the president at the request of the watergate special prosecutor for tape recordings and documents relating to the pr esidents conversations with close aides and advisors for the first time the court found constitutional basis for the doctrine of executive privilege in the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties and in the separation of powers30 b u t although it considered presidents communi cations with his close advisors to be presumptively privileged the court rejected the presidents contention that the privilege was absolute precluding judicial review whenever it is asserted31 also while acknowledging the need for confiden tiality of high leve l communications in the exercise of article ii powers the court stated that when the privilege depends solely on the broad undifferen tiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such communications confronta tion with other values arises32 i t h l d t h t absent need to protect military diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in confidentiality of presidential communications is significantly diminished by production of materials that are essential to the enfor cement of criminal statutes33 having concluded that the claim of pr ivilege was qualified the court resolved the competing interests the presidents need for confidentiality vs the judiciarys need for materials in criminal proceeding in manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch34 holding that the judicial need for the tapes as shown by demonstrated specific need for evidence in pending criminal trial outweighed the presidents generaliz ed interest in confidentiality 35 the court was careful however to limit the scope of its decision noting that we are not

president nixons presidential r ecords to the administrator of the general services administration who would screen them for personal and private materials which would be returned to mr nixon but preserve the rest for historical and governmental objectives the court rejected mr nixons challenge to the act which included an argument based on the presidential privilege of confidentiality38 although nixon ii did not involve an executive response to congressional probe several points emerge from the courts disc ussion that bear upon congress interest in confidential executive branch informati on first the court reiterated that the executive privilege it had announced in nixon i was not absolute but qualified39 second the court stressed the narrow scope of that privilege in nixon i the court held that the privilege is limited to communications in performance of presidents responsibilities of his office and made in the process of shaping policies and making decisions40 third the court found that there was substantial public interest in preserving these materials so that congress pursuant to its broad investigative power could examine them to understand the events that led to president nixons resignation in order to gauge the n ecessity for remedial legislation41 postwatergate cases two postwatergate cases both involvi ng congressional demands for access to executive information demonstrate both the judicial reluctance to involve itself in the essentially political confrontations such disputes represent and also the willingness to intervene where the political process appears to be failing in united states v att42 the dc circuit was unwilling to balance executive privilege claims against congressional demand for information unless and until the political

citizens allegedly made for national security purposes the justice department argued that the executive branch was entitled to sole c ontrol over the information because of its obligation to safeguard the national security44 the house of representatives as intervenor argued that its rights to the information flowed from its constitutionally implied power to investigate whether ther had been abuses of the wiretapping power the house also argued that the court had jurisdiction over the dispute because of the speech or debate clause the court rejected the conflicting claims of the executive and the congress to absolute authority45 with regard to the executives claim the court noted that there was absolute claim of executive privilege against congress even in the area of national security the executive would have it that the constitution confers on the executive absolute discretion in the area of national security this does not stand up while the constitution assigns to the pr esident number of powers relating to national security including the function of commander in chief and the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors it confers upon congress other powers equally inseparable from the na tional security such as the powers to declare war raise and support armed forces and in the case of the senate consent to treaties and the appointment of ambassadors46 likewise the court rejected the congressional claim that the speech or debate clause was intended to immunize c ongressional investigatory acti ons from judicial review congress investigatory power is not itself absolute47 according to the court judicial intervention in executive privilege disputes between the political branches is imprope r unless there has been good faith but unsuccessful effort at compromise48 there is in the constitution the court held duty that the executive and congress attempt to accommodate the needs of each other the framers rather than attempting to define and allocate all governmental power in minute detail relied we believe on the expectation that where conflicts in scope of authority arose between the coordinate branches spirit of dynamic compromise would promote resolution of the dispute in the manner most likely to result in efficient and effective f unctioning of our governmental system under this view the coordinate branches do not exist in an exclusively adversary relationship to one another when conflict in authority arises rather each branch should take cognizance of an implicit constitutional mandate to seekhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30319crs9 49 id

lawfully in refusing to release certain documents to congressional subcommittee at the direction of the president54 the administrator based her refu sal upon president r eagans invocation of executive privilege against house committee probing the epas enforcement of hazardous waste laws the court dismisse d the case without reaching the executive privilege claim on the ground that judicial intervention in dispute concerning the respective powers of the legislative and executive branches should be delayed until all possibilities for settlement have been exhausted55 compromise and cooperation rather than confrontation should be the aim of the parties 56 as the court of appeals had done in united states v att the district court in united states v house of representatives encouraged the political branches to settle their dispute rather than invite j udicial intervention only if the parties could not agree would the court intervene and resolve the interbranch dispute

privilege reagan through george w bush not surprisingly the executive branch has developed an expansive view of executive privilege in congressional investigations taking maximum advantage of the vague and essentially undefi ned terrain within the judi cially recognized contours of the privilege thus executive branch statements have identified four areas that are asserted to be presumptively covered by executive privilege foreign relations and military affairs two separate topics that are sometimes lumped together as state secrets law enforcement investigations and confidential information that reveals the executives deliberative process with respect to policymaking typically the executive has asserted executive privile ge based upon combination of the deliberative process exemption and one or more of the other categories as consequence much of the controversy surrounding invocation of executive privilege has centered on the scope of the delibera tive process exemption the executive has argued that at its core this category protects confidential predecisional deliberative material59 justifications for this exemp tion often draw upon the language in united states v nixon that identifies constitutional valu in the president receiving candid advice from his subordinates and awarene ss that any expectation of subsequent disclosure might temper needed candor60 the result has been presumption by the executive that its predecisional deliberati ons are beyond the scope of congressional demand congress will have legitima need to know the preliminary positions taken by executive branch officials during internal deliberations only in the rarest of circumstances 61 according to this view the need for the executive to preventhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30319crs11 61

discover information about ongoing policymaking with in the executive branch in that case the executive has argued the deliberative process exemption serves as an important boundary marking the separation of powers when congressional oversight is used as means of participating directly in an ongoing process of decisionmaking within the executive branch it oversteps the bounds of the proper legislative function62 the executive has also argued that becau candor is the principal value served by the exemption its protection should ex tend beyond predecisiona l deliberations to deliberations

issue the court held that the presidential communications privilege must cover communications made or received by presidential advisers in the c ourse of preparing advice for the president even if those communications are not made directly to the president the court rested its conclusion on the presidents dependence on presidential advisers and the inability of the deliberative process privilege to provide advisers with adequate freedom from the public spotlight and the need to provide sufficient elbow room for advisers to obtain information from all knowledgeable sources101 thus the privilege will apply both to communications which these advisers solicited and received from others as well as those they authored themselves the privilege must also extend to communications authored or received in re sponse to solicitation by members of presidential advisers staff102 the court however was acutely aware of the dangers to open government that limitless extension of the privilege risks and carefully cabined its reach by explicitly confining it to white house staff and not staff in the agencies and then only to white house staff that has operational proximity to

in particular the privilege should not extend to staff outsi the white house in executive branch agencies instead the privilege shoul d apply only to communications authored or solicited and received by those members of an immediate white house advisors staff who have broad and significant responsibility for investigation and formulating the advice to be given the president on the particular matter to which the communications relate only communications at that level are close enough to the president to be revelatory of his deliberations or to pose risk to the candor of his advisers see

only applies to communications that these advisers and their staff author or solicit and receive in the course of performing their function of advising the president on official government matters

president makes it imperative to identify the type of decisionmaking to which it refers clos reading of the opinion makes it arguable that it is meant to encompass only those functions that form the core of presidential authority invol ving what the court characterized as quintessential and nondelegable presidential power104 in the case before it the court was specifically referring to the presidents article ii ppointment and removal power which was the focal point of the advice he sought in the espy matter but it seems clear from the context of the opinion that the description was meant to be in juxtaposition with the appointment and removal power and in contrast with presiden tial powers and responsibilities that can be exercised or performed wit hout the presidents direct involvement pursuant to presidential delegation of authority or statutory framework105 the reference the court uses to illustrate the latter category is the presidents article

role in supervis ing and coordinating but not displacing decisionmaking in the executive branch remains unimpeded but his communications in furtherance of such activities would presumably not be cloaked by constitutional privilege such reading of this critical passage of the courts opini on is consonant with the courts view of the source and pur pose of the presidential communications privilege and its expressed need to confine it as narrowly as possible relying on nixon i the espy court identifies the presidents article ii powers and responsibilities as the constitutional basi s of the presidential communications privilege since the constitution assign s these responsibilities to the president alone arguably the privilege of confidentia lity that derives from it also should be the presidents alone107 again relying on nixon i the court pinpoints the essential purpose of the privilege tlhe privilege is rooted in the need for confidentiality to ensure that presidential decisionmaking is of the highest caliber informed by honest advice and knowledge confidentiality is what ensures the expression of candid objective and even blunt or harsh opini ons and the comprehensive exploration of all policy alternatives before presidential course of action is selected108 the limiting safeguard is that the privilege will apply in those instances where the

were withheld on the grounds that they were protected by the presidential co mmunications and deliberative process privileges the district court held that because the materials sought had been produced for the sole purpose of advising the president on quintessential and non delegable presidential power the exercise of the presidents constitutional pardon authority the extension of the presiden tial communications privilege to internal justice department documents which had not been solicited and received by the president or the office of the president was warranted112 the appeals court reversed concluding that internal agency documents that are not solicited and received by the president or his office are instead protected against disclosure if at all by the deliberative process privilege113 guided by the analysis of the espy ruling the panel majority emphasized that the solicited and received limitation is necessitated by the principles underlying the presidential communications privilege and recognition of the dangers of expanding it too far114 espy teaches the court explained that the privilege may be invoked only when presidential advisers in close proximity

generals pardon recommendations for the president the panel majority held that such brightline rule is inconsistent with the nature and principles of the presidential communications privilege as well as the goal of serving the public interest communications never r eceived by the president or his office are unlikely to be revelatory of his deliber ations nor is there any reason to fear that the

great pains to explain why espy and the case before it differed from the nixon and postwa tergate cases according to the court until in re sealed case the privilege had been tied specifically to direct communications of the president with his immediate white house advisors117 the espy court it explained was for the first time confronted with the question whether communications that the presidents closest dvisors make in the course of preparing advise for the president and which the pr esident never saw should also be covered by the presidential privilege the espy courts answer was to espouse limited extension of the privilege down the chai n of command beyond the president to his immediate white house advisors only recognizing the need to ensure that the president would receive full and frank dvice with regard to his nondelegable appointment and removal pow ers but was also wary of undermining countervailing considerations such as openness in government hence the espy court determined that while communications authored or solicited and received by immediate white house advisors in the ffice of the president could qualify under the privilege communications of staff out side the white house in executive branch agencies that were not solicited and received by such white house advisors could not118 the situation before the judicial watch court tested the espy principles while the presidential decision involved exercise of the presidents pardon power was certainly nondelegable core presidentia l function the operating officials involved the deputy attorney general and the pardon attorney were deemed to be too remote from the president and his senior white hous advisors to be protected the court conceded that functionally those officials were performing

decisionmaking is deemed so sensitive or important or unique that direct presence of presidential authority is appropriate where the exercise of such authority derives solely from the statutory dele gation and does not find its basi s in one of the socalled core constitutional powers of the president it is reasonable expectation of the congress that it will be able to determine whether and how the legislative intent has been carried out just as it does with its assignments to the departments and agencies view that any delegation of decisionmakin g authority directly to the president will thereby cloak it from congressional scrutin is not only anomalous but arguably counterproductive of interbra nch coordination cooperation and comity as it would discourage such delegations122 of course further judi cial development of the principles enunciated in espy may alter this vi ew of its scope recent developments george w bush claims of executive privilege in early 2007 the house judiciary committee and its subcommittee on commercial and administr ative law commenced an inquiry into the propriety of the termination and replacement of number of united states attorneys six hearings and numerous interviews were held by the committees between march and june 2007 essentially focusing on testimony with respect to actions of present and former department of justice doj officials and employees as well as doj documents relating to the matter on march 21 2007 the house subco mmittee authorized chairman john conyers jr to issue s ubpoenas to number of present and former

comittee and harriet miers relating to those committees investigations of the dismissal and replacement of nine us attorneys in 2006 had been deemed by the president subject to executive privilege and

not be resolved before dates scheduled for their appearances123 accompanying the fielding letter was legal memorandum prepared by acting attorney general paul d clement for the president detailing the legal basis for claim of executive privilege124 the memo identifies three categories of documents being sought 1 internal white house communications 2 communications by white house officials with individuals outside the executive branch including individuals in the legislative branch nd 3 communications between white house and justice department officials125 with respect to internal white house communications which are said to consist of discussions of the wisdom of removal and replacement proposals which us ttorneys should be removed and possible responses to congressional and media inquiri such discussions are claimed to be the types of internal deliberations among white house officials that fall squarely within the scope of executive privilege si nce their nondisclosure promotes sound decisionmaking by ensuring that senior g overnment officials nd their advisors may speak frankly and candidly during the decisionmaking process citing us v nixon since it is argued what is involved is the exercise of the presidential power to appoint and remove officers of the united states quintesse ntial and nondelegable presidential power citing espy the presidents protected confidentiality interests are particularly strong in this inst ance as conse quence an inquiring congressional committee would have to meet the standard established by the senate select committee decision requiring showing that the documents and information are demonstrably critical to the re sponsible fulfillment of the committees function126 thus it is claimed there is doubt whether the committees have oversight authority over deliberations essential to the exercise of this core presidential power or that their intere sts justify overriding claim of executive privilege as to the matters at issue127 with respect to category 2 matters i nvolving communications by white house officials with individuals outside the white house the clement memo asserts that confidentiality interest s undergirding the privilege are not diminished if the president or his close advisors have to go outside the white house to obtain information to make an informed decision particularly about core presidential power again espy and senate select committee are referred as supporting authority as to the final category respecting communications between the justice department and the white house concerning proposals to dismiss and replace us attorneys it is claimed that such communications are deliberative and clearly fall within the scope of executive privilege the presidents need to

authority over the nomination or replacement of us attorneys citing espy and senate select committee128 the privilege is asserted to extend to white house doj communications that have been previously disclosed to the committees by the department an argument that waiver may have occurred is contrary to relevant legal principles that should and do encourage rather than punish such accommodations by recognizing that congress need for such documents is reduced to the extent similar materials have been provided voluntarily as part of the accommodation pr ocess since the committees have these documents seeking the relevant comm unications would be cumulative under senate select committee129 this rationale is argued to s upport the lack of any need for the testimony of the former white house officials subpoenaed congressional interest in investigating th replacement of us attorneys clearly falls outside its core constitutional re sponsibilities and any legitimate interest congress may have in the disclosed communications has been satisfied by the departments extraordinary accommoda tion involving the extensive production of documents to the committees interviews and hearing testimony concerning these communications as the dc circ uit has explained because legislative judgements normally depend more on the predicted consequences of proposed legislative actions and their political ac ceptability congress will rarely need or be entitled to precise reconstruction of past events to carry out its legislative responsibilities senate select comm 498 f 2d at 732130 on june

principles that protect president from compelled congressional testimony also apply to senior presidential advisors because such ppearances would be tantamount to the president himself appearing the

procedure by morton rosenberg and todd b tatelman principally dealt with the executives cl aims that the suit should be dismissed because the committee 1 lacked standing 2 had not stated cause of action authorizing the suit and 3 was inappropr iately involving the court in dispute between the political branches of type of that traditionally has been resolved by negotiation and accommodation by the parties the court rejected the executives justiciability claims finding both standing and an implied cause of action in the constitutions institutional commitment to the congress in article i of the power of inquiry observing that the supreme court has consistently recognized that the power carries with it the process to enforce it which is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function and that issuance of subpoena pursuant to an authorized investigation is an indispensable ingredient of law making136 in rejecting the suggestion that the court exercise its equitable discretion not to involve itself in political disput between the branches the court observed that numerous courts since the initial wa tergate rulings had found it appropriate to attempt to resolve subpoena disputes ra ising privilege and immunity questions in both civil and criminal contexts involving the political branch in circumstances where it appeared only judicial intervention could prevent stalemate that could result in paralysis of gove rnment the court noted that both parties conceded that an impasse had been reached and observed although the identity of the litigants in this case necessitates that the court proceed with caution that is not convin cing reason to decline to decide case that presents important legal questi ons rather than running roughshod over separation of powers principles the court be lieves that entertaining this case will reinforce them two parties cannot negotiate in good faith when one side asserts legal privileges but insists that they cannot be tested in court in the traditional manner that is true whether the negotiating parties are private firms or the political branches of the federal govern ment accordingly the court will deny the executives motion to dismiss137 turning to the sole merits issue raised by the committees motion for partial summary judgement the executives claim that present and past senior advisers to the president are absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the courts conclusion was an unequivocal rejection of th governments position the executive cannot identify single judi cial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30319crs30 138 id at 78 139 339 us 323 1950 140 id at 331 141 457

unsupported by existing case w in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute imm unity for senior presidential aides138 at the outset the court noted th at 1950 supreme court ruling in united states v bryan139 established that if compliance w ith congressional subpoena requirement is ignored the great power of testimonial compulsion so necessary to the effective functioning of courts and legislatures would be nullity140 in attempting to explain why compliance is to be excused in this instance the executive argued that since the president himself is absolutely immune to compelled congressional testimony close advisers to the president himself must be regarded as his alter ego and be entitled to the same absolute immunity forcing such close advisors to testify before congress would be tantamount to compelling the president to do so the court responded that the same line of argument d been rejected by the supreme court in harlow v fitzgerald 141 suit for damages against senior white house aides arising out of the defendants official actions the aides claimed they were entitled to blanket protection of absolute immunity as an incident of their offices as presidential aides142 recognizing that absolute immunity had been extended to legislators judges prosecutors and the president himsel f the supreme court rejected extending such immunity further emphasizing that for executive officials in general however our cases make plain that qua lified immunity represents the norm143 the high court rejected the argument th at it had accorded derivative immunity to legislative aides in speech or debate cases as sweeping too far noting that even cabinet members are not entitled to absolute immunity144 the harlow court made the concession that presidential aide coul d be accorded absolute immunity if it was shown that the responsibilities of his ffice embraced sensitive function such as foreign policy or national security and that he was discharging the protected functions when performing the act for which liability is asserted145 the miers district court concluded that in this matter since ther was involvement of national security or foreign policy concerns neither ms miers nor mr boltens close proximity to the president is sufficient under harlow to provide either absolute or qualified immunity146httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30319crs31 147 id at 8384 emphasis in original 148 nixon i supra 418 us at 707708 149 id at 8485in response to the executives claim that without absolute immunity there would be chilling effect on the candid and frank advice advisers would provide chief executive the court stated the prospect of being hauled in front of congress daunting as it may be would not necessarily trigger the chillin g effect that the executive predicts senior executive officials often testify be fore congress as normal part of their jobs and forced testimony before congress does not implicate the same concern regarding personal financial exposure as does damages suit significantly the committee concedes that an executive branch official may assert executive privilege on questionbyquestion basis as appropriate that should serve as an effective check against public disclosure of truly privileged communications thereby mitigating any adverse impact on th quality of advice that the president receives in any event the historical record produced by the committee reveals that senior advisors to the pres ident have often testified before congress subject to various subpoenas dating back to 1973 see auerbach decl 23 thus it would hardly be unprecedented fo r ms miers to appear before congress to testify and assert executive privilege where appropriate still it is noteworthy that in an environment where there is judicial support whatsoever for the executives claim of absolute immunity the historical record also does not reflect the wholesale compulsion by congress of testimony from senior presidential advisors that the executive fears147 next the district court rejected the claim that nixon v united states established that presidents immunity is qualified and not absolute only when judicial resolution of criminal justice matter concerned148 here the court emphasized the executive argued that what was involved wa s peripheral exercise of congress power not core function of nother branch the court responded congresss power of inquiry is as broad as its power to legislate and lies at the very heart of congresss constitutional role indeed the former is necessary to the proper exercise of the latter accord ing to the supreme court the ability to compel testimony is necessary to the effective functioning of courts and legislatures bryan 339 us at 331 emphasis dded thus congresss use of and need for vindication of its subpoena power in this case is not less legitimate or important than was the grand jurys in united states v nixon both involve core functions of coequal branch of the federal government and for the reasons identified in nixon the president may only be entitled to presumptive rather than absolute privile ge here and it is certainly the case that if the president is entitled only to presumptive privilege his close advisors cannot hold the superior card of absolu immunity claim of absolute immunity from compulsory process cannot be erected by the executive as surrogate for the claim of ab solute privilege already firmly rejected by the courts presidential autonomy such as it is cannot mean that the executives actions are totally insulated from scrutiny by congress that would eviscerate the congresss oversight functions149httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30319crs32 150 id at 85 151 id at 89the court recognized that the effect of cl aim of absolute privilege for close advisors was to make the president the judge of the parameters of his ow n qualified privilege permitting the executive to determine th limits of its own privilege would impermissibly transform the pr esumptive privilege into an absolute one yet that is what the executive seeks through its assertion of ms miers absolute immunity from compulsory process that proposition is unten able and cannot be ju stified by appeals to presidential autonomy150 finally the district court rejected the governments fallback position that even if ms miers is not entitled to absolute immunity she should be accorded qualified immunity the court dismissed the argument relying on the requirements established by harlow this inquiry does not involve sensitive t opics of national security or foreign affairs congress moreover is acting pursuant to legitimate use of its investigative authority notwithstanding its best efforts the committee has been unable to discover the underlying causes of the forced terminations of the us attorneys the committee has legitimate reasons to believe that ms mierss testimony can remedy that dificiency there is evidence that the committee is merely seeing to harass ms miers by calling her to testify importantly moreover ms miers remains able to asse rt privilege in response to any specific question or subject matter for its part the executive has not offered any independent reasons that ms miers should be relieved from compelled congressional testimony beyond its blanket assertion of absolute immunity the executives showing then does not support either absolute or qualified immunity in this case151 the court concluded that its rejection of claim of absolute immunity rested on two premises such claim would transf orm the presidents qualified immunity into an absolute one and if such claim we re to prevail it would cover even non privileged executive information there are powerful reasons supporting the rejection of absolute immunity as asserted by the executive here if the court held otherwise the presumptive presidential privilege could be transformed into an absolute privilege and congress legitimate interest in inquiry could be easily thwarted indeed even the speech or debate context which has an explicit textual basis and confers absolute immunity members of congre ss must still establish that their actions were legislative in nature before invoking the protection of the clause see eg rayburn 497 f 3d at 660 jewish war veterans of the us of am v gates 506 f supp 2d 30 54 ddc 2007 members ca nnot simply assert without more that the speech or debate clause shield s their activities and thereby preclude all further inquiry yet that is precisely the treatment that the executive requests here similarly if the executives absolute immunity argument were to prevail congress could be left with recourse to obtain information that is plainly not subject to any colorable claim of executiv privilege for instance surely at

document subpoenas issued by the house government reform committee as part of the investigation of alleged law enforcement corruption in the fbis boston field office over period of almost 30 years following two hearings in which the validity of the privilege claim was the central issue testimony presenting overwhelming evidence that similar doj documents and testimony had been provided in the face of investigative mands by jurisdictional committees for over 85 years despite claims of interference with prosecutorial deliberations and with credible threat of successful contempt vote on the floor of the house the documents were relinquished154 the second claim of privilege apparently asserted on be half of the president by white house counsel alberto gonzales occurred during the judicial
