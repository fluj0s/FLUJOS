classified by ambassador robert h tuttle for reasons 14 bd 1 cnf summary conservative party leader david cameron told senator john mccain the tories wont break ranks with hmg on policies affecting british troops in battle cameron and shadow foreign secretary william hague told mccain and senators joseph lieberman and lindsey graham that prime minister gordon brown had political support to increase british troops in iraq mccain said basrah was quiet for all the wrong reasons this conversation took place march 20 before the recent surge of violence in southern iraq mccain thanked britain for its support the senators also discussed afghanistan pakistan and israel with conservative leaders end summary participants 2 u senators john mccain joseph lieberman and lindsey graham accompanied by the ambassador senate staff richard fontaine and dan serchuk and poloff kirsten schulz met march 20 in david camerons house of commons office cameron had assembled an eager group from his front bench including hague shadow chancellor george osborne shadow defence minister liam fox as well as chief of staff edward llewellyn former party leader michael howard and dame pauline nevillejones the room was packed and the atmosphere collegial mccains assessment of iraq 3 cnf senator mccain said the situation in iraq had improved he warned that qaeda would put up fight in mosul and the iranians were not going to go quietly into the night maliki mccain told the group was weak but getting better in anbar province he added there was demand for elections mccain praised general petraeus and the quality of the military leadership and mentioned petraeus upcoming congressional testimony cameron asked what the american troop numbers were likely to be mccain said the us would stick at 180000 and noted its not the number of troops but the number of casualties which is of import alqaeda said mccain had taken to using suicide bombers and now to deploying women bombers he said one woman was asked why she had tried to become suicide bomber she replied because my husband told to cameron asks mccain for appraisal of basrah 4 cnf cameron asked mccain what he thought was happening in the south of iraq mccain said he was very worried he said it was like chicago in the 20s and could go at any time the iranians were there and the iraqis were likely to find the going to be extremely difficult just because its quiet said mccain doesnt mean its good it is quiet for all the wrong reasons pledge on troops 5 cnf cameron and hague told the senators that the conservatives would never take policy position that would undermine british policies where troops are involved hague noted the conservatives largely share the labour foreign policy agenda cameron said prime minister brown did not have the political support to increase the british troop presence in iraq saying that moment has passed hague seconded camerons assessment cameron asked mccain whether the british plans for further drawdown should not go forward given that hmg could not both maintain presence in iraq and build up its role in afghanistan in response mccain thanked cameron and for britains contribution in iraq and afghanistan 6 cnf mccain said he understood the prime minister intended to withdraw british troops prior to the next election hague confirmed brown politically could not do otherwise i understand that said mccain the british people have my gratitude for all that you have done israel london 00000929 002 of 002 7 cnf mccain told cameron that israels prime minster ehud omert was still paying the price for lebanon cameron asked whether quartet leader tony blair was optimistic mccain said he admired blair for his steadfastness but what mccain had noticed in international relations was the tendency of statesmen to be optimistic once they become negotiators iran 8 cnf mccain told cameron he saw an increasing and increasingly damaging role for iran in regional affairs this included an increase in activity in iraq and in arming hezbollah mccain said he advocated gathering europe to cut off all credit to iran not just europe but other likeminded nations such as japan should be encouraged to take collective action on such matters he said hague responded that he and the conservatives had been pushing for this for the last two years hague and cameron alleged that the release of the national intelligence assessment had set back this effort afghanistan and pakistan 9 cnf cameron told mccain that he and his party focused on afghanistan as the key foreign police issue this was due not least to the timeline for when the conservatives might come into office 2010 or 2009 at the earliest and the fact that british troops were meant to be out of iraq by then cameron also raised pakistan noting that 60000 individuals travel to pakistan from the uk each year and that this has implications for the uks own significant domestic terror threat cameron said he was interested in exploring the idea of whether isaf and enduring freedom operations could be combined as well as whether an increase in military presence was required or an enhanced civilian presence was more important mccain replied that afghanistan is complicated by the uncertainty in pakistan we all like karzai he said but his is very weak government cameron said nato troop capacity was patchy and there appeared to be perpetual problems with shortages of air transport support mccain said he was worried about pakistan if they dont cooperate and help us i dont know what we are going to do he said he added waziristan hasnt been ruled for 2000 years on positive note mccain praised the fighting capacity of afghans whom he called great fighters cameron said each year he met with karzai and each year he had the sense karzais sphere of influence was shrinking 10 u codel mccain did not clear this cable visit londons classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurlondonindex cfm tuttle
