of the current to future force the current force is todays operational army th army organizes trains and equips the current force to conduct operations as part of the joint force it is designed to provide the requisite land power capabilities join t force commanders need across the range of military operations the current forces abi lity to conduct major combat operations underscores its credibility and effectiveness for fullspectrum operations and fulfills the enduring obligation of army forces to fight wars and win the peace b u the future force is the operati onal force the army continuously seeks to become to best support national security requirements and dod needs the future force is the strategically responsive jo int interdependent precision maneuver force dominant across the full range of military oper ations envisioned in the future global security environment optimized for strategic versatility this more mobile more lethal and agile force will dominate land operations in any future conflict c u the army re fines capabilities to better enable the current force to conduct joint operations in the near term while simultaneously developing transformational capabilities for th future force the two activities are symbiotic while the army develops the future force it simultaneously acce lerates select future force dotmlpf capabilities into the cu rrent force similarly the operational experience of the current force directly informs future force capabilities the shaded area in the arrow shown in the illustration above depicts this continuum and the
