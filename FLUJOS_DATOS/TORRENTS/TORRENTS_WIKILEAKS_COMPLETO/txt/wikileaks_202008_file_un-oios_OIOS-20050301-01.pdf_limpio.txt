information technology management aa200427001 report date 01 march 2005 auditors bharat b manocha hui ming june tan 2 united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services internal audit division ii oios audit of icty information technology management aa200427001 executive summary from june to october 2004 oios conducted an audit to assess the adequacy of ictys arrangem ents for inform ation technology it managem ent the total expenditure was approxim ately us18 m illion in 20022003 oios c oncluded that icty had given insufficient attention to the nature and type of it services that would be required for the com pletion strategy and that it needed to strengthen its arrangem ents to get m aximum leverage out of its investm ent in it as described in m ore detail below governance at the tim of the audit icty did not have an effective governance m echanism for oversight of it activities icty needed to establish an inform ation and com munications technology com mittee to com ply with stsgb200317 and to ensure effective coordination and prevent overlapping between different organs of the tri bunal oios is pleased to note that icty established the com mittee in august 2004 planning and monitoring to ensure that icty has the right level and t ype of services to m eet the challenges of the completion strategy oios recom mended that icty form ulate an it strategy which should be supported by long range plan covering the rem aining period of the com pletion strategy and short range plans these would provide basi s for allocating and m onitoring resources communicating to interested parties how the it strategy will be delivered and dem onstrating how it activities have been prioritised to m eet the tr ibunals needs oios is pleased to note that icty m anagem ent and the ict com mittee have supported the creation of strategy whilst itss had developed tools to m onitor som of its services there was overall m onitoring fram ework in place to apprise senior m anagem ent how it resources were being used to m eet their needs oios recom mended the creation of such fram ework covering targets and perform ance indicators the use of m onitoring tools including custom er satisfaction surveys whom to report and what to report organiz ational structure icty had not undertaken an analysis how and in what way current it support m ight change as consequence of icty downsizing its activitie s as it nears its com pletion date oios recom mended such an exercise be carried out which should consider cost effectiveness of outsourcing com pared to m aintaining resources in house the m erger reorganisation of units as consequence of reducing work load and whethe r itss should continue to m aintain and support all current projects and applications or whether some could be discontinued to save costs 3application development icty needed to undertake review of the type and nature of application development needed over the remaining life of icty if need fo r major application development was identified oios further recommended review of the existing methodology which should include the creation of project selection committee training there was assurance that the it training provided had added value since training was conducted based on historical trends and not on training needs analysis and there was evaluation if training had improved staff efficiency there was also substantial scope for improving utilization of training resources as staff were performing tasks not required inventory management there was assurance that all ict assets assigned to itss were properly accounted for some 200 assets with an acquisition value of us380000 we re reported to be missing or lost in 2003 the reasons adduced for these losses reinforced oios assessment that itss needed to take urgent additional steps to comply with stai374 and to safeguard its assets certain of these matters have been referred to oios investigations di vision for their consideration and work was ongoing at the time this final report was issued icty commented that the report was balanced and fair in the issues that it did present although not generally part of the format of this ty pe of report icty would have appreciated some discussion of the calibre of services which itss provides to the tribunal as in general it is believed that they are considered as being an important and productive partner in helping the organisation achieve its mandate oios appreciates the comments and would like to thank icty for the excellent cooperation received in the c onduct of this audit and the positive response it received to the issues raised oios is fully supportive and adheres to the concept of positive reporting and would like to recognise the important role played by itss specific conclusion was drawn on the quality of services provided by itss because the focus of the audit was on the overall management of it

between june and october 2004 in accordance with the international st andards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 information technology support secti on itss section under the icty registry is responsible for providing information and communication technology ict services to all the three organs in icty registry chambers and office of the prosecutor otp itss comprises five its development unit operations unit training unit systems development unit s du and the office of the chief itss as at october 2004 itss had 71 staff 13 professional p and 58 general service gs the chief itss reports to the chief administrative officer registry 3 it related expenditure for both staff and it non staff items were as follows table 1 total it costs in icty us in000 description total expenditure 20022003 budget for 2004 2005 staffing costs note 1 7753 7213 non staffing costs note 2 10419 9444 total it costs in icty 18172 16657 note 1 staffing costs for 20022003 were based on st affing levels in itss and sdu as at 31 december 2003 multiplied by the standard salary costs for icty staffing costs for 2004 2005 were based on the itss regular budgetstaffi ng table for the current biennium and the 11 posts from otp transferred to itss during 2004 multiplied by standard salary costs for icty note 2 total expenditure certified by the chief itss during the biennium 20022003 as per icty accounting records 4 draft of the report was shared with the icty chief administrative officer cao in december 2004 whose comments were received on 18 january 2005 icty provided further clarificationcorr ection of their response on 09 february 2005 the responses have been reflected in this final report ii audit objectives 5 the overall objective of the audit was to provide the icty registrar with an assessment of the adequacy of ictys arrangements for management of it this included assessing the it governance and planning framework b it activities undertaken by itss and the adequacy of the arrangements for identification and oversight of these activities and c whether it activities were being carried out in compliance with regulations and rules 2iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on the adequacy of arrangements for managing it in particular itss activities during january 2002 to september 2004 it excluded communications the audit included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations governance icty information and communications technology ict committee 7 stsgb200317 dealing with the information and communications technology board ictb directed that ll departments and offices away from headquarters oah create internal or cal information and technology groups or committees following the pattern of the ictb whose responsibilities would be to ensure departmental strategies are aligned with the overall objectives of the secretariat b information on departmental systems resources and assets is maintained and updated on regular basis c existing systems are reviewed to confirm their cost effectiveness and d standard methodologies are devel oped and consistently used for ict projects 8 icty did not establish an information and communications technology ict committee as required while chie f itss had established an informal working group to discuss requirements nd share information within the three organs it was not formally constituted and did not have the mandate to take decisions consequently the working group could not provide an effective substitute for the ict committee in the absence of such committee there was limited coordination within the three organs lead ing to duplication of effort across icty inconsistent systems being used and an inability to transfer some information between the various systems at the time of the audit chief itss informed the audit team that icty was in the proce ss of establishing an icty ict committee along the lines required by stsgb200317 icty commented that as from 23 august 2004 the tribunal had established th local ict committee in accordance with the referenced secretary generals bulletin membership of the committee has been strategically determined so that nior management from all of the organs of the organization are well represented in view of this additional information recommendation is raised 3b planning it strategy 9 general assembly ga resolution 57304 of 16 may 2003 welcomed the significant step the ict strate gy a57620 dated 20 november 2002 represented in developing strategic framew ork to further guide the development of ict within the and requested that the it requirements for the various duty stations be fully integrated into the strategy 10 in the opinion of oios the above mean t that icty needed to create its own it strategy document which included those elements of the ict strategy applicable to icty and included any other sp ecific ict issues relevant to it at the time of the audit itss did not have an icty it strategy while itss had budget document outlining resources required in the opinion of oios this is not substitute for strategy document explaini ng how it will support achievement of the icty mandate and the completion strategy the absence of such strategy is also seen as contributory factor to other findings made in this report recommendation to ensure compliance with a57620 the ict strategy and to assist icty in optimising its resources for achievement of the completion strategy the icty information and communications technology committee should oversee the creation and implementation of an icty information technology strategy document rec 01 11 icty commented that it agrees with this recommendation as do the members of the local ict committee the draft strategy will be presented for review and comment at the next meeting of the committee which will be held in early february oios welcomes and supports the proposed initiative and will close the recommendation upon receipt and review of the icty information technology strategy document b long and short term planning 12 itss had work plan for 20032004 that scribed goals to be achieved at the time of the audit this plan had not been updated for 20042005 to include the more recent challenges facing icty such as the financial uncertainty and the need to serve otp after the merger of the system s development unit sdu with itss in the view of oios there also needed to be consideration of the type and nature of it short and longrange plans required to link with the biennium work plans these types of plans are important because th ey provide basis for allocating and monitoring use of resources communicating to interested parties how the it strategy will be delivered and demonstrating how it activities have been prioritised to meet the ictys needs this is considered especially important to ensure that it resources are correctly matched with the aims and objectives of the completion strategy icty commented that this will be im plemented via the ict committees it strategy the associated detailed programmes of work and itss use of project 4management discipline since itss work activities are structured around the requirements of the substantive and support offices appropriate budget planning guidance will be prepared and disseminated to all parties as part of the budget process of the 20062007 biennium in view of this additional information recommendation is raised c monitoring it activities 13 in the opinion of oios registry had responsibility to ensure that icty had monitoring framework in place to apprise senior management of the three organs how it resources were being used to meet their needs 14 itss who were responsible for monito ring it had implemented software to monitor some of the it services provide d however monitoring activities were not being undertaken in the context of any approved monitoring framework or supported by any customer satisfaction surveys th ere was also an absence of monitoring information such as targets and performa nce indicators and hence itss was not in position to assess the impact of services pr ovided or to demonstrate the adequacy of resources as explained below itss could not assess if the development unit du completed projects on schedule or experienced time and cost overruns b there was evaluation if the pr ojects developed by du delivered the planned benefits c there was limited monitoring of re sources deployed in sdu during the period 01 april to 30 september 2004 d the training capacity was not fully utilized the average fill rate being 55 percent the itss training unit did not conduct any evaluation to ascertain the reason for low fill rates recommendation to ensure that icty is ab to leverage the maximum benefit from information technology implemented and to meet programmatic needs chief information technology service section should develop monito ring framework that should be approved by the icty information and communications technology committee rec 02 15 icty commented that it agreed with the recommendation and added that we strongly believe that the central setting of standards by itsdhq would save us and other nonhq offices from reinventing th wheel the setting of standards by each individual office gives none of us the benefits and efficiencies of centralised standard by which to compare ourse lves with i intend to raise the issue with itsd to see if such standards exist and if they can assist us with providing guidelines methodology andor other pertinent information oios appreciates the response and will close the recommendation upon notification of the implementation of the monitoring framework 5 d organisation structure integration of sdu with itss 16 as part of the implementation of an oios recommendation in its audit of office of the prosecutor otp review of the office of the prosecutor at the international criminal tribunals for rw anda and former yugoslavia a58677 otp transferred the systems development unit of otp sdu comprising 10 staff to itss on 31 march 2004 oios expected that itss would have undertaken advance planning to determine how to maximise the benefits of this transfer in particular whether there would be synergies and savings through merger with similar units within itss merger took place the otp staff continuing to operate as separate unit until september 2004 in oioss opinion merger could save at least one post the head of sdu p3 with poten tial saving of approximately us240000 per biennium itss has yet to realize these potential savings 17 icty pointed out some of the concrete steps it had taken in the period april through august 2004 the sdu was fully integrated in with the human resources administration of the rest of the section uptake meetings were held with incoming staff to determine their personal and professional objectives extensive discovery exercises were undertaken to determine the scope of sdu duties and responsibilities an analysis was done to determine how if at all the sdu and itss processes mapped onto each others existing organisational structures in recognition of the major differences in culture and mission between the two organisations careful moves were made to ensure that all parties were adequately consulted this process was hailed by the staff union as model by which other sections could seek to preempt conflict and discord 18 oios thanks icty for the clarifica tion but would like to emphasize that to maximise the benefits of the merger acti on could have been taken earlier this would have enabled itss to share staff nd other resources with sdu to provide better service to otp recommendation to maximise savings from the tr ansfer of it staff from the office of the prosecutor to itss chief information technology service section icty should revi ew the possible integration of these staff within existing itss units with the potential saving of one p3 post approximately us240000 per biennium rec 03 19 icty agreed that the functions of the sdu manager were longer required but icty may need to redeploy th actual post to cover the newly emerging functions which are an organisational governance obligation sgsgb200317 6oios appreciates the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of documentation that the post has been abo lished and or documentation explaining the reuse of the post including the revised classified job description b organisation and management of it support 20 oios expected that icty would have analysed how and in what way current it support might change as consequen ce of icty downsizing its activities as it nears its completion date for example the closure of field offices and reduction of activities in icty headquarters chief itss explained that such analysis had been requested or had taken place so far oios is of the opinion that the following analysis is urgently needed to provide senior management with an understanding of the options for the provision of it support over the remaining life of icty analysis of when it is more cost effective to outsource than to maintain resources in house for example oios is pleased to note that repairs and maintenance have already been outsour ced however oios is of opinion that services such as help desk and application development have potential to be outsourced b analysis of which units may need to be merged or reorganised as consequence of reducing workload for example it appears as if the workload of workshop and audio visual unit has already reached point where merger should be considered c analysis of the changing nature and functions of management required as consequence of reorganisation integration and outsourcing for example whether itss should continue to ma intain and support all projects applications currently supported or some of these can be discontinued to save costs recommendation to assist in determining the optimum utilization of resources for information technology support over the remaining life of icty chief informa tion technology service section should submit paper to the information and communication technology committee outlining whether it is more cost effective to outsource than to maintain resources in house strategy for merging reorganising units as consequence of reducing work load and whether itss should continue to maintain and support all current projects applications or some could be discontinued to save costs rec 04 21 icty commented that contrary to olos assertion that nearing the completion equates to significant reduc tion in activity icty management would like to observe that while the activities ssociated with investigations are being reduced the completion strategy calls for the tribunal to operate at full capacity until trialsinchief are completed at th end of 2008 support of field offices and field activities has already been optimised consequently due to the efficiency with which the offices are already supported reduction in the number and functioning of the offices would not result in significant associated reductions in staffing back at the headquarters in the hague the icty management has determined that there 7will be only minor reduction of activity through 2008 as only minor staff reductions are anticipated specific critical milestones such as the closure of the annex and administration buildings which would have an impact on it support as well as other administrative support are now not deemed plausible until end of 2007 similarly until the ict board can and does prioritise the outstanding it projects it would be premature for itss to independently initia an analysis it would make more sense to first determine the priorities and set forth timeframe for completion itss can then set forth to determine appropriate st affing levels as the organization downsizes having noted this it should be made clear that itss has already invested significant effort in investigating the principle and practice of outsourcing over the last yearsfinally returning to the matter of presumed workload decreases it is icty administrations opinion that as the icty has matured so its staff and management team have increasingly viewed the it com ponent as means of developing further efficiencies and innovationsicty management is fully aware that not all the current backlog of projects can or should be undertaken but this is exactly the reason why icty intends to submit each project to hlbc review so that it can be determined whether such projects will reap suitable benefit as we near the completion of the icty mandate it seems that the workload is chiefly determined not by the raw numbers of staff or by th number of physical facilities but by the number complexity and criticality of systems deployed 22 icty concluded that in general however the proposal that itss continue to review with the involvement of th ict committee the opportunities for outsourcing merger reorganization and sy stem discontinuation is sound and icty management fully supports this recommendation oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of strategy paper to the ict committee outlining whether it is more cost effective to outsource than to maintain resources in house strategy for merging reorganising units as consequence of reducing work load and whether itss should continue to maintain and support all current projectsapplications or some could be disc ontinued to save costs and the decision of the ict committee c management span of control within operations unit 23 while the head operations unit p4 supervised approximately 50 gs staff the p2 supervised 7 gs staff and the p3 did not have any direct supervisory responsibility as he was entrusted with r ecruitment procurement and implementing special projects such as the otp evidence digitizing project activity in the areas supervised by the p3 has decreased becau of the cash flow crisis and the completion strategy in view of this and the wide span of control of the p4 oios is of the opinion that the operations unit s hould be restructured to assign additional supervision responsibilities to the two professional staff in the unit recommendation to improve the management sp an of control within the operational unit chief inform ation technology service section icty should review and restruct ure management responsibility for staff between the professional grades rec 05 824 icty commented that itss is curren tly considering revamp of the organizational structure of the section and the concerns noted by oios will be taken into account at the time of the reorganization oios thanks icty for the prompt action taken and will close the recommendati on upon receipt and review of copy of the new organisational structure which deals with issue of the span of control within the operational unit application development methodology 25 given the limited life span and the financ ial crisis facing ic ty at the time of the audit oios expected that icty would have undertaken review of the type and nature of application development needed over the remaining life of icty oios observed that icty had not established mechanisms to review the following key issues how much new application development is required over the next four to five years and what criteria should be used to determine what represent cost effective development at this stage of ictys life and b whether development unit du should continue to maintain and support the projects it developed or whether this function should be entrusted to the operations unit to derive synergy of operations as well as to enable du to focus on its core business of developing applications 26 should icty establish that there is s till need to develop major applications during the remaining period of its life it should review and modify its existing project methodology the current methodology is neither comprehensive nor in line with secretariats global ict strategy stipulated in a57620 its value as guide to ensure that the staff were familia r with the process and that all adopted consistent process for identifying and veloping projects was therefore limited oios noted that the existing methodology had the following weaknesses the existing project management methodology had not been updated since 1999 and did not include guidelines on areas such as the criteria for selection prioritization of projects monitoring and post implementation review b cost benefit analysis was not undert aken hence there was assurance that the projects developed were those that generated the best returns c project selection committee was not tablished to ensure that similar needs or opportunities within the three organs were identified and reconciled d there was postimplementation revi ew of applications developed to determine if the projects delivered the expected benefits actual time and resources expended on the projects were not monitored to assist in identifying whether projects were managed in an efficient and effective manner or projects experienced time and cost overruns recommendations to determine what resources are required for application development over the remaining lif of icty chief information technology service section should submit paper to the information and communication technology committee outlining 9the extent of new application development foreseen and whether it is worthwhile to undertake the deve lopment at this stage of ictys life the paper should also discuss whether the development unit should continue to maintain and support the projects it developed or this function could be transferred to the operations unit rec 06 27 icty commented that the current high level business case hlbc analyses seem to conclude that with even five years remaining in the tribunals lifespan investment in development is show ing strong payback and still continues to make sense clearly there will be point at some point in the life of the tribunal when due to the diminishing amount of tim left it will become increasingly difficult to extract sufficient benefit to justify the cost of investment icty management agrees that it would helpful if the tribunal could foresee at which point in time dismantling the development capacity beco mes sensible and itss will attempt to make this educated guess in the it strategy document however in spite of this estimate icty management feels that it makes sense for the ict committee to continue to review the individual pr ogrammes and projects that make up the it strategy and tactical plans and based on its ongoing assessment that these activities concretely assist the tribunal in ac hieving its mandate in costeffective and efficient way decide on case bycase basis whether or not to proceed with development with regard to the question of the du continuing to maintain applications it is important to understand what is meant by maintenance the term software maintenance has more to it than one would initially assume it includes adding and subtracting system functionality performance tuning data conversion migration and debugging this is in st to software support which entails screening calls acting as focal point creating user accounts providing application access to application installation of the application and helping users to work around known bugs presently in majority of the cases user calls are already handled by itss operations dispatchers and if any support activities are currently performed by du they can be transferred to operationshelp desk nonetheless the maintenance tasks as defined above must be done by qualified programmer or data manager who possesses specific application database and programming knowledge oios thanks icty for the additi onal clarification which outlines the issues that oios wishes to see addressed in the paper it proposes should be presented to the ict committee the recommendation will be closed upon receipt of the paper to the ict committee outlining the extent of new application development foreseen and whether it is worthwhile to undert ake the development and whether the development unit should continue to main tain and support the projects it developed or this function could be transferred to the operations unit and the decision of the ict committee on the paper recommendations should icty determine need for major application development over its remaining life to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of these projects and to ensure compliance with a57620 chief informa tion technology service section should update the project manage ment methodology in line with industry norms such as control objectives for information and related technology cobit and ensure that all staff are aware of 10 how to follow the methodology rec 07 28 icty commented that it agrees with the general observations however we would like to mention few points which are as follows in line with the oios recommendation of 1998 itssdu has been following an application development methodology cmm which is also part of itil application management and is widely practiced by both governmental and commercial organizations throughout the world the current report recommends adop ting cobit as model however it is vital to note that cobit unlike itil doe s not specifically incorporate application development we concur that current thodology must be updated according to a57620 and stsgb200317 nevertheless we would like to point out that although not strictly in line with stsgbi200317 framework in itssdu is in place for project selection monitoring and post implementation review thanks to this approach itssdu has been able to meet users requirements successfully and so far there is record of project failure in stark contrast it is worth pointing out that on an average every year 60 of worl dwide software development projects are considered failures economist nov 25t h 2004 indicating that itss has been extraordinarily successful at managing development projects oios appreciates the additional clarification cobit is highlevel organisational tool which would require the adoption of methodology such as itil at the implementation level which is recognised within the cobit fr amework itself oios will close the recommendation upon receipt and review of the revised project management methodology approved by the ict committee f it training 29 as consequence of the integration of sdu within itss itss had an itss training unit and an otp sdu training unit the three staff of itss training unit 1 p2 and 2 gs provided general training on standard desktop applications to all icty staff the otp sdu training unit w ith three gs staff provided training in otp specific applications the activities of both training units were reviewed and number of general issues were identifie d which have been referred to under the sections above on monitoring and organization structure in addition to these general issues oios noted inadequate assessment of the need for and inadequate planning of training activities as discussed below the two training units did not carry out any training need analysis to determine the training requirements of re spective staff the input from staff and managers was minimal and courses were conducted based on the historic trend b more than 80 percent of the tr aining conducted by the itss training unit was on standard desktop applications although almost every job description stated that staff should be proficient in these applications c the two training units did not evalua if the training imparted had added value in enhancing the efficiency of the staff members work d the itss training unit spent over 200 hour s preparing course materials that were to be provided by the vendor1 1 extract of contracts with vendors the contractor shall provide all course materials and documentation required for th training with permission to duplicate and distribute these materials to unicty staff 11e the details of the courses conducte d by otp training it staff were not available and itss did not evaluate the efficiency of staff resources f the itss training unit spent over 2000 hours reworking training materials prepared by headquarters unhq fo r the galaxy system chief itss explained that unhq and icty management encouraged them so that these materials could be shared with other offices however when itss training unit forwarded the draft ma terial there was follow up from unhq and as result the material was not shared with other offices the training material was not even us ed in icty since it stopped using the galaxy system in august 2004 recommendation to maximize the efficiency nd effectiveness of training provided chief information t echnology service section should develop training framework that includes needs analysis of the training required over the remaining life of icty and evaluate if the training conducted enhanced staff efficiency the basis for the inclusion of each course should be documented and submitted to information and communication technology committee for approval rec 08 30 icty commented that although itss had not conducted needs analyses during period indicated in the audit itss training unit had carried out two training needs analyses in 2001 and 2002 based on the surveys the course curriculum was determined post training results showed that staff members felt that they saved on average 45 minutes day at carrying out their regular duties the training unit recognizes that 80 of its classroom curricula are on standard desktop applications however 55 fill rate shows that this tr aining is still required further indicating that screening of staff it skills upon uptake is not as effective as it could be in terms of the training materials provided as part of the sanction and casemap it was never the intention that the vendors delivered the final training materials as part of their contracts considering the extensive custom procedures for the use of these products in the otp would need to be developed it was accepted that the vendors would only able to deliver generic materials for later adaptation by icty in response to the comments in regard to galaxy the training unit made frequent formal requests to headquarters in ny for galaxy training materials unhq was unable to provide them as they did not exist therefore in support of ictys scheduled implementation of galaxy in april 2003 icty hrs submitted formal request to the training unit for development of training materials th training unit is working on followup targeted questionnaire that will evaluate wh ether staff members feel that they have benefited from the training the training unit plan to send out questionnaire at regular intervals after training including conducting an annual review of each staff members training records we have near ly completed pilot program with clss where we determine in conjunction with the target offices management skill standard for each basic job the traini ng unit will develop personalised training program for each staff designed to addre ss the identified deficits should this be successful with clss we intend to scale up the exercise this approach is more labour intensive but it removes the inherent inefficiency of the voluntary broadcast training and it directly involves the management of the target section oios is 12pleased to note that itss training unit had initiated actions to address some of the audit findings but would like to point out that oios was not informed about the assertion of the 45 minutes savings during the audit additional information provided to oios recently revealed that th average savings of 45 minutes claim was based on the response of seven staff member s in 2002 further some staff surveyed felt that they did not save any time at all icty was unable to provide oios with any supporting evidence on the statement made in their response on training materials for sanctions and casemap as regards galaxy icty chief human resource section confirmed that he had requested itss to prepare some training materials which he thought to be one to two weeks assignment he was therefore surprised to learn from oios that itss had spent more than 2000 hours and stated that he would not have requested this if itss had informed him of the extent of resources required oios will close this recommendation upon receipt and review of documentation that training needs analysis has been conducted and benefits of training provided have been undertaken nd the list of training courses approved by the ict committee g contract management management of repair and maintenance contracts 31 during 2004 icty entered into eleven contracts at total value of approximately euro 121000 us145000 for repair and maintenance of ict equipment valued at approximately us13 million oios reviewed three of the eleven contracts and noted overpayments arising from nonadherence to contract terms and conditions on contract ictycon03026 icty procurement section informed the audit team that the amount invoiced by the contractor and certified by itss was correct and hence th ere was overpayment as they had inadvertently incorporated incorrect prices in the contract at the time of the audit procurement section was in the pro cess of amending the contract and recommendation has therefore been made 32 itss also agreed with the audit team that contract terms and conditions had not always been adhered to to rectify this situation itss made arrangements for concerned staff to attend briefings on their procurement responsibilities it was also agreed that for future contracts an initial briefing would be held prior to commencement of services with procurem ent section the project manager and the contractor in addition procurement secti on will request the contractor to provide detailed cost breakdown of equipment repaired and maintained which will be reviewed by both procurement section and itss in view of the actions taken oios is making recommendation b services not included in the contract 33 itss requested preventive maintenance services from one of the contractors which were not specifically included in the contract ictycon03031 itss accepted that they had made an error nd chief itss and chief procurement section have taken the steps described in the previous section to address this issue recommendation is therefore raised 13c controls over repair and maintenance of equipment 34 oios expected itss to maintain maintenance log for equipment detailing when machines were repaired what was repaired and the cost of repairs an analysis of these logs would then assist itss in determining when it is more economic to replace equipment than to repair the reliab ility of suppliers to take into account for future purchases and to monitor the eff ectiveness of repairs being carried out though icty maintained details of invoices received and paid each year for repairs complete history of repair undertaken for each machine was not available the information in the communication assets tr acking system was neither complete nor accurate 35 oios also noted that itss did not have an adequate quality control system in place in two of the three contracts to ensu re that when the contractor replaced the fuser unit or other parts the replaced parts were returned and to ascertain whether asserted repairs and maintenance by the contractor had been fully completed recommendation to assist icty management in determining when it is more economic to replace equipment than to repair assessing the reliability of suppliers for future purchases and monitoring the effectiveness of repairs being carried out chief information technology service section should establish mechanism such as an equipment maintenance log together with procedures on the collection processing and reporti ng and information of details about equipment repair and replacement rec 09 36 icty commented that this would be implemented by midmay 2005 oios thanks icty for the prompt action ta ken and will close the recommendation upon receipt and review of details of proposed mechanism determining when it is more economic to replace equipment than to repa ir assessing the reliability of suppliers for future purchases and monitoring the effectiveness of repairs being carried out h asset management monitoring of ict assets 37 icty property control inventory unit pciu is responsible for recording and reporting all nonexpendable assets in accordance with the stai374 property records and inventory control under revised definition of nonexpendable property pciu assigns all ict assets to the itss the asset manager for all these equipment 38 the chief itss entrusted the responsibility of inventory management to the coordination cell within itss which us ed the communication assets tracking system cats to keep track of approximately 8000 items with total value of approximately us13 million as at 30 june 2004 because itss was not updating cats promptly and correctly and was not aware where equipment was located or who was using it oios noted that as at 30 june 2004 14 314 items assigned to itss did not have information on their status ie in stock in use in repair etc b 98 items shown as in use were assigned to former staff c 37 items shown as in use were not assigned to any staff and there were also information on the location of these assets 39 therefore there were assurances that all assets assigned to itss were properly accounted for and as result oios noted substantial ict assets had been lost as discussed below recommendation to ensure that icty has co mplete and accurate inventory of its ict equipment the chief of information technology service section should develop procedures for updating the communication assets tracking system database accurately and promptly and undertake an exercise to confirm the existence and location of all the assets entrusted to itss rec 10 40 icty commented that the review of th database contents has already been undertaken and completed considering the possible perception of lack of independent verification and because itss is not staffed to independently conduct fullscale physical inventories the verifyi ng inventory exercise will be conducted in conjunction with pciu the timeframe for completion will be confirmed with pciu and reported to oios oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt and review of procedures for updating the communication assets tracking system database and receipt of th results of the exercise to confirm the existence and location of the assets entrusted to itss b procurement and management of ict assets 41 the ict assets in stock with itss were kept in four storerooms there were indications that itss did not plan the pr ocurement of ict equipments resulting in surplus stocks as at 30 june 2004 oios noted 474 items valuing approximately us513000 remained in stock for over year resulting in possible stock obsolescence and loss in value in addition itss did not manage the assets in stores properly 23 items remained as for repair for over year b five items remained in repair for period between nine months to three years c though there were four locations for storing assets the location ie room number of the assets was not entered into cats d during surprise physical inventory check we noted that there were more items for repair than shown in cats recommendation to ensure efficient and effective utilization of ict assets 15and to comply with stai374 th chief information technology service section icty should review if assets in stocks for more than one year should be disposed off procurement for items in stocks should not be made unless justified and closely monitor assets sent for repairs rec 11 42 icty commented that due to the hiring freeze many computers and printers slated for replacement andor other deploy ment remained in stock in addition the shortage in staffing within itss itself meant that certain deployment projects were put on hold again resulting in equipment remaining unexpectedly in stock furthermore for small items such as ink jet printers instead of opting for what would be costineffective repairs we mainta in stock of new printers which can be issued as replacements for malfunctioni ng units these circumstances and practices have meant that oios observed what appears to have been an unusually high numbers of new equipment left in stock in sp ite of this review of the new instock items has been undertaken to determine if there are any items which should not have been either acquired or held for unjustifiable reasons efforts will be made to improve the logging tracking and followup of items out for repair oios appreciates the clarification and will close the recommendation upon receipt and review of the exercise undertaken to review if assets in stocks for more than one year should be disposed off steps taken to ensure that procurement for items in stocks is not made unless justified and details of the procedures developed for monitoring assets sent for repairs c loss of ict assets 43 ictys property control and inventory unit pciu carried out an annual physical inspection of all assets to ensure th at they are available their review in 2003 revealed that significant number of ict equipment was missing while itss managed to locate some of the missing items it reported the loss of ict items with an acquisition value of us380000 to secur ity and safety section sss during february to july 2004 the reasons adduced by itss for these losses indicated weak controls over safeguarding itss assets 59 computers with an acquisition value of approximately us108000 placed on pallets apparently ended up on the disposal truck b seven spectra vehicle radios were disposed off along with the vehicles in which they were mounted c eight computers with an acquisition value of approximately us9000 which had been sent to ictr arusha in 2000 did not reach them 44 sss investigated the losses and submitted copies of its reports to the chief operations unit of itss during february to july 2004 as the assets could not be located itss proposed that the missing equi pment be written off the icty local property survey board lpsb considered the proposal in its meeting of 11 november 2004 and noted th at it would like to know what procedures sops have been put in place to avoid this type of discrepancy in future and who is responsible should the procedures which are in place not work lpsb therefore recommended that all cases be deferred until further clarifications 1645 the sss investigation report was copy of the information provided by itss and there was evidence of any work unde rtaken to establish the causes of the losses oios is of the opinion that an investigation of the reasons why the losses occurred has not been properly conducted and is very concerned given the size of the loss the matter has been referred to the oios investigations division for their consideration and appropriate action recommendation is therefore raised on this matter in this report 46 icty commented that in its narrative oios observed the ongoing process of accounting for group of assets which has proven difficult to finalise this is process begun in 2001 which was later noted in the 2002 report of the external board of auditors and of which snapshot was revealed in the pciu 2003 physical inventory at the beginning of the whole pr ocess pciu determined that there was significant list of some 2000 inventory ite ms which could not be immediately accounted for in physical check 47 in the intervening period since then the majority of the items have been cleared from the list many by being found some identified as mistaken data entry errors some with duplicate or incorrect asset tags and some as being identified as actually being lost or stolen this has involved hundreds of hours of staff time and meant significant indepth efforts on many staff members parts to ascertain asset status in conjunction with itss the pciu has been involved in longterm painstaking process of trying to make final determination 48 what remained when observed by oi in this audit was some 200 items valued at around us380000 when originally acquired although the identification of these items had been ongoing for several years following the receipt of the informal comments of the auditors ic ty management immediately undertook an intensified review with the assistance of itss security and pciu as of this date we have further reduced this list to about 140 items with residual value of about us104000 we are sharing this informati on locally with the resident auditors and the oios investigator 49 in its further response of 11 february 2005 icty clarified that with respect to the overall number and value of missing equipment our internal investigation is ongoing and we will be repor ting back to both the oios investigator and to the resident auditors 50 while oios appreciates the action taken by icty management it observed that the 60 items asserted to be resolved located by icty are yet to be verified by pciu further the acquisition value of 140 items still missing is us304000 residual value of us104000 oios noted that the issue is being investigated both by icty security and oios investigations division v further actions required on
