period anatomy of maybe solutions lecture given on 12 july 1961 thank you well i didnt mean to interrupt suzies talk what is it the 12th of july audience the 12th of july all right what she can tell you is far more practical and she can tell it with lot more bayonets probably well you havent had chance to ask any questions and ive been informed by mary sue that you are now getting into shape that you know what you dont know so what question would you like to ask today great isnt it female voice dont disappoint all right female voice i was wondering when you decide and how when to put the tenway bracket from fiveway bracket when you decide when you decide to go from tenway bracket to pardon fiveway bracket to tenway bracket female voice yes ah well youre dealing with problem which has actually basis in mechanics beyond this the reason you go to from fiveway to tenway bracket is the plus minus proposition its covered in the anatomy of maybe and i think that is covered in what thats scientology 880 isnt it female voice yes and thats the anatomy of maybe and continued uncertainty on the part of pc continuous nocognition the pc who says never says what do you know is hanging so hard in maybes and his maybes are so fantastic that as you look this thing over youll see from the anatomy of maybe that the way to take it apart is take it on the plus side take it on the minus side how have you done it how have you not done it how have you coughed how have you not coughed you get the idea and his idea of maybe i will cough disappears maybe does not have in itself you see any faintest reality in fact it is simply manifestation of positive and negative and your positive and negative manifestation add up to maybe now problem one consists of postulate versus postulate b and between these two postulates you get an indecision dont you see but usually postulate is do it and postulate b is dont do it that is the commonest variety of problem and if you ask somebody that youre trying to take problems apart by solutions which can be done ill tell you how to do that in moment you would say some version of do it dont do it and then the decision can emerge but as long as hes hanging on ive got to do it i mustnt do it then decision can emerge and maybe is simply counterbalanced insistence on must and must not or it is and it is not and these things equally insistent addest up into the indecision of maybe but the indecision of maybe is not itself fact have you got the idea female voice yes all right if thats not fact then youve got to take apart the thing by taking apart its two sides and then the indecisional character or the maybe character the uncertainty and this is quite important in psychotherapy because were not handling the whole subject of anxiety the whole subject of anxiety is resident in this anatomy of maybe well anxiety simply is consists of must and must not is or is not and these things are so counterbalanced that of course the person cant make up his mind and anxiety is simply heightened or frantic state of maybe you see so all right lets supposing you have terribly terribly terribly anxious or nervous pc who is very indecisional and doesnt know whether to come to session and doesnt know whether or not to come to session and thinks there might be great consequences in coming to session or not coming to session and wonders whether or not they should do it this way or should do it that way and they are just dramatizing indecision all the time all the time all the time actually you should know that it is mistake to run fiveway or sixway bracket on them you would have to run pardon fiveway bracket youd have to run one of these tenway brackets on them got the idea female voice yes because theyre they cannot land theyre incapable of landing on plus and incapable of landing on minus so the longer you run anything in the middle that is avoiding this tremendous condition in which they find themselves why the longer theyre going to be in processing and this is the case that never says what do you know youve run this case youve run this case this case gets cognitions this case doesnt ever say well im getting better this case never says well theres some way out of the hole or the case never even says im getting much worse you know it just goes on grind grind grind grind grind grind grind well youve run into the anatomy of maybe and the total absence of cognition winds us up into the total presence of uncertainty and anxiety i dont know whether i should be processed or not you see because if i am processed dadada you never know and if i i i dont know i you know i isnt there ter some terrible consequence are you very sure that it doesnt hurt the mind and so on and youll run into all of this the person is saying to you maybe the person is saying to you indecision anxiety all that sort of thing well practically every process you do on them you ought to somehow or another bend it around so theres plus and minus plus and minus plus and minus plus and minus see never run plus plus plus plus because youll get stuck flow promptly and never run minus minus minus minus minus because youll get stuck flow promptly and that is what decides it the condition of the pc is what decides it now about one pc maybe out of every this is an inaccurate figure but its just somewhat of idea of order of magnitude maybe one out of twenty never says what do you know all right well that particular pc when youre sizing them up you run them for little while just make up your mind everything on this pc has got to be run plus and minus everything so this would make the rudiments sound like this do you have present time problem is there present time problem you dont have got it female voice yes do you have an arc break all right is there an arc break you dont have thank you very much are you withholding anything all right very good very good is there anything youre not withholding fine all right you could even go to the reductio ad absurdum of asking such pc is it all right if i begin this session now what would happen if i didnt and youll find that your noncogniting pc will all of sudden be saying what do you know you know and this long grind grind grind will tend to disappear and go into limbo so that is when you decide this the greater the anxiety the greater the indecision the greater the uncertainty of the pc the more you must run both sides of an auditing command and it just depends on that and most pcs the large majority of your pcs this just falls into place and you can do it most any way you want to do it and itll go along and you would do prehav assessment and its failed leave well you dont have to run leave they may dramatize leave little bit immediately after youve run failed leave but doesnt matter you can get away with it dont you see but if this person is one of these cant change dont go anyplace so forth you assess them on failed leave you know instantly if theyre going to blow straight across the scenery theyre going to disappear on you if you say failed leave about twice without saying leave got the idea you should recognize this as that particular case because i think that case is the bane of your existence the case actually will change but never seems to notice it yeah well thats how you handle that case you can take that case apart like you can count pennies on table okay female voice just something more to add here would it also depend on terminals running terminals sop goal on the terminal or on the pre maam doesnt female voice only on the precl doesnt determine terminal has nothing to do with it on most sop goals cases you just run the level female voice right thank you and thats fine but if youve got superanxious pc who is being very doubtful about everything well this kind of manifestation youre running youre running terminal youre running terminal whizzlestick and this pc just doesnt know if thats the level or not youve assessed cause whizzlestick cause well i dont know whether thats the level or not i wouldnt be sure thats the level are you sure thats the level that couldnt have fallen on that could it have that isnt the level then really is it well the auditing command you put together had better be cause not cause okay female voice yes all right you bet male voice ron on routine 1a when youre running recall ptp or one of the processes can you change during session and when all right in running routine 1a and youre running recall ptp or whatever youre running can you change within the session the mildness would be the determination the answer is yes not ordinarily but it could be done and it would be determined by the mildness of reaction not the violence of reaction if youre getting tremendous tone arm reaction and youre getting tremendous pc reaction as result of running such process as recall ptp it would be an auditor code break to shift it not only in the session but in the intensive because its running too hot and its running too heavy and it would be too painful shift to suddenly alter the auditing command but the other side of it you can the thing doesnt seem to be doing very much youre you know youre getting some tone arm action youre getting division of the tone scale or something like this and the pc seems to be doing it rather easily and they were having little difficulty short time before doing it but they all of sudden start doing it easily or something and it looks like its getting little too easy with the pc or something like this you could shift you could shift to confront this is something like i was saying you dig up the ore from the bottom of the mine and put it out on the dump well you could shift over onto confront and all of sudden watch that tone arm fly again see you can do an adjustment like this you can always do an adjustment on processing when the process you are running is longer producing marked results but if you change process before the rule of change has occurred the twentyminute test has occurred you have committed serious blunder not to go back sometime and complete that process you got the idea male voice yeah it basically would mean that you probably made mistake it comes under the heading of rectifying an error person would would run all right on confront but wont run at all well on recall and you ran recall and confront wont get heavy needle reaction and so forth but then heavy tone arm reaction but you dont get much on recall see well its actually the correction of blunder what you do would bring him by cycle up to pt whether running confront or recall or anything else you get him solidly in pt and shift and that would be the main thing that would determine whether you could shift or not is can you get him into pt see if hes out of pt and the tone arm is moving like mad well you wouldnt shift youd carry on thats all any auditing command of course can be modified if you werent able to modify an auditing command or change phrasing of process or different approach on the same subject of course youd be hung with your own mistakes and youd also be hung with the diminishing change this pc youve run him for you ran him all day yesterday and you run him on recall problem just as simple as this you see and that tone arm was just whizzing man that was going over and jumping on hitting the needle on the head and turning the sensitivity knob up all by itself you know and just really whizzing when you bring him into session and all of sudden it isnt whizzing check your rudiments your rudiments are all in just not getting any reaction on that process today well dont waste auditing dont waste auditing shift it over see if you can assess another command here that does get big heavy needle reaction and run that one and that would be your basic criteria im not trying to give you anything complicated by the way if you ran recall problem during the whole of that session and the next session itd probably come back to doing its business all over again you see its just whats faster as long as youre running problems run them any confounded way you want to or in any fashion you want to but there are certain rules that have to be followed if youre going to do good job of auditing and one of those rules is you dont change process which is producing marked change on the case if your process is damped out and isnt producing very much change why shift it in its type or wording making big loud note in the middle of in caps on the middle of your auditors report that this process was changed when not flat or something of that sort see at least let somebody in on the secret that answer your question male voice it does thank you all right id like to say something more about problems and types of processes that could be used on problems here and heres good time as any to say them heres an interesting point about problems and solutions i may have given you too much of an impression that it is impossible to run solution now that is not factual you can run solutions there are many ways of running solutions and getting away with it but im talking about running something like this preventing the person from examining the problem and always insisting that he run solution yes that is impossible but you run solutions on cases all the time sop goals what is goal goal is solution to some problem youve learned that already youve seen that all right another comment id like to make here is it seems to be tentatively true from observation of reports and from what mary sue says that those people who are being run on problems and being given security checks and being assessed on sop goals are getting rather rapid troublefree assessments on sop goals does that confirm your understanding of it and those people who arent being run on any preparatory processes and security checks at the same time are making poor longterm scramble progress is that the way it looks like hm well tentatively we make the observation that case runs faster in goals assessment if run on problems and security checks at the same time at different periods of the day all right now let say some more about this solution thing there is whole problems process very old one at least three years old two two three years old its probably older than that im always finding something new had precursor or some two or three years before that its already occurs in the notebooks and that is you take the condition of the pc off your own bat you assume that its solution to problem of course youll be right but you assume that its solution to problem this is the way of doing this you see and then you ask the person what problem could that be solution to now this fellows got headache got continuous headache all right so you say all right now what problem would continuous headache be solution to now obviously theyre looking at solution without examining the problem right now this brings us forward to method of nulling goals which would be too insidious for words and it is not usable i underscore that this is not usable this could however be done weve assessed this person for cadet this is the final terminal that emerged and so on we could say without using the prehav scale if we didnt have copy of one or something this is not recommended see this is not doable action what problem would cadet be solution to thats the pcs terminal youre going to produce action thats for sure thats for sure because youre going to run him into every problem hes ever had for the last two hundred trillion or ever since hes adopted this particular terminal youre going to run him into every one of them so clang clang clang expect action it is thing that could be done which you might get away with it is not recommended thing to do you got it all right now im just giving you examples here of what you can do with this you take the the stable datum and you ask him what confusion was that stable datum to you see youre saying the same thing as all right what problem would continuous headache be solution to see youre asking youve taken the stable datum which is headache and youve asked him for the problem because he never confronted that or he wouldnt have the headache you see to get him to confront this however this is not always successful this is successful enough to be very useful to you this is good way of getting rid of chronic ptp or something like that its not always successful because you may have put him up above the level of his confront like crazy well he cant even confront the headache because hes complaining about it and yet youre asking him to step back into the further nevernever land of unreality and confront the problem that thats solution to and on some cases youre going to lay complete ostrich egg on this you see their confront just is not up to this that is all but it is useful mechanism and is something to know about and it is usable you can do this now you can take goal heres something you cant do you can take goal and youd say tell problem that goal would be solution to weve assessed the fellow and the pc to be unencumbered all right this was the goal all right and we say well what problem would being unencumbered be solution to and of course this is something like picking somebody up and throwing them into the tar pit and say swim you but the these are heroic things so heroic that they will exceed the level of the preclears reality quite ordinarily and easily you could however take present time problem and try to run this with it and you would very often succeed with great rapidity it would be quite astonishing to you how often you would succeed in taking this difficulty the pc has and assuming just whole hog its just assuming that it must be solution to problem and just telling the fellow to look at the problem and it would blow up with great rapidity you take some fellow whos worried about well lets take very common one impotence this is very common and you say well what problem would impotence be solution to you know you keep talking about this or the fellow keeps giving you this hidden standard and this hidden standard apparently has absolutely nothing to do with his goals assessment you know the goals assessment is here and the hidden standard is over there in the corner but he tries to find out if the goals assessment is working all the time to find out whether or not it turns off the burning in his right ear we want to get rid of this hidden standard this is good way to do it you see it has lighter usages than goals assessments according to my experience at least this far it has lighter usages you can get rid of ptps of short or long duration this way you can get rid of chronic somatic or something of this sort rather easily and the auditing command that would go along with this is very pat one its just what problem would whatever it is be solution to quite useful useful gimmick youll get an awful lot of chronic somatics and things like that off your pc with consequence were doing the oddity you see of solving problems without the consequences of problems and solutions which is the greatest oddity in the world scientology is full of these oddities its the oddity of getting away with it were doing the impossible living in universe that is tailormade never to get out of you see tailormade tailormade for you never to let anybody else out of it either and were in situations which are all tailormade to stay in and hitherto getting out of them has been attended by all the consequences of jailbreak you know complete with sirens and police dogs its all boobytrapped you solve problems solve problems solve problems youve had it you see thats boobytrapped down the line all right so all of sudden we solve problems with sirens the front gates of the prison disappear the prison disappears we get out of the prison by dropping the prison not by busting out through the front gates and making some ironmonger lot of work and weve got lot of these lot of these in the works and we do this quite bit its the only way it could be done dont you see you cant cure as man has been doing it without consequence because its rigged the other way so here is universe well ill give you an example of the rigging of the universe you know ministers can marry but they cannot divorce and you look around you and youll find everywhere in this universe theres mechanisms of that character prohibition about getting in every prohibition about getting out take the armed services you walk up there my golly the recruiting sergeant is nice man next day theyve fed you cold beans and you say well the devil with this youve run into subaltern or something and you turn around and you go back to the same recruiting sergeant and you say give my papers back and by golly he wont do it and then youve got universe that and civilization and all of its customs are more or less tailormade in this particular direction well we even do it ourselves to some slight degree we have some book auditor out someplace and hes just found out that music processing is the various thing thats in now in north fernando valley or something why he has eight pcs sit down and they all raise their shirts and contemplate their navels and they play bach and he says if youve done this now for 289 hours why you will be clear as near beer and youre all set you know and hes just book auditor and we say oh well for gods sakes you know and thats the limit of action but the guy is professional auditor oh hell man the sirens go and the police cars start wheeling see what the hell are you doing see its all on the basis of you know better than that this is always quite astonishing you see because the universe is so thoroughly rigged this way why it happens to be the only method by which you could ever make any progress out of it is to approximate some of the progresses in and that happens to be one of them if youre professional auditor if youre professional auditor and you know better well then dont do it and if youre book auditor and you dont know any better well so what you got the idea i mean some professional auditor is expected to go over and say you know if you instead of having them raise their shirts have them sit in chairs like this facing each other and then run tr 0 on them for while but that you see is even present to that degree in the administrative lines of scientology much to my shame but theres other mechanisms that are survivals of this sort of thing apparently all resistance is to prevent oneself from going any further down the resistance is to go down its quite amazing the difficulty you have actually in worsening somebodys mental state its fantastic what you would have to do to worsen somebodys mental state really and how anybody would achieve this actually its to the utter shame of psychology and psychiatry that theyre really not able to they temporarily do it in one lifetime or something like this i suppose if they gave the guy enough motivators why maybe it would even run out some of his overts you could look at it in some kind of reverse mechanism i think thats the mechanism on which they must operate but most of the resistance is to getting worse and you stop pressing against the resistance to getting worse or if you resolve the resistance toward getting worse just that the guy will get better which is one of the goofier things you see thats goofy you dont try to make the fellow well you just stop him resisting getting worse he has terrific resistance to getting any lower down than he is and theres practically resistance to getting any better which make one look at an auditor who isnt getting results wondering what on earth he must be doing you see because it actually is very easy one to reverse this because theres practically springs back of it the fellows mainly concentrated on keeping himself from getting any worse thats how his mind is rigged hes preventing deterioration or something like this and he could get it all all sorts of complications where his prevention of deterioration looks like hes trying to deteriorate and thats really true too but its nevertheless rigged as resistance toward degradation and all an auditor has to has to do is convince pc that he is not trying to degrade him is not trying to make him any worse is actually not trying to cure him because he might have resistance to being cured too because he knows how much worse you can get when youre cured the cures for broken arms which they rebreak two or three times you know can be quite heroic and all youd have to do actually is to convince pc that you werent trying to push him further down on the thing and just had hearttoheart talk with him about whether you were or werent and all of sudden hed get better because the fact that hes resisting getting worse is pinning him into getting worse see that what he which he resists he becomes see theres lot of goofy little mechanisms here that operate on the side of the auditor you really have to get pretty wild to violate all of them and not get case to improve at all okay i want you to remember that particular process though as as good patchup process youre just sick and tired of hearing about this burning right ear he knows he will get better because his ear will stop burning well did you make any goals during this session and moment of comm lag ensues and then he says very brightly well not really and if you dont follow through immediately afterwards and say well what didnt happen you sometimes will miss the hidden standard well what didnt happen well the fellow says of course my gall bladder isnt burning when i get better my gall bladder always burns so i know i havent gotten any better we havent run out that particular somatic ka ka ka here weve got it see weve got hidden standard here there are ways and means of smoking these hidden standards into view of course theyre idiotic you didnt have anything to do with gall bladder you werent you werent even processing him on anything that would have helped his gall bladder and yet his whole test of whether or not he met his goals in the session is whether or not his gall bladder had altered or got worse gall bladder didnt get worse so he didnt improve you got fellow in an interesting condition of being in games condition with his own gall bladder or something see you can you can have fellow in an interesting games condition with his stomach you know hes trying to get even with his stomach auditing isnt working his stomach didnt get worse all kinds of crisscrosses here the reactive mind the reactive mind of course is not sensible so you get all kinds of unsensible responses where it comes down home close okay all right any other questions oh im glad the rest of you are caught up to it im glad the rest of you are right up there on the ball yep yes female voice we were working on the purpose of our job which as you know is good squeeze and you notice an improvement thats good thing when you have sensitivity thats very easy and then reading thats not easy where where you dont get drops youre just sort of diagnosing on change of characteristic uhhuh female voice as the sensitivity is very free and and practically hits the pin yeah female voice the actual needle action on the is very slight female voice assessment is is very stuck all right here it is bobby youll run into this rather constantly its your needle using sensitivity knob for diagnosis and your sensitivity knob has low setting for thirdofadial drop and yet youre not getting much needle action well that is why an emeter can never have its sensitivity knob adjusted to read low there sensitivity knob can only be set as it is set on the mark iv thats about as good as you can do because if you start setting the sensitivity knob lower for less drops then the drop that would be observed will drop out do you understand what im talking about you will longer be able to see any drop you got it so the person that youre discussing is actually getting up into well or in theyre release and havent found it out yet and theyre getting tremendous drop on zero setting practically of the sensitivity knob terrific action and then when you try to assess something why horror of horrors that needle doesnt move very much heres very loose cansqueeze test and not much of motion in the needle all right now lets look over the characteristic of an emeter an emeter is registering amount of charge or disagreement charge and disagreement could be said to be synonymous and to make charge more understandable use the word disagreement if youre getting bad fall you can always get your fastest cognition on the part of your pc by asking what are you in disagreement with this doesnt fit in well for most of your questions and so on but you could always bend it around so that you can use it this pc do you have an arc break do you have do you have this or that or anything of the sort you finally say to this person well do you have disagreement with anything and all of sudden youll observe this fall that you have observed so fleetingly because it is the fundamental reaction is caused by disagreement now as person gets up toward clear theyre getting closer and closer in this particular direction of course their wild disagreements aberrational disagreements with existence are much less so theres actually much less charge on the case and the needle will only register to the degree of the charge remaining on the case and so you have the oddity of the closer person gets toward clear the looser is the needle and the less is the actual reaction on questions and you will get to point its good thing for you to bring up because its good diagnostic point youre eventually going to have to raise the sensitivity knob up for person who gets toward clear just as you had to do for somebody whos way down at the bottom so that you could read the needle at all and this becomes very difficult the can squeeze test makes the needle go over bang and it hits one pin and comes back and hits the other pin and its crash you see and you say well all right now do you have present time problem the fellow looks like he has present time problem or something like this you know to get read you have to actually increase that sensitivity knob in spite of the wildness and violence of that can drop so your cansqueeze test ceases to be valid from release on up when you can longer retard the sensitivity knob on mark iv british meter to get thirdofadial drop from there on this is something that is not in the text you had better be suspicious that you are going to miss falls and youd better start advancing the sensitivity knob do you see that its theres something to know there now thats quite quite amazing youd say well but you see all aberration is mockery of clear and youve got down into the lower scale mockeries of clear of course youd have to keep highly advanced sensitivity knob to get any reading at all the case is actually below having charge on it now as the case gets better you get thirdofadial drop which is somewhat the average case now youve got pretty good charge see your charge is quite heavy and you get nice readings and everything is fine and one day youre auditing the fellow and you say all right now squeeze the cans and it goes over and hits the pin at the other side and you retreat with that sensitivity knob reading you say give the cans squeeze and it goes over and hits the pin and youve got the sensitivity knob down and you just cant turn it down any further and you say well i ought to fix this meter and i actually fell for this myself some time ago ought to get these meters fixed you understand so that they can be turned down to thirdofadial drop when that condition begins to exist then you to find charge had better start advancing the sensitivity knob and youd better start advancing the sensitivity knob to magnify these little remaining disagreements that dont amount to hill of beans well the difference is that when the fellow originally to get thirdofadial drop had to have his sensitivity knob well advanced well he was below disagreeing now he comes up to point where he can disagree with things fundamentally and you of course are getting terrific reads with the thing down here at the sensitivity knob reading at its lowest set you get big reads and everything is fine and then you process the fellow little bit further along the line youre going to see change of characteristic here at zero set youre going to get more than thirdofadial drop well from that time on you had better start advancing the sensitivity knob to get your reads not for the rudiments but for security checks and goals you can do it with goals assessments too actually rudiments and goals assessments are cousin in the way theyre read security check youd better start really revving that thing up because youre not going to find much on it the fellow just isnt reacting he isnt as reactive anymore so the needle isnt reacting but that is your fundamental test of whether or not the case is going clear and when you see this first start to occur of your thirdofadial drop squeeze thats thats gone dog as test thats good as test anymore you got release thats good enough to just check out release right there and after you get up to point where you just cannot retard it and it just hits pins and caroms back and forth and flies all over the place and you have to in order to get read have to advance it up to 3 or 4 on the sensitivity knob setting you know you got present time problem the fellow says nothing happens so you advance it to 3 or 4 have you got present time problem you know bang you get terrific read of about two divisions you know now the test crosstest is that it blows that fast guys got present time problem he tells you about it now you cant find it again gone see the things blowing when this condition completely disappears and advances to point where you just cant well the cansqueeze test is just all over the place and 16 you cant get anything falling you cant even do an assessment anymore something like that youd better bring yourself up with with sharp halt youve probably been looking at clear for the last few hours and havent noticed it that is the gradient scale of clear test its unmistakable when it happens to you unmistakable if case is not changing in characteristic of can squeeze as it goes along it isnt making any advance and that would be checked out by the way by giving them continuous profile tests its not making any advance the can squeeze test is not varying from one session to the next see they still have to be here at sensitivity knob setting 2 to get thirdofadial drop next session sensitivity knob setting 2 to get thirdofadial drop next session sensitivity knob setting is on 2 you say whats going on here ptp arc break withhold theres rudiment out man see rudiments are out the speed with which you can detect this is sufficiently good that if your processing is advancing with all of your rudiments in this is an important thing to know if your processing is advancing with all rudiments squared away see rudiments all in everythings all straight you should be able actually to detect from session to session difference in the can squeeze test gives you some index of how far rudiments are probably out on most cases that are being processed now as the case goes to release and from that point on your midsession break ought to find difference see the difference between your your first part of the session and your second part of the session when you start the session again you ought to see difference in the can squeeze test minute but detectable and they should advance that rapidly you can tell very quickly and very immediately that case is not advancing because this phenomenon that youve just brought up is not taking place and if that phenomenon does not come into being on case in some finite period of time and you cant set the sensitivity knob back you see far enough you still get too much drop matter what you do with the sensitivity knob and then your detection of security check questions becomes very difficult because youre not getting much needle action well if that doesnt take place you just better take case practically apart you know whats wrong with these rudiments whats the hidden standard whats missing here whats holding up the show what are you doing out of session you know whats going on here got the idea just really chew into the ground on it your processing will advance as fast as that happens thank you for bringing it up its point which happens to be missing okay does that answer your question female voice yes all right any other question yes female voice would you tell the commands on cch 4 what did you say now female voice would you tell the commands on cch 4 commands on cch 4 oh i dont think i have to tell you those in the first place your verbalization is not your process and you may be getting much too precise im not going to tell you those i think theyre in your bulletins and that sort of thing point in it okay female voice thats just the hm female voice thats just the book motion process thats just the book motion process female voice i couldnt find bulletin that did have the commands in it so male voice never was one never was separate one never was one female voice okay all right issue one suzie female voice all right all right okay virginia its actually if you want to know the commands of any of the cchs get your minimum effective statements to get the motion done female voice mmmm that answers the question command verbalization is tremendously important in every other routine than the cchs thats why im not going to give you set of auditing commands right here and nail them down in brass because there have been i think dozen versions anything you want to say to the pc more or less repetitively which shows him that youre going to do this and you expect him to do it just like it right afterwards and then that demonstrates that you are interested in knowing whether or not that hes satisfied that he did it would be the commands of cch 4 got it female voice yes all right any other questions yes female voice in longish sentence on form 6 in the female voice in long sentence on forms security check form 6 long sentence mmhm female voice and check on sensitivity 16 and that needle wiggles while the sentence is still spoken should it stand quite quite null during the whole sentence yes maam female voice yes yes maam quite null during the whole female voice whole sentence sentence on security check question or any question youre asking pc on an emeter you have this liability that there are sections of the question female voice yes and each section may fall female voice yes so if youve got long section you have option but to clear every part of the question female voice yes thank you this is so poorly understood at large that it has actually let scientology in for some brickbats because you can ask almost anybody anything you can ask girl are you virgin if shes virgin the needle falls see and are you virgin and the girl oh theres just charge on this word virgin hasnt anything to do with whether shes virgin or not its virgin thats falling its not are you virgin and you can get led very far astray with this with an emeter if you dont take them apart so the basic rule is that you would ordinarily to begin with take that long question to pieces so eventually having taken it to pieces and gotten it all straightened out with the pc you eventually would be able to read the whole question from beginning to end without any reaction female voice good thank you all right okay female voice on that particular thing you wouldnt suddenly youre reading it to him for the first time you wouldnt suddenly stop female voice youd read it to him you just read it to him dont even look at your emeter find out what they said and they said all right read it to them again looking at your emeter and they say so you read it by sections to them again looking at your emeter questioning each section and get all sections clear its sort of like clearing the auditing command and then read the whole thing again now that youve got all sections clear and you get fall and they say i guess your works cut out along about that time okay any other questions all right you seem to be well genned in today well genned in as matter of fact youre changing ill pull california gag on you your auras are changing color its only stated in two places in the world in chelsea and angeles anyway weve stepped up the velocity have you noticed this oh youve noticed this and theres something goes along with this which i had better remark to you about since i havent put bulletin out on it its expected that at the end of thirty days you will have completed your checksheet i just thought in view of the fact that you were still taking it easy i had better add that at the end of thirty days you should have completed your checksheet thats pretty grim isnt it female voice yes mmmm but i will say this we wont instantly and immediately hire skywriters in your home town to fly overhead and paint sign in the sky that you have not gotten course completion at saint hill that is within thirty days we wont do that yes male voice ron i came up against something recently on cch 4 which might be useful i found that auditors were using sort of sort of standard command on i want you to make im going to make motion with this book and i want you to copy it mirrorimagewise and then they were using this check question are you satisfied with that duplication or something of that nature after every command hm male voice and i found that this was causing an invalidation on the preclear when the auditor wasnt satisfied with it and then went on with the same command oh yes it will it will you have to be very smooth male voice so i told them they should only use that satisfied check question when they themselves as auditor were satisfied and were prepared to leave it well this this can cause quite bit of randomity the original reason are you satisfied was used has to be researched and that was because invalidation was curing here youve got occurring here youve got the cure problem phenomenon you see and the cure is now causing difficulty but the tendency of the auditor to critically do the command again caused tremendous arc breaks and would actually cause the process to be totally inoperative so are you satisfied with the auditing command that you did that rather was introduced in order to cure this particular situation now it is not necessary for the auditor to duplicate the exact command they just did it is not necessary that they do this after all theyre not trying to duplicate duplicate duplicate because its not particularly duplicative its duplicative enough that the auditor does it and then the pc does it so what they do is they find the pc is very weak on circular motion so they just go on making varieties of circular motions and they just put him over the jumps on circular motions but theyre not always the same circular motion dont you see and this prevents the thing now thats another cure and that undoubtedly will produce its own problem in the future your points well taken vie right okay any other questions have you been doing anything in your processing lately that you didnt think you really ought to be doing but were only doing it because you had been told come on lets see if anybodys brave enough to say anything to this yes virginia female voice well for while when i was doing the one about i cant even remember the command but anyway it was five or sixway bracket on well my goodness i sure did lose it i didnt like doing it because it was oh where you wouldnt or somebody wouldnt do it and you shouldnt do it or something like that well oh confront thats the one it was female voice well i i could think of the that they might not do it or when i could see that they wouldnt do it well i wouldnt be so sure about that because if i could say well you wouldnt polish my shoes but if i ask you to do it and you were confronted with the problem you might at least confront it well you were running command that you hadnt any agreement with as an auditor you thought the command could have been female voice i was the preclear you were the preclear female voice yes i didnt like it well i just kept on doing it because i was the preclear and thats what we had been told by yeah all right female voice but i didnt like it at all all right female voice because i kept running up against that same sort of thing well practically everybody i know when asked if i asked them specifically or they knew about it i think that they would be willing to confront it they probably wouldnt be willing to do something about it but theyd be willing to take look be interested all right did you clear it with your auditor female voice well i told her about it and now im not running that process anymore so all right okay okay all right now is anything youve been auditing that you felt you were shouldnt really have been auditing anything youve been auditing you felt you shouldnt have been auditing why itd take brave auditor to answer that question you look back on most of the processes youre auditing are laid down by very specifically all right yes male voice i have one question ron in answer to your last question about doing something you didnt particularly want to do i felt that giving withholds up on security check as an auditor running each withhold down was irrelevant i thought the nature of the withhold was irrelevant and it took up time mmhm male voice i feel that also it rather tends to cut down in twoway comm with the pc how would it do that because he feels that his withhold will be further exposed or something like that male voice i think it rather it sort of takes time writing the thing down i see all right now let let clarify this let clarify this your points very well taken there and its never intended that everybody should write down every withhold that the pc ran across because you would run into the youd run into the british museum library every time but something that was very difficult to clear something that literally took you an hour or more to clear or something of this nature it took you half an hour to finally get down to it what was it now that appearing on security check as what the nature of withhold would be that would be this rough to try to clear would be of value only to on research and eventually id be able to go over tremendous pack of written security checks dont you see and be able to establish the type of withhold which was most closely pressed to the bosom and perhaps adjudicate something out of this that would get us along little bit further so your resistance toward that is quite proper because writing down every line of the pc every withhold he had writing it down on security check that would be poor show but those that are very resistive would be of great interest to not as character index on the person but just as general run the human race most closely withholds the following and then you just make some great long column of the types of withholds you get the common denominators in these withholds youd probably find hidden button that we didnt know much about before okay thats the only only thing i want and if youd write that sort of thing down you really had to struggle for this one you know you got in there and you ask him well have you ever raped cat you know or whatever the security question is and you go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and you just cannot get any clearance on the thing at all and then you find out that its something some odd shading of the command or something like this or of the question that was really holding it up well for heavens sake write it down female voice oh hes complaining about that because i asked them to write it down and the reason i do is because we have different auditors giving sec checks from the different auditors who were processing them and the auditor wants to know whether his preclears case is improving whether apart from running more withholds are coming off well you mark the fact that youve got female voice they also want to check to see if his withholds if the preclears withholding anything from him the auditor that hes told another the sec check auditor but hasnt told the auditor you see what i mean his real auditor so i mean for all purposes of this course is that i think they should jot down they dont have to write down every word the preclear said but they can at least note it you know stole apple they just write down apple you know hmmm female voice so all right ive given you my requirements what id like to see on security check that applies very broadly whether youre doing them in northumbria or any other unlikely place and so on now mary sue to facilitate running the course which would probably then apply to facilitate running an hgc wants shorthanded notation of the withhold that was there and was given up like stole apple and she puts down apple and somebody then checking back across this thing hes looking through this on rudiments or that sort of thing he finds out that hes got whole chain of withholds that doesnt that hasnt been given up to security check or something of that sort dont you see nobody expects you to make any stenographic heroics or become very heroic stenographically along this line okay does that answer it robin male voice yes thank you all right yes male voice in the bulletin instruction about sending all sec checks forwarding them in to you this applies male voice does this apply to all auditors this applies this applies to sec checks on scientologists and is an old regulation and has been thrown pretty much adrift whether or not sec checks when completed should be sent in to this has gone adrift that was the old security program of getting up policy of scientology and clean hands dont you see male voice yes and this was actually preventer it wasnt that i wanted to know these things it was that there was some feeling about when this was first begun that such data might be used for blackmail or something like this and of course if the actual security check is sent through and its already resident in safe someplace in the world its couldnt so operate ever you got the idea male voice yeah so that was its basic thing now there is another check purely organizational in character which is just now being worked up we got the joburg and the joburg passed immediately over into processing now it had left need for an actual security check which some hco area sec or d of t or somebody like that could give rapidly or the assoc sec sec could give for employment or for course admission that didnt take seventeen hours of auditing or something like that to deliver and it must be at the absolute outside about thirty questions that would be the absolute limit that the thing could possibly tolerate you see preferably less all right so let us say that person has been accepted for employment in central organization then i would expect to see their employment check sent on through with the record and fact that they had been employed you got the idea male voice yes now that would also then keep central organizations from bypassing this particular step because you would notice that there was lot of personnel there that you had employment application form for of any kind and that would mean the security had dropped in some particular area and if you want trouble in an area drop its security i can guarantee youll get trouble in the area all right now if field auditor wished to do this and the field auditor were giving this short form security check to people that were operating in some area or something like that and they wanted to send it in to why they should do so it isnt required proposition however clean hands check has now become so difficult to do because the security check so rapidly changes its character under processing and so many security factors emerge which were totally unreal before that clean hands certificate or seal on certificate is now only going to be issued as result of being audited on these routines which have repetitive security checks mixed up in them now therefore it you could not do what was originally intended which is you simply drop in on an hco and get security check and they give you clean hands stamp and thats that thats not possible but you could forward the evidence of having been audited all the way up the line on routine you see with consequent security check with copies of the security checks either in an hgc or in the field hand those over to hco and clean hands seal could be then administered but it would now be as result of auditing auditing on the routines it would not be as result of simply security check in an hco male voice how much auditing on the routine how much male voice yes sir well i dont see that theres much reason to drop below the level of release male voice thank you id say auditing to release and thats about the only thing thatd make it safe and secure washingtons all excited right now theyre going around in small circles and being very proud and that sort of thing they just committed an administrative blunder they left the d of p on pc and that mustnt happen ds of ps even acting ds of ps must not be given pc you see thats an old piece of policy because it skimps then auditing on all the rest of the pcs in the place but theyve got somebody going through to clear and this fellow was appointed acting d of p who was auditing somebody and this person is just just flicking the edges of clear see and washington went into panic because all of sudden the assoc sec was transferred over on to course temporarily and the d of p was transferred over on to course and somebody in just as he went off post thought well this is good auditor hes had lots of good results and so forth well just make him acting d of p without finding out how many weeks he had left on pc or what state the pc was in everybody takes look at this and finds the pc busy almost clear you see and going to clear and it just caused fantastic amount of randomity let tell you because it was in effect because of this erroneous appointment in effect they had almost been told not to clear somebody got the idea and boy that put everybody in sweat that certainly couldnt work that way but this is the first clear of recent times theyve made in the hgc so that this activity was being stepped in the road of of course had rockets going up in all directions you know white lights burning tar barrels and flags flown upside down dont do this to us you know of course the fellow who did it to them is probably safely over on course now very interesting australia and washington are starting to boom and they are going at great guns their academies are getting fuller and fuller and their hgcs are fuller and fuller london right now is getting in desperate state some of its leading lights are here and all of sudden had didnt have to but did bust policy and take list one and two which is the staff staff auditors off staff and put them on outside pcs oh oh but when it had been found out that this had happened it was already day or sos auditing deep into the outside pcs you see all that means is is that the acting d of p denied sources for staff auditors and so forth just was straight up against the wall see in view of the fact the temporary d of p london is down here right this minute why of course this is all up in the air with screaming thunk theres two things that happen you just mustnt have the director of processing auditing pc and running all the pcs too that just doesnt work you get results anywhere and the other thing that mustnt happen these days is the staff mustnt lose its list auditors it just mustnt because i think staffs of say all of central organizations and the hcos have right to be clear and theyre all getting real on it you know theyve gone along for years without having very much reality on clearing and weve been wading into them with sevenleague boots as far as as doing it right and squaring it up and their willingness is terrifically high and theyve been getting up to high level of duplication and so on and all of sudden their results are coming up coming up getting better and better and theyre moving up and theyre moving people easily now up into brackets of release and theyre looking right ahead and suddenly clear is getting real to an awful lot of people in scientology it was never real to before i never thought it would take eleven years but give you an idea right now the only reasons why clearing is not being done are scandalously huge they are never minor errors theyre errors of such magnitude they would just stagger you you know tremendous errors the two people in joburg who were hanging up on whom rout i posted the notice on your board in here did you read it the two people there in joburg who were hanging up and cables were flying back and forth routine 1 was not working on these people all of sudden they the course instructor waded in with all flags flying and grabbed ahold of the pcs and put them on meter and they had screaming present time problems of long duration that should have been caught in the security check model sessions every session but had never had any attention paid to them and she found the present time problems on these two people and they instantly broke into tears both of them you know just cracked right up and so on boom and all of sudden routine 1 started to work like mad that is what is called an error of magnitude is running somebody with the rudiments out and these things certainly must have been showing up on some rudiments it takes an error of magnitude something like the auditor didnt come to the session for three weeks and the fellow didnt get clear you know and this should start to be getting real to you youve noticed when you came here you were probably pulling lot of wild blunders of one character or another okay and youve noticed these things smoothing out right all right and youve noticed that there was something to smooth out didnt you understatement of today your next lecture is friday afternoon okay thank you
