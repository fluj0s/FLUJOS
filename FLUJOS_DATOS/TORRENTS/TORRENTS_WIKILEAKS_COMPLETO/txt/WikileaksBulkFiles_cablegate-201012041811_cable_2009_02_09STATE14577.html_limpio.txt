acting as jeffrey feltman reasons 14 bd 1 sbu this is an action request for posts in abu dhabi amman cairo kuwait city manama and riyadh please see 7 summary and background 2 c posts are requested to raise with appropriate government officials our concerns about russian plans to transfer the s300 longrange airdefense system to iran washington would like these governments to immediately and directly raise this issue with their russian counterparts arguing that such transfer could significantly enhance irans air defense capability increase regional instability and reward iran at time when iran is undermining security with its nuclear pursuits and support for terrorism 3 snf over the past few years the russian government has told the usg that while it has contract to supply the s300 airdefense system to iran the transfer would not be completed until iran complied with its international nuclear obligations usg suspicions were piqued during february 12 meeting when russian foreign minister lavrov brushed off us burns concerns over such transfer but did not reiterate russias yearlong position that the s300 transfer depends on iranian behavior the iranian defense minister is currently in moscow for talks with russia on the delivery of the s300 initial press reports quote rosoboronexport officials as saying there has been progress in the talks to expedite delivery of the system russian news media also speculates that russia will not deliver the s300 to iran for fear of upsetting discussions with the new us administration despite the denials in the press we are concerned by the technical preparations for delivery of the s300 which are complete or nearing completion it appears that there is need for action now to prevent seniorlevel political decision to allow the delivery to go foward 4 c though russia states that the s300 is defensive in nature the mobile system could be used to support offensive operations s300s located on iranian territory would have the range to engage targets well beyond irans borders into persian gulf and iraqi airspace threatening us and regional partners 5 sbu unscr 1747 passed on march 24 2007 urged all states to exercise vigilance and restraint in the supply sale or transfer of broad range of conventional weapons as defined for the purpose of the united nations register on conventional arms to iran while the s300 does not technically meet the definition within the register for any of the categories of items listed in paragraph 6 of unscr 1747 transfers of this type of system to iran seriously undercut the primary objective of unscr 1747 to further press iran to comply with the unscr 1737 requirement to suspend its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the iaea 6 c we have selected action addressee posts to engage the gor because we maintain strong bilateral relationships and share common security interests but also because we believe these governments have potential leverage with russia in particular abu dhabi kuwait egypt and saudi arabia have increased their politicalmilitary cooperation with russia these countries can legitimately make the point to moscow that they cannot have close politicalmilitary partnership with russia while russia strengthens the hand of iran arguably the greatest threat to each of these nations security suggested talking points 7 sbu posts are requested to approach appropriate host government officials regarding the possible transfer of the s300 airdefense system from russia to iran post should draw from the following talking points in the spirit of our bilateral cooperation we request your governments support in urging russia to not transfer highly sophisticated air defense system to iran in 2005 russia signed contract to sell the modern longrange s300 air defense missile system to iran in 2006 after it was exposed that iran was not in compliance with its international nuclear obligations russia assured us it would not complete the transfer until iran changed course despite these assurances we are concerned that russia is in position to deliver the s300 to iran as soon as political decision is taken moreover when we raised our concerns in recent seniorlevel conversations with russian officials we were not reassured by the russian response we request that you use your influence with russia to sharpen their decision against transfer at this time though russia has categorized the s300 as defensive in nature it is mobile system that can easily used to support offensive operations the most modern variant of the s300 highperformance surfacetoair missile system would greatly improve irans ability to defend large regions of its airspace up to 200 km beyond its borders with iran in noncompliance of its international nuclear obligations and continued meddling in regional affairs this is not the time for russia to engage in arms sales with tehran we are also concerned about the implications of the transfer of an air defense system to iran such transfers would undercut the broad objective of unscr 1747 to increase pressure on iran to suspend its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the iaea by denying arms transfers to iran if appropriate we believe you have particular leverage given your expanded military cooperation with russia you can legitimately argue that moscow cannot be true partners in the politicalmilitary realm while simultaneously strengthening iran which is arguably the greatest threat to your nations security end talking points clinton
