architectural and transportation barriers compliance board access board published ada1 and architectural barriers act accessibility guidelines adaag these guidelines in part provided detailed guidance on play and recreation areas lodging at place of education and communications requirements these guidelines have legal effect and serve as guidance only until adopted by the department of justice in final regulations in its june 17 2008 nprms doj proposed the adoption of parts i and iii of the access board guidelines and also proposed several other amendments 2 g21g138g143g142g561g10g138g155g139g152g155g561 the adoption of the access board guidelines would serve to increase accessibility however the department of justice expressed concern about the potential effect of these changes on existing structures to address these concerns doj added safe harbor provisions for both titles ii and iii for title ii which applies to states and localities individuals with disabilities must be provided access to programs when viewed in their entirety unlike title iii public entity under title ii is not required to make each of its existing facilities accessible however in order to provide certainty to public entities and individuals with disabilities dojs proposed regulations add safe harbor provision stating that public entities that have brought elements into compliance in existing facilities are not simply because of the departments adoption of th 2004 adaag as it s new standards required to modify those elements in order to reflect incremen tal changes in the proposed standards 3 title iii of the ada which covers places of public accommodation requires each covered facility to be accessible but only to the extent that accessibility changes are readily achievable the proposed regulations for title iii like those for title ii also contain safe harbor provision this provision would presume that qualified small business has done what is readily achievable in given year if in the prior tax year it spent fixed percentage of its revenues on readily achievable barrier removal4 doj stated that it was concerned that the incremental changes in the 2004 adaag may place unnecessary cost burdens on businesses that have already removed barriers by complying with the 1991 standards in their existing facilities5 doj solicited comments on whether public accommodations that operate existing facilities with play or recreation areas should be exempted from compliance with certain requirements 1 42 usc 12101 et seq for more detailed

proposed regulations for both titles ii and iii contain virtually identical language relating to service animals they define service animal as meaning any dog or other common domestic animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of qualified individual with disability some examples provided we re guiding individuals who are blind pulling wheelchair assisting an individual during seizure and retrieving medicine or the telephone the term service animals would not include farm animals or wild animals such as non human primates including those born in captivity reptiles ferrets amphibians and rodents assistance for individuals with psychiatric cognitive and mental disabilities was specifically included however animals whose sole function is to provide emotional support comfort therapy companionship therapeutic benefits or to promote emotional wellbeing are not service animals 6 generally public entity title ii or public accommodation title iii must modify its policies practices or procedures to permit the use of service animal by an individual with disability if the entity can show that the use of the service animal would fundamentally alter the entitys service program or activity the service animal need not be allowed the proposed regulations delineate exceptions where service animal may be removed these include where the animal is out of control or not housebroken and where the animal poses direct threat to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation 7 if the animal is excluded because of these reasons the entity must give the individual with disability the opportunity to participate without the animal8 the work the service animal performs must be directly related to the individuals disability and the animal must be individually trained housebroken under the control of its handler and have harness leash or other tether9 public entity or public accommodation is not responsible for supervising the animal and although the entity may not ask about the individuals disability or require documentation the entity may ask what work the animal has been trained to perform10 finally an individual with service animal must be allowed access to areas open to the public program participants and invitees and there shall be special fees or surcharges although there may be charges for damages caused by the service animal 11 in its discussion of the proposed regulations the justice department observed that it received large number of complaints about service animals and that there was trend toward the use of wild or exotic animals the justice departme nt also noted distinction between comfort animalsthat have the sole function of providing emotional support and which would not be covered and psychiatric service animals which may be trained to provide number of services such as reminding an individual to take his or her medicine and which would be covered however doj specifically recognized that there are situations not governed exclusively by the title ii and title iii regulations particularly in the context of residential settings and employment 6 proposed 28

the ada was enacted the choices of mobility aids for individuals with disabilities have increased dramatically individuals with disabilities have used not only the traditional wheelchair but also large wheelchairs with rubber tracks riding lawn mowers golf carts gasolinepowered twowheeled scooters and segways doj indicated that it had received inquiries concerning whether these devices need to be accommodated the impact of these devices on facilities and personal safety issues the proposed regulations under both titles ii and iii include sections on mobility devices they require public entity under title ii or public accommodation under title iii to permit individuals with mobility impairments to use wheelchairs scooters walkers crutches canes braces or other similar devices designed for use by individuals with mobility impairments in areas open to pedestrian use 13 public entity or public accommodation under title iii must make reasonable modifications in its policies and procedures to permit the use of other powerdriven mobility devices by individuals with disabilities unless it can be demonstrated that such use is not reasonable or would result in fundamental alteration of the nature of the services or programs 14 in addition public entity or public acco mmodation under title iii shall establish policies permitting the use of other powerdriven mobility devices when reasonable the determination of reasonableness is to be based on the dimensions weight and operating speed of the mobility device in relation to wheelchair the potential risk of harm to others by the operation of the mobility device the risk of harm to the environment or natural or cultural resources and the ability of the public accommodation to stow the mobility device when not in use if requested by user15 public entity or public accommodation under title iii may ask person using powerdriven mobility device if the mobility device is required because of the persons disability but may not ask questions about the persons disability16 doj solicited comments on whether there are certain types of powerdriven mobility devices that should be accommodated whether motorized devices that use fuel 12 73 f ed reg 34473 34516 june 17 2008 for discussion of the arguments for and against the proposed regulations provisions on service animals see rebecca skloot creature comforts t he
