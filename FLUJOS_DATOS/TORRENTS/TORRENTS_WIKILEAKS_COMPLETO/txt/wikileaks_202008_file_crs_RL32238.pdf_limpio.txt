what is defense transformation the term defense transformation came into common use among military officials and defense analysts in the 1990s it has been defined by military officials military analysts and other observers in various ways in general defense transformation can be thought of as largescale discontinuous and possibly disruptive changes in military weapons or ganization and cepts of operations ie approaches to warfighting that are prompted by significant changes in technology or the emergence of new and diffe rent international s ecurity challenges advocates of defense transformation stre ss that in contrast to incremental or evolutionary military change brought about by normal modernization efforts defense transformation is more likely to feature di scontinuous or disruptive forms of change they also stress that while much of the discussion over transformation centers on changes in military weapons and systems changes in organization and concepts of operations can be as important or even mo re important than changes in weapons and systems in bringing about transformation changes in organization and concepts of operation some have argued can lead to transformation even without changes in weapons and systems while even drama tic changes in weapons and systems might not lead to transformation if not accompanied by changes in organization and concepts of operation dod has defined transformati on in one document as process that shapes the changing natu re of military competition and cooperation through new combinations of concepts capabilities people and organizations that exploit our nations advantages and protect against our asymmetric vulnerabilities to sustain our strategic position which helps underpin peace and stability in the world first and foremost transformation is continuing process it does not have an end point transformation anticipates and creates the future and deals with the coevolution of concepts processes organizations and technology prof ound change in any one of these areas necess itates change in all transformation creates new competitive areas and competencies and identifies leverages or creates new underlying principles for th way things are done transformationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs3 1 us department of defense office of the secretary of defe nse director force

new sources of power the overall objective of these changes is to sustain us competitive advantage in warfare1 the administrations view of transfor mation has evolved somewhat since 2001 to include more emphasis on transformation as continui ng process rather than one with an endpoint and on making changes not just in combat forces and warfighting doctrine but in supporting dod activities ch as training personnel management logistics and worldwide basing arrangem ents the administrations definition of transformation also encompasses maki ng changes in dod business policies practices and procedures particularly w ith an eye toward streamlining operations and achieving efficiencies so as to reduce costs and move new weapon technologies from the laboratory to the field more quickly the administration has also used the term transformation to refer to proposed changes in matters such as the budget process and environmental matters affecting military training2 some observers have equate d transformation principally with the idea of making us forces more mobile agile and lethal through greater reliance on things such as unmanned vehicles uvs advanced technologies for precisionstrike operations and special operations forces s of other observers have equated transformation principally with the concept of networkcentric warfare ncw3 and the c4isr4 technologies needed to implement ncw still others have quated transformation primarily with making us military forces more expeditionary5 with making order ofmagnitude improvements in specific military capabilities with making many smaller improvements that add up to larger improvements or with the notion of weapon modernization in general some of these alternative formulati ons are not so much definitions of transformation as prescriptions for how u s military forces should be transformed others can be viewed as reducing the thre shold of what qualifie s as transformation by including changes that while perhaps dramatic represent an elaboration of currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs4 6 the term rma was reformulation of the even earlier term military technical revolution mtr which was coined by sovi et military analysts during the cold war to refer to fundamental changes in warfare that are brought about by major new technologies such as nuclear weapons western military analysts concerned that the term mtr placed too exclusive an emphasis on changes in technol ogy created the term rma so as to take into account changes in military organization and concepts of operations as well 7 for

consulted few or several rmas are deemed to have occurred in r ecent d ecades or centuries although the terms transformation and rma have sometimes been used interchangeably rma can be used to refer to major change in the character of warfare while transformation can be used to refer to the process of changing military weapons concepts of opera tion and organization in reaction to or anticipation of an rma what are the administrations plans for transformation dod publications dod has published number of documents describing the administrations plans for defens transformation among these are elements of defense transformation published in october 2004 military transformation strategic approach published in the fall of 2003 transformation planning guidance published in april 2003 and separate transformation plans called road maps for each of the military services overall vision in general the adminis trations vision for defense transformation calls for placing increased emphasis in us defense planning on the following irregular warfare including terrorism insurgencies and civil war potential catastrophic security threats s uch as the possession and possible use of weapons of

to traditiona l warfighting strategy that focuses on seeking out the enemys military forces wherever they might be and then using firepower to destroy them piece by piece through process of gradual attrition until the enemy is longer capable of fighting effectively 9 effectsbased operations also called effectsbased warfare refers to warfighting strategy that has been proposed as an alternative to traditional attritionstyle warfare rather than focusing on seeking out and destroying enemy forces wherever they might be effectsbased operations focuses on attacking selected key ements of the enemys ability to fight in coordinated manner under an effectsbased strategy us forces might attack the enemys military leadership its military commandandc ontrol systems and the most politically and militarily significant elements of the enemys fielded military forces while bypassing less significant enemy military forces the goal of effectsbased warfare is to create specific effects on the enemy that lead to rapid co llapse of the enemys willingness and ability to fight without having to go through timecons uming and potentially costly effort to destroy the bulk of the enemys military forces through gradual process of attrition some observers argue that the concept of ffectsbased operations is not new and has been employed in past conflicts observers also argue however that new technologies may significantly increase the effectiveness of effectsbased operations 10 scott c buchanan energy and force transformation joint force quarterly issue 42 3rd quarter 2006 5154military

agility and precision application of firepower some transf ormation advocates characterize these changes as shifting from an industrialage approach to wa r to an informationage approach as mentioned earlier the administrati ons transformation vision also includes proposals for changing things like tr aining practices personnel management practices logistics operations and worldwide basing arrangements and for changing dods business practices particularly w ith an eye toward streamlining those practices so as to accelerate the fielding of new weapons and generate savings that can be used to invest in them potential emerging area of dods vision for defense transformation are actions to reduce dods energy requirements and to develop alternative energy sources partic ularly for forces operating in distant theaters10 dod has stated that its transformation effort is focused on achieving six critical operational goals and consists of four essential pillars six critical operational goals identified by secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld provide the focus for the depa rtments transformation efforts 1 protecting critical bases and defeating ch emical biological radiological and nuclear weapons 2 projecting and sustaining forces in antiaccess environments 3 denying enemy sanc tuary 4 leveraging information technology 5 assuring informati on systems and conducting information operations and 6 enhancing space capabilitie s over time the continued focus of the departments force transforma tion efforts on the development of the capabilities necessary to achieve these six critical operational goals will help shift the balance of us forces and broaden our capabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs6 11 military transformation strategic approach op cit p 3the four military transformation p illars identified by the secretary strengthening joint operations exploitin g us intelligence advantages concept development and experimentation and developing transformational capabilities constitute the essential elements of the departments force transformation strategy the first pillar focuses on stre ngthening joint operations through the development of joint concepts and architectures and the pursuit of other important jointness initiatives and inte roperability goals the overarching joint operations concepts jopsc document provides the operational context for military transformation by linking strategic guidance with the integrated application of joint force capabilities th second pillar involves exploiting us intelligence advantages through multiple inte lligence collection assets global surveillance and reconnaissance and enhanced exploitation and dissemination our ability to defend america in the new security environment requires unprecedented intelligence capabilities to anticipate where when and how adversaries intend to harm us the third pillar concept development and experimentation involves experimentation with new approaches to warfare operational concepts and capabilities and organizational constructs through war gaming simulations and field exercises focused on emerging cha llenges and opportunities experiments designed to evaluate new concepts provide results that help refine those concepts in an iterative fashion regarding the fourth pillar the department requires strong mechanisms for implementing results from concept development and experimentation and more immediatel for developing transformational capabilities needed to support the jopsc and subordinate joint operating concepts11 in its report on the 2005 quadrennial fense review submitted to congress on february 6 2006 dod stated if one were to attempt to characterize the nature of how the department of defense is transforming and how the senior leaders of this department view that transformation it is useful to view it as shift of emphasis to meet the new strategic environment in this era ch aracterized by uncertainty and surprise examples of this shift in emphasis include from peacetime tempo to wartime sense of urgency from time of reasonable predictability to an era of surprise anduncertainty from singlefocused threats to multiple complex challenges from nationstate threats to decentralized network threats from nonstate enemies from conducting war against nations to conducting war in countries weare not at war with safe havens from one size fi ts all deterrence to tailored deterrence for roguepowers terrorist networks and nearterm competitors from responding

fairbanks implementing the transformation vision joint force quarterly issue 42 3rd quarter 2006 3642 14 an official from oft in an article publis hed in the summer of 2006 stated the following one dod tool for tracking overall progress each year is the strategic transformation appraisal preparing the appraisal and presenting it to the secretary of defense are important re sponsibilities of the director of force transformation the document assists the secretary in evaluating progress across dod in the implementation of transformation both in direction and balance in developing the appraisal the oft re views the annual service transformation roadmaps and the joint roadmap prepared by us joint forces command and assesses the direction of transformati on these roadmaps are compared with broad guidance contained in key dod documents such as the quadrennial defense review report transformation planning guidance and strategic planning guidance the office of force transformation employs three sets of qualitative metrics to analyze roadmaps the first set derived from the national defense strategy reviews the four strategic challenges facing the united states traditional irregular catastrophic and di sruptive as the first step in topdown cbp capabilitiesbased planning effort the second set focuses on capabilities described in the four approved joint operating concepts jocs the joint interdependencies the services have id entified in their transformation roadmaps continuedkey elements of the air forces transformation plan include reorganizing the service to make it more expeditionary and exploiting new technologies and operational concepts to dramatically improve its ability to rapidly deploy and sustain forces to dominate air and space and to rapidly identify and precisely attack targets on global basis key elements of naval transformation include focus on operating in littoral ie near shore waters newdesign sh ips requiring muchsmaller crews directly launching and supporting expeditionary operations ashore from sea bases more flexible naval formations and more flexible shipdeployment methods elements common to the transformation plans of all the

following cebrowskis departure from oft in january 2005 the offices deputy director terry pudas served as acting director on august 28 2006 dod announced that it planned to dissolve oft and transfer

would happen to the ffices programs and track record ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs10 innovation some experts even said dods catalyst for experimentation would be lost now more than seven months later those concerns and questions remain unanswered dod has folded most of oft into reorganized policy office within the office of the secretary of defense it has shifted ofts people and projects into new offices but it has not finalized the role of the new office were starting to settle into the new c onstruct as we move from outside the policy organization to more aligned construct said terry pudas former acting director of oft pudas now is ac ting deputy assistant secretary of defense for forces transformation and resources in the office of the undersecretary of defense for policy when dod decided to close oft pe ntagon officials countered critics by saying transformational thinking at dod had matured and was engrained sic throughout the department they emphasi zed how networkcentric warfare and the emerging global information grid are revolutionizing intelligence collaboration and battlefield command and control the decision to move oft inside osds policy structure was doubleedged sword pudas said on the one hand former oft employees are more directly connected to policy development and implementation which encourages better coordination but now they now spend much of their time in meetings rather than focusing on new initiatives pudas new office houses 20 people about the same number as at oft but staff members arent leading any projects yet he said instead they are focused on collaborating with other offices and overseeing policy concerns of the joint forces and transportation commands john garstka director of force transf ormation in the new office said being inside the osd policy shop has advantag but the unique character of the original oft has been lost it all revolves around the money garstka said adding that the former oft leadership pursued project funding without getting specific permission it remains to be seen whether ofts chnology concept development activities now under the director for defense research and engineering will remain robust he said proximity to the policymaking process doesnt necessarily correspond to increased influence in that process garstka added networkcentric operations core philo sophy of the first oft director retired vice adm art cebrowski and oft is one idea that dod has embraced officials say dod has applied ofts conceptual framework for networkcentric operations to variety of case studies

weapon systems one element of dods effort in th is regard is evolutionary acquisition with spiral development ea sd which dod has identified is its new preferred acquisition strategy easd is an outgrowth of the defense acquisition reform movement of the 1990s and is inte nded to make its acquisition system more responsive to rapid changes in threats t echnology and warfighter needs for more on easd see crs report rs2119521 how much would transformation cost calculating the potential cost of defense transformation is not an easy matter for the following reasons opinions differ often signifi cantly on what kinds of planned changes for dod qualify as transf ormational and which do not developing and acquiring new w eapons and equipment that are deemed transformational can be very expensive but the cost of this can be offset perhaps substantially or even completely by reducing or cancelling the developmen t and procurement of non transformational weapons and equipment that would longer be needed implementing transformational changes in organization can also cost money but these costs might similarly be offset by the reduced recurring cost of maintaining the new forms of organization while exercises intended to expl ore new warfighting concepts of operation can be expensive the cost of staging these exercises can be offset by curtailing other exercises that are intended to further develop older concep ts of operations if transformation is viewed as continuing process rather than one with an endpoint any calculations of its cost become snapshots rather than final figures in an article published in the summe r of 2006 an official from dods office of force transformation oft stated frequent question is how much dod spends on transformation that is hard to say because transformation is far more than list of programs the concepts capabilities and organizations developed through innovative ideas experimentation major training exercise s and assessment of

director dod office of force transformation terry j pudas joint force quarterly issue 42 3rd quarter 2006 3235the battlefields of afghanistan and iraq cannot be categorized under transformation line item in the defense budget22 although some analysts who advocate defense transforma tion might personally support increased spending on defense mo st appear to advocate transformation as costneutral or costreducing proposition indeed some advocates support their proposals for transformation on the grounds that they represent lessexpensive strategy for meeting future security challenges than the alternative of investing in programs for making more incremental or evolutionary changes to current military capabilities some analysts have gone even further arguing that an increasing defense budget might actually impede tr ansformation by permitting officials to believe that projected security challenges can be solved by investing larger amounts of funding in todays military forces while constrained or declining defense budget conversely might help encourage transforma tion by forcing officials to contemplate more seriously the idea of shifting to new and less expensive approaches for meeting these challenges the administration has stressed that its interest in incorporating current best privatesector business practices in dod operations and in running dod more like business is driven in large part by desire to run dod more efficiently and thereby generate maximum savings that can be used for among other things investing in transformation the acting director of oft in an interview published in the summer of 2006 stated transformation should not be equated with plussing up the defense budget transformation should be associated w ith how we make choices using new logic so its not necessarily about spending more money its really bout making better choices23 what weapons and systems are transformational although transformation involves and might even depend more significantly on changes in organization and concepts of operations much of the debate over transformation has centered on which military weapons and systems should be deemed transformational nd which not experts disagree on this question even when working from common definition of transforma tion as result lists of weapons and systems that qualify as transformational differ from one source to the next supporters of various weapon procurem ent programs keenly aware of the administrations interest in transformation have been eager to argue that their own favored weapon systems should be viewed transformational or at least not as legacy label that for many has become synonymous with obsolescence andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs14 24 the term legacy was originally policyneutra l term used to refer to existing or current generation weapons that while not transfor mational could well be worth procuring or maintaining in inventory at least for some number of years over time however the term legacy has come to be used in more pejorative manner to refer to systems that are not only not transformational but obsolescent and ripe for immediate termination or eliminationsuitability for reduction or termination24 as result wide variety of military weapons and systems have been presented at one point or another as transfor mational while fewer have been spotlighted as non transformational or legacy weapons and systems that ve frequently been identif ied as closely associated with the administrations transformation vision include but are not necessarily limited to the following c4isr systems that link military units into highly integrated networks for conducting ncw forces for countering terrorists and weapons of mass destruction space systems missile defense unmanned vehicles special operations forces precisionguided airdelivered weapons lighter and more mobile army ground forces and smaller and faster navy surface ships weapons and systems that have been identified by various observers not necessarily by dod as non transformational or legacy include the following weapons and associated c4isr system s that operate in an isolated standalone manner rather th an as part of network unguided weapons heavy armored forces for the army manned tactical aircraft and large slowermoving navy surface ships how might it affect the defense industrial base related matter of interest to congress is how the administrations transformation plans if implemented might affect the composition of us defense spending and as consequence revenues and employment levels of various firms in the defense industrial base in assessi ng this issue potential points to consider include the following transformational vs nontr ansformationallegacy programs to some degree implementing th administrations transformation vision could lead to increased dod spending on the items listed above as transformationa l and more restrained amounts of spending on the items listed above as non transformational or legacyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs15 25 examples of such firms would include bo eing general dynamics lockheed martin northrop grumman and raytheon the 5

18 newport naval war college 2003 largescale systems integration work implementing the administrations transformation plan could lead to increased dod spending for the largescale systems integration work that is required to tie individual military weapons and systems together into smoothly functioning systems of systems some defense firms particularly some of th larger ones have ta ken steps to strengthen and publicize their capacity for performing this kind of work large diversified contractors vs specific units within them and smaller firms for larger defense firms that perform wide range of work for dod25 implementing the administrations transformation plan might transfer revenues from one part of the company to another without necessar ily having major effect on the companys bottom line the potential effect on individual units within those firms however may be greater if those facilities specialize in producing only certain kinds of defense goods or services these units as well as smaller defense firms that perform lessdiverse array of wo rk for dod may be more likely to experience either an increase or decrease in revenues and employment levels as result of transformation26 traditional vs nontraditional dod contractors some new technologies that may contribute to transformati on particularly certain information technologies are found more in the civilian economy than in the world of defens erelated research as result implementing the administrations transformation plan could shift some dod spending away from traditional dod contractors and toward firms that previously have done little or business with dod indeed dod is attempting to encourage firms that have not previously done business with dod socalled nontraditional contractors to begin doing bus iness with dod so that dod may make maximum use of applicable technologies from the civilian sector how might it affect operations with allied forces dod states that it is working toward transformed force capable of conducting effective combined operations with other countries military forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs16 27 military transformation strategic approach op cit p 10as the us military transforms our interests are served by making arrangements for international military cooperation to ensure that rapidly transforming us capabilities can be applied effectively w ith allied and coalition capabilities us transformation objectives should be used to shape and complement foreign military developments and priorities of likely partners both in bilateral and multilateral contexts27 some observers have expre ssed concern that us fense transformation could widen the current gap between us and foreign military concepts and capabilities which is already quite significant in some respects and thereby make us forces less compatible with allied and friendly forces reduced compatibility they believe could lead to reduced coalition warfighting effectiveness when the united states engages in combined operations with allied and friendly forces increased risk of fratricide ie friendlyfire incidents involving us and coalition forces and increased risk of political friction between the united states and its coalition partners whether transformation strengthens or weakens the ability of us forces to participate in combined operations with foreign military forces will depend in part on decisions made by foreign governments if these governments for example invest in networking technologies for ncw that are compatible with those used by us forces it could increase interoperability with us military forces to level that was not possible in prencw times c onversely if those governments do not significantly invest in networkingrela ted technologies for ncw or invest in technologies that are not compatible with those of us forces it could reduce interoperability between us forces and the forces of t hose countries below what it is today under this latter scenario operations involving us and foreign military forces might be combined operations in name only with the foreign forces assigned to marginal or other functions that can be performed acceptably without being fully incorporated into the us networ k or without creating complications future interoperability with foreign military forces will also depend in part on decisions made together by us and foreign leaders decisions that align emerging us concepts of operations with those of foreign military forces and to hold combined exercises employing these new c oncepts of operations could improve the potential for conducting effective combin ed operations conversely lack of coordination in emerging concepts of ope rations or of exercises to practice them together could impede interoperability and reduce the potential for effective combined operations the acting director of dods office of force transformation oft in an interview published in the summer of 2006 stated the following when asked about the transformation effort s of other countries i would point to three or four countri that have really accelerated their efforts in thinking about transformati on in pursuing this informationage construct of networkcentric operations we can look to the united kingdom and to australia who are very engaged in things like

networkcentric business to really high level singapore is doing an enormous amount of work they have something thats akin to transformation office as well and of course weve got the allied command transformation which is stood up and this nato reaction force28 what transformational changes has congress initiated congress in past years has instituted changes that can be viewed as examples of or contributors to defense transformation including changes that were opposed or at least not proposed or actively supporte d by dod leaders examples of such actions include the following congress played leading role in promoting jointness within dod by creating the landmark 1986 go ldwaternichols act pl 99 433 which among other things stre ngthened the institutional roles played by the joint chiefs of staff and the commanders in charge of joint forces assigned to various regions around the world although the term defense transformation was not in common use in 1986 the goldwaternichols act today can be viewed in retrospect as significant early example of defense transformation29 congress in 1986 also expressed concern for the status of sof within overall us defense pla nning and passed legislation section 1311 of the fy1987 defense authorization act pl 99661 to strengthen its position among other things section 1311 established the us special operations command ussocom as new unified command to the exte nt that enhancement of special operations forces is now consid ered key element of defense transformation this action also can be viewed in retrospect as an early example of transformation in 2000 congress passed legisla tion section 220 of the fy2001 defense authorization act pl 106398 that established transformationrelated goal for unmanned vehicles the provision stated that it shall be goal of the armed forces to achieve the fielding of unmanned remotely c ontrolled technology such that 1 by 2010 onethird of the aircra ft in the operational deep strike force

report april 16 2007 31 thom shanker and mark mazzetti gaining militarys trust is early step for incoming defense secretary new york times nov 9 2006potential oversight issues for congress transformation under dods new leadership one potential oversight issue for congress relating to defense transformation is how much dod will continue to emphasi ze transformation and how dods overall vision for transformation might change as result of robert gates succeeding donald rumsfeld as secretary of defe nse in december 2006 rumsfeld was key designer of dods transformation plans nd at his departure perhaps the most prominent single advocate for defense tran sformation gates whose career prior to becoming secretary of defense was primarily in intelligence rather than defense is not generally known as leading advo cate of or commentator on defense transformation an april 2007 news article stated that farreaching change toward smaller more hightech force was to be cornerstone of rumsfelds legacy and he had vested interest in the answer today new defense secretary robert gates has yet to say much about transformation its been largely pushe d to the background by the immediate needs to if anything expand the military move consistently resisted by rumsfeld30 november 2006 news article stated course corrections for iraq are certai nly anticipated but officials predicted that mr rumsfelds push for future military transformation would become secondary priority as mr gates deals with the challenges that threaten to overwhelm both the military and its budget gates will focus less on transformation and more on understanding the world around us one pentagon offici said we all agree that needs to happen31 second november 2006 ne ws article stated rumsfeld who first served as secretary of defense during the ford administration from 1975 to 1977 returned as defense secretary in 2001 vowing to transform the military into highly mobile and technological force but some of his decisions such as relying more heavily on special forces rather than large divisions and slashi ng prized weapon systems immediately sparked opposition and his reputation for brooking little dissent and discounting military advice engendered growing resentment yet rumsfeld who next month will become the longestserving defense secretary ever is also credited with bringing his corporate executives knifehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs19 32 bryan bender secretarys style drew resentment boston globe nov 9 2006 33 julian barnes rumsfeld s ought new role for pentagon angeles times nov 9 2006to massive bureaucracy in critical need of reform in particular he improved the defense departments famously imprecise financial controls and forced unpopular changes to an entrenched civilian workforce many of his supporters believe the changes he championed over the objections of culture highly resistant to change help explain his frayed relations with military leaders and handful of retired generals who have increasingly called for his removal32 third november 2006 ne ws article stated rumsfelds many supporters credit him with making tough decisions speeding up the transformation of the military cutting outdated weapons systems advancing the missile defense system creating new focus on domestic security repositioning forces out of ge rmany and south korea and reorganizing the army to make it more adaptable but critics shook their heads in dismay as he considered cutting the army by two divisions early in his tenure they also charge that he allowed strongwilled deputies to drop the militarys adherence to the baseline standards of the geneva convention and created military prison at guantanamo bay beyond the reach of american courts the critics said he equated long experience with antiquated thinking and ran roughshod over people who offered alternate ideas to these critics the difficulties of the iraq war are the natura l result of rumsfelds tendency to ignore the warnings of others lawrence dirita former advisor to rumsfeld disputed the criticism and argued that his former boss accelerated the militarys move toward more nimble and fastermoving force adversaries around the world understa nd how much more capable we are today dirita said there has been paradigm shift at the department of defense toward speed agility and precision33 fourth november 2006 news article stated at the pentagon mr rumsfelds program was called transformation and it acquired the status of an official ideology mr rumsfeld was enamored of missile defense and spacebased systems issues he had worked on during his years out of office like many conser vatives he was wary about the army leadership which he considered to be too wedded to heavy forces and too slow to change within the military establishment however the defense secretary quickly became contentious figure as his penc hant for handson management and his theories on military transformation were given field test mr rumsfeld did nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs20 34 michael r gordon rumsfeld force for change did not change with the times amid iraq tumult new york times nov 9 2006decide how many troops would be deployed for the war in iraq but he helped pick the generals who did he never he sitated to push prod and ask questions to shape their recommendations in terms of his transformation agenda mr rumsfeld enjoyed at best mixed success he overhauled the coldwarera system of military bases around the world decision that has led to the reduction in american forces in europe and korea he also insisted on greater cooperation among the military services on the positive side he brought the armed forces to much higher degree of joint thinking and integration said barry m blechman member of the defense policy board which advises mr rumsfeld and the president of dfi international consulting firm still despite mr rumsfelds avowed intention to challenge orthodox pentagon thinking few major weapons programs were canceled and the militarys force structure and spending patterns were not radically altered at the end of the day you would have to say that for rumsfeld transformation was more promise than reality said andrew f krepinevich jr the executive director of the center for strategic and budgetary assessments he made start but these things take time and it is clear now that iraq has denied him that time34 specific elements of do ds transformation vision certain specific elem ents of dods transformation vi sion at least as articulated during rumsfelds tenure as secretary of fense have been subject to debate at various points these include the following the emphasis on networ kcentric warfare the planned total size of the force the armys transformation plan the balance of air power vs ground forces the balance of tactical aircraft and unmanned air systems vs long range bombers the emphasis on special operations forces forces for stability operations the role of reserve forces ballistic missile defense and the meaning of and emphasis on effectsbased operations overall leadership and management of transformation december 2004 report from th government accountab ility office on dods transformation efforts statedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs21 35 us government accountability office military transformation clear leadership accountability and management tools are need ed to enhance dods fforts to transform military capabilities gao0570 december 2004dod has taken pos itive steps to design and implement complex strategy to transform us military capabilities but it has not established clear leadership and accountability or fully adopted resultsoriented management tools to help guide and successfully implement this approach the responsibility for transforming military capab ilities is currently spread among various dod organizations with one person or tity having the overarching and ongoing leadership responsibilities or the account ability for achieving transformation results in addition alt hough dod establishe d an informal crosscutting group that meets occasionally to discuss transformation issues this group has charter formal responsibilities or au thority to direct changes gao has previously reported that key practices for successful transformation include leadership that sets the direction of transformation and assigns accountability for results and the use of crosscutting implementation teams which can provide the daytoday management needed for success in recent testimony on dods business transformation we underscored the importance of these elements and stated that dod has not r outinely assigned accountab ility for performance to specific organizations or individuals w ho have sufficient authority to accomplish goals dod officials believe that single organization accountable for transformation results and formal implementation team are not necessary because existing informal mechanisms involve key organizations that can individually implement needed changes and an annual assessment of transformation roadmaps is prepared for the secretary of defense who can direct the transformation efforts of each organiza tion however in the absence of clear leadership accountability and formal implementation m echanism dod may have difficulty resolving differences among competing priorities directing resources to the highest priorities and ensuring progress should changes in senior personnel occur in addition in formal mechanisms are not sufficient to provide transparency to the process or assurance to congress that dod is allocating resources to address needed improvements rather than desired improvements while dod s strategy to transform military capabilities is good first step dod has not fully developed resultsoriented management tools that can help managers effectively implement and manage major efforts and focus on achieving results specif ically dod has not revised its initial transformation goals set in 2001 to reflect new joint concepts thus dod lacks foundation for developing other tools such as pe rformance goals and measures and linking specific resources needed to achieve each goal dod faces challenges in developing these tools because the joint concepts are being developed concurrently with its plans to acquire new capabilities but without these resultsoriented tools it will be difficult for dod to determine the extent to which its transformation efforts are achieving desired results to measure its overall progress or to provide transparen cy for how billions of dollars in planned investments are being applied35 experiments and exercises some observers have ex pressed concern about wh ether experiments and exercises carried out nominally in support of transformation are sufficiently focusedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32238crs22 36 some observers for example expressed concern that usjfcoms large

approach argue that people who have made mistakes in their careers are also likely to have never tried to accomplish anything that if successful would have qualifie d as useful innovationon exploring transformational warfighting ideas as opposed to demonstrating existing nontransformational cap abilities observers have so expressed concerned about whether experiments and exercises are sufficiently challenging and realistic and whether they are scripted to ensure the success of favored transformation ideas36 potential questions for congress regarding transformationrelated tests and exercisesinclude the following culture of innovation dod officials and other obs ervers note that inst illing culture of i nnovation among dod personnel will be critical to implementing transformation37 instilling such culture could involve things such as actions to create an institutional and workplace receptiveness to new ideas procedures for protecting people who generate new ideas and avoi dance of the socalled zerodefect approach for assessing performance and sel ecting people for advancement38 potential challenges to creating cu lture of innovation include widespread

can be complex undertaking transformation thus raises potential issue as to whether congress has adequate information nd tools for assessing dods progress in implementing transfor mation potential questions for congress on this issue include the following are the defense budget and rela ted budgetjustification documents that are submitted to congress adequately organized and presented to support the incorporation of th concept of transformation into congresss review of the budget if not in what ways should the organization and content of the budget and the budgetjustification documents be changed does dod provide congress with fficiently detailed and periodic information about the status of dod transformation efforts to support congressional overs ight of these efforts should congress for example require dod to submit periodic reports on the status of transformation in genera l or of specific aspects of transformation does congress have adequate metrics for measuring military capability in light of transformationrelated changes such as ncw or for assessing dods success in implementing transformation transformation as allpurpose justification tool some observers expressed concern that the administrations regular some might even say habitual use of the term transformation in discussing its proposals for dod during the period 20012004 turned th concept of transformation into an empty slogan or buzzphrase other observers were concerned that the administration invoked the term transformation as an all purpose rhetorical tool for justifying its

requirements that were ins tituted to assist congress in conducting oversight of dod activities41 potential oversight questions for congress relating to the administrations use of transformation in justifying its proposals for dod include the following did the administration debase the concept of transformation through overuse did the administration in justifying its proposals for dod draw adequate distinctions between pr oposals that are transformational and proposals that are not transf ormational but mig ht nevertheless be worthwhile for other reasons did the administration use the term transformation in part to cloud potential issues pertaining to its proposals for dod or to minimize congressional debate on those proposals did the administration use the large complex and somewhat abstract topic of transformation in part to occupy congresss attention and thereby distract congress from c onducting detailed oversight on dods proposed budgets or to keep congress off balance as it attempted to c onduct oversight of dod activities legislative activity for fy2008 the proposed fy2008 defense budget was submitted to congress in early february 2008
