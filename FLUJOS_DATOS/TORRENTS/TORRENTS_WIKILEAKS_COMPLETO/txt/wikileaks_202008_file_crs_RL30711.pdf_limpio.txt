divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711the house apportionment formula in theory and practice summary the constitution requires that states be represented in the house in accord with their population it also requires that each st ate have at least one representative and that there be more than one representative for every 30000 persons apportioning seats in the house of repres entatives among the states in proportion to state population as required by the c onstitution appears on the surface to be simple task in fact however the constitution presented congress with issues that provoked extended and recurring debate how may representatives should the house comprise how populous should cong ressional districts be what is to be done with the practically inev itable fractional entitle ment to house seat that results when the calculations of proportionality are made how is fair ness of apportionment to be best preserved over the years since the ratification of the constitution the number of representatives has varied but in 1941 congre ss resolved the issue by fixing the size of the house at 435 members how to apportion those 435 seats however continued to be an issue because of disagreement over how to handle fractional entitlements to house seat in way that both met constitutional and statutory requirements and minimized unfairness the intuitive method of apportionment is to divide the united states population by 435 to obtain an average number of pe rsons represented by member of the house this is sometimes called the ideal size congressional district then states population is divided by the ideal size to determine the number of representatives to be allocated to that state the quotient will be whole number plus remainder say 14489326 what is congress to do with the 0489326 fractional entitlement does the state get 14 or 15 seats in the house does one discard the fractional entitlement does one round up at the arith metic mean of the two whole numbers at the geometric mean at the harmonic mean congress has used or at least considered several methods over the ears eg jeffersons discarded fractions method websters major fractions met hod the equal proporti ons method smallest divisors method greatest divisors th vinton meth od and the hamiltonvinton method the methodological issues have b een problematic for congress because of the unfamiliarity and difficulty of some of the mathematical concepts used in the process every method congress has used or c onsidered has its advantages and disadvantages and none has been exem pt from criticism under current law however seats are apportioned using th equal proportions method whic h is not without its critics some charge that th equal proportions method is biased toward small states they urge that either the major fractions or the hamiltonvinton method be dopted by congress as an alternative strong case can be made for either equal proportions or major fractions deciding between them is policy matter based on whether minimizing the differences in district sizes in absolute terms through major fractions or proportional terms through equal proportions is most preferred by congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711contents introduction 1 constitutional and statutory requirements 2 the apportionment formula 3 t h f r m u l i n t h r 3 c h l l n g s t t h c u r r n t f r m u

and others argued that jeffersons method was unconstituti onal because it discriminated against small states webster argued that an additional repr esentative should be awarded to state if the fractional entitlement was 05 or greater method that decreased the size of the house by 17 members in 1832 congress subsequently used fixed ratio method proposed by rep samuel vinton following the census of 1850 through 1900 but this method led to the paradox that alabama lost seat even though the size of the house was increased in 1880 continuedthe house apportionment formula in theory and practice1 introduction one of the fundamental issues befo re the framers at the constitutional convention in 1787 was how power was to be allocated in the congress among the smaller and larger states the solution ultimately adopted known as the great or connecticut compromise resolved the controversy by creating bicameral congress with states represented equa lly in the senate but in proportion to population in the house the constitution provided the first apportionment of house seats 65 representatives were allocated to the states based on the framers estimates of how seats might be appor tioned after census hous apportionments thereafter were to be based on article 1 section 2 as modified by the fourteenth amendment amendment xiv section 2 representatives sh all be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers article 1 section 2 the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state shall have at least one representative from its beginning in 1789 congress was f aced with questions about how to apportion the house of representatives questions that the constitution did not answer how populous should congressiona l district be on average how many representatives should the house comprise moreover matter how one specified the ideal population of congressional distri ct or the number of representatives in the house states ideal apportionment would as practical matter always be either fraction or whole number nd fraction say 14489326 thus another question was whether that state would be apportioned 14 or 15 representatives consequently these two major issues dominated the apportionment debate how populous congressional district ought to be later recast as how large the house ought to be and how to treat fractional entitlements to representatives2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs2 2 continued subsequently mathematician wf willcox proposed the major fractions method which was used following the census of 1910 this method too had its critics and in 1921 harvard mathematician ev huntington proposed the equal proportions method and developed formulas and computational tables for all of the other known mathematically valid apportionment methods committee of the national academy of sciences conducted an analysis of each of those methods smallest divisors harmonic mean equal proportions major fractions and greatest di visors and recommended that congress adopt huntingtons equal proportions met hod for review of this history see us congress house committee on post office and civil serv ice subcommittee on census and statistics the decennial population census and congressional apportionment 91st cong 2nd sess h rept 911314 washington gpo 1970 appendix b pp 1518 3 article i section 2 defines both the maxi mum and minimum size of the house but the actual house size is set by law there can be fewer than one representative per state and more than one for every 30000 persons thus the house after 1990 could have been as small as 50 and as large as 8301 representatives 4 the actual language in of article 1 section 2 pertaining to this minimum size reads as continuedthe questions of how populous congressi onal district should be and how many representatives should constitute the hous have received little attention since the number of representatives was last increased to 435 after the 1910 census3 the problem of fractional entitlement to representatives however continued to be troublesome various methods were considered and some were tried each raising questions of fundamental fa irness the issue of fair ness could not be perfectly resolved inevitable fractiona l entitlements and the require ment that each state have at least one representative lead to inevitable disparities among the states average congressional district populations th congressional deba which sought an apportionment method that would minimize those disparities continued until 1941 when congress enacted the equal pr oportions method the apportionment method still in use today in light of the lengthy debate on appor tionment this report has four major purposes 1 to summarize the constitutional and statutory requirements governing apportionment 2 to explain how the current appor tionment formula works in theory and in practice 3 to summarize recent challenges to it on grounds of unfairness and 4 to explain the reasoning underl ying the choice of the equal proportions method over its chief alternative major fractions constitutional and statutory requirements the process of apportioning seats in the house is constrained both constitutionally and statutorily as noted previously the constitution defines both the maximum and minimum size of the house there can be fewer than one representative per state and mo re than one for every 30000 persons4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs3 4 continued follows the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state shall have at least one represen tative this clause is sometime misread to be requirement that districts can be larg er than 30000 persons rather than as it should be read as minimumsi ze population requirement 5 55 stat 761 1941 sec 22 codified in 2 usc 2a in other words after the 2000 census this report is due in january 2001 6 ibid sec 22 b 7 the apportionment population is the population of the 50 states it excludes the population of the district of columbia nd us territories and possessionsthe 1941 apportionment act in addition to specifying the apportionment method sets the house size at 435 and mandates administrativ procedures for apportionment the president is require d to transmit to congress statement showing the whole number of persons in each state and the resulting seat allocation within one week after the opening of th first regular session of congress following the census5 the census bureau has been assigned the responsibility of computing the apportionment as matter of practice the director of the bureau reports the results of the apportionment on december 31st of the census year once received by congress the clerk of the house is charge d with the duty of sending to the governor of each state certificate of the number of representatives to which such state is entitled within 15 days of receiving notice from the president6 the apportionment formula the formula in theory an intuitive way to apportion the house is through simple rounding met hod never dopted by congress first the us apportionment population7 is divided by the total number of seats in the house eg in 1990 249022783 divided by 435 to identify the ideal sized congressional district 572466 in 1990 then each states population is divided by the ideal district population in most cases this w ill result in whole number and fractional remainder as noted earlier each state will definitely receive seat s equal to the whole number and the fractional remainders w ill either be rounded up or down at the 5 rounding point there are two fundamental problems with using simple rounding for apportionment given house of fixed size first it is possible that some state populations might be so small that they w ould be entitled to less than half seat yet the constitution requires that every state must have at least one seat in the house thus method which relies entir ely on rounding will not comply with the constitution if there are states with very small populations second even method that assigns each state its constitutional min imum of one seat nd otherwise relies on rounding at the 5 rounding point might re quire floating house size because rounding at 5 could result in ither fewer or more than 435 seats thus this intuitive way to apportion fails because by defin ition it does not take into account thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs4 8 the geometric mean of 1 and 2 is the squa re root of 2 which is 14142 the geometric mean of 2 and 3 is the square root of 6 which is 24495 geometric means are computed for determining the rounding points for the size of any states delegation size equal proportions rounds at the geometric mean which varies rather than the arith metic mean which is always halfway between any pair of numbers thus state which would be entitled to 104871 seats before rounding will be rounded dow n to 10 because the geometric mean of 10 and 11 is 104881 the rationale for c hoosing the geometric mean rather than the arithmetic mean as the rounding point is discussed in the section analyzing the equal proportions and major fractions formulas 9 any number in this range divided into each states population and r ounded at the geometric mean will produce 435seat houseconstitutional requirement that every state have at least one seat in the house and the statutory requirement that th house size be fixed at 435 the current apportionment thod the method of equal proportions established by the 1941 act satisfies the constitutional and statutory requirements although an equal proportions apportionment is not norma lly computed in the theoretical way described below the method can be unde rstood as modification of the rounding scheme desc ribed above first the ideal sized district is found by dividing the apportionment population by 435 to serv as tri divisor then each states apportionment population is divided by th ideal district size to determine its number of seats ra ther than rounding up any remainder of 5 or more and down for less than 5 how ever equal proportions rounds at the geometric mean of any two successive num bers geometric mean of two numbers is the square root of the product of the two numbers8 if using the ideal sized district population as divi sor does not yield 435 seats the divisor is adjusted upward or downward until rounding at the geometric mean will result in 435 seats in 1990 the ideal size district of 572 466 had to be adjust ed upward to between 573555 and 5736439 to produce 435member house because the divisor is adjusted so that the total number of seats will equal 435 the problem of the floating house size is solved the constitutional requirement of at least one seat for each state is met by assigning each state one seat automatically regardless of its population size the formula in practice deriving the apportionment from table of priority values although the process of dete rmining an apportionment through series of trials using divisions near th ideal sized distri ct as described above works it is inefficient because it requires series of calculations using different divisors until the 435 total is reached acco rdingly the census bureau determines apportionment by computing priority list of state claims to each seat in the house during the early twentieth century walter f willcox cornell university mathematician discove red that if the rounding points used in an apportionment method are divided into each states population the mathematical equivalent ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs5 10 us congress house committee on post office and civil service subcommittee on the census and

for automatic reapportionment rather than requiring the congress to pass new apportionment law each decade by authority of section 9 of pl 85508 72 stat 345 and section 8 of pl 863 73 stat 8 which admitted alaska and hawaii to statehood the house size was temporarily increased to 437 til the reapportionment resulting from the 1960 census when it returned to 435 12 reciprocal of number is that number divided into onemultiplying the population by the reciprocal of the rounding point the resulting numbers can be ranked in priority list for assigning seats in the house10 such priority list does not assume fixed house size because it ranks each of the states claims to seats in the house so that any size house can be chosen easily without the necessity of extensive recomputations11 the traditional method of constructing pr iority list to apportion seats by the equal proportions method involves first computing the reciprocals12 of the geometric means between every pair of consecutive whole numbers the rounding points so that it is possible to multiply by decimals rather than divide by fractions the former being considerably easier task for exam ple the reciprocal of the geometric mean between 1 and 2 141452 is 11414452 or 707106 78 these reci procals are computed for each rounding point they are then used as multipliers to construct the priority list table 1 provides list of multipliers used to calculate the priority values for each state in an equal proportions apportionment to construct the priority list each states apportionment population is multiplied by each of the multipliers the resulting products are ranked in order to show each states claim to seats in the house for example assume that there are three states in the union california new york and florida and that the house size is set at 30 representatives the first seat for each state is assigned by the constitution so the remaining twentysev seats must be apportioned using the equal proportions formula the 1990 pportionment populations for these states were 29839 250 for california 18044505 for new york and 13003362 for florida table 2 p 6 illustrates how the priority values are co mputed for each state once the priority values are computed they are ranked with the highest value first the resulting ranking is numbered and seats are assigned until the total is reached by using the priority rankings in stead of the rounding procedures described above it is possible to see how an increase or decrease in the house size will affect the allocation of seats without the necessity of doing new calculations table 3 p 7 ranks the priority values of the three states in this example showing how the 27 seats are assigned httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs6 table 1 multipliers for determining

base d on the 1990 census is appended to this report it shows priority rankings for the assignment of seats in house ranging in size from 51 to 500 seats challenges to the current formula the equal proportions rule of rounding at the geometric mean results in differing rounding points depending on which numbe rs are chosen for example the geometric mean between 1 and 2 is 14142 and the geometric mean between 49 and 50 is 4949747 table 4 on the following page shows the rounding points for assignments to the house using the equa l proportions method for state delegation size of up to 60 the rounding points are listed between each delegation size because they are the thresholds which must be passed in order for state to be entitled to another seat the table illustrates that as the delegation size of state increases larger fractions are necessary to entitle the state to additional seats the increasingly higher rounding points n ecessary to obtain additional seats has led to charges that the equal proportions fo rmula favors small stat at the expense of large states in 1982 book about congressional apportionment entitled fair representation the authors ml balinski and h p

into each states 1990 apportionment population will produce house size of 435 if rounded at these points which are the geometric means of each pair of successive numbers table by crs bill that would have changed the pportionment method to another formula called the hamiltonvinton method was introduced in 198115 the fundamental principle of the hamiltonvinton method is that it ranks fracti onal remainders to reapportion the house using hamiltonvi nton each states population would be divided by the ideal sized congre ssional district in 1990 249022783 divided by 435 or 572466 any state with fewer resident s than the idealsiz ed district would receive seat because the c onstitution requires each state to have at least one househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs10 16 the hamiltonvinton method used after the 18501900 censuses is subject to the alabama paradox and various other popula tion paradoxes the alabama paradox was so named in 1880 when it was discovered that alab ama would have lost seat in the house if the size of the house had been increased from 299 to 300 another paradox known as the population paradox has been variously described but in its modern form with fixed size house it works in this way two states ma gain population from one census to the next state which is gaining population at rate fa ster than state b may lose seat to state b there are other paradoxes of this type hamiltonvinton is subject to them whereas equal proportions and major fractions are not 17 the absolute value of number is its magnit ude without regard to its sign for example the absolute value of 8 is 8 the absolute value of the expression 42 is 2 the absolute value of the expression 24 is also 2seat the remaining states in most cases have claim to whole number and fraction of representative each such state receives the whole number of seats it is entitled to the fractional remainders are rankordered from highest to lowest until 435 seats are assigned for the purpose of this analysis we will concentrate on the differences between the equal proportions and major fractions methods because the hamiltonvinton method is subject to several mathemati cal peculiarities16 equal proportions or major fractions an analysis each of the major competing methods equal proportions currently used and major fractions can be supported mathem atically choosing between them is policy decision rather than matter of c onclusively proving that one approach is mathematically better than the other major fractions apportionment results in house in which each citizens share of hi s or her representative is as equal as possible on an absolute basis in th equal proportions apportionment now used each citizens share of his or her representative is as equal as possible on proportional basis the state of indiana in 1980 would have been assigned 11 seats under the major fractions method and new mexico would have received 2 seats under this allocation there would have been 2004 representatives per million for indiana residents and 1538 representative per million in new mexico the absolute value17 of the difference between these tw numbers is 0466 under the equal proportions assignment in 1980 indiana act ually received 10 seats and new mexico 3 with 10 seats indiana got 1821 representatives for each million persons and new mexico with 3 seats received 2308 re presentatives per million the absolute value of the difference is 0487 because major fractions minimizes the absolute population differences under it indiana w ould have received 11 seats and new mexico 2 because the absolute value of s ubtracting the population shares with an 11 and 2 assignment 0466 is smaller than 10 nd 3 assignment 0487 an equal proportions apportionment how ever results in house where the average sizes of all the states congressional districts are as equal as possible if their differences in size are expressed proportionally that is as percentages the proportional difference betw een 2004 and 1538 major fracti ons is 30 the proportional difference between 2308 and 1821 equal proportions is 27 basedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs11 18 major fractions best conforms to the spirit of these decisions if the population discrepancy is measured on an absolute basis as the courts have done in the recent past the court has never applied its one person one vote rule to apportioning seats states as opposed to redistricting within states thus establishe d rule of law is being violated arguably apportionment method can meet the one person one vote standard required for districts within states unless the size of the house is in creased significantly thereby making districts smaller 19 nevada had two seats with population of 799184 montana was assigned two seats with population of 786690 south dakotas single seat was required by the constitution with population of 690178 the vast majority of the districts based on the 1980 census 323 of them fell within the range of 501000 to 530000on this comparison the method of equal pr oportions gives new mexico 3 seats and indiana 10 because the proportional differen ce is smaller 27 than if new mexico gets 2 seats and indiana 10 30 from policy standpoint one can make case for either method by arguing that one measur of fairness is preferable to the other the case for major fractions it can be argued that the major fractions minimization of absolute size differences among districts most closely reflects the one person one vote principle established by the supreme court in its series of redistricting cases baker v carr 369 us 186 1964 through karche r v daggett 462 us725 198318 although the one person one vote rules have not been applied by the courts to apportioning seats among states major fractions can reduce the range between the smallest and largest district sizes more than equal proportions one of the measures which the courts have applied to withinstate redistri cting cases although this range would have not changed in 1990 if major fr actions had been used in 1980 the smallest average district size in th country would have been 399592 one of nevadas two districts with equal proportions it was 393345 one of montanas two districts in both cases the larg est district was 690178 south dakotas single seat19 thus in 1980 shifting from equal propor tions to major fractions as method would have improved the 296833 differen ce between the largest and smallest districts by 6247 persons it can be ar gued because the equal proportions rounding points ascend as the number of seats increases rather than staying at 5 that small states may be favored in seat assignments at the expense of large states it is possible to demonstrate this using simulation techniques the house has only been reapportioned 20 times since 1790 the equal proportions method has been used in five apportionments and major fractions in three eight apportionments do not provide enough historical information to enable policy makers to generalize about the impact of using differing methods computers however can enable reality to be simula ted by using random numbers to test many different hypothetical situations thes techniques such as the monte carlo simulation method are useful way of observing the behavior of systems when experience does not provide enough info rmation to generalize about themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs12 20 comparing equal proportions and major frac tions using the state populations from the 19 actual censuses taken since 1790 reveals that the small states would have been favored 34 of the time if equal proportions had been used for all the apportionments major fractions would have also favored small stat in these cases but only 03 of the time see fair representation p 78 21 hp young and ml balinski evaluation of apportionment methods prepared under contract for the congressional research servic of the library of c ongress contract crs8415 sept 30 1984 p 13apportioning the house can be viewed as system with four main variables 1 the size of the house 2 the population of the states 3 the number of states and 4 the method of apportionment 1984 ex ercise prepared for the congressional research service crs involving 1000 s imulated apportionments examined the results when two of these variables we re changed the method and the state populations in order to furt her approximate reality the st ate populations used in the apportionments were base d on the census bureaus 1990 population projections available at that time each method wa s tested by computing 1000 apportionments and tabulating the results by state there was discernible pattern by size of state in the results of the major fractions appor tionment the equal proportions exercise however showed that the smaller stat were persistently advantaged20 another way of evaluating the impact of possible change in apportionment methods is to determine the odds of an outcome being different than the one produced by the current method equal proportions if equa l proportions favors small states at the expense of large states would switching to major fractions method that appears not to be influenced by the size of state increase the odds of the large states gaining additional representation based on the simulation model prepared for crs this appears to be true the odds of any of the 23 largest states gaining an additional seat in any given apportionment range from maximum of 134 of the time california to low of 2 of the time alabama the odds of any of the 21 multidistricted smaller states losing seat range from high of 17 montana which then had two seats to low of 0 colorado if major fractions were used instead of equal proportions in the aggregate switching from equal proportions to major fractions could be expected to shift zero seats about 37 of the time to shift 1 seat about 49 of the time 2 seats 12 of the time and 3 seats 2 of the time and 4 or more seats almost never and these shifts will always be from smaller states to larger states21 the case for equal proportions support for the equal proportions formula primarily rests on the belief th at minimizing the proportional differences among districts is more important than minimizing the absolute differences laurence schmeckebier proponent of the equal proportions method wrote in congressional apportionment in 1941 that mathematicians generally agree that the significant feature of difference is its relation to the smaller number and not its absolute quantity thus the increase ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs13 22 schmeckebier congressional apportionment p 60 23 representatives per million is computed by dividing the number of representatives assigned to the state by the states populati on which gives the number of representatives per person and then multiplying the resulting dividend by 100000050 horsepower in the output of two engine s would not be of any significance if one engine already yielded 10000 horsepow er but it would double the efficiency of plant of only 50 horsepower it has been shown that the relative difference between two apportionments is always least if the method of equal proportions is used moreover the thod of equal proportions is the only one that uses relative differences the methods of harmonic mean and major fraction being based on absolute differences in addition the method of equal proportions gives the smallest relative difference for both average population per district and individual share in repr esentative other method takes account of both these factors therefore the thod of equal proportions gives the most equitable distribution of repr esentatives among the states22 an example using massachusetts nd oklahoma 1990 populations illustrates the argument for proportional differences the first step in making comparisons between the states is to standardize the figures in some fashion one way of doing this is to express each states representation in the house as number of representatives per million residents23 the equal proportions formula assigned 10 seats to massachusetts and 6 to oklahom in 1990 when 11 seats are assigned to massachusetts and five are given to oklahoma using major fractions massachusetts has 1824 repr esentatives per million pe rsons and oklahoma has 1583 representatives per million the abso lute difference between these numbers is 241 and the proportional difference between the two states representatives per million is 1522 when 10 seats are assigned to massachusetts and 6 are assigned to oklahoma using equal proportions massachusetts has 1659 representatives per million and oklahoma has 19 representative per million the absolute difference between these numbers is 243 and the proportional difference is 1453 major fractions minimizes absolute differen ces so in 1990 if this if this method had been required by law massachusetts and oklahoma would have received 11 and five seats respectively because the abso lute difference 0241 representatives per million is smaller at 11 and five than it would be at 10 and 6 0243 equal proportions minimizes differences on proporti onal basis so it assigned 10 seats to massachusetts and six to oklahoma becau the proportional difference between 10 and 6 allocation 1453 is smaller than would occur with an 11 and 5 assignment 1522 the proportional difference versus absolu difference argument could also be cast in terms of the goal of one person one vote the courts use of absolute difference measures in state redistricting cases may not necessarily be appropriate when applied to the apportionment of s eats among states the courts already recognize that different rules govern redistricting in state legislatures than in congressional districting if the one person one vote standard were ever to be applied to apportionment of seats among stat process that differs significantlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30711crs14 24 montana argued in federal court in 1991 and 1992 that the equal proportions formula violated the constitution because it does not achieve the greatest possible equality in number of individuals per representative department of commerce v montana 503 us 442 1992 writing for unanimous court ju stice stevens however noted that absolute and relative differences in district sizes are id entical when considering deviations in district populations within states but they are different wh comparing district populations among states justice stevens noted however alt hough common sense supports test requiring good faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality within each state the constraints imposed by article i 2 itself make that goal illusory for the nation as whole he concluded that congress had ample power to enact the statutory procedure in 1941 and to apply the method of equal proportions after the 1990 census 25 the total area of the us is 3618770 square miles the area and rank among all states in area for the seven single district states in this scenario are as follows alaska 591004 1 delaware 2045 49 montana

redistricting within states pr oportional difference measures might be accepted as most appropriate24 if the choice between methods were judged to be tossup with regard to which mathematical process is fairest are there other representational goals that equal proportions meets which are pe rhaps appropriate to consider one such goal might be the desirability of avoiding geographically large districts if possible after the 1990 apportionment five of the seven st ates which had only one representative alaska delaware montana north dakot south dakota vermont and wyoming have relatively large land areas25 the five representatives of the larger states served 127 of the us population but also re presented 27 of the us land area arguably an apportionment method that would potentially reduce the number of very large districts would serve to in crease representation in those states very large districts limit the opportunities of constitu ents to see their representatives may require more district base d offices and may require to ll calls for telephone contact with the representatives dist rict offices switching fro m equal proportions to major fractions may increase the number of st ates represented by only one member of congress although it is impossible to predict with any certainty using census bureau projections for 202526 as an illustration major fractions
