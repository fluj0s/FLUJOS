health inspection service aphis is responsible for enforcing the animal welfare act awa 7 usc 2131 et seq which requires minimum standards of care for certain warmblooded animals bred for commercial sale used in research transported commercially or exhibited to the public however the act excludes farm animals raised for food and fiber from coverage1 the humane methods of slaughter act 7 usc 1901 et seq enforced by usdas food safety and inspection service fsis governs the humane slaughter and handling of livestock but not poultry at packing plants also under the so called twentyeight hour law 49 usc 80502 last amended in 1994 many types of carriers may not confine animals in vehicle or vessel for more than 28 consecutive hours without unloading the animals for feeding water and rest2 at the state level laws to prevent deliberate animal cruelty sometimes apply to farm animals but few states have prescribed onfarm treatment standards that appears to be changing in states where animal activists have sponsored successful ballot measures to impose care standards on animal producers in florida voters approved 2002 ballot measure outlawing gestation crates for pigs in arizona voters did the same along with veal stall ban in 2006 in 2008 california for examples voters approved socalled proposit ion 2 which will require that veal calves egg laying hens and pregnant pigs be allowed to lie down stand up fully extend their limbs and turn around freely the california law to take effect in 2015 subjects violators to misdemeanor penalties of up to 1000 in fines andor 180 days in jail

assert that todays intensive farming systems perpetuate standard practices that in their view are harmful to animals wellbeing examples include rearing large numbers of livestock or poultry in close confinement with little or room for natural movement and activity eg housing sows in small gestation crates chickens in battery cages isolating veal calves in small crates performing surgery such as docking hog tails dehorning cattle and trimming poultry beaks so that confined animals do not hurt each other or their handlers permitting commercial movement of nonambulatory livestock downers that are disabled due to sickness or injury and not fully stunning poultry which are not covered by the humane slaughter act and sometimes livestock most of which are covered before slaughter 1 see crs

and water pollution food safety problems eg misuse of animal drugs and foodborne bacterial illnesses and the decline of smallerscale family farms they also believe that if regulators approve future applications of biotechnologysuch as animal cloning genetic alterations to improve productivity and the use of livestock as factories for pharmaceuticals and human organsanimal wellbeing will be compromised some animal rights groups advance the more controversial argument that humans have right to use animals for any purpose including for food

understand their animals welfare needs and address them adequately they express concern that efforts by poorly informed critics could lead to costly and counterproductive regulations harmful to their industry and the animals alike agricultural food processing and number of animal science groups have argued that support for science education and voluntary guidelines are more effective ways of assuring animal welfare recognizing that more customers are concerne d about animal treatment some major food retailers have developed humane animal care standards their suppliers must follow also various industry groups have published voluntary standards for care that they encourage members to meet including the american meat institute american sheep industry association national cattlemens beef association national chicken council pork board and united egg producers several of these along with certified humane raised and handled and free farmed of the american humane association provide socalled third party certification programs intended to assure consumers that products were derived from producers who followed prescribed care standards some animal welfare groups contend th at such voluntary industry standards are not strong or specific enough are not enforceable andor are primarily marketing contrivances g11g151g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 members of congress have offered various proposals to require changes in the treatment of animals on the farm during transport or at slaughter members of the house and senate agriculture committees which generally have jurisdiction over such bills have held hearings on various farm animal welfare issues but they generally express preference for voluntary rather than regulatory approaches to improving animal care

mutilates disfigures tortures or intentionally causes an animal held for commercial use pain or suffering or has responsibility for an animal held for commercial use and fails to provide food water shelter and health care as is necessary to assure the animals health and wellbeing appropriate to the animals age and species is subject to penalties of up to one year in jail andor 100000 in fines commercial use would mean use or intended for use as food or fiber or for food or fiber production separate bill hr 1726 would have required the federal government to purchase products derived from animals only if they were raised according to humane standards ie had adequate shelter with sufficient space to walk and move around with limbs fully extended had adequate food and water with starvation or forcefeeding and had adequate veterinary care

the treatment of farm animals reached center stage in february 2008 when usda announced the largestever meat recall by hallmarkwestland meat packing co the recall came after usdafsis found that the facility for at least two years did not always notify inspectors about cattle that had become nonambulatory after they had been inspected but before they were slaughtered for food fsis regulations explicitly prohibit most nonambulatory downer cattle in human food because of their higher risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease moreover fsis charged that the plant had violated the humane slaughter act which first came to light after animal welfare advocates secretly videotaped what they described as employees inhumanely handling downer cattle before slaughter the act stipulates among other things that method of slaughtering or handling in connection with slaughtering shall be deemed to comply with the public policy of the united states unless it is humane in number of subsequent 2008 hearings fsis came under strong criticism for failing to enforce the act this was despite the fact that congress had included in the 2002 farm law pl 107171 section 10305 resolution urging usda to fully enforce it and to report the number of violations to congress annually since then congress has directed millions of dollars to fsis for fulltime inspectors to oversee compliance and for incorporation of humane tracking system into the agencys field computer systems see also crs report rs22819 nonambulatory livestock and the humane methods of slaughter act by geoffrey s becker g6g152g160g151g142g155g156g561 in 2005 the senatepassed version of hr 2744 usdas fy2006 appropriation included floor amendment sponsored by senator akaka to prohibit nonambulatory livestock also called downers from being used for human food the akaka amendment would have applied not only to nonambulatory cattle which by fsis regulation are already generally banned from the food supply but also to any sheep swine goats horses mules or other equines unable to stand or walk unassisted at inspection the house version lacked such ban and conferees removed the senate language prior to final passage pl 10997 the proposal reemerged in the 110 th congress as s 394 and hr 661which also would have required that nonambulatory livestock be humanely euthanized rather than slaughtered s 2770 contained similar provisions and also would have set gradually increasing penalties for violations g10g152g155g156g142g561g21g149g138g158g144g145g157g142g155g561 for many years horse protection groups have sought to end the slaughter of horses for human food policy issues focus on the acceptability of the practice and on how to dispose of or care for unwanted horses longer being slaughtered unti l 2007 two foreignowned plants in texas and one in illinois slaughtered horses for human food 105000 in 2006 all for export on january 19 2007 however federal appeals court panel declared texas law banning commerce in horsemeat to be enforceable effectively closing the two plants there the remaining foreign plant in illinois closed later in 2007 after federal appeals court ruled that new state law banning the practice was constitutional the us supreme court declined to hear the case in june 2008 these developments had occurred as congress considered succession of measures to ban or otherwise limit equine slaughter during respective floor debates on usdas fy2006 appropriation pl 10997 the house and senate approved amendments to ban use of

presumption was that since inspection is required for any meat to enter the human food supply ban on inspection funding would halt the practice however the three plants petitioned usda for voluntary antemortem inspection services as authorized by the agricultural marketing act of 1946 with the mortem portion funded by user fees usda agreed to this plan which took effect in early 2006 subsequently the fy2008 usda appropriation 741 division of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 both prohibited the use of appropriated funds to inspect horses prior to slaughter for human food and also the usda rule see above that provided for the collection of user fees animal welfare groups have continued to seek new federal legislation such as companion bills hr 503s 311 and hr 6598 in the 110th congress permanently ending horse slaughter for human food the american veterinary medical association vma which has opposed the bills has asserted that horses that otherwise would have been transported and slaughtered in the united statesunder more humane conditionsare now going to mexico and canada for processing in 2007 more than 44000 horses were shipped for slaughter to mexico and 35000 to canada respectively 312 and 41 increase from 2006 according to vma bill supporters argued that one of the intents of hr 503s 311 and of hr 6598 was to prevent such exports bill critics countered that once horses leave the country enforcement and oversight would be problematic at best separately pending bill hr 6278 would have prohibited the interstate transportation of horses in
