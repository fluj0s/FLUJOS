jurisdictions including voter registration recruiting pollworkers running each election and choosing and purchasing new voting systems these oﬃcials are therefore critical to the successful implementation of state and federal election laws including the help america vote act of 2002 hava pl 107252 nevertheless there has been little objective information on the perceptions and attitudes of leos about election reform this report discusses the results of scientiﬁc opinion survey of principal local election oﬃcials1 that was designed to help ﬁll that gap in knowledge the ﬁndings may be

election reform results of survey summary there are more than 9000 local election jurisdictions in the united states local election officials leos are responsible for adminis tering elections in those jurisdictions leos are therefore critical to the successful implementation of the help america vote act of 2002 hava p l 107252 and state election laws but there has been little objective information on the perceptions and attitudes of those officials about election reform this report which will not be updated discusses the results of recent scientific survey of leos the findings may be useful to congress in considering funding and po ssible reauthorization of hava the demographic characteristics of leos are unusual for group of government officials almost threequarters are women and 5 belong to minority groups most do not have college degree and mo st were elected to their positions some survey results suggest areas of potentia l professional improve ment such as in education and in profe ssional involvement at the national level over the past 20 years jurisdictions have turned increasingly to computer assisted voting systems especially optical scan and direct recording electronic dre systems the most important fact ors reported by leos in the acquisition of new systems are federal and state requi rements and funding hava encourages but does not require systems that detect voter error but it does require that voting machines be available that are fully acce ssible to persons with disabilities about half of jurisdictions with optical scan systems use centralcount which cannot help voters to correct mistakes before casting the ballot however most jurisdictions acquiring new voting systems are choosing either precinctcount optical scan or dres both of which can help voters avoid errors leos are generally highly satisfied with whatever voting systems they are using now they have less confidence in the pe rformance and security of other systems dre users generally oppose the use of voterv erified paper audit trails vvpat for dres but users of other systems favor it this result could mean that users are overconfident in dres or that nonusers ar insufficiently knowledgeable about them leos also tend to favor new systems that have characteristics similar to what they have been using for exampl lever machine users tend to favor dres leos trust the voting system vendors they work with but do not believe that those vendors are very influential in decisions bout acquiring new voting systems leos consider themselves knowle dgeable about and familiar with hava they support individual provisions of the act most strongly for federal funding and least strongly for provisional balloting to some extent provisions rated more difficult to implement receive less suppor t most leos believe that hava has resulted in some impr ovement in elections in their jurisdictions those rating hava higher overall tend to be younger more comfortable with technology and more familiar with the act the areas for imp rovement of hava most commonly listed are federal funding nd the requirements for registration voter identification and provisional

that was designed to help fill that gap in knowledge2 the findings may be useful to congress as it considers funding and po ssible reauthorization of hava who are local election officials there are more than 9000 local election jurisdictions in the united states3 in most states they are counties or major cities but in some new england and upper midwest states they are small townships for example more than 1800 townships in wisconsin4 given that diversity and other differences among states such as wealth population and the role of stat election officials responsibilities and characteristics of leos are likely to vary among the states nevertheless some patterns emerged from the survey httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs2 5 women make up about 60 of that work force see us census bureau 2000

httpwwwcensusgoveeo2000indexhtml 7 ibid 8 ibidthe demographic characteristics of leos are unusual for group of government officials according to the survey results the typical leo is white woman between 50 and 60 years old w ho is high school graduate she was elected to her current offi ce works fulltime in electi on administration has been in the profession for about 10 years and earns under 50000 per year she belongs to statelevel professional or ganization but not nationa l one and she believes that her training as an election offici has been good to excellent as with any such description the one above does not capture the diversity within the community surveyed about onequarter of leos are men about 5 belong to minority groups 40 are college gr aduates and 8 have graduate degrees they range from 24 to 89 years of age nd have served from 1 to 50 years about onethird were appointed rath er than elected to their pos ts reported salaries range from under 10000 to more than 120000 about onethird belong to regional national or inte rnational professi onal organizations the demographic profile of leos is unusual especially for professional group while it is possible that some of th above results were statistical artifacts it is likely that overall they reflect the demographic characteristics of leos in general if so those characteristics ppear to differ from those of other local government employees for example acco rding to us census figures while women comprise higher proportion of the local government workforce than men overall5 men comprise higher proportion of local government general and administrative managers6 about 20 of those mana gers belong to minorities7 the causes of those differences are not apparent the patterns do not appear to be result of the fact that most leos are elected as the demographic characteristics of legislators appear to be largely similar to those for local government managers8 potential policy implications of the demographic characteristics of leos arediscussed later in this report perceptions and attitudes about voting systems the kinds of voting systems used in the united states have been changing over the past 20 years in particular the computerization of voting has climbed dramatically during that period increasingly jurisdictions have turned to computer assisted voting systems especially optical scan and direct recording electronic dre systems in 1980 fewer than onequa rter of jurisdictions used computer assisted systems with under 5 using opti cal scan and dre systems in contrast more than 75 used computerassisted syst ems in 2004 with more than half of thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs3 9 election data services new study shows 50 million voters will use electronic voting systems 32 million still with punch cards in 2004 press release 12 february 2004 voting equipment summary by type as of 11022004 table 5 august 2005 both available at httpwwwelec tiondataservicescom 10 ibid and data from the election reform information project 11 this includes oregon with its mailin voting system and jurisdictions in states such as washington where more than half of balloting is by mail 12 sec 301a1 of hava requires that vo ting systems with some exceptions notify voters of overvotes and permit them to veri fy and correct their votes before casting the ballot this is sometimes called secondchance voting the exceptions are for punchcards handcounted paper ballots and centralcount systems for which voter education and instruction about preventing and correcting errors is fficient to meet the requirement the net effect is that all precinctcount systems except punchcards are required to provide for secondchance voting currently those systems include lever machines dres and preci nctcount optical scanusing optical scan9 over that 20year span the most dramatic changes have been the sevenfold increase in the use of optical scan by jurisdictions from about 7 in 1990 to more than 45 in 2004 and the doubling in dre use between the 2000 and 2004 elections from 10 to 20 the number of jurisdictions using punchcards lever machines and handcounted pa per ballots was declining even before the enactment of hava use of these systems fell by more than half between 1990 when they were used by more than 80 of jurisdic tions and 2004 with about 30 usage the major alternative voting systems in use at present are therefore optical scan and dre about half of jurisdictions with optical scan systems use precinct count in general the survey results re flect the patterns found in other studies10 however those studies unlike the survey did not distinguish between centralcount and precinctcount systems the distinction may be important from policy perspective because for opti cal scan voting systems onl the precinctcount version provides for detection of imp roperly marked ballots by machine before the ballot is cast allowing voters to correct mistakes such as overvotes this is often called secondchance voting centralcount systems rely entirely on visual inspection by the voter to detect errors about half 499 of the jurisdictions surveyed use optical scan voting systems of those 449 are centralcount systems11 hava promotes but does not require the use of voting machines that detect errors12 leos are highly satisfied with whatever voting systems they are using now most leos more than 85 altogether reported that they are highly satisfied with their current voting systems and that the systems performed very well during the november 2004 election more th an 90 there was little variation in the degree of satisfaction with different ki nds of voting systems but the differences are illuminating the most highly rated systems were precinctcount optical scan and dres which are the most compatible of current systems with the goals and requirements of hava ratings for these systems were not significantly different from each otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs4 13 results are based on singlefactor anova and posthoc 2tailed students ttests at p05 even though dres were rated significan tly higher than centralcount optical scan the differences were small with most leos rating their systems as performing extremely well more than half for centralcount optical scan systems and about twothirds for dresboth precinctcount optical scan and dre systems were rated significantly higher than leve r machines handcounted paper systems and centralcount optical scan with respect to overall satisfaction there were significant differences in the performance ratings ofdifferent systems for the nove mber 2004 election except between dres which were rated highest and centralcount optical scan which was rated lowest 13 while generally satisfied with their current systems leos also indicated areas where improvements are needed in rating set of desired qualities of voting systems and the degree to which their current voting system has those characteristics the four features rated highest for both the current and desired system were accuracy in counting reliability security and ease of use by voters current systems were rate d lowest in comparison to desired features for prevention of voter errors ease of use by persons with disabilities and machine error two features were rated higher as characteristics of the current voting system than they were in desirability speed in vote counting and cost of acquisition the characteristics rated lowest for bot h current and desired systems were impact on different socioeconomic groups and alternativelanguage capability not surprisingly users of dres and pr ecinctcount optical scan systems rated them higher for prevention of voter error than users of other systems rated theirs dre users also rated their systems higher th an users of other systems did theirs for ease of use by disabled persons and for multiplelanguage use most jurisdictions acquiring new voting systems choose those that help voters avoid errors the length of time that jurisdictions reported using their current voting systems varied widely from one year or less to more than 200httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs5 14 the distribution was highly skewed so th average reported here is the median the mean was 26 years 15 this analysis did not distinguish be tween precinct and centralcount users years the average is 12 years14 about one in six jurisdictions reported that they had acquired new voting system since 2000 and half of those obtained dres which prevent overvotes and can help voters minimize unintentional undervoting the remainder chose opticalscan systems and more than threequarters of those acquired precinctcount versi ons about 40 of respondent s indicated that they are likely to replace their current voting system within the next five years with similar proportions as above expecting to choos dres precinctcount and centralcount optical scan systems overall 85 of recently acquired or planned voting systems assist voters in preventing or detecting many ballotmarking errors leos tend to choose new voting systems with similar characteristics to what they use at present leos might be expected to choose new voting systems that behave in similar manner to those they have been using in particular jurisdictions replacing punchcard nd handcounted paper systems might be more likely to choose op tical scan which is also paperbased those replacing lever machines might be expected to choos dres since neither system uses paper ballots the survey results support that hypothesis lever machine users are four times more likely to switch to dres than to optical scan lever machine users who switch to optical scan systems are five times more likely to choose precinctcount than centralcount which might be expected as lever machines are also precinct count systems users of punchcards are more likely to switch to optical scan systems than to dr and are more likely to choose precinct count than centralcount the results fo r leos using handcounted paper systems are not conclusive but suggest prefer ence for optical scan over dre systems leos have more concerns about the security and performance of voting systems they are not using themselves while leos tend to be very satisfied with the systems that they are usin g they have more re servations about other kinds average support for other systems wa s substantially less than that for the system in use punchcards lever mach ines and handcounted paper ballots all received negative average ratings from those leos not using those systems dres and the two types of optical scan receive d positive ratings on average with precinct count rated the highest cent ralcount optical scan was ra ted bit higher than dres which is perhaps surprising given the findi ng discussed above that most jurisdictions planning to obtain new systems expect to adopt either dres or precinctcount optical scan this issue was also examined more speci fically for dres and optical scan users dre users rated their systems higher than nondre users in all specific performance categories tested including security reliability usability and cost except for multiplelanguage capability the same patterns held in comparisons of opticalscan users and nonusers15 the reasons why nonusers rate d alternativelanguage capability higher than users is not clearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs6 16 this is sometimes also called contemporaneous paper record cpr or voterverified paper ballot vvpbdre users do not support the use of voterverifiab paper audit trails vvpat but nonusers do one of the most stri king differences between users and nonusers of dres is in their at titudes toward the proposal that dres be required to produce paper ballo ts on which voters can verify their choices before the ballot is cast fig 1 system also called voterverifiable paper audit trail vvpat 16 most dre users 70 do not s upport the use of vvpat and most do not plan to add them to their voting syst ems whereas about 70 of leos not using dres do support vvpat dre users oppos ing vvpat most commonly cited risk to voter privacy printer

support for vvpat were generally willing 65 to spe nd only 300 or less for the feature source texas am university in coordination with the congressional research service both dre and optical scan users do not generally believe that their voting system software is vulnerable to attack by viruses or hackers they also believe that current state and federal cer tification procedures for so ftware and hardware are adequate and that any security concerns with their systems can be adequately addressed by good security pr ocedures for both systems nonusers are less confident in security and

source texas am university in coordination with the congressional research service the help america vote act hava impacts and attitudes hava requirements and funding have been major factor in the adoption of new voting systems by leos among the 17 of jurisdictions reporting that they acquired voting systems since 2000 about half reported receiving federal funding for that purpose with about onethird repor ting that most of the funding was from federal sources about 40 of respondents expect to acquire new systems within the next five years hava and state requireme nts and funding were listed as the mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs8 17 it is possible that the influence of state requirements per is somewhat less than it appears from the results since hava requirement s are generally administered through state election officials 18 sec 301a3 of hava requires that juri sdictions provide accessible voting for persons with disabilities through the use of at leas t one direct recording electronic voting system or other voting system equipped for indivi duals with disabilities at each polling placeimportant factors in thos decisions table 117 concerns about the accuracy or cost of the previous or current systems were among the least important factors most respondents who plan to replace their current systems expect to change all voting machines in the jurisdiction but 42 an ticipate acquiring one new system per precinct to meet hava accessibility requirements18 most leos consider themselves familiar with and knowledgeable about hava the requirements and other provi sions of hava have substantial impacts on local jurisdictions and some re quirements such as provisional balloting are aimed directly at local officials it would therefore be expected that most local election officials would be familiar with hava provisions and that is in fact the case only 10 of leos reported lack of familiarity with the act and more than half consider themselves to be very familiar with its requirements most leos support hava provisions when asked about the specific provisions of hava leos on average rated each of them positively table 2 with the highest support given to the provision of federal funding and the lowest to the provisional voting requirement however even with respect to federal funding there were complaints many relating to pe rceived slowness in distribution of funds leos were also concerned that federal re quirements would lead to higher operating costs that local jurisdictions would not be able to afford the results suggest that support is associated to some degree with ease of implementation although none of the provisions was rated especially difficult or especially easy to implement on average for example the two provisions requiring implementation that received the highest vels of support faci litating participation for military or overseas voters and provision of information for voters were also rated as the easiest to implement and pr ovisional voting was considered the second most difficult however the disability access requirement r eceived substantially higher level of support than the identif ication requirement for certain firsttime voters even though the former was consid ered the most difficult to implement while the latter was among the least difficult common remark about the disability requirement was the perception that it is unn ecessary or onerous for jurisdictions with small populations this argument was also made before hava was enacted proponents of the accessibility pr ovision counter that the mobility of us society and the presence of hidden disa bled persons as well as othe r factors make the uniform application of this provision necessary the creation of the federal election assistance commission eac which has been somewhat controversial was seen as an advantage by most leos with only one in seven seeing it as disadvantage during the debate on hava some observers argued that the eac should be permanent and others that it should exist only untilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs9 all requirements payments aut horized in the act are distributed in february 2005 the national association of secr etaries of state took the position that the eac should be temporary although th at position was tempered in subsequent statements provisional voting received the highest percentage of negative assessments with 35 of respondents considering it disadvantage and 48 an advantage it was the only category for which respons were strongly polarize d with many leos rating it strong advantage and almost as many strong disadvantage it was not possible to determine for this report what factor s might account for the polarized

surprisingly the lowest interaction 13 of leos was in paperballot jurisdictions and the highest was in optical scan and dre jurisdictions about 85leos believe that hava is making some improvements in the electoral process the survey asked leos to rate the degree to which hava has resulted in improvements in elections in their jurisdictions from improvement to major improvement only 12 of leos responded that it d to improvement but only 7 responded that it led to majo r improvement the average response was halfway between those two extremes comparison of how leos rated hava overall with other characteristics of the offi cials suggests that younger officials who are comfortable with technology and fam iliar with hava tended to be supportive of the legislation not surprisingly those who believe that there is too much federal involvement in the election process tende d to be less supportive less obvious was the finding that collegeeducated leos so tended to be ss supportive although the effect was smaller than for the other factors about 23 of respondents provided suggestions for improving hava the th ree most common areas for improvement listed were federal funding registration and voter id entification and provisional ballots the role of voting system vendors there has been some debate and uncerta inty about the role and influence of voting system manufacturers nd vendors in the selection of voting systems by local jurisdictions some observers have ar gued that vendors have undue influence in what voting systems jurisdictions choose others believe that such concerns are unwarranted but little has been known of how leos view vendors and their relationships with them the results of the survey were mixed with respect to the importance of vendors leos appear to ve high trust and confidence in them but do not rate them as being especially influe ntial with respect to decisions about voting systems leos trust and have confidence in the voting system vendors they work with most jurisdictions using computerassisted voting reported that they had interacted with their votingsystem vendors within the last four years19 more than 90 of leos considered their vo ting system vendors responsive and the quality of their goods and services to be hig h they felt equally strongly that the recommendations of those vendors can be trusted however about fifth of respondents thought that vendors are willing to sacrifice security for greater profit although 60 disagreed also quarter fe lt that vendors provide too many aspects of election administration leos do not believe that vendors are very influential in decisions about acquiring new voting systems when leos were asked what sources of information they relied on with respect to voting systems state election officials received the highest average rating with bout threequarters of leos indicating that they rely on state officials great deal next most important were other election officials followed by the eac and advo cates for the disabl ed about onethird stated that they rely on vendors great d eal level similar to that for professionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs11 20 for this question leos were also asked to rate their own influence which received the highest average score the question also as ked about the influence of some other actors such as courts and voters and it listed elec ted and nonelected state and local officials but not election officials specifically except the respondents themselves and the eac 21 for example maine ranks 37th among states in population with 13 million residents but it ranks 4th in the number of election jurisdictions with 518 22 contemporaneous survey of state electi on officials did not have sufficiently high response rate to produce statistically valid sa mple and is therefore not discussed in this continuedassociations only 2 rated vendors higher than any other source whereas 20 rated state officials highest interest groups were ra ted lower than vendors and political parties and media r eceived the lowest ratings when leos were asked about the infl uence of different actors on decisions about voting sy stems the overall pattern of response was similar to that for information sources once again state local and federal officials were judged the most influential20 and political parties and the dia the least with vendors in between an exception was that local none lected officials were considered less influential on average than vendors both voters and advocates fo r the disabled were rated as more influential on average than vendors leos rated vendors as more influential than any other source in contrast 12 listed themselves as the most influential about twothirds of leos be lieve that local elected officials should have more influence about onethird that st ate elected fficials should and about half believe that the fede ral government has too much influence fewer than 10 of leos believe that th ere is insufficient oversight of vendors by the federal government and states but about one in six believe that local governments do not exercise enough oversight about half of leos believe that the federal government exercises too much ove rsight of vendors about third believe that states do and about one in six that local governments do possible caveats as with any survey care needs to be taken in drawing inferences from the results discussed above one question that could arise is whether the sample is representative of leos as whole steps were taken in the design of the study to minimize the risk that the sample would not be representative for example simply drawing the sample at random from the na tionwide pool of election administrators would have resulted in di sproportionately large number of jurisdictions from new england and the upper midwest where ections are administered by townships rather than counties21 to prevent such regional ove rrepresentation in the sample more than 150 officials were chosen to be surveyed from each stat for states with fewer than 150 election jurisdictions all were included in the sample for other states 150 leos were chosen at random to be incl uded in the sample overall neither the sample design nor the characteristics of th responses suggest that the results are unrepresentative of the views and characteristics of local election officials22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs12 22 continued report another potential caution for interpretation relates to the inherent limits of surveys such as this one in particular th ere is way to guaran tee that the responses of the election officials corre spond to their actual beliefs in addition there is way to be certain that any par ticular belief corresponds to reality the question of vendor influence provides an illustration of the possibility for disparity for several reasons leos might be reluctant to rate vendors as having the level of influence on decisions about voting systems that they actually believe is the case alternatively they might believe that vendors ve only modest influence wher eas in fact the influence is much greater the possibility of disparity is raised in this case because leos indicated very high level of trust and c onfidence in vendors but indicated that their influence was comparatively minor final caution involves how survey results might be used to inform policy decisions on the one hand the results coul d be used to support the shaping of policy in directions expressed by leos in their responses in many cases such policy changes might be appropriate on the othe r hand it is possible that at least some of those desired changes would not in fact yield the most effective or appropriate policies in such cases the results might more constructively be used to help policymakers identify issues for which improvements in communication and understanding are needed potential policy implications the survey results may have policy implications for several issues at the federal state and local levels of government some issues that may be relevant for congressional deliberations are highlighted below election officials many observers have commented favorably on the experience and dedication of the nations local election officials survey results are consistent with that view at the same time other observers including some election officials have called for increased prof essionalism in election administration some survey results suggest areas of potentia l professional improve ment such as in education and in professiona l involvement at the nationa l level congress could address this potential need by means such as facilitating educational and training programs for leos and promoting professi onal certification of election officials by entities accredited through the eac the seemingly unique demographic ch aracteristics of leos as group of government officials may have other polic implications but they are not altogether clear however some observers may ar gue that efforts should be undertaken to ensure that leos reflect the diversity of the workforce or voting population as whole especially with respect to minority representation voting systems since the enactment of hava controversy has arisen over whether dre voting systems are sufficiently secure and reliable the

availability of poll wo rkers and the processing of absentee ballots while results of the two surveys are not gene rally comparable because of differences in focus and methodology the gao survey did find that high percentage of local officials expressed satisfaction with the performance of their existing voting systems finding consistent with the results of the current surveyrevealed that leos who have experience with dres are very confident in them and do not generally support the addition of voterverified paper audit trail vvpat to address security concerns however leos using other systems are much less confident in dres and more supportive of vvpat the strongly dichotomous results suggest that as congress consider s whether to require the use of vvpat or similar security mechanisms it might be useful to determine whether dre users are overconfident in the security of their syst ems or alternatively whether nonusers need to be better educated about the relia bility and security of dre systems23 the help america vote act hava the survey results suggest that hava is in the process of achieving several of its policy goals the general support of hava provisions including those such as the creation of the eac and the provisional ballot require ment that have been somewhat controversial implies that leos are in agreement with the goals of the act and are active partners in its implementation the overwhe lming choice of new voting systems that assist voters in avoiding errors indicates that the hava goal of reduc ing avoidable voter error is in the process of being met the areas of concern expressed by leos such as how to meet the costs of ongoing implement ation of hava requirements raise issues that congress may wish to address as it considers hava appropriations and reauthorization the close relationship between leos nd the vendors of their voting systems seems unlikely to change as result of hava however with the codification by hava of the voting system standards and cer tification processes the influence of the federal government in decisions about new voting systems might be expected to increase in relation to that of vendors and others however the influence of state elected officials seems unlik ely to decline especially given the responsibilities that hava places on state governments with re spect to election administration research needs scientific opinion surveys of local election officials are rare24 and additional research may be useful to address some of the matters raised by this study for example survey of st ate election officials might provide useful information and might additi onally be helpful in asse ssing the most appropriate federal role in promoting the effective implementation of hava goals at all levels of government httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32938crs14 one common suggestion of leos for imp roving hava was to provide means of adjusting requirements to fit the needs of smaller jurisdictions to determine what if any such adjustments would be ppropriate it may be usef ul to have specific information on how the needs and characteris tics of different jurisdictions vary with size something that was beyond the scope of this survey it could also be useful to identify how the duties of leos vary with size and other characteristics of the jurisdiction in many jurisdictions electi on administration is only part of the leos job it is not known to what degree thes other responsibilities might affect election administration negatively or positively finally this survey provided only one snapshot of leo characteristics and perceptions it might be beneficial to perform similar surveys periodically to identify trends and explore new questions and issues
