variance with what it appears to mean the expression means equal rather than exclusively favorable treatment and is often used interchangeably with nondiscriminatory to make this dis tinction clearer and avoid possibly misleading interpretation of the mostfavorednation term legislation was enacted in 1998 to replace it in us law with the rm normal trade rela tions or ntr in this report both terms are used interc hangeably with nondiscriminatory the united states accords general mfn treatment as matter of international obligation as well statutory policy to all trading partners however mfn tariff treatment of several countries has been suspended unde r specific legislation virtually all such suspensions initially applied to 21 countri or political entities took place under the mandate of the trade agreements ex tension act of 1951 and two more under countryspecific legislation mfn tariff tr eatment of countries suspended under the 1951 law can be restored and ma intained in effect for oneyear periods by using the procedure provided under title iv of the trade act of 1974 for such restoration to nonmarket economy nme countries u nder this procedure an nme country needs to conclude with the united states trade agreement containing reciprocal mfn clause and be in compliance with the criteria of the jacksonvanik jv freedomofemigration provision of that act the two countries whose mfn status was suspended by countryspecific legisl ation could and di d have it restored by presidential action under conditions specified in the suspending law trade agreements with nme countries must be approved by joint resolution and are triennially selfrenewa ble but their renewal is also subject to presidential confirmation to maintain in force the compliance with the jv criteria and the mfn status such compliance must be either determined semiannually or waived annually by the secretary of state and ch determinations or waivers are annually subject to possible disapproval by joint re solution repeated past legislative action to disapprove some waivers particularly those for china has been unsuccessful and ntr treatment contingent on waiver has invariably remained in effect permanent restoration of ntr status of any country generally requires specific legislation of the 29 countries todays successors of countries or areas originally subject to the 1951 suspension 15 had their perman ent ntr status restored by specific legislation five directly and ten after period of c onditional restoration under the jacksonvanik amendment one poland by the president under then existing statutory authority and one east germany administratively through unification with west germany the status of seven of them is still temporary subject to the determination of fullcompliance with the jacksonvanik amendment and of three of them under the jacksonvanik waiver provision two countries cuba and north korea are denied ntr status altogether the ntr

8normaltraderelations mostfavorednation policy of the united states what is normaltraderelations mostfavorednation treatment in international trade the expression m ostfavorednation usually abbreviated mfn status or treatment has specific meaning quite different from what it appears to mean while suggesting special and exclusive privileges granted to one country it means in reality equal treatment of all countries granted the mfn treatment defined in more specific detail in article i of the general agreements on tariffs and trade gatt 1994 an integral part of the world trade organization agreement the term denotes the reciprocal extension of any concessions privileges or immunities granted or yet to be granted by country in trade agreement or in some other way to one country which is or would be the most favored in this respect to all countries to which it accord s mfn treatment as consequence all countries to which country extends mfn tr eatment are or would be treated by the extending country equally or in nondiscriminatory fashion the understandable misinte rpretation of the mostfa vorednation term in its literal meaning particularly in the context of us trade policy of the mid1990s toward china gave rise to legislation1 to replace the often misleading term most favorednation treatment in the seven instances in the existing and in all future us legislation with the term normal trad relations ntr or another appropriate expression the mfn term however has remain ed universally in use in international trade relations including trade agreements to which the united states is party because of this fact and for reasons of historical continuity both terms mfn and ntr are used in this report with the identical meaning and also interchangeably with the term nondiscriminatory term also often used in us trade legislation in practice the principal benefit country gains from being accorded mfn status by another country is that the tters imports from the former are dutied at concessional rates often referred to as mfn rates and listed in the us tariff schedules as general rather than full rates thus the extension of mfn treatment to country can often mean signif icantly lower cost and hence greater competitiveness of its products in the ex tending countrys markets than would otherwise be the case in this report the mfn ntr treatment is discussed in the specific context of tariffs because of the origins and historical development of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31558crs2 2 the suspension was required by section 5 of the trade

practice partic ularly the denial or restoration of such treatment to nonmar ket economy countries evolution of us mostfavorednation policy there are three basic often overlapping ways in which the united states accords general mfn treatment to its trading partners one is by means of bilateral compact eg friendship commerce and navigation or similar treaty or an executive trade agreement in which mfn st atus is accorded reciprocally another much broader in its reach is throug h being member of the world trade organization wto which as rule carries with it the obligation of according mfn treatment to all other members in addition the united states specifically accords to all foreign countries any concession on tariffs or othe r import restrictions agreed to in reciprocal negotiations with any trading partner by its own law first enacted in 1934 and now contained in section 126 of the trade act of 1974 19 u sc 2136 us legislation provides specific procedure for extending mfn stat us to country except in the case of restoration of the status to nonmarket economy countri discussed below nor is there an official list of countries with mf n status all countries other than those to which mfn treatment is specifically denied by law as listed in general note 3b of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states have mfn status the policy of general application of mfn treatment was modified when the president in 1951 and 1952 suspended2 the application of mfn tariff rates to the soviet union and to all countries or areas then under the contro l of international communism in practice the suspension applied to all countries of the then sinosoviet bloc but not to yugoslavia this action resulted in the increase of customs duties assessed on the us imports from the countries involved from the concessional levels resulting from trade agreements with third countries to considerably higher levels as enacted by the highly protectionist tariff act of 1930 the communist countries and areas initia lly denied mfn tariff treatment under section 5 were albania bu lgaria china any part under communist domination or control czechoslovakia estonia germ any soviet zone nd

approval of trade agreemen t concluded with an nme country was to be effected by the adoption of concurrent re solution the type of approving resolution was changed with some delay to joint by section 132b2c of pl 101382 of august 20 1990 as precautionary consequence of the june 23 1982 decision of the us supreme court in us immigration and natura lization service v ch adha which found legislative vetoes by means of onehouse resolution unconstitutionalsubsequently polands mfn tariff status was restored by the president in december 1960 while cubas was added to section 5 suspensions by law in may 1962 also in 1962 list of communist count ries all section 5 countries except poland to which mfn tariff status was be ing currently denied was included in the newly revised tariff schedules of the united states enacted by the tariff classification act of 1962 and thereby the denial of mfn treatment to individual countries became part of the us law ra ther than of implementing regulations as theretofore section 231 of the trade expansion act of 1962 pl 87794 76 stat 876 applied the section 5 suspension to any country or area dominated by communism and thereby placed in jeopardy mfn tariff status of yugoslavia as well as of poland the implementation of this directive was delayed and the law was later amended by allowing any country with mfn status at the time of its enactment december

treatment to nonmarket economy countries the trade expansion act of 1962 also made the restoration of mfn tariff status to country subject to section 5 susp ension possible only by legislation while restoration of permanent ntr treatment can take place only through legislation enacted under general legislative procedure ntr treatment as such can be restored to nonmarket economy nme c ountry subject to section 5 suspension on temporary basis by specific procedure provide d in title iv of the trade act of 1974 while section 401 of the act requires the continuation in force of the then existing suspensions of mfn tariff status it also in other provisions of its title iv authorizes the president to restore nondiscriminatory status to nonmarket economy country and maintain it in effect on temporary basis by specific procedure the key elements of the procedure for temporary restoration of the mfn status to an nme country are 1 conc lusion of bilateral trade agreement containing reciprocal grant of the mf n status and additional provisions required by law section 405 trade act of 1974 19 usc 2435 and approved by the enactment of joint resolution4 considered under specific fasttrack procedure set out in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2191 and 2 compliance with the freedomofemigration requirement s jacksonvanik amendment section 402 19 usc 2432 the

under specified conditions neither the initial presidential determination of full compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment re quirements nor his initial waiver of full compliance with them requires positive congressional approval however the initial presidential determination of full compliance with such requirements but not the initial waiver is subject to congressional disapproval by joint resolution5 of either house enacted under specific fasttrack pro cedure laid out in secti on 152 of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2432 following the main steps of the proce dure the disapproval resolution whose language is prescribed by law is referred respectively to the house ways and means committee or the senate finance committee and must be reported within 30 days of session or else the committee consid ering it is subject to discharge motion the resolution may be amended only with re spect to its country applicability and the debate on the resolution and any procedural motions is subject to limits the resolution must be adopted within 90 days of session after the da the presidential determination is delivered to congress and enters into force thereby in effect denying the nondiscriminatory tr eatment and other trade bene fits to which it applies on the 61st day after its enactment if the pres ident vetoes the resolution the veto must be overridden within the 90 days or within 15 days of session after the receipt of the veto message whichever is later the date of the override is considered as the date of enactment after the enactment of legi slation approving the bilateral agreement restorations of nondiscriminatory treatment are implemented by pres idential proclamation which in the case of permanent restorations usually sets the date of their entry into force whereas temporary restorations enter into force on the date the exchange of notices of acceptance of the agreement by the two countries takes place the continuation in force of an nme countrys temporary mfn status is contingent on 1 automatic triennial exte nsions of the underlying trade agreement and 2 periodic renewal of the author ity of the jacksonvanik amendment the agreement usually concluded for threeyear initial term itself provides for automatic threeyear extensions w hich do not require congressional approving action but is subject to termination by either party upon notice at least 30 days before the expiration of any threeyear term the continuation in force of the agreement is also subject to the requirement of section 405b1b of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2435b1b

earlier renewed agreements had meanwhile lapsed this lapse however has not in practice affected the ntr status of the countries involved since they are all still treated as having ntr status apparently solely on the basi s of the standard provision for automatic triennial renewal contained in the trade agreements themselves during the entire period from mid1989 to the statutory extension of pntr in 2001 the most controversial issue of the us mfn policy has been the mfn status of china the presidents annual renewals of chinas jacksonvanik waiver and mfn status faced strong opposition in c ongress nevertheless joint resolutions introduced every year in the aftermath of the june 1989 tiananmen square incident to disapprove such renewals were not adopted two bills to subject chinas mfn status to additional restrictions passe d during the 2nd session of the 102nd congress were vetoed by the president and in bot h cases the veto was upheld by the senate similar legislation as well as joint resolutions disapproving chinas waiver in subsequent congresses were not enacted without actually affecting the practical effect of mfn trea tment legislation first introduced in 1996 see

which precluded th actual extension of permanent ntr to china before chinas accession to the world trade organization which eventually took place on december 11 2001 the tiein between the us grant of permanent ntr treatment to china and chinas accession to the wto ran in both directions on the one hand although chinas very comprehensive trade agreement with the united states was negotiated outside the working party for chinas accession to th wto it became part of chinas protocol of accession on the ot her hand mostfavoredn ation treatment of china by the united states was required by the wto agreement as reciprocal obligation of wto members such obligati on could have been avoided only by the united states or chinas invocation of wto article xiii which allows reciprocal nonapplication of obligations under the wto agreement including the mfn treatment between current and the acceding wto member cf kyrgyzstan p 9 invoking article x iii would have meant that the united states would be precluded from benefitting not only from chinas co mprehensive concessions in its 1999 bilateral agreement with the united states but also from those in the agreements with other wto members such action would have meant that the united states benefits from trade with china would have remained limited to those of very general nature contained in the much less comprehensive bilateral agreement
