summary 2s frances townsend assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism met with president saleh in aden on october 22 to discuss mutual cooperation in the war on terror during the meeting saleh accepted townsends request for usg interrogation of jamal albadawi convicted architect of the bombing of the uss cole saleh blamed aging agents in the political security organization pso for inadequate cooperation asked the usg to pressure regional gulf countries to stop their support of southern secessionist movements accepted townsends offer of usg assistance in preparation of counterterrorism and cash courier laws and agreed to the need for joint operations to combat terrorism outside yemen saleh also warned against the threat of iran specifically with regard to its role inside iraq and promised to do more to curb the flow of young yemeni men going to fight in iraq the meeting was generally constructive one with the yemeni president making some positive commitments post will continue to work with the royg to ensure these commitments are not forgotten end summary jamal he is under my microscope albadawi and friends 3s frances townsend assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism met with president ali abdullah saleh in aden on october 22 to discuss mutual cooperation in the war on terror during the lunch portion of the meeting also attended by the foreign minister the governor of aden and member of parliament she asked for an update on the status of jamal albadawi convicted architect of the bombing of the uss cole ref b the president confirmed albadawis release clarifying that he is under house arrest living and working on his farm near aden while the royg closely monitors him saleh added that while yemeni authorities pursued albadawi the royg was transmitting messages to him promising that if he turned himself in his situation would get better saleh said he personally met with albadawi two weeks ago and had frank discussion with him albadawi promised to give up terrorism and i told him that his actions damaged yemen and its image he began to understand saleh said 4s townsend expressed dismay over albadawis release and asked for usg access to interrogate him saleh told townsend not to worry he is under my microscope but had objections to her request reiterating numerous times that interested usg entities could interrogate albadawi by coordinating with the political security organization pso 5s saleh specifically mentioned two other escapees that remain at large abdullah alwadii and nasr alwahishi he said alwahishi had taken the place of abu ali as head of alqaeda in yemen townsend reiterated usg concern over the roygs house arrest system with reference to the cases of ibrahim makri and mansur albahani both of whom were linked to terrorist activity while under house arrest weapons trafficking you cant make this stuff up 6c as townsend began to ask saleh about his efforts to combat weapons trafficking saleh interrupted her to invite one of yemens top three weapons traffickers faris manaa into the lunch meeting when manaa who met with the president earlier in the day entered the room saleh jokingly addressed the embassy assistant legal attach legatt saying hey fbi if he does not behave properly you can take him back to washington in townsends plane or to guantanamo the legatt replied we could put both manaa and albadawi on the plane however the translator did not report this to saleh making it unlikely that the president heard the legatts reply meanwhile presidential staff provided manaa with chair at the table saleh explained that the royg had recently confiscated shipment of pistols from manaa and given them to the military townsend lightheartedly commented he has donated weapons to the nations military he can be considered patriot now saleh responded with laughter saying he is double agent he also gave weapons to the alhouthi rebels the president said the ministry of defense was the only entity in yemen authorized to purchase weapons comment if the presidents statement were an accurate portrayal of the situation arms dealers would effectively be out of business salehs comment has been made to post numerous times before this and manaas presence at the palace raises serious questions about the presidents commitment to stopping weapons trafficking manaa also runs construction company and petroleum services business with contracts in iraq his ties to saleh may extend beyond money made from the weapons trade end comment 7c saleh said the new weapons ban ref c in yemens major cities had been success receiving surprisingly positive public response he specified that in the past month 45000 pieces of weaponry had been collected the governor of aden added that his city was 100 clean of weapons saleh expressed desire to follow the united states example of licensing guns when asked by the legatt if he was going to expand the weapons ban outside major cities saleh responded that it is stepbystep process pso the old guard is the problem 8s townsend complimented yemens national security bureau saying it has done good work despite its youth yet complained of lack of cooperation from the pso with the usg saleh replied that his proposed constitutional amendments ref were the first step in addressing this problem at foreign minister alqirbis insistence saleh elaborated upon his answer adding that although the pso has firm orders to cooperate and respond quickly its agents are aging alluding to pso head ghalib mutahi qamish note qamish has been topic of sometimes tense discussion between townsend and saleh in the past end note the gulf factor fueling southern unrest 9s while saleh claimed the situation in the rebellious northern saada governorate was very calm he expressed apprehension over the unrest in the south the president asked the usg to pressure countries funding southern opposition saying it is important that yemen not reach state of instability we need your support townsend replied you do not even have to think about it of course we support yemen 10s saleh asserted that neighboring arab countries were intent on destabilizing his country by supporting the southern secessionist movement not because they have anything against yemen but because we are following the united states democracy model and they do not want democracy in the region he specifically referred to crown prince sultan of saudi arabia but inculpated other gulf countries as well according to saleh gulf islamic organizations are funding the opposition in the south and supporting secessionist movement leaders living in oman egypt and saudi arabia he said some of those regional islamic organizations had links to the radical factions within the islamist opposition party islah calling them jihadists salafis and alqaeda note islah is the largest opposition party in yemen and is largely recognized as moderate it includes radical factions that are considered to be minority end note usg support ct cash courier law and joint operations 11c townsend asked about the progress of yemens draft counterterrorism ct law saleh answered it has come long way but we have not yet fully achieved our goals townsend offered usg technical assistance in drafting the law and training for its implementation which saleh casually accepted note the minister of legal affairs recently rejected an offer for the same assistance ref d the lack of an effective ct law sometimes leaves the royg without legal basis to hold terrorists post views passage of comprehensive ct law as significant step in strengthening counterterrorism bilateral relations end note 12c townsend recommended cash courier law to strengthen yemens efforts at combating terrorism and proposed usg assistance with the drafting of this law as well which saleh also nonchalantly accepted comment salehs informal manner makes it unclear how resolute he was in accepting yet it is certain that he did not reject the offers made by townsend and generally agreed to her proposals end comment 13s townsend said usg agencies want to work with the royg on counterterrorism outside not just inside yemen saleh agreed he noted that usama bin ladens personal bodyguards are all yemeni alluding to the need for usgroyg cooperation in the tribal areas between pakistan and afghanistan saleh added that violence by governments is not always the answer and asked for greater usg assistance in development note yemen is beneficiary of significant nonct aid through the middle east partnership initiative the us department of agriculture food for progress program and as of november 1 returns to the millennium challenge cooperations threshold country program end note iran iran iran 14s throughout the meeting saleh repeatedly asked about iran and the usgs position visavis the country townsend replied that if iran does not get serious the usg will be forced to return to the united nations to request more sanctions 15s saleh warned townsend about qatars relationship with iran cautioning that although the two countries are allies iran could turn on qatar at any time townsend agreed saying she had relayed the same message to qatar and asked saleh if he had spoken to the qatari emir about this matter saleh responded of course he also asked townsend to deliver verbatim message to president bush about iran you must discipline and tame child when he is young 16s on iraq saleh asked townsend to tell president bush that maliki represents iran in iraq he is worse than ahmedinejad he repeatedly referred to maliki as dog although the embarrassed interpreter substituted the word he foreign fighters to iraq 17s townsend expressed usg concern over young yemeni men going to fight in iraq and asked saleh to do more to tackle the problem saleh replied that it is an extremely difficult task as yemeni men do not travel directly to iraq they first travel to cairo damascus or riyadh making it practically impossible to track who is traveling to baghdad townsend suggested publicly announcing airport interrogations of young men suspected of going to iraq she noted that the fear of getting caught itself might stem the flow of foreign fighters saleh agreed and said the royg will try to do more note yemeni security services currently try to scrutinize young male yemeni travelers particularly those traveling to damascus as means to identify foreign fighters and sometimes deny them travel end note letters exchanged 18c townsend delivered letter from president bush to president saleh the letter was read by both saleh and foreign minister alqirbi saleh responded to it by emphasizing yemens willingness to cooperate with everything that is included in president bushs letter with this he insisted the united states continue to support yemen both financially and politically and stand in the way of those against us saleh presented townsend with letter for president bush and report on yemens efforts to combat terrorism comment 19s overall this meeting was more constructive than some observers would have expected given salehs colorful character and knack for theatrics the inclusion of weapons trafficker during his lunch with townsend was not complete surprise salehs action was seen by some as veiled threat to manaa but was clearly also message to the usg that in his country he will do as he pleases like other leaders in the region saleh is loathe to be perceived as subservient to us or western interests his use of the dual threats of terrorism and instability when referring to internal conflict is also not new saleh consistently uses this tactic when attempting to garner usg support salehs allowing usg interrogation of albadawi is positive the fact that saleh released this convicted terrorist despite usg objections however is cause for concern salehs acceptance of townsends proposal of assistance in drafting the ct and cash courier law and his commitment to joint action to combat terrorism outside yemen are welcome developments as is his willingness to cooperate to stem the flow of yemeni fighters to iraq even if his acceptance of these ideas is nonchalant post will continue to work with the royg to ensure these commitments are not forgotten 20u minimize considered
