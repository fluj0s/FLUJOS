legal status through the provisions of the immigration reform and control act irca of 1986 pl 99603 law which also significantly strengthened border and interior immigration enforcement provisions

reportedly it is infrequently coll ected at land ports as result dhs does not have reliable da ta on emigration from the united states past legislative action on nonimmigrant overstays illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act congress strengthened the antiterrorism provisions in the ina and passed provisions that many maintained would ramp up enforcement activities in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira of 1996 pl 104208 division c and the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act pl 104132 in iirira there were several provisions aimed at nonimmigrant overstays foremost iirira clarified that the visa of nonimmigrant is void as soon as the nonimmigrant alien ove rstays the period of authorized stay iirira furthe rmore created new grounds of ex clusion for aliens who are unlawfully present in the united states thos who are unlawfully present for more than 180 days but less than one year and who voluntar ily depart the country are ineligible for admission or reentry to the united states for three years an alien unlawfully present for one year or more who leaves or is remove d from the united states is inadmissible for 10 years these provisions are generally refe rred to as the three and 10year bars finally 110 of iirira required the attorn ey general to develop an automated entryexit system that among other things 1 collects record of departure for every alien departing the united states and matches the record against the record of the aliens arrival in the united states and 2 allows the identification through online searches of nonimmigrants who remain beyond their period of authorized stay as amended by several subsequent laws 110 of iirira became the statutory basis of what is now the usvisit system which uses biometric identification ie finger scans and digital photographs to check identity16 usvisit exit pilot programs are now in place at several air and sea ports17 enhanced border

among its provisions it required the development of an interoperable electronic data system to be used to share information relevant to alien admissibility and removability and the implementation of an integrated entryexit data system18 it also required that all visas have biometric identifiers19 the act placed new requirements on the vwp specifically mandating that the government of each vwp country certify that it has established program to issue tamperresistant machiner eadable passports with biometric identifier the act also required all vwp countries to certify that they report in timely manner the theft of blank passports legislation implementing the 911 commission the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act irtpa of 2004 pl 108458 included visa policy and immigrationrelated provisions imed at curbing nonimmigrant overstays as well as the specific recommendations offe red by the 911 commission20 the irtpa required accelerated deployment of the biometric entry and exit system to process or contain certain data on aliens and their physical characteristics21 the act also expanded the pre inspection program that places us immigration inspectors at foreign airports increasing the number of foreign airports where traveler s would be preinspect ed before departure to the united states moreover it required all individuals entering the united states including us citizens and visitors from canada and other western hemisphere countries to bear passport or other docum ents sufficient to denote citizenship and identity the irtpa required the establishment of new standards aimed at ensuring the integrity for federal use of birth certificates stateissued drivers licenses and identification cards and social security cards states may receive grants to assist them in implementing the proposed birth certifi cate and drivers license standards22 estimating overstays in the past few years it became apparent that the data on nonimmigrant overstays were unreliable because these data were based upon the i94 arrivaldeparture form although the i94 forms are usually collected from foreign nationals at air and sea ports the forms are infrequently collected from foreign nationals exiting at land ports moreover two major classes of nonimmigrants are exempt from filling out the i94 whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22446crs6 23 us

perimeter generally 25 miles 75 miles in arizona from the border robert warren then demographer with the former ins attempted to estimate nonimmigrant overstays based on the percentage overstays fo r each country that yielded an estimate that 23 million or 33 of th 70 million unauthorized immigrants residing in the united states in january 2000 were nonimmigrant overstays23 in 2004 the us government accountability office gao attempted to estima the nonimmigrant overstays using samples based upon three different methodolog ies gao concluded three alternative data sources on illegal immigrants indicate varying but uniformly substantial percentages of overstays 31 27 and 5724 in 2003 the warren reached the following conclusion in general the net nonimmigrant overstay figures are more likel to be overestimate s than underestimates because the collection of departure forms fo r longterm overstays who depart probably is less complete than for those who depart within the first year25 the 2004 gao study however drew two different c onclusions the extent of ove rstaying is significant and may be understated by dhs s most recent estimate26 more recently the pew hispanic center applied the warren methodology with some modifications to their estimates of the uthorized resident alien population in 2006 their estimates suggest that out of an uthorized resident alien population of 115 million to 12 milli on about 4 million to 55 million or between 33 and 50 are nonimmigrant overstays27 estimates of nonimmigrant oversta ys residing in the united states are plagued by the broader difficulties in measuring all three components of unauthorized migration aliens entering without inspection between ports of entry and aliens entering with fraudulent documents as well as aliens ove rstaying or otherwise violating the terms of legal entry the extent that some nonimmigrant overstays become quasilegal aliens eg those who have lpr petitions pending or have sought relief from removal from an immigration judge further complicate the estimates28
