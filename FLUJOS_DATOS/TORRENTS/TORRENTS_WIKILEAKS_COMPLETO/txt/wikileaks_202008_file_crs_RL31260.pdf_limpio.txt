high definition television hdtv and other new servi ces currently being developed the nationwide deployment of di gital television is comple x and multifaceted enterprise successful deployment requires the development by content providers of compelling digital programming the delivery of digital signals to consumers by broadcast television stations as well as cable and satellite television systems and the widespread purchase and adoption by consum ers of digital tele vision equipment the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 provided that initial eligibility for any dtv licenses issued by the federal communications commission fcc should be limited to ex isting broadcasters because dtv signals cannot be received through the existing analog television broadcasting system the fcc decided to phase in dtv over period of years so that consumers would not have to immediately purchase new digita l television sets or convert ers thus broadcasters were given new spectrum for digital signals while retaining their existing spectrum for analog transmission so that they can simultaneously transmit analog and digital signals to their broadcasting market areas congress and the fcc set target da of december 31 2006 for broadcasters to cease broadcasting their analog signals and return their existing analog television spectrum to be auctioned for commercial rvices such as broadband or used for public safety communications however the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 allowed station to lay the return of its analog spectrum if 15 or more of the television households in its market did not subscribe to multichannel digital service and did not have digita l television sets or converter s given the slowerthan expected pace at which digital televisi ons have been introduced into american homes and given the impetus to reclaim analog spectrum for commercial uses and public safety the 109th congress enacted the defic it reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 which

digital television dtv is new television service representing the most significant development in levision technology since the advent of color television dtv can provide movie theater quality pi ctures and sound wi der screen better color rendition multiple video programming or single program of high definition television hdtv and othe r new services currently being developed dtv can be hdtv or the simultaneous transmission of multiple programs of standard definition television sdtv which is lesser quality picture than hdtv but significantly better than todays television the rationale often cited for the digital transition is that aside from offering superior broadcast quality to consumers dtv will allow overtheair broadcasters to offer the same kinds of digitallybased services such as payperview currently offered by cable and satellite television providers additionally it is argued that digital television uses the radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than traditional analog television thereby conserving s carce resource bandwidth that can be used for other wireless applications there are three major components of dtv rvice that must be present in order for consumers to enjoy fully realized high definition television viewing experience first digital programming must be available digital programming is content produced with digital cameras and other digital production equipment such equipment is distinct from what is curre ntly used to produce conventional analog programming second digital programming must be delivered to the consumer via digital signal digital signals can be broadcast over the airwaves requiring new transmission towers or dtv antennas on existing towers transmitted by cable or satellite television tec hnology or delivered by prereco rded source such as digital video disc dvd and third consumers must have digital television product capable of receiving the digital signal and displaying digital programming on their television screens role of congress and the fcc congress and the federal communica tions commission fcc have played major roles in the development of dt v starting in 1987 the fcc launched decadelong series of proceedings expl oring the potential and feasibility of transition from conventional analog televisions to advanced television systems while the original term used to describe the new television system was high definition television hdtv the fcc used broader term advanced television atv referring to any television tec hnology that provides improved audio

december 27 1996 2 four video formats are being used commercially by us television producers and manufacturers these four formats are descri bed by the number of lines they produce per each picture frame and whether they use interlaced i or progressive p scanning techniques these are 480i and 480p suita ble for sdtv broadcasts and 720p and 1080i hdtv the progressive scan video format is more compatible with pc displays while the interlaced scan is more compatible with analog television receivers 3 fcc fifth report and order in the matter of advanced television systems and their impact on existing television service mm docket 87268 fcc 97116 released april 21 1997 4 provision in the public health security and bioterrorism prepar edness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 hr 3448 hrept 107481 ddresses the digital conversion of full power television stations that received their analog licenses after the fcc allocated digital spectrum to existing analog stations in 1997 section 531 requires the fcc to allot digital channel to any requesting fullpower television station that had an application pending for an analog television station construction permit as of october 24 1991 and which had its application granted after april 3 1997 any station receiving digital spectrum under this provision is required to complete construction of its digital facility within 18 months without the possibility of an extension st ations are also prohibited from operating an analog signal on its designated digital channel the bills conference report states that this provision will allow recent broadcast licensees to foster digital audience during the transition period to digital television without having to terminate analog service and that without this change those stations would be nied the flexibility to operate an analog and continuedvideo quality after it became clear that atv would be using digital signal transmission the fcc began in 1995 to use the term dtv synonymous with atv to describe the new service more accurately in december 1996 after lengthy debate between television manufacturers broadcasters and computer firms the fcc adopted standard for dtv signal transmission based on recommendations of the advanced television system committee atsc1 the atsc standard allows fo r 18 different video formats of which four have subs equently been adopted for commercial use2 meanwhile the telecommunications ac t of 1996 pl 104104 provided that initial eligibility for any dtv licenses issued by the fcc should be limited to existing broadcasters broadcasters would be issued dtv licenses while at the same time retaining their existing analog licenses during the transition from analog to digital television the act provided that br oadcasters must eventually return either their existing analog channel or the new di gital channel also in the 104th congress major debate took place over whether to di rect the fcc to conduct auctions for the spectrum allocated for dtv the fcc estimated the commercial value of the dtv spectrum to be between 11 billion to 70 billion legislation was enacted however and the fcc did not obtain the authority to auction the dtv licenses in 1997 the fcc adopted rules3 to implement the telecommunications act and granted dtv licenses to some 1600 full pow er incumbent television broadcasters4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31260crs3 4 continued digital facility simultaneously in the near term especially in major markets 5 the national television systems committee ntsc was the industry group that developed the currently used us television standards 6 using digital technology the dtv frequencies can be placed in the vacant portion of the same spectrum band currently allocated for an alog ntsc television without interfering with analog television broadcasts the dtv licenses consist of 6 megahertz mhz of unused spectrum within the vhf and uhf frequency bands be cause dtv signals cannot be received through the existing analog television broadcasting system known as ntsc5 the fcc decided to phase in dtv over period of years so that consumers would not have to immediately purchase new digital television sets or converters thus broadcasters were given 6 mhz of new spectrum for digital signals while retaining their existing 6 mhz for analog transmission so that they can simultaneously transmit ntsc and dtv signals to their broadcasting market areas6 the simultaneous broadcasting simulcasting of the same programs in both digital and analog modes was intended to allow viewers who have not yet purchased dtv sets or convert ers to continue to receive television programming during the transition to dtv the ruling required television stations receiving the dtv licenses to build their dtv facilities according to sche dule determined by the size of their markets the fcc has granted extensions to licens ees unable to meet the schedule due to unforeseeable or uncontrollable circumstances such as an inability to secure tower locations for new antennas the fcc set target date of 2006 for broadcasters to cease broadcasting the analog signal and return their existing analog television spectrum licenses to be auctioned for other commercia l purposes during the 105th congress the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 made the 2006 reversion date statutory providing that broadcast license that authorizes analog television service may not be renewed to authorize such service for pe riod that extends beyond december 31 2006 however the act required the fcc to grant extensions for reclaiming the analog television licenses in the year 2006 from sta tions in television markets where any one of the following three conditions exist if one or more of the television stations affiliated with the four national networks are not broadcas ting digital television signal if digitaltoanalog c onverter technology is not generally available in the market of the licensee or if at least 15 of the television households in the market served by the station do not subscribe to digital multichannel video programming distributor including cable or satellite services and do not have digital tv sets or

assistance fund and the 1 billion in consumer digital transition subsidies are moot because the legislation limits the digital transition d eadline only to public safety spectrum and does not authorize auctions of commerc ial spectrum currently used for analog television broadcasts also labeling requirements would only go into effect if the fcc acts to set hard deadline for the return of

must act to pass legislation in the first session of the 109th congress that establishes comprehensive approach to the timely return of analog broadcast spectrum as early as december 31 2006 and that any delay in the adoption of such legislation will delay the ability of public safety entities to begin planning to use this needed spectrum the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of

modifying or removing the 85 digital pe netration threshold re quirement or would later and redefined transition deadline be more appropriate should the reclaiming of analog spectrum for public safety uses be singularly designated or should it be included as part of comprehensive approach to returning all of the analog spectrum appendix b in this report provides listing of dtvrelated legislation introduced into the 109th congress aside from ensuring that consumers enjoy the benefits of digital television reclaiming the analog spectrum was prime motivation in the desire of congress and the fcc to complete the digital transition as soon as possible portion of reclaimed analog spectrum will be allo cated for first res ponder communications while the rest will be auctioned to the private

httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd05258tpdfauction revenues va ried from 10 billion24 to 28 b illion25 to 50 billion26 all or part of these auction proceeds could be used to reduce the federal budget deficit27 key issue in the debate was addressing the millions of american overtheair households whose existing analog televisions will require convert er boxes in order to receive digital signals when the analog signal is turned off many policymakers asked whether should some form of financia l assistance subsidies or tax credits for example should be provided by the fe deral government to enable overtheair households to purchase converter boxes or di gital televisions should such assistance be provided to lowincome households ex clusively or to all households should subsidies if warranted be financed by proceeds garnered by auctioning the analog spectrum and finally how much funding would subsidy program require and how much revenue is likely to be raised by auctioning the commercial portion of the reclaimed analog spectrum at the request of the house committee on energy and commerce the government accountability office gao conducted televisi on characteristics survey involving 2471 randomly selected american househol ds based on the survey gao found that 19 or 21 million hous eholds rely exclusively on overthe air television 57 or 64 million househol ds rely on cable and 19 or 22 million have subscription to dbs satellite levision additionally gao found that low income nonwhite and hispan ic households are more lik ely to rely on overtheair television broadcasting28 gao estimated that if subsidy were n eeded only for overtheair households the cost could range from about 460 million to 2 billion depending on the cost of the settop box from 50 to 100 per box nd whether subsidy recipients are limited to lowincome households under this scenario gao is assuming that cable and satellite providers woul d convert broadcasters digital si gnals to analog at the

such that cable and sa tellite tv consumers with anal og sets would be able to receive the signal without converter box under different scenario gao assume d that cable and satellite providers would

for one converter box per househol d it should be noted that the vast majority of televisi on households have more than one overtheair analog television each analog television set would need its ow n

television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 cable tv pr oviders are required to transmit local analog programs to their customers th is decision was based on the reasoning that since cable tv has predominant pos ition in the market without mandatory carriage provisions the economic viability of local broadcast television and its ability to produce quality local programming would be jeopardized59 the commercial broadcasters primarily the smaller networ ks and independent stations represented by the association of local television stations but also the national association of broadcasters be lieve that the same principles and conclusions of the 1992 act should apply to dt v services leading to mandatory carriage of the dtv programming by cable operators broadcasters argue that because most americans receive their tv via cable the carriage of dtv programming by cable providers is essential for consumers to purchase dtv receivers the cable companies led by the nati onal cable television association ncta oppose any must carry requirements fo r cable operator carriage of dtv programming arguing that it would be an unlawful taking of their property and that they should be able to decide what c ontent they provide on their own networks ncta points out that unlike the commerc ial broadcasters who were given free spectrum licenses for dtv cable operators must build their own infrastructure to be able to transmit dtv signals cable operators say they will carry commercial broadcasters dtv programming as soon as consumer demand warrants it cable television services provide finite numbe r of channels to consumers and any mandate to provide dtv programming would require cable companies to remove other nonbroadcast channels many cable operators are investing in the upgrades needed to provide dtv although the vide transmission standards adopted by cable operators may not be the same as those us ed by the broadcasters this could mean that different home equipment may be necessary for cable services than for overthe air tv reception in addition hdtv prog ramming will require cable operators to build more robust transmission ie gr eater bandwidth capability than

rule that digitalonly tv station whether commercial or noncommercial can immediately assert its right to carriage on local cable system additionally tv station that returns its analog spectrum and

association of america makers of personal video r ecording technology tivo and consumer groups on september 10 2003 the f cc adopted second report and order which adopted with certain modifications th mou agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industrie s the new rules allowed for the manufacture of plug and play television sets that would receive oneway digital signals from the cable company to the consumer without the need for settop box however consumers would have to obtain from their cable operator security card pod or cablecard that must be inserted into the tv set settop box would still be required for twoway services such as vi deo on demand or paype rview finally the order initiated subsequent proposed rulemaking second further notice of proposed rulemaking to examine remaining issues75 under the current fcc rule after july 1 2007 the security of the unidirectional digital signal must be protected by cablecard supplied by the cable provider which can be inserted

prohibition as the july 1 2007 d eadline approached many cable providers sought waivers from the fcc urging that the july 1 2007 deadline be extended by two years cable providers argued that imposing the ban would raise the costs to consumers of leasing the new cablecard enabled boxes without adding any new functionality and divert indus try resources from developing lowcost digital settop boxes needed for the digital transition cable companies also argued that next generation network architect security downloadable security will likely be available in 2008 or 2009 rendering ca blecard technology obsolete the consumer electronics industr on the other hand argued that if the july 1 2007 deadline was extended the value of cabl ecard technology to consumers would be further diminished thereby making it more likely that consumers would not purchase plug and play digital sets with integrated tuners and continue to opt for sets which rely on the settop boxes supplied by cable providers ultimately the fcc granted some waivers for small cable operators experiencing difficulty obtaining new equipment as well as for operators pledging an alldigital conve rsion by february 17 200976 large cable operators such as comcast and time warner have not been granted waivers and must comply with the july 1 2007 deadline meanwhile because cablecards do not provide signal security for
