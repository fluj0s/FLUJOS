environmental and energy policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress upper mississippi riverillinois waterway investments proposed authorization legislation in the 108th congress summary thirtyseven lock and dam sites and thousands of channel training structures create 9footdeep 1200milelong navigation channel known as the upper mississippi riverillinois waterway umriww system the umriww makes commercial navigation possible between minneapolis and st louis on the mississippi river and along the illinois waterway from chicago to the mississippi river thus facilitating lowcost barge transport of agricultural and other products to and from upper midwestern states since the 1980s the system has experienced increasing traffic delays raising concerns about competitiveness of us products in some international markets the us army corps of engineers corps the agency responsible for the system began studying the feasibility of navigation efficiency improvements in 1993 the study has been the subject of much controversy in 2000 corps economist alleged that the agency manipulated analyses to support navigation investments and series of newspaper articles criticized the corps planning process for the umriww study and other corps studies in response the corps halted the study and reinitiated it in 2001 with reformulated economic analysis and an ecosystem restoration objective ecosystem restoration was included to respond to criticisms that the study was too limited in its environmental analysis the study objective for restoration is to identify measures that address ecosystem decline including the ongoing effects of navigation operation and maintenance the goal is to benefit broad array of species by reducing the loss of habitat habitat quality and habitat diversity under the reformulated study in september 2004 the corps produced final feasibility report recommending 1 50year plan for combined navigation improvements and ecosystem restoration and 2 authorization of an initial set of measures including seven new locks and an initial 15year increment of restoration measures the corps recommended that the investments in the 50year plan be made within an adaptive implementation framework which would provide checkpoints for the administration and congress as more information was gained and project milestones were reached the feasibility report was approved by the corps chief of engineers on december 15 2004 at the end of the 108th congress the debate over the urgency necessity and national benefit of expanded umriww navigation capacity revolved around the possible congressional responses to the corps recommendations three pieces of legislation in the 108th congress hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 water resources development act wrda of 2004 would have authorized combined investments in navigation 173 billion and ecosystem restoration 146 billion the bills would have authorized most of the initial set of activities recommended in the corps feasibility report fourth bill hr 4686 proposed investing in umriww ecosystem restoration using an existing environmental management program without

mississippi riverillinois waterway investments proposed authorization legislation in the 108th congress introduction in september 2004 the army corps of engineers corps released its final integrated feasibility report and programmatic environmental impact statement for the umriww system navigation feasibility study1 it set out 50year plan for combined navigation investments 24 billion and ecosystem restoration investments 53 billion for the upper mississippi riverillinois waterway umr iww from the 50year plan the corps recommended authorization of first increment of investments 188 billion for seven new locks and smallscale navigation measures and 146 billion for ecosystem restoration the feasibility report was approved by the corps chief of engineers on december 15 2004 three bills in the 108th congress hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 would have authorized many of the umriww investments recommended by the corps they would have authorized 173 billion for navigation and 146 billion for ecosystem restoration action was taken on hr 4785 or s 2470 water resources development act wrda is the traditional legislative vehicle for authorizing corps projects on august 25 2004 the senate environment and public works committee reported s 2773 wrda 2004 the senate did not hold floor vote on the bill the house passed wrda 2003 hr 2557 without umr iww authorization on september 26 2003 that vote took place before the corps umriww feasibility report was available fourth bill hr 4686 the mississippi river protection and restoration act of 2004 would have expanded ecosystem

between minneapolis and st louis and along the length of the illinois waterway five of the nations top agricultural production states iowa illinois minnesota missouri and wisconsin have relied on the umriww system as principal conduit for exportbound agricultural products mostly bulk corn and soybeans the lowcost highvolume umriww system has provided an important competitive advantage for us agricultural products in international markets commercial users of the waterway argue that this competitiveness is in danger because of increasing transit delays most of the lock and dam infrastructure of the umriww navigation system were built by the corps in the 1930s these 600foot locks require the prevalent 1100foot barge tows to split in half and pass through in two steps this decoupling process contributes to wait times at some locks the corps reports that the umr iww system has over half 19 of 36 of the most delayed locks of the countrys inland waterways2 commercial users advocate that the federal government should expand lock capacity by building new 1200foot locks parallel to the existing 600 foot locks keeping both operational they argue that commercial umriww barge operators have been paying fuel tax into the inland waterway trust fund iwtf3 for making this type of infrastructure investment in contrast taxpayer advocacy group taxpayers for common sense and some environmental groups have argued that inexpensive smallscale measures like traffic scheduling congestion tolls and switchboats could manage demand and reduce lockage delays and unlike new locks that will take years to design and build smallscale measures can be implemented quickly at fraction of the cost4 navigation investment supporters argue that in practice the usefulness of smallscale measures is limited some environmental groups are also concerned that additional stress caused by construction activities and increases in barge traffic above current levels could accelerate ecosystem

that the improvements are not economically justified based on current agricultural and transportation trends and costs5 they argue that steady barge traffic on the umriww since the mid1980s indicates that foreign demand for us feedstuffs is stagnant navigation proponents counter that barge traffic has been steady recently because of delays that is delays are forcing grain shippers to switch to alternate transportation modes to ensure timely arrival at downriver processing plants or gulf ports navigation supporters cite that since the late 1940s the umriww has experienced substantial traffic growth from less than 10 million metric tons in the mid1940s to more than 80 million metric tons in the 1990s for an analysis of the historic trends and the prospect for future traffic see crs report rl32470 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway navigation expansion an agricultural transportation and environmental context coordinated by randy schnepf although 1200foot locks are expected to reduce current waiting times at locks they are not expected to eliminate all lock delays because decoupling is only one cause of delay lock delays also occur because of closures for operation and maintenance and the variability in demand more than one boat arriving at the same time results in queue and the seasonality of crop harvesting assures strong autumn demand the corps has not published an estimate of the proportion of delays expected to be eliminated by new locks ecosystem decline the upper mississippi river system umrs an ecosystem defined as including the umriww navigation system and the aquatic and terrestrial habitats and species that are critically important to the river floodplain ecosystem6 is losing the habitat and habitat diversity that support the ecosystems diverse species two structural elements dams and locks that facilitate navigation and flood reduction levees have changed the riverine ecosystems structure and functions altering basic processes and habitats by modifying water levels and their fluctuations the umrs provides habitat and food to at least 485 species of birds mammals amphibians reptiles and fish including 10 federally listed endangered or threatened species and 100 statelisted threatened or endangered species it is critical migration corridor for 40 of north americas waterfowl and shorebirds and home to at least 118 fish species and almost 50 freshwater mussels species in wrda 1986 pl 99662 congress declared the umrs nationally significant ecosystem and nationally significant commercial navigation system and created the environmental management program emp for conducting habitat rehabilitationenhancement projects and longterm resource monitoring for the umrs the ecosystem encompasses four national fish and wildlife refuges and three national parks lie within or immediately adjacent to the river system the umrs ecosystem also is viewed as significant because of its recreational use and the 5 twicecooked pork 6

and peis p 113 crs4 economic value of recreation annually there are 12 million daily visits for recreation in the umrs boating sightseeing sports fishing hunting and trapping are some of the popular recreational uses7 it is estimated that recreational activities generate 12 billion and over 18000 jobs annually8 according to the corps current annual environmental investments 339 million on average in federal and state funds are inadequate to prevent continued degradation side channels backwater and wetlands are filling in with sediment the ecosystem is also experiencing loss of connectivity of the floodplain to the river impeded fish migration loss of island habitat and loss of native plant community diversity and abundance although the navigation system and levees significantly altered conditions they are not the only stressors causing decline the mississippi river and illinois river have long history of impaired water quality largely caused by contamination from agricultural industrial residential and municipal sources9 as well as increased sedimentation and altered runoff patterns from land use changes environmental groups seek investments in ecosystem restoration that will support mosaic of habitats and river management that more closely resembles natural hydrograph and riverfloodplain connectivity some cite the loss of migratory birds in the areas of the illinois river and the middle and lower mississippi river as examples of possible outcome if investments are not made environmental groups want to reverse ecosystem decline and to increase the services and benefits provided by healthy ecosystem eg recreational uses umriww feasibility study evolution to inform the congressional decision on whether to authorize umriww investments the corps conducted feasibility study10 the corps feasibility study which began in 1993 to investigate the longrun navigation needs of the umriww has been the subject of controversy in february 2000 corps economist approached the us office of special counsel an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency that protects government whistleblowers and contended that the corps manipulated costbenefit analysis to support umriww lock improvements the feasibility study was temporarily halted while the allegations were investigated by the army inspector general and available study documents were reviewed by the national research council nrc of the national academy of sciences the inspector generals investigation found incidents of fraud or waste it did reveal serious misconduct and improprieties with the study and suggested an 7 ibid pp 146147 8 ibid p 147 9 ibid p 127 10 for more information see crs congressional distribution memorandum umriww project history by kyna powers may 3 2004 crs5 institutional bias that favored largescale projects11 the nrc pointed out several flaws in the economic modeling methodology and the data used for navigation estimates including overly optimistic river traffic projections12 it also criticized the corps for limiting the studys environmental analyses to incremental effects of expanding navigation capacity in response in 2001 the corps reformulated the economic analysis and added an ecosystem restoration component to the study the nrc continues to review the study second nrc panel produced report in early 2004 that reviews the reformulated study13 and another report in october 2004 that comments on an april 2004 draft corps feasibility report which is similar to the final feasibility report14 the nrc suggested in its reports that until small scale measures were investigated and implemented where feasible it would be impracticable to evaluate the benefits of new locks and lock extensions following on the earlier reports the october 2004 report found economic feasibility for any of the navigation alternatives has therefore not been demonstrated that nrc panel concluded that many of the flaws and omissions in this study can be corrected in the course of implementation by the application of adaptive management principles15 final feasibility report in september 2004 the corps released final feasibility report based on the results of the reformulated study it recommended 50year plan for combined navigation efficiency and ecosystem restoration investments the corps proposed authorization of first increment of measures as well as dualpurpose navigation and ecosystem restoration management of the umriww the corps navigation improvement plan would cost an estimated 24 billion over 50 years while the ecosystem restoration plan would cost an estimated 53 billion over 50 years the corps recommended that congress authorize first increment of the navigation measures at 188 billion and first 15year increment of ecosystem restoration measures at 146 billion although the corps did not implement smallscale measures as the nrc suggested the agency evaluated them as part of the reformulated study few of the smallscale measures that were studied were included in the corps recommendation for navigation investments the feasibility report was approved by the corps chief of engineers on december 15

creating structure for umriww investments and operations consisting of three basic elements adding ecosystem restoration as umriww project purpose creating dualpurpose navigation and restoration authority approving combined navigation and ecosystem restoration plan as framework and adaptively implementing navigation investments and adaptively managing ecosystem restoration investments16 according to the corps these three elements combined would allow the agency to proceed with operational changes and nearterm investments for navigation and ecosystem restoration investments would be part of longterm river management framework that minimizes risk by establishing process to incorporate acquired information into ongoing decisionmaking and phased authorizations three bills hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 108th congress would have authorized most navigation and ecosystem restoration activities recommended by the corps fourth bill hr 4686 would have authorized expansion of ecosystem restoration under an existing program without authorizing navigation investments the next section of this report discusses the standard project development and authorization process for corps projects and how the umriww feasibility report and authorizations in hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 differed from the standard process that section is followed by two other sections one that compares the corps navigation plan to legislation proposed in the 108th congress and one that compares the restoration plan to the proposed legislation project development and authorization process standard process for most corps projects to be eligible for construction appropriations congress must authorize the project typically in wrda bill once authorized commencement of constructionrelated work must await appropriations appropriations are generally made in the annual energy and water development appropriations act although some projects may be authorized and received appropriations simultaneously in an appropriations bill this has not been the norm 16 part of the corps definition of adaptive management is an approach to natural resources management that acknowledges the risk and uncertainty of ecosystem restoration and allows for modification of restoration measures to optimize performance the process of implementing policy decisions as scientifically driven management experiments that test predictions and assumptions in management plans using the resulting information to improve the plans sic corps final feasibility report and peis p 611 crs7 the formal corps project development and authorization process typically has congress authorizing project based on report by the corps chief of engineers ie chiefs report that has been reviewed for compliance with administration policy by the assistant secretary of the army civil works then the office of management and budget omb17 the chiefs report contains final feasibility report including studies of engineering feasibility and analyses of benefits and costs environmental studies and the chiefs recommendation for the project in recent years congress increasingly has authorized projects based on informational copies of the chiefs report before complete reviews by the assistant secretary and omb however majority of projects are still authorized after full executive branch review since wrda 1996 congress also has increasingly authorized corps projects before chiefs report is completed these authorizations generally have been contingent upon completion of favorable chiefs report by the end of the calendar year umriww feasibility report the corps umriww feasibility report is distinct from the typical feasibility report the corps usually recommends authorization of an entire project that it has analyzed and compared to alternatives because the umriww is an extensive navigation system the corps analyzed and compared alternative 50year packages of projects for navigation and ecosystem restoration and it recommended that congress approve the combined plans as framework and authorize subset of initial projects with the implication that the remaining projects in the 50year plan would be authorized later18 the subset of projects was not analyzed as standalone plan for example the corps feasibility report did not have benefitcost analysis for the first increment of navigation activities separate from the analysis of the 50 year plan the report also did not present costeffectiveness analysis for the first increment of ecosystem restoration projects proposed legislation the authorization of umriww investments in hr 4686 s 2470 and s 2773 was distinct from the standard project authorizations most project authorization language in wrda bills state that project is to be carried out in accordance with the chiefs report rather than specifying authorized activities the bills specified navigation activities to be authorized without referencing chiefs report and not subject to any larger framework or plan in contrast the bills would have authorized ecosystem restoration measures in accordance with the general framework outlined in the feasibility report 17 for more information on the corps project development and authorization process see crs report rl32604 army corps of engineers water resources activities authorization and appropriations by nicole t carter 18 similar framework approach was used for the corps first largescale restoration effort in the florida everglades wrda 2000 pl 106541 approved the final feasibility report as framework authorized few specific projects under the framework and established process for developing and authorizing additional projects crs8 supporters of exceptions from the standard process generally argue that the completion of the administrations reviews and the timing of authorizing legislation are not always synchronized and that exceptions provide the flexibility to bridge the two schedules when most of the corps analysis is already complete environmental and taxpayer groups have been critical of exceptions to the corps standard process they contend that authorizing without complete administration review rushes projects through review that congressional decisions are made with incomplete information and that reviewers may be pressured to make favorable recommendations navigation investments the analysis performed to justify federal investment in navigation improvements in the umriww feasibility report is atypical in some respects the analysis had to account for complex set of risks and uncertainties resulting from 50year planning horizon for the extensive umriww system for the final feasibility report and peis the corps used scenariobased approach rather than forecasting navigation demand over 50 years which the corps was doing prior to the criticism in 2000 and 2001 the scenario approach examined umriww movements for five traffic scenarios based on differing world trade crop area crop yield and consumption patterns the corps used the scenarios to arrive at preferred navigation plan and to make three general findings first single navigation alternative was clear best choice across range of economic conditions19 second the preferred navigation alternative depended on two variables 1 traffic forecasts derived from future trade scenarios and 2 price sensitivity of shippers20 third the risks are high if action is taken and high traffic occurs risks are also high if large investment is made and increases in traffic do not materialize21 stated another way the corps found every alternative including action to contain risk in the face of an uncertain future meeting fundamental criterion for federal involvement that national economic development benefits exceed costs depends on what the future holds for example according to the corps analysis if umriww traffic continues at the fairly constant level of the last 20 years costs of largescale measures would likely exceed benefits22 if navigation traffic on the system increases ie follows the longer 50year growth trend benefits probably will exceed costs23 these findings are useful for understanding why proceeding with navigation capacity expansion remained controversial during the 108th congress for discussion of the difference of opinion on the urgency of new locks the feasibility of using alternatives to new locks for reducing delays and the confidence level in the corps analysis see crs 19 corps final feasibility report and peis pp x 437438 and 493 20 ibid pp 462 and 493 21 ibid p 493 22 ibid p 458 23 ibid p 459 crs9 report rl32470 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway navigation expansion an agricultural transportation and environmental context coordinated by randy schnepf corps navigation plan adaptive implementation the final feasibility report and peis stated that sufficient analysis has been completed to support an initial navigation investment to be implemented using an adaptive approach that minimizes risk by controlling the magnitude of investment decisions24 the corps recommended authorization of an initial set of navigation investments from its 50year navigation plan including seven new 1200foot locks authorization for the remaining navigation investments which consist primarily of extending five 600foot locks to 1200 feet would be sought in later legislation to support this adaptive approach the corps recommended the continued study and monitoring of umriww navigation to produce the data to feed into an adaptive implementation approach in another departure from standard practice the corps recommended that the seven new locks be reconsidered after congressional authorization as additional information becomes available the corps would transmit reports to the administration and congress containing acquired information first the corps would produce notification report at the end of the first phase of lock design and before the award of construction contract the notification report would present all new information resulting from monitoring river traffic and markets and results of any improved models and analysis the corps recommendation was to break up preconstruction engineering and design work for the seven new locks into two segments first the design work on three locks followed by the design work on the remaining four locks the design work for the first three locks was estimated to take three years following initiation of appropriations so the corps anticipated notification report in 2008 if the full annual appropriations were received starting in 2005 the corps estimated that it would spend 30 million on preconstruction engineering and design for the first three lock sites the second report would come five to seven years into implementation ie 2010 to 2012 when the corps submits reevaluation report upon the development and use of new and widely accepted models the report would conclude with recommendation to congress on whether to continue stop or delay lock construction underway third report would be an updated feasibility report for the 50year plan evaluating investments in second increment of measures the second increment of navigation measures would consist primarily of five lock extensions upstream of the new locks on the mississippi river this report was anticipated for 16 years into implementation ie around 2021 24 ibid p 493 crs10 first increment the corps 50year navigation plan consists of smallscale measures structural and nonstructural including switchboats25 and largescale improvements seven new locks and five lock extensions the plan would have first cost ie design and construction costs of 24 billion plus annual switchboat costs of 18 million in the final feasibility report and peis the corps recommended that congress approve the 50year plan as framework and authorize first increment of 188 billion to be paid 50 from federal general revenue funds and 50 from the inland waterways trust fund consistent with standard policy for inland waterway projects the first increment would include seven new locks and smallscale measures for use during lock construction the seven new locks would be 1200foot locks parallel to existing 600foot locks the 188 billion authorization proposed by the corps would cover the first costs for authorized navigation measures like most corps authorizations the authorized amount would not reflect operation and maintenance om expenses om for inland waterways is 100 federal responsibility the om for the recommended navigation measures would be 78 million annually the federal government would be responsible for this amount as well the 115 to 126 million annually spent on om of the existing umriww navigation system the corps estimated that it would take 13 years for each lock to proceed from the start of preconstruction engineering and design to completion of construction if fully funded the first three of the seven new locks would be complete at the earliest by 2019 the remaining four locks would be started three years later and completed earlier than 2022 environmental mitigation the final feasibility report and peis assessed and set out process and specific measures for mitigating impacts directly associated with the navigation improvements in its preferred navigation alternative the corps concluded that the impacts of largescale umriww measures could be mitigated it stated that by using mitigation the net effect from both increased traffic and site specific impacts would be loss to the five principal areas of concern fisheries submerged aquatic plants backwaters secondary channels and historic properties26 comparison of legislation and corps navigation plan as recommended by the corps hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 would have authorized seven new locks and smallscale and nonstructural measures see table 1 the language in the three bills emphasized that iwtf funds come from tax on commercial waterways users the navigation sections of hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 made reference to the corps preferred plan as longterm framework in 25 switchboats would be used to assist tows by managing the second half of their hauls as they move the first half through the 600foot locks resulting in shorter lockage time switchboats would be employed as hired vessels permanently stationed on both the upstream and downstream sides of lock 26 corps final feasibility report and peis p 419 the corps did not established specific mitigation actions instead it identifies potential mitigation measures for each river reach crs11 short it appeared that the bills would have authorized construction of specified activities without committing to longterm management framework table 1 identifies other differences between the corps recommendation and the three bills these include 1 the bills did not include an adaptive implementation process 2 the bills did not include continued monitoring and study provision except for development and testing of lock appointment scheduling system and 3 the bills required the secretary of the army to provide switchboats for five years instead of the 15 years recommended by the corps in effect the bills relied on the continued involvement of congress through the appropriations process rather than the corps adaptive approach and continued study and

research service crs12 ecosystem restoration investments the corps upper mississippi river system restoration plan is unique because the investments are aimed at benefitting diverse set of species most of the corps other environmental investments have been for project mitigation often targeted at specific threatened or endangered species for the umrs the corps is proposing largescale restoration effort that is not directed at specific species but at providing habitat and habitat diversity to benefit populations of multiple native species in situ for more detailed discussion of the ecosystem restoration proposal see crs report rl32630 upper mississippi river system proposals to restore an inland waterways ecosystem by kyna powers and nicole t carter the environmental management program for the umrs authorized in wrda 1986 has allowed the corps to test the impacts of measures similar to those proposed for the umrs however since largescale implementation of these measures may produce uncertain outcomes the corps is recommending an adaptive management approach since the umrs restoration plan is among the first largescale restoration efforts being planned across the country it raises numerous unanswered policy questions that are not addressed in this report including what distinguishes ecosystem restoration from mitigation for past and ongoing damages of navigation projects what qualifies as restoration for example is system that needs regular intervention such as dredging restored is restoration feasible goal for waterway managed for intensive commercial navigation is dualpurpose management for ecosystem restoration and navigation possible for highuse commercial waterway how should federal appropriations be distributed among the universe of ecosystem restoration projects nationally for example how does restoration of the umrs rank compared to the restorations of the florida everglades coastal louisiana and the california bay delta corps ecosystem restoration plan the final feasibility report recommended an ecosystem restoration plan for combating the environmental damage resulting from ongoing navigation om and other factors degrading the umrs ecosystem it recommended longterm 50year restoration framework an adaptive management approach and authorization of 15 year first increment of activities the restoration goals of the plan are27 maintain viable populations of native species in situ represent all native ecosystem types across their natural range of variation restore and maintain evolutionary and ecological processes eg disturbance regimes hydrologic processes nutrient cycles etc and integrate human use and occupancy within these constraints 27 ibid p 171 crs13 the corps limited its ecosystem restoration plan to the navigation project and study and to addressing the cumulative impacts of operations of federal projects and other stressors without reducing the benefits of existing federal projects as such restoration measures are constrained because they cannot harm navigation and they are limited to the umriww and its floodplain rather than the larger watershed for example dramatic water level changes that could produce substantial restoration benefits are not in the corps plan because they would interfere with navigation another consequence of limiting restoration to the navigation project and study is that some of the stressors leading to degradation are excluded from the preferred plan the recommended umrs restoration plan does not include changes to land use practices flood protection practices that isolate the river from its floodplain on largescale or significant alterations to navigation infrastructure for example the corps plan includes backwater dredging measures dredging addresses the symptom of elevated sedimentation but not the land use practices that can cause it directly changing land use is outside the scope of the navigation study and navigation project because only some of the stressors causing ecosystem degradation are managed under the corps plan not all of the ecosystems natural river processes would be restored resulting in the need for regular human intervention to obtain some restoration benefits 15year restoration increment in the final feasibility report the corps proposed that congress authorize an initial 15year 146 billion increment of the corps 50year 53 billion ecosystem restoration plan the 146 billion would cover the first costs ie design and construction for the authorized activities breaking down as 133 billion 93 federal and 013 billion 7 nonfederal this costshare arrangement is unusual for most corps ecosystem restoration projects costshare of 65 federal and 35 nonfederal is applied to the project28 the costshare arrangement proposed by the corps for the umriww drew attention because it distinguished between activities that have the 6535 split and activities that will be 100 federal in general the 100 federal components address impacts of the existing 9foot navigation project or are on federal land29 according to the corps measures in the 15year increment were selected to provide 1 the best return on investment 2 the best gains in habitat diversity and 3 additional knowledge that will facilitate implementing the 50year plan30 the corps also favored measures for which planning design construction and 28 currently the corps has authorization to lead only one largescale restoration effort the florida everglades restoration the everglades restoration was split 50 federal and 50 nonfederal the everglades ecosystem was also harmed by operations of federal projects and encompasses extensive federal lands for information on everglades restoration see crs report rs20702 south florida ecosystem restoration and the

pervaze sheikh and nicole t carter 29 the 100 federal components include any project 1 below the ordinary high water mark or in connected backwater 2 that modifies navigation structures or operations or 3 located on federal land 30 corps final feasibility report and peis pp 511512 crs14 monitoring could occur during the 15year window however some organizations contended that 15 years would be insufficient to demonstrate substantial improvements unlike the analysis of the 50year ecosystem restoration options the final report did not analyze in detail the ecosystem benefits expected from the 15year increment it also did not present alternative 15year increments or cost effectiveness analysis of the 15year increment the recommended 15year increment included 225 measures from the 1010 measures in the 50year plan the 225 measures were grouped into three main categories of activities fish passage and dam operations fish passage construction at four dams and fish passage planning and design at two dams 209 million and new dam operating procedures and related land acquisition or easements at two dams 41 million 250 million total 100 federal programmatic restoration authority

evaluation the recommended 146 billion did not include om expenses om for ecosystem restoration for corps projects is typically 100 nonfederal responsibility because some of the projects would be managed by federal agencies their om would be federal responsibility the om costs which would be incurred over the 50year planning horizon for the 15year increment were estimated at 615 million with an expected split of 96 million federal and 519 nonfederal comparison of legislation and corps restoration plan three bills hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 were largely similar to each other and used many of the corps recommendations they would have authorized the same projects the same costshare arrangement and the same total authorization of 146 billion in contrast hr 4686 would have authorized an increase in umrs ecosystem restoration investments under the existing emp separate from navigation investments hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 although hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 would have required that restoration be implemented in accordance with the general framework outlined in the final feasibility report and peis there were some differences between the corps 15year increment and the proposed authorizing 31 ibid p 522 crs15 language in the three bills see table 2 for example the corps recommended adaptive management of the ecosystem restoration plan but the bills made mention of adaptive management instead they would have required some complementary measures they required an ecosystem restoration implementation report by july 2005 and every four years thereafter the report included baselines benchmarks goals and priorities for restoration projects and to measure the progress in meeting goals the bills also would have authorized science panel which was one of 12 elements of the adaptive management strategy outlined in the final feasibility report32 because the bills did not specifically authorize the adaptive management approach it was uncertain if the corps would have the authority to implement the 136 million adaptive management program and the complementary 136 million monitoring and evaluation that the agency recommends similarly the corps recommended adding ecosystem restoration as project purpose33 bill language would have required the corps consistent with requirements to avoid any adverse effects on navigation to modify umriww operations to address cumulative environmental impacts and improve ecological integrity and to carry out ecosystem restoration projects the bills did not explicitly add ecosystem restoration as project purpose of the umriww the implications of this for managing for both navigation and restoration were unclear another distinction was that hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 would have authorized the lump sum of 146 billion with one primary limitation that land acquisition be limited to 35 million annually in the final feasibility report the corps made recommendations on an annual limitation on land acquisition instead it recommends cap of 35000 acres on land acquisition the final report provided breakdown of the 146 billion between three categories of restoration activities fish passage and dam operations programmatic restoration authority and land acquisition the major difference among the three bills was that s 2773 included three sections that are not in hr 4785 and s 2470 restoration project design requirements linked navigation and ecosystem restoration progress and project ranking based on restoring natural river processes project design s 2773 would have required that before an individual restoration project could begin construction the secretary would be required to establish restoration performance measures including baseline indicator and target goals the bill also required that the design of these projects include monitoring plan for the performance measures including timeline for project completion the provision appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns over what would be achieved both under the first increment of authorized activities and the longer 50year plan and when restoration would be complete this provision was complementary to the corps recommendation for an adaptive management approach which required establishing baselines and performing monitoring to incorporate new information into ongoing investments 32 ibid p 516 33 ibid p 491 crs16 table 2

quadrennial report see science panel and river continued study and management teams monitoring for systemic studies evaluation complementary provisions of restoration measures continued study and report after 15 years implementation report by monitoring june 30 2005 and every 4 years after that reports would include baselines benchmarks and priorities and measures in progress to meet the

source congressional research service crs17 linked progress s 2773 would have required the corps to establish milestones for the ecosystem restoration and navigation projects it also would have required the secretary of the army to determine if the projects are being carried out at comparable rates if the projects were not moving toward completion at comparable rate annual funding would have been adjusted to promote comparable progress the provision appeared to be an attempt to address concerns about ecosystem restoration investments being outpaced by navigation investments some environmental groups were willing to accept new locks if ecosystem restoration also was authorized and funded they wanted investments in restoration and navigation linked they feared that if the two were not linked ecosystem restoration could have been authorized but receive minimal appropriations navigation and agricultural interests expressed their dissatisfaction with wedding navigation and restoration progress they considered navigation and ecosystem restoration investments as separable they did not want navigation construction slowed down due to constrained federal appropriations for ecosystem restoration in light of the multiple multibillion dollar largescale restoration projects already underway or under development nationally they also contended that linking may delay progress of lock construction thus extending the environmental and traffic disturbances caused by construction linked progress ultimately is policy decision of how congress wants to direct its appropriations project ranking s 2773 would have required the secretary of the army to develop ranking system for restoration projects that emphasized projects that restore natural river processes project ranking based on restoring natural river processes appeared to be an attempt to promote projects that trigger selfrepair and selfmaintenance over large areas at relatively modest cost34 this provision likely would have given priority to water level management and other dam alterations floodplain measures such as levee modifications and removals and alteration of river training structures such as wing dams and dikes the impact of this provision on the implementation of the corps final plan was uncertain it would have given priority to single aspect of project rather than considering multiple objectives for instance prioritizing projects that restore natural river processes may not be appropriate for all river reaches especially lower reaches that are more altered than lessdisturbed upper reaches greater number of engineered restoration activities were recommended by the corps in the lower basin which is more heavily developed and leveed than in the upper basin for example the corps recommended artificially mimicking natural hydrograph to restore ecological processes eg pumping water out of areas with water levels raised by dams for reaches where natural river restoration options were limited by the navigation system and development solution using more natural river process may have been to change dam operations to decrease water levels thus harming navigation but this option was not considered in the corps plan because the agency considered it outside the scope of the feasibility study and navigation project hr 4686 the mississippi river protection and restoration act of 2004 hr 4686 would have provided for ecosystem restoration of the umrs by expanding the environmental management program and establishing trust fund 34 early 2004 nrc report p 19 crs18 financed by the federal treasury and charitable donations to pay for the program the bill called for half of the annually appropriated funds for umriww operations and maintenance to be reserved to carry out restoration projects recreation projects and monitoring of waterway traffic movements it amended the existing emp in numerous ways including increasing the authorized appropriation level for the habitat restoration projects from 2275 million to 80 million annually until the trust fund contains 25 billion authorizing 35 million annually for purchase of floodplain land and increasing the annual appropriation limit for recreation projects from 05 million to 10 million the bill also addressed other environmental and flooding issues along the entire mississippi river in contrast the corps plan would create new structure and program for restoration investments the corps did not suggest dismantling the emp instead the agency proposed coordinated implementation of the emp and the ecosystem restoration plan that it had developed in contrast to the annual authorization limits in hr 4686 the corps supported 15year authorization of 146 billion this would be in addition to the existing emp authorization although the corps recommended annual authorization for or annual restriction on land acquisition beyond its 15year limit of 35000 acres hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 would have restricted floodplain land acquisition to 35 million annually neither the corps plan hr 4785 s 2470 nor s 2773 specified authorizations for umrs recreation projects conclusions the corps feasibility report recommended first increment of investments in navigation 188 billion and ecosystem restoration 146 billion the recommendation was for these investments to be made using an adaptive approach and as part of longterm framework for dualpurpose operations the recommendation was to improve navigation efficiency by building seven 1200foot locks to reduce delays caused by decoupling of barge tows the ecosystem restoration proposal was to address cumulative impacts degrading the umrs ecosystem including the ongoing effects of om of the navigation system recommendations for restoration activities were limited geographically to the umr iww and its floodplain and to the scope of the navigation project and its feasibility study more comprehensive watershed approach was not part of the plan recommended in the feasibility report three bills hr 4785 s 2470 and s 2773 would have authorized many of the elements of the corps recommendation for the first increment of investments the bills would have authorized seven new navigation locks and smallscale navigation measures legislative mention was made of longterm framework or plan for navigation investments the adaptive implementation process that the corps recommended for integrating new information into the lock construction decision to manage the risk and uncertainty of making largescale investments also was not addressed in the bills crs19 following the corps recommendations the three bills would have authorized ecosystem restoration activities to be carried out in accordance with the framework in the feasibility report and they would have required operational changes to the umriww consistent with requirements to avoid any adverse impact on navigation in addition s 2773 contained three provisions related to implementation of ecosystem restoration the provisions would have required comparable rate of progress for navigation and restoration projects outcomeoriented project design and the development of ranking system for restoration projects that prioritizes natural river processes hr 4686 differed from the corps plan because the corps proposed 1 integrated investments in navigation and ecosystem restoration and 2 new structure for umrs ecosystem restoration efforts in contrast hr 4686 would have built on the existing emp thus emphasizing that some groups considered the decision to authorize ecosystem restoration investments to be separate from the decision to authorize navigation capacity expansion for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32574
