submitted two separate fy2006 supplemental appropriations requests the first totaling 724 billion would fund ongoing military operations in iraq nd afghanistan 679 billion and state department operations in iraq and various foreign aid pr ograms including additional assistance for iraq 42 billion th other supplementa l would provide 198 billion for recovery and reconstruction activities in hurricaneaffected gulf coast areas thus congress considered co mbined spending proposal of 922 billion for the military component of the suppl emental several issues arose in congress including whether dods funding requests for training afghan and iraqi security forces were necessary in light of the pace of implementation how to make transparent the dod assumptions about milita ry personnel levels for activeduty and reserve forces that underlie the request whether dod could better contain increases in operating costs and whether dods i nvestment request financed peacetime as well as wartime needs the supplemental proposal for international matters covered range of activities that were either not ddressed in the regular fy 2006 appropriations addressed circumstances that had changed since passage of the regular spending measures or like military operations in iraq and afghan istan have been largely funded through supplementals rather than incorporated into the base of annual ongoing diplomatic and aid operati ons the request of 16 billion in iraq stabilization assistance was the first sizable aid package for baghdad since congress approved 1845 billion in the fy2004 emergency s upplemental measure other foreign policy elements included funding for us dipl omatic costs in iraq and afghanistan reconstruction aid for afghanistan democr acy promotion programs

for war related costs in iraq nd afghanistan hr 4939 provides 6586 billion roughly the same leve l as requested the enacted bill however is about 19 billion less than passed earlier by the house and senate reduction that serves as an offset for the addition of 19 billion to f und the presidents border security initiative the other major reduction to the administrations request is 1 billion less

in iraq 66 million for democracy programs in iran and 618 million for humanitarian support in sudan the overall foreign aid nd state department package is about the same as the president proposed but the conference agreement reduces amounts for iraq and iran by about 215 million and 9 million respectively the bill however increases emergency aid for darfur nd southern sudan by 104 million the

president further revised his supplemental request on may 18 asking for 195 billion to support an enhanced border security initiative proposal offset with cuts to the original dod supplemental

fund and through assumed tax savings for people affected by the disaster see belo w for further discussion of complete hurricane recovery measures and fundingthe president requested that the tire amount of both supplementals be considered emergency appropriations designation that would exempt the funds from any limitations contained in the fy2006 budget resolution nevertheless the supplemental adds to the size of the us budget deficit the administration did not seek any offsets from other previously appr oved spending that could have the effect of reducing the supplementals impact on th deficit although revisions to the original request were offset with reduc tions in the initial supplemental proposal some members argued that some or all of the supplem ental appropriation should be off set especially as the size of the senate version of the emergency supplemental grew during committee and floor considerati on calls for offsets or the removal of spending for matters other than the iraq war or hurricane relief intensified some senatepassed amendments included corresponding offsets for new spending items such as the amendment by senator gre gg to add funds for border security with an equivalent reduction in defense depar tment appropriations but many did not as noted elsewhere despite not proposing any offsets to the original 922 billion request president bush said on several occas ions that he would veto the legislation if the final version exceeded his proposal although he would allow increases for pandemic influenz preparedness summary of congressional action as

senate passed an amendment by senator gregg providing 19 billion for border security operations offset by 2775 unspecified cut in defense monies for both the iraq war and hurricane katrina because the defense department would have discretion to distribute the cut it is not possible to say what the total for war costs in the senate bill would be if the entire reduction was applied to war expenditures the senate total could be as low as 658 billion or as high as 676 billion if the reduction was taken exclusively from dod hurricane damage funds the total for war costs could also fall somewhere in between this high and low rangeactivities 12 billion less than the revise d administration request and 44 billion below the senate level other major issues settled by conferees include 19

congressional action on march 17 hr 4939 hrept 109388 the house provided 9195 billion in supplemental funds 270 million less than the administrations request the legisla tion reduced the defense portion of the supplemental by 137 million cut interna tional programs by 166 million and gulf coast hurricane relief by 658 million hr 4939 further made available in fy2006 750 million for low income home energy assistance that had previously been appropriated for fy2007 this action whic h was not requested by the administration raised the tota l funding level of the bill in addition to trimming the presidents proposal the housepassed m easure included provision that would block the sale of operations at five amer ican port terminals to the uaebased dubai ports world the senatepassed version of hr 4939 increased the overall size of the legislation to 1089 billion 168 billion ove r the request and 17 billion higher than the house the bill provided 677 billion for military operations in iraq and afghanistan2 and 445 billion for state depar tment and foreign assistance programs roughly at the vels requested the legi slation further provided 288 billion for hurricane related expenses about 9 b illion more than pr oposed the senate also included several provisions unrelated to either military operations international affairs or hurricane rec onstruction including 23 billion for pandemic influenza preparedness nearly 4 billi on for agriculture disaster and economic assistance 650 million for port security nd 19 billion for enhanced security at american borders that was offset with cuts for defense spending in the bill president bush threatened to veto the legislation because of the added spending although the white house said it supporte d the pandemic infl uenza appropriation and would accept bill that did not exceed bout 945 billion during floor consideration the senate acted on several amendments that proposed to reduce various items in the bill but in most cases the amendments were defeated tabled or withdrawn for example senator c oburn submitted an amendment cutting 19 separate programs proposed by the senate appropria tions committee totaling over 2 billion in individual votes the sena approved one element of the coburn amendment cutting 15 million for the na tional marine fisheries service to implement seafood promotion strategies but tabled an item that would havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33298crs6 3 congressional record june 8 2006 p h3613ph3614deleted 700 million to relocate csx freight rail line further inland from the gulf coast and defeated proposal to delete section 2303 that would broaden the navys liability for higher shipbuilding costs asso ciated with business disruption senator coburn withdrew that remaining 16 divisions of his amendment the senate further rejected an am endment by senato r mccain reducing agriculture assistance by 745 million th senate also tabled an amendment by senator thomas that would have replaced the committee text of the bill with the presidents request plus funding for pa ndemic influenza prep aredness and border security with offsets thereby reducing the bills total cost to 945 billion and an amendment by senator ensign that would have required the bill to be recommitted to the appropriations committee with instructions to report back legislation not exceeding 945 billion other amendments passed by the senate are set out below in tables and discussed in detail defense issues conference action conferees following senate recommendation cut 2 billion from the administrations defense request to finance border security needs but unlike the senate position the confer ence agreement allocat those cuts to particular accounts most but not all of the cuts are taken from procurement as requested by the administration but confer ees also reduced the amounts to train the afghan and iraq security forces by 1 billion the administration opposed this cut but conferees argued that dod could not use all of the funding requested within the fiscal year the conference agreement also adopts th senate proposal to consolidate all funds to develop ways to feat improvised explosive devices ieds in new joint improvised explosive defeat fund and give s dod the authority to transfer those funds to individual accounts with reportin g requirement to c ongress within 60 days of enactment and then ever 30 days thereafter on how the funds will be spent since most of the funds for ieds were requested in opera tion and maintenance om accounts the conference version s hows lower total for om even though the conferees largely approved the service requests in the case of warrelate d military construction th conference agreement approves 235 million deleting f unds for several projects in bagram which omb withdrew without explanation and reducing f unds for an ied bypass road in iraq the utility of which both houses questioned c onferees expressed some frustration with the administrations actions in changing its mind about whether certain projects were truly emergencies3 the enacted bill drops senate provision that prohibited construction of permanent us bases in iraq or us cont rol of iraqi oil resources or infrastructure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33298crs7 in section 1213 conferees endorse th senates resolution calling on the administration to submit requests for wa rrelated funds after fy2007 in the annual budget rather than in supplementals senate action during floor debate the nate passed the gregg amendment samdt 4939 which provided 19 billi on for border security operations construction and proc urement offset by 2775 unsp ecified cut in defense monies for both the iraq war and hurricane katrina because the defense department would have discretion to distribute the cut it was not possible to say what the total for war costs in the senate bill would be if the entire reduction was applied to war expenditures the senate to tal could be as low as 658 billion or as high as 677 billion if the reduction was taken excl usively from dod hurricane damage funds the total for war costs could have also fallen somewhere in between this high and low range the senate appropriators also cut 207 million from the 679 billion request for war funds compared to house cut of 137 milli on except for the gregg amendment the senate bill like the house largely redistributed funds with increases being mainly offset by cuts in addition to the gregg amendment re duction significant wa rcostrelated floor amendments considered in the senate included an amendment by senator byrd samdt 3079 adopted 94 to 0 that as in previous supplementals stated sense of the senate that after fy2007 the administration should submit requests for funds for ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan in the regular budget covering the entire fi scal year and including detailed justification an amendment by

overall plans for the types of equipm ent to be provided to afghan and iraqi security forces while the current and proposed statutory language requires dod to provide fiveday advance notification of individual transfers from the account this does not give congress an overall sense of dod plans for the amounts and types of equipment to be provided nor is it clear whether dod plans to transfer or

justification did not include any information about the mix of activeduty and reserve fo rces anticipated in fy2006 that would be funded with these monies and because of the discrepancies in the figures it is impossible to say whether dods estimate d funding in fy2006 is similar to or different from last year in general the more that dod relies on reservists the higher are warrelate d military personnel costs that is because dods incremental war costs for activeduty forces include only special pays because their regular pay is included in dods regular appropriations whereas the

did not oppose them there was formal request or justification material it ppears that about half of the 153 billion increase in fy2006 for om could be explained by higher transportation maintena nce

billion or almost 40 higher than the fy2005 level43 according to dods justifica tion material the additional depot maintenance requirements reflected the harsh desert environment and wartime conditions which have increased the wear and tear on equipment another area programmed for large incr eases was transportation of personnel and equipment to and within theater for which dod is

for the most critical items and shipment commitment also included in dods justification material for fy200544 it is not clear why in the fourth year of operations dod is still heavily rely ing on air transport of supplies higher fuel prices may so account for increases in operating tempo costs that include fuel spare parts and other co sts of deployed units dods request is predicated on the assumption that the average price of fuel with service charges rises from 62 to 84 per barrel45 dod estimates that higher fuel costs in fy2006 account for 26 billion in higher costs including 22 billion financed in the bridge fund and 423 million in the new supplemental46 the fy2006 om supplemental also included 539 million for body armor plus an additional 140 million in the brid ge

roughly half of the 15 billion increase in om in fy2006 from dods justificati on material the source or rationale for other funding increases or for continuati on of fy2005 levels for other areas was not apparent congressional action the 316 billion in funding proposed in the conference agreement for om is 17 billion below the request and close to the senate level th cuts include 500 million to om air force presumably reflecting the house difference about th likely cost of fuel 750 million cut to coalition support which halves the administr ations request and transfer of funds to counter ieds

million for the marine corps target devices such as lightweight laser designator rangefinder 95 million and 113 million for knight family fire support and target signators for the army and additional communication aids modification kits for aircraft eg ah64 helicopters in the army and av8s in the navy were also requested similar items were included in the bridge fund including for example ove r 1 billion for radios of various types50 rationales for procurement request unclear although dods request included descriptions of i ndividual procurement items it did not give any rationale or explain whether funding requests for various items reflect battlefield losses washout rates for worn equipment equipm ent provided for stateside units whose equipment remains overseas or additional gear for deployed units this made it difficult to assess whether fundi ng levels were too high t oo low or about right nor was it clear whether the army and marine corps in partic ular had additional unfunded requirements that woul d come due in later years or whether some of these items were originally budgeted in the baseline budget but transferred to the supplemental carryover of fy2005 procurement monies about 6 billion of procurement monies appropr iated in fy2005 remain to be obligated in fy2006 in addition much of the 8 billion for pr ocurement in the fy2006 bridge fund is probably still available51 if dod received an additional 164 billion in the fy2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33298crs37 52 crs calculation based on dod fy 2006 supplemental request war p 24 which shows that 410 million buys 3146 hmmwvssupplemental dod would have as much as 30 billion in procurement monies to spend in fy2006 in addition to its baseline budget as part of its budget review dod set goal that all supplemental procurement funds should be obligated by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year in light of the large amount of funds and the fact that monies were not likely to be available until the third quarter it appeared unlikely that dod would reach that goal although procurement monies are generally available for three years it could be argued that shorter period of time would be appropr iate for urgently required procurement funds and would improve oversight congressional action although the conference agreement adopts procurement total of 150 billion 26 billion below the house level and 450 million below the senate level some 11 billion of this decrease reflects the transfer of procurement funds to count er ieds from procurement to the new consolidated account thus the actual cut to the original request is closer to 15 billion with about 440 million taken from tr ucks and other logistical support equipment 210 million from the bridge to future networks program still undergoing testing and cuts to va rious communications devices the administrations revise d request included some of these cuts conferees also include the congre ssional adds of 230 million for 3 v22 aircraft the 227 million to keep the c17 aircraft line open and 300 million to keep open the line to upgrade m1a1 tanks like both houses the enacted bill shifts some of the funds requested to recap italize old

m1a1 and m1a2 tanks 400 million nd buy tank urban survival kits 100 million improved recovery vehicles 100 million 8 mq1 predators 77 million the measure also proposed to spend 100 million to keep the c17 production line open even though it is not clear whether additional planes will be needed preferring to buy new uparmored hmmwvs rather than rebuild old ones the house appropriations committee swappe d 480 million in recapitalization monies to buy new vehicles bringing the to tal for new hmmwvs to 890 milli on which would buy about 6850 vehicles at about 130000 each52 the committee argued that buying new vehicles was more appr opriate because these would be uparmored whereas the repaired vehicles would not and therefore would not be usable in combat if the recapitalized hmmwvs are not suitable for combat then it was not clear why dod included that funding in the supplemental dod did not show how their funding request meshes with the army s requirements in theater in recent years

its concern that dods justification for warrelated procurement includes only descriptive mmaries and is absent of meaningful program and budget informa tion such as requirements pricing and delivery schedules for this reason the committee warned that congress will not be able to fully support supplemental re quests unless it is pr ovided with the same detailed justificati on and program materials that is receives with the annual request54 the senate bill cut 940 million of dods 164 billion procurement request that included transfer of 11 billion in army procurement funds for countering ieds to the new centralized joint ied def eat fund see above additions to various programs were largely offset by cuts elsewhere the 700 million in cuts included programs considered to be duplica tive 111

increased costs for ships under constructi on at ingalls shipyard in pascagoula mississippi and avondale shipyard in new orleans at the time however house and senate appropria tions committees raised concer ns about navy reimbursement plans primarily because of the difficultie s in segregating the costs that should be borne by the contractors insurance vs the costs to be borne by the government the contractor carries insurance to protect its profits against busin ess interruption and therefore its insurance company may be liable for higher costs incurred because of downtime and lower productivity of the shipyard workforce additional overhead charges and higher inflation costs due to delays all of these circumstances associated with the damage to the two sh ipyards could cut into contractor profits if the government did not reimburse related costs the fy2006 supplemental included an additional 1 billion for hi gher costs for total of 27 billion last year the house and senate appropriations committees raised concerns about the navys reimbursement plans primarily because of the difficulties in segregating the costs that should be borne by the contractors in surance vs the costs to be borne by the government accord ing to the navys original estimate from 11 billion to 15 billion of the timated higher costs could be due to business disruption costs some of which coul d be covered by insurance claims the contractor carries insurance to protect its profits against business disruption and therefore its insura nce company may be liable for higher shipbuilding costs incurred because of downtime lower pr oductivity additional overhead charges and higher inflation costs due to delays all of these circumstances associated with the damage to the two shipyards could cut into contractor profits if the governme nt did not reimburse those costs to ensure oversight the appropriations committees last year required that the navy or army secretary submit report

continuedalthough there does not appear to be any st andard definition of what is required for defense official to certify to these c onditions the following questions might need to be answered to demonstrate that the navy is turning to the government as last resort to reimburse these higher costs 1 has the contractor submitted and receive d rejections from insurers for its claims for reimbursement for business interruption if so has th contractor challenged the rejection in court and what has b een the outcome of the challenge 2 what types of expenses does busin ess interruption insu rance cover and what types of expenses does it not cover ho w do these criteria relate to the expenses incurred at the shipyard 3 can the navy demonstrate that delays incurred are associated with gulf coast hurricanes rather than other problems with shipbuilding program by showing work plans before and after the hurricane 4 can the navy demonstrate that the ex penses were unavoidable ie that the contractor has made maximum effort s to avoid delays and disruption by subcontracting work to other cations or relocating personnel congress may want to clarify the standards required for the navy to certify that such additional expenses were unavoidable directly associated with the gulf coast hurricanes and not payable by third part and apply such criteria both to the 1 billion in this new request and the 17 billi on appropriated in th earlier reallocation pl109148 congress may also want to as k the navy to refine its initial estimate made in the third week of septem ber 2005 only three weeks after hurricane katrina struck the 1 billion supplementa l request together with the 17 billion already enacted is identical to that original estimate82 congressional action as noted above the conference agreement provides 775 million house level rather than th 102 billion requested and recommended by the senate for the navy to reimburse its contractors for higher costs associated with the hurricane damage at ingalls ms and avondale shipyards conferees eliminate the new section 2303 as added by the senate that w ould have expanded the liability of the navy to cover business disruption costs the administration urged the elimination of section 2303 arguin g that it would require the navy to cover shipbuilding costs that are routinely borne by private insurance creating an incentive for insurance companies to deny payments and would expand the scope of the navys liability and limit flexibility in future contract negotiations because shipbuilders could claim business disruption for years to come including costs of any affected shipyard including those completely unrelated to dod83httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33298crs71 83 continued

senate floor action th senate rejected by 48 to 51 an amendment proposed by senator coburn that w ould have removed section 2303 of the bill which would require the navy to renegotiate contracts to pay the costs of any business disruption incurred by ship construction c ontractor due to hurricane katrina84 senator coburn argued that advance payment by the navy of such costs would make it unlikely that northrop grumman would co llect from its insurer for those losses85 this was contentious conference issue because the senate language was not included in the house bill and house report language emphasized that the navy should be sure not to reimburse the contr actor for costs that could be covered by insurance in floor debate senator cochran defended section 2 303 contending that the language provides that the government would be reimbursed for any insurance monies received by the contractor in floor debate senator cochran defended section 2303 contending that if the na vy paid up front with the possibility of insurance proceeds offsetting government costs the estimated 140 million cost of the provision would be less than the co st of threetosix month delay in shipbuilding senator cochran also emphasized that the 140 million would come out of the total of 27 billion requested by the navy position that the navy might dispute86 section 2302 would allow the navy to pay the costs of any business disruption incurred by ship construction contractor associated with hurricane katrina require the secretary of the navy to adjust contracts to take intoaccount such business disruption costs declare that if the government pays the contractor for such damagesthose amounts may not be used to reduce payments otherwise payable ie payments that would be the insurance companys responsibility or allow the contractor to collect from both the government and the insurance company and require the contractor to reimburse the government for any insurance payments received with the monies credited to the original account87httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33298crs72 88 srept 109230 p 62 89 northrop grumman hurricane katr ina white paperfebruary 21 2006 p7 90

instant update etter says navy wont pay for northrop damage that was insured march 30 2006in its report the senate appropriations committee stated that it is in the best interest of the department of the navy and national security to restore compromised shipyard capability and also to sure industry seeks reimbursement by insurance companies to the maximum extent the report also stated that the committee expects the shipbuilders to reimbur the navy for any insurance receipts received for business disruption costs88 section 2303 would expand the types of co sts that the navy would be liable to pay reduce the navys bargaining leverage with its contractors and affect the contractors resolve in negotiating with its insurer this new language would require the navy to renegotiate its current contracts with northrop grumman to cover business disruption losses chiefly additi onal labor hours and overhead for ships being built in the existing shipyards the navy is expected to face pressure from northrop grumman to pay business disrupti on costs in advance with the contractor required to reimburse the government in the event that it receives monies from its insurer if the navy pays these costs however the insurer could argue that it longer needed to reimburse northrop because it woul d not have suffered loss in fact the language in northrops policy with factory mutual states that the company will not be liable for any loss to the extent that the insured has collected for such loss from others89 thus if northrop collects from anothe r source in this case the navy then the insurance company or the court might decide that the company has not suffered loss and hence could not collect from in its insurer the senate language mirrors proposal recently made by northrop gru mman the primary contractor affected90 although northrop grumman argues that the advance agreement and relevant court case would ensure that the governme nt would be reimbursed if the insurance carriers were required to pay for that loss they acknowledge that the insurance companies potentially may argue that they are entitled to setoff of the am ounts paid by the government91 an advance agreement could also allow northrop to be reimbursed for certain losses not covered by insurance recently assistant secretary of the navy delores etter said that it would not be good precedent for the navy to pa for insured damages in advance because we dont think the insurance companies are as likely to follow through if weve already covered it for them92 this view reflects an earlier policy memorandum from the office of the secretary of defense advising the navy to ensure that the government does not approve payments for contractor costs associated withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33298crs73 93 as quoted in memorandum from donald p springer defense corporate executive defense contract management agency proposed advance agreement related to certain costs incurred as result of hurricane katrina april 12 2006hurricane katrina until all avenues for recovery from insurance carriers have been exhausted conditionally allowable there is risk that insurers will deny coverage on the basis that there has been loss ffered by the contractor dods current acquisition regulations prohibit the paymen t of costs that would be covered by insurance93 without the new language the navys liability for business disruption costs would be capped for fixed price contracts and limited to certain types of costs based on federal acquisition regulations though defining ty pes and amounts of costs could be difficult to determine in the case of fixed price contracts the navys liability for additional labor hours or overhead costs is limited by the ceiling top price in the contract up to the ceiling price the navy and the contractor share cost overruns by 5050 or some other ratio with the cont ractors profits being reduced as costs increase once costs exceed the ceiling price the c ontractor is liable for any additional costs for all costs above those anticip ated before the hurri canes for which they would be liable northrop grumman will presumably submit claim to its insurance company to pay those costs in order to prot ect its profits the primary issue is who covers those costs and at what point in time the types of costs that would be considered related to busine ss disruption is also likely to be contentious with the new language in section 2303 potentia lly broadening the definition in current acquisition regulations for cost plus contracts the government is liable for higher costs as long as there are appropriations available to pay those costs if business disruption costs exceed funding currently available the navy could request dditional funds part of the issue appeared to revol ve around timing northrop grumman argued that advance payment would be helpful because business disruption claims could take years to settle on the other hand the very act of the government paying those claims could undermine both the contractors resolv to negotiate with and to challenge its insurers claims in court at the same time advance payment could also potentially make it more difficult for northrop to get payment under its insurance policy significant issue raised by the new language was the precedent that might be set if the government pays in advance for any business disrupti on italics added claims which suggests that the government would be liable for all rather than only some types and amounts of business disr uption expenses determining business disruption costs for example deciding whether shipbuilding delays are due to hurricane damages or technical problems or deciding wh ether particular types of expenses eg administrative leave for employees would be considered allowable is inherently problematic the new language however appeared to expand the governments liabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33298crs74 94 house committee on appropriations draft report p 58concerned about the accuracy of navy estimates and pote ntial overlap with private insurance claims the house bill cut 250 million from the navys 1 billion request for additional funds to reimbur shipbuilder northrop grumman for estimated higher shipbuilding costs resultin g from the damage to avondale and ingalls ms shipyards the navy w ould still have almost 25 billion including the 17 billion provided in the katrin reallocation for these costs the committee believes strongly that funds in this act and under this heading in prior acts should not be used to subs titute for private insurance benefits and notes that shipyards have business interr uption insurance that could overlap with these funds94 as in previous conference report language the house committee again required that the navy not obligate funds unless it can certify that these costs would not be reimbursed by third part the committee noted that the navy submitted certification applying to funds already received that there was overlap on march 1 2006 military construction the presidents fy2006 supplemental request proposed 405 million to replace military facilitie s destroyed by the 2005 gulf coast

replace naval reserve and ar my national guard facilities because it did not expect to obligate the funds this year and the funds would therefore lapse the 405 million requested was for 53 million to
