changes two interest rates the first called the discount rate is an administered rate explicitly set by the fed it is the rate at which the fed lends shortterm funds to banks pursuant to pl 96221 the monetary control act of 1980 it is determined by the sevenperson board of governors of the federal reserve system the second known as the federal funds rate is market rate at which banks lend to each other overnight to meet their reserve requirements and other liquidity needs the fed sets target for this rate and buys and sells primarily us treasury securities with an aim to achieving the target which speedily becomes known to market participants it is decided by 12person federal open market committee which includes each member of the board plus varying fiveperson roster selected from among the 12 regional federal reserve bank presidents among the 12 the new york bank is always represented on the fomc on january 6 2003 the board of governors announced fundamental change to the setting of the discount rate henceforth it was to be made penalty rate for those banks who chose to borrow from the federal reserve to meet temporary reserve deficiencies as opposed to borrowing in the federal funds market the penalty aspect of the discount rate comes from the fact that it is set above the target for federal funds primary discount rate of 2¼ was initially set for banks judged to be in sound financial condition whereas banks whose financial condition was judged to be riskier would be required to pay higher secondary rate of 2¾ this change in operating procedure is shown in table 1 since the onset of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007 the fed has not made an issue of whether banks borrow at the discount window or in the federal funds market even though the discount rate remains slightly higher than the target rate for federal funds g23g151g141g142g155g156g157g138g151g141g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g3g151g151g152g158g151g140g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 because the discount rate is administered changes in it are stated explicitly hence the changes shown in table 1 are exact because the federal funds rate varies somewhat in response to market conditions when the fed changes only the federal funds rate it may specify the target rate or it may only announce that it is increasing or decreasing slightly the degree in pressure on reserve positions and that the action is expected to be associated with small increase or decrease in shortterm money market interest rates in the latter case the size of the rate change must be inferred hence some of the federal funds rates in the table are approximate based on observation instead of announcements at its december 16 meeting the fomc for the first time set range for the federal funds target this is because it was having difficulty holding the actual federal funds rate at the 1 target rate set on october 29 for much of the period between that date and december 16 the actual federal funds rate was substantially below the 1 target g20g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g142g561g143g152g155g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561 the fed tries to keep the economy operating at an output level consistent with low rate of inflation and low unemployment it therefore seeks level of interest rates at which the economy will grow at its potential to produce the interest rate levels that produce this growth rate vary with the course of the business cycle different rates are judged appropriate at different times changes in the federal funds target are the most visible signs of shifts in fed monetary policy and

institutions and markets of all kinds here and abroad unusual financial market conditions such as those related to the asian financial crisis of 19971998 the russian debt crisis of 1998 the terrorist attacks of september 2001 and the financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007 also influence fed decisions on rate changes the fed reports to congress twice yearly on its monetary policy including rate changes in oversight hearings in february and july as originally required by pl 95188 the federal reserve reform act monetary policy has varied considerably over the period beginning in 2001 initially it was aimed at setting an expansion in motion to do this the federal funds target was reduced from 5½ in march 2001 to 1 in june 2003 it remained at 1 for year as the expansion gathered momentum the target was raised in 17 equal increments spread over two years to 5¼ even as the fomc drew attention to upwar d movements in the core rate of inflation at various meetings during 2006 and 2007 it continued to express the view that inflation would moderate over time as would the rate of growth of gdp these reasons appear to be important for leaving the rate unchanged at 5¼ for more than year however during the late summer of 2007 the fall in housing prices and conditions in financial markets related to the difficulty in refinancing subprime mortgages and extending credit in general became matter of great concern to ease these conditions the board of governors on august 17 2007 reduced the discount rate for primary credit to 5¾ this was followed on september 18 with another reduction of ½ and reduction in the federal funds target to 4¾ additional cuts of ¼ in both rates were approved on october 31 and december 11 2007 on january 22 the target was reduced by ¾ and on january 30 by further ½ the economy began to soften in the third quarter of 2007 gdp growth was negative falling at an annual rate of 02 in the first quarter of 2008 it was positive again and rose at an annual rate of 09 during the second quarter the growth was also positive and at an annualized rate of 28 unhappily gdp contracted again in the third quarter the unemployment rate began to rise on sustained basis in february and in october it reached 67 job losses since december 2007 are in excess of 12 million as conditions in financial markets worsened and the economy softened the fomc and the board approved furt her reduction in the federal funds target and discount rate both rates were lowered on march 18 april 30 october 8 october 29 and december 16 and the discount rate was reduced itself on march 16 they now stand at range of 0 to ¼ and ½ respectively as these developments were taking place the world price of energy began to rise at brisk rate rising energy prices threatened to boost the overall rate of inflation posing challenge to the feds mandated commitment to stable prices initially the fed reacted by holding the federal funds target stead however as the magnitude and international scope of the credit crisis became apparent and energy and other commodity prices began to fall the target was lowered and the fed undertook number of new and innovative measures to shore up the financial system these measures were also undertaken to shore up the economy in general as growth slowed and job losses mounted for further discussion see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and
