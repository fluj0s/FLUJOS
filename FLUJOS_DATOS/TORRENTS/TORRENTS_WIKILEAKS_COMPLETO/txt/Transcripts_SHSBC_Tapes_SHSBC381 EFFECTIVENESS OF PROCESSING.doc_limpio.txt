effectiveness of processing lecture given on 30 april 1964 thank you well this is the what audience 30th of april thirtieth of april ad 14 saint hill special briefing course all right weve had little slowdown here recently on research the last six seven daysi managed to get the show back on the road againmostly due to the nonsense going on in australia the general situation with regard to that is theyre not in any danger or anything like that theyre just being crossadvised and being generally upset the government of australia in the form of little pipsqi mean this is anyhow theythey have this parliament and it has very very greatwell its all swollen up on itself because it used to be the state of australia used to meet there see and they dont realize that it doesnt anymorebut its just the parliament of victoria see well these little boys have an opposition there that are quite red and they all of sudden decided under fellow of the name of galbatty to investigateinvestigate scientology on account of how bad it all was you see andthis is the message i want to get across to you not the state of australia an organization starts slippingthey stop following through standard policies they are not on the ball here and they individuate there and they goof up someplace else and then you all of sudden start having trouble in their vicinity and it finally swells up to something like this inquiry you see and that sort of thing just everybody has to some degree or another taken his finger off of his number and goofed up you get the idea in this particular case why they ran some jerk down there who they knew was security risk he couldnt pass an emeter test if youd held gun to his head he is just complete bum so they go ahead and give him highlevel processing name is werne and they give this fellow bunch of highlevel processing and restimulate two or three wrong goals on him one way or the other so he goes into complete spin and i think hed been in psychiatric treatment and he went back under psychiatric treatmentand then he runs over and sees galbatty to get galbatty to pass legislation so as to cure his gpms and it just all went to smoke and it had never even occurred to anybody down in melbourne simply to handle werne refund his money and straighten him up when they did refund his money they didnt even require him to sign release so they went and refunded his money he went over to the court the same afternoon and filed suit for hundred and sixty thousand pounds i mean it takes genius see it just takes goof up after goof up now theyve been testifying on the stand down there nothing but class vi materialclass v class vi materialyap yap yap yap yapnot realizing that all it is is fishing expedition by theby the opposition dont you see to get lot of oddities they can quote and say you see scientology is just silly quote all these things out of context you see and then go stampede other state legislatures you see into passing legislation against scientology well finally the opposition took its finger off of its number down there and theya document passed into our hands on testimonysuggested testimony for witnesses and it turns out to be the minutes of their second meeting of witnesses wherein they were arranging testimony which they should give at this free open public inquiry if you want to look up the records the profumo witnesses are still in prison for having done this exact thing you see well all this is very interesting the profumo witnesses to the contrary as soon as i got hold of this documentits case of what we would do about it meantime therethis inquiry is costing the organization five hundred pounds week so every time you turn around there is cable through from down there send us five hundred pounds you see send us five hundred pounds send us twotwo to three days later send us five hundred pounds we finally gave them guarantee from swiss bank that guaranteed their bank account and the bank down therei guess it has mostly kangaroos for customersthis bank didnt understand what this swiss bank blockedfund guarantee was which was that if theyif their overdraft wasnt met the money would simply pass into the bank to meet the overdraft they couldnt understand thisthe only bank in the world that couldnt have understood it so theyre still at this business ivejust little while ago one came through send us two thousand dollars at once you see theythey wont at anythey dont realize that this is sort of silly while theyre busy sending through these demands to get them off the hook because they cant stand up to it the instructions going their way you see are just being disregarded and the instructions were simply walk into the inquiry and say we couldnt testify anymore because of collusion and fraud and produce the document and that would be that of course that would definitely be that it would probably result in the resignation of the premier who ordered the inquiry well all this is very interesting we got this evidence got it all rigged up i planted the howitzer tied the opposition across the muzzle of the howitzer showed everybody where the lanyard was all they had to do was jerk on it slightly and said all right pull the lanyard and thats the end of the inquiry into the situation everybody promptly ran away and said theireverything under the sun but they wouldnt go near the lanyard see so the attorneys down there are busy telling the staff how this document is unimportant that it doesnt mean anything because it was known to the fellow who was running the board of inquiry audience oh oooooh so they all bought this you see that the document is valueless but the same attorney the same attorneydirectly immediately and at oncehas telexed through long letter to on the basis of for gods sakes dont because it will unseat the incumbent government of victoria just before the election finish them while hes telling the organization that its unimportant and means nothing finally i start hammering on him hard enough and he comes through with the truth hes protecting the government of victoria first and scientology second he says of course if the opposition got in because of this terrible scandal and so forth why they would pass material against scientology and hes very reasonable about this sort of thing but i just wonder why he would tell staff down there that it is so unimportant when he tells oh dont please you know his fingernails are chewed off clear to the third joint you see what the situation is see we have it in our power to simply give little tug on this lanyard and that is the end of any future inquiry practically on scientology to the end of time everybody would say leave those people alone horrible now thats the existing thing now they wont do it they wont present this evidence andi wouldnt go along with this but they practicallynot even being practical enough to go around to the incumbent and say hey bud why dont you meet the organizations cost for this inquiry which was normal in any case and just pass little bill sort of and say thats the end of the inquiry we didnt have anything and we wont release it thats using it for blackmail you at least got that see suggestion of that has come across or anything of the sort but these cables keep coming through send us two thousand dollars so we can pay this weeks bills at the inquiry see all right theres gpm to create problems i just wish they would move up the track to the next gpm which is to destroy problems now thats what has interrupted research here for the last six daystrying to get through trying to get things clarified trying to get things squared around every once in while an organization will start to skid little bit on execution of this following of policy that being on the ball here see and then the next thing you know why theyre in deep dark stumbling trouble of some kind or another then at that pointjust to give you the rest of the lessonwhen you try to straighten it out youve got all kinds of crosscurrents going on where everybodys got them hypnotized into believing something else and you cant get an execution at the point of trouble so it just goes up in balloon now the organization will be all right itllitll survive simply for the excellent reason that theyll be forced to take some kind of solution along this particular line of course i always believei always believe that when somebody comes and attacks scientology on frontal attack and starts doing things one way or the other if he at any time laid himself out on the carving table and said carve i would simply pick up the biggest knife i mean i havent got any circuitous thinking on this particular subject somebody says down with scientology shoot all scientologists and so forth and heres piece of evidence by which you can shoot my finger instantly one splitsecond later would twitch this just isthis is terribly im afraid unsubtle see its just unsubtle but its that situation which exists in victoria as of this minute all anybody would have to do is just twitch his finger and that would be the end of inquiry and the end of really all future inquiries and it would probably be the end of the fda trial in washington because rumors abound that it was washington money which started the inquiry in australia in the first place this investigation would back all the way back up and probably be the end of the emeter trial in washington but there it isthere it is now were not going to do anything more with them they can go ahead and work their own destiny out in their own peculiar way it will probably all come out all right somehow or another i just hope that we dont for years and years and years fight this confounded basketful of testimony which is nonfactual and so forth that it wont keep appearing in other state legislatures as reasons why it should pass laws to debar scientology i just hope that wont happen but its on melbournes head thats it i have spoke all right now lets talk about im just bringing you up to date giving you thegiving you the gen zipzap center rapidly if you ever find an organization or area in scientologyill give you this as little moral lessonwhich is slipping you know slipping one way or the other well actually wewe dont have any classified auditors auditing anybody around here we didnt believe in that you see the preclear theno nobody keeps any logbook you know so nobody ever keeps any auditors reports on sessions you see and wewe dont believe in you see this that the other thing slipping you know what you are looking at in the future youre looking for complete bust it isnt you see that centrally scientology in its control areas or international board is always right that isnt the case but it is at least always uniform and these things are built out of errors which have developed in the past and their efforts to guide safe course through the rocks and shoals of processing and organizational activities when those things are all abandoned naturally the errors which they prevent occur and when those occur you get deterioration of the situation all right i dont know what to talk to you about today you dont look like you need good talking to you look like you are doing all rightexcept you of course you look like you are doing all right and so on i could give you bit of talk on the hgc allowed processes but i dont happen to have list of them sitting in front of but the whole basis that i could talk to you about and will talk to you about is simply the effectiveness of processing and effective processing thats all just you the auditor bringing about desirable effect on the pc its just that nothing more nothing fancier than that now that is quite subject and its the subject that you are grappled with in studying and sometimes you forget you are grappled with that subject and think that you are just grappled in with bulletins or tapes or something like this but actually all the way along the line you are simply handling this one single subject and problem which is how do i the auditor produce desirable effect upon the pc that is the entirety of your activity now of course you the auditor could go into group auditingthat is to say the oldstyle group auditing where you have lot of people in chairs and they execute the commands from somebody on platform you could have the same problem there how do you standing up before group and group auditing it produce an effect on the pc and also how do you the auditing supervisor when you are running coaudit get an effect produced on the pcs in the coaudit which you are conducting you see and also this could go into how do you the auditor by training alone and teaching pe course or something of that sort produce an effect on the caseson the cases of the people who are listening to your talks and lectures it goes out into that ramification now it can go little bit further how do you as scientologist produce an effect on somebody that youre talking to lets drop out the idea of an auditing action how do you the scientologist produce an effect on somebody you are talking to you are talking to george q blitz and he wots not of what you are or anything of the sort and without your giving him an acc on the subject of scientologyor even discussing scientology at allhow do you produce an effect upon this gent now all of these things come under the heading of the production of an effect dont they now just production of an effect then production of desirable effect then production of desirable effect upon pcs or other than pcs as subdivisions of thisso its just the production of an effect and if i were to teach you just cleanly and totally how to produce an effect on another human being it could go into very numerous subjects theres the subject of armaments you cock gun and you pull trigger and bullet arrives in somebody elses skull you produce an effect on that individual now governments lacking adroitness and so forth really in the final last resort only produce that effect they are producing an effect on somebody through the channels of destruction they are trying to get compliance through threat now that is whole field and area and is exactly 50 percent of the production of an effect general subject thats 50 percent of existence thats the production of an effect by threat menace force duress strengthyou get the idea and thatsim giving you this very very technically this is 50 percent exactly of the ways of producing an effectare in that category now if we study that 50 percent we will find that nearly all mental healing activities sooner or later drift into it psychiatrywith its prefrontal lobotomy electric shocks wet packs chemical shocks biochemical administrations of one kind or anotherhas drifted over into the solidform effect there are two reasons for this 1 they do not realize they are trying to influence thought they have definition of thought they dont even think anything is there thinking they are trying to influence matter man to them is matter and they are using matter to influence man so theyre actually in the field of physics not in the field of mental healing and its drifted over to that direction every once in while psychiatrist will err in the direction of producing kindly effect its stray i am not now being sarcastic im just talking right straight off the record he strays over and he says something friendly to somebody any of his friendly ideas toward patient when he exhibits them are in the zone and area of pitch he knows its pitch and so does the patient the arc you see isnt there at all he tries to be friendly so as to get the patient to confess more theres always lot of falsity involved in this sort of thing so you run danger in operating 100 percent in that remaining 50 percent see youre operating wholly in the remaining of 50 percent the production of beneficial effect and operating in that 50 percent of the sector you have left the other 50 percent slightly on automatic so therefore you occasionally drift over into it once in while you drift over into it once in while as an auditor youve just had too much and you explode and you tell the pc to hell with you happens to the best of auditors thats because hes got 50 percent area here that he is not operating in so occasionally it goes on automatic you follow that its almost inevitable that an auditor sooner or later is going to blow up at pc now let point out to you this other fact that an auditor in that blowup never has doesnt and never will produce an improvement of case in the pc you have to be there in the drivers seat few times like this and watch yourself blow up under tremendous stress ah this person is just too much manyou know every time you turn around why youreyoure trying to help them out and they arc break see and you try to help them out some more and they arc break and they ream you out and so forth and you finally let them have it see well what cures you of that the best cures are at class vi materials what cures you of doing that at class vi there are so many examples of thisabundant examples pcs been arc breaky pcs been arc breaky pcs been arc breakyyouve blown up and then youre red face few sessions later to find out that you were running it all upside down and backwards that there was bypassed charge there see you dont get as much of an opportunity to get cleancut examples of this at the lower levels because those bypassed charges are mainly session bypassed charges but you still run into them and after your face has been reddened with the blush of shame few times at realizing that you actually had skipped gpm on the pc you know nothing slightyou just skipped whole gpm youre going back over your auditors reports tada tada dada one day you know and youre looking it over lets see what have we run on this fellow and so forth well we ran number 3 and then we ran number 4 and then we ran number 6 and then we ran number 7 and then wewhat oh my god wonder he was arc breaky see now you know and it never comesemerges clearer that you made mistake the pc got arc breaky and then you blew up in his face the reason why the pc operated that way lays there very wide open its visual to the eye and you say well i blew up for nothing i had this sort of an experiencehad this sort of an experience one time found out almost 150 hours later that the person had been in an actual ri at particular moment when they had just been too insufferable for words and i had been gnashing my teeth privately to myself about what horrible pcing this person did almost 200 hours later i was running down the track and the pcand my gosh we collided headon with the ri that that pc had been in at that moment of that arc break because it had been bypassed at that moment it had been walked right on by it hadnt been accepted on the list but i recalled it because there had been an argument about it after that for several sessions the pc was very arc breaky and easily upset there is this whole sector over here 50 percent and thats wide open for an auditor to blow up in but what does he accomplish all he accomplishes is messup he really doesnt actually bring about any destruction he just messes it up now to go on and do something is harder task than if he hadnt moved over into that sector let give you broad example its much easier to process somebody before he has had his prefrontal lobotomy than afterwards you see just classify the prefrontal lobotomy over here as in extremis of destructive action toward the pc you see well similarly on much much lighter level it is far easier to straighten out the arc break before you have blown upyou the auditorin the pcs face one way or the other you know i am not going to process you anymore you keep talking to like that even if its that mild youll find yourself falling across that one falling across that one falling across that onewow you finally out of your own selfdefensenot because you have done anything to the pc because it is causing you so much troubleyou begin to say why did i ever do it you see its kickback mechanism that operates in the final analysis to an auditor with experience as disciplinary factor all he has to do is recognize this and he sees at once what the disciplinary factor is with regard to it so youre actually not keeping the auditors code because i tell you to youre keeping it because if you do anything else but keep the auditors code you have made far more trouble for yourself as the auditor with that pc than you can easily undo and now youre in an awful mess its selfdisciplinary type of activity now i warn you that this big sector does exist50 percenta destructive sector so that if left at random every other effect produced would be destructive if you just had this thing going at random its like you flip coin fifty times why youre going to get twentyfive heads and twentyfive tails usually on the average fifty percent the chances are so if you had an unintentional undirected justanyoldway type of thingyou werent worried about interpersonal relations you werent worried about anything of this sort but were just delivering random communications or causedistanceeffect lines you might say to the pc then 50 percent of them would be destructive and 50 percent of them would be constructive that justthats the random supposing you didnt know anything about scientology do you understand this would be the random selector well youre specialist youre specialist over here in the other 50 percent fortunately by the laws of life its this remaining 50 percent sectorthe good sector you seeis the only one which has any lasting benefit or there is any direction up or anything else the odd part of it is it isntit isnt proposition in black and white it isnt proposition of putting something there or wiping something out it isnt that fiftyfifty its by the definitions of create and construct which you get out of fundamentals of thought you dont ever really destroy anything see its not take something away youre dealing in sector over here then whereby you can do something constructive by actually deleting something but the other sector is just messing up what is already wrong eradication has to be 100 percent before it is effective if you want to know the truth of it if you wanted purity of destruction you would get notthereness but destruction does not go in that direction when you rehabilitate the individual it isnt enough to knock down the prison walls and leave them in rubble with him buried under them see that would be destructive way of going about freeing an individual well we want to get joe out of the dungeon good blow up the castle boom where is joe so the action of destruction as its normally commonly understood is not an action which produces result on case all it produces is messup now an asising of situation is not looked on by you or or anybody else really as destruction its looked on as constructive action now joes in the prison and we say wheeoowno castle there stands joe rubble simple clean we look upon that as beneficial actually thats an ultimate in this other 50 percent if you had an ultimate destruction you wouldnt even have the rubble but youd still have joe now if the way to handle joe as an individual is to set him freeand it isthen the destructive action that youre engaged on would not be messing up what he is caught inbut it would consist of the asising rather smoothly of what he is caught in take good workman to take down his jail see now the only thing joe objects to is having it all rubblified in his vicinity having it so messily knocked apart that he cant find his way through it now he hasnt got castle and he is not free but hes got an awful lot of shambles and thats what he objects to he doesnt object to being free he doesnt object to the disappearance of his dungeon he objects to it being done in such way that he is battered about and surrounded by rubble so the effect that youre trying to produce on the pc is an infinitely simple one you are simply trying to set the individual free by asising what the individual is caught in and without destroying the individual and without leaving lot of rubble around and thats really all you are trying to do in the effect you are producing on the pc yourefrankly it can be done in the mind its relatively easy magicians trick with the mind you gohes surrounded by this bird cage called motherinlaw see and hes worried all the time about the motherinlaw worried all about the motherinlaw worried about the time about the motherinlaw he cant think about his job or anything else because of his motherinlaw aww aww worry worry worry worry worry worry all right your magic trick as an auditor is asising this cage called motherinlaw so as not to leave lot of rubble around now the way you would leave rubble around is this sort of an approachcounseling you see put your mind on something else assert yourself in the home these are various types of advice dont you see assert yourself in the home do not permit yourself to be dominated by women how much rubble do you think is going to start gathering along about this point huh in the first place youve launched simply otherdetermined and not pandetermined action so therefore youve set up conflict between two other terminals youve made trouble in life for somebody else so you are going to start adding to the debris and trouble of life with such advice as assert yourself around home you see or something like that turn your attention in the other direction dont think about it learn to sit still and look at your navel and not think these are all advices of the past that i am giving you theyre not just cracks assume the ib position thats one of the plays shakespeare wrote ib ibid im kidding in other wordsdo something that doesnt do anything about the problem at all i was struck by it last night i was looking up thesaurus thats why it came up at this particular point and it seems like the only play he ever wrote so anyway life then could be handled in way of setting it into more violent countermotion against itself you could handle life by setting it into more violent countermotions war for instance is one of the chronic errors that man falls into let us solve the problems of the balkans by going to war see this is to set terminals at other terminals and have you ever noticed the amount of debris which accumulates when this occurs the amount of breakage is fabulous you can still even this late go up around london and you can still see bits of debris which came out of that last big solution see its still there and its still knocked about and thats solving things by setting terminals at terminals or making somebodys attention go off of the subject or so forth now those are the mechanisms by which life handles its problems those are the mechanisms and you as an auditor actually are being asked to decry throw aside and so forth the standard dramatizing solutions that life is prone to see youre askedyoure asked as an auditor to assume better discipline which is more workable discipline in other words lets find out what the problem is what considerations they have had about the problem and what they have done to solve it because these we find are the building blocks of the cage those are the building blocks of the prison the problem itself what they have said the problem was or what has caused it and solutions they have had to what they thought it was those are the building blocks and after they have got through building all these things up they have got pretty big dungeon they have got big dungeon called motherinlaw or big dungeon called government or theyvetheyve got something you see and this thing is built up but that is whatall the cage is built out ofnot built out of another blessed thing somebody had to conceive that there was problem there then had to conceive the problem was something differentwe had to get an alteris of the original problem by the wayhad to conceive the problem was different and then conceive that there were other problems and each time they had concept of what the problem is they would have to solve that in numerous ways before they really have firstclass dungeon thats how one is built you have to sayyou have to say well i have problem at home imim not happy with my home in other words here he is versus the home see he has to say i have this problem oddly enough there doesnt have to be any prior artnothing has to have existed before that point he had to have hadneeded reason because thetan is always capable of postulation and then he had to find justification of some kind or another for this problem to exist so he altered the problem little bit he said its because of my motherinlaw she is the problem well now of course she cant be the problem because she is not two terminals up to this point see she is just one so now he has to then say it was the motherinlaw and then he has to assume that he is against her and that she is causing the difficulty and then he has to go ahead and solve this now of course he already solved home as problem by saying it was caused by his motherinlaw and she was the problem thats the first solution is the announcement of the first problem all right now he has got to solve this situation one way or the other hes got to work at it one way or the other heshe buys her some croquet mallets so she will take up croquet you see and go off and so forth or he does something or another he makes extraordinary actions in life well after while you can count on the fact that although his home is not happy the problem he has set up motherinlaw has been solved into submergence its disappeared from view he longer can annunciate what the problem is but he can annunciate the last solutions that he had to it and he will now find whats wrong with his life is the last solution he had to his motherinlaw that is now the problem see his last solution that he would never go home see its now problem because he can never seem to go home he is now forcing himself to go home but he cant go home you see this is now the problemhis inability to go home hes even forgotten why he started not to go home so now he starts solving this problem he tries to make home more attractive he tries to get himself in trouble outside of home so that he will go home and eventuallyeventually he gets himself messed up with awhat is commonly called an affair see the reason he got himself mixed up in this affair is the girl always said you ought to go home now see and thisso this is nowthis is now the problem it was solution you see but now its problem again so he is starting to solve this sort of thing and he goes off in long concatenation of solutions now this fellow is walking around in circles in life by this time he doesnt know whether he is there or went he knows that he is unhappy it is not just an item unhappiness that causes him to be unhappy he can actually off his own bat be unhappy everything seems to sort of dim down he seems to sort of have his mind on something all the time all the time he seems little abstracted he cant concentrate or he does something or another now that is the prison and he has built it up himself out of some basic and fundamental problem now your art as the auditor is asising not destroying youre asising these bits and pieces that made up this cage and you will find that as you asis them they disappear you are not then adding to this enormous structure which hes already got by giving him new solutions all right now let give you an example here now supposing your pc was totally uneducateda very untutored unlearned pc and youre really trying to fish him out of the soup and to the best of your ability and so forth and you were running what problem have you had in order to get the pc to asis the problems they have had i know you dont run this particular process but lets just say you were see you still can do it you could still get away with it you wont get much tone arm and your pc was inventing new problems to have and you were unaware of this as an auditor and thought the pc was giving you problems the pc had had and in actual fact the pc was giving you new problems that he had never had he is running process called invent new problem and youre runtrying to run process called asis your old problem do you see that now supposing your understanding was deficient to that degreethat you were trying to get him to asisasis bankand you didnt realize that he could very easily be making new bank and supposing you didnt add this up well your pc wouldnt improve that would be the exact penalty right at that point the pc might even be happy with you the pc might even be still talking to you pc this pc that but sooner or later you are going to decide that you are off on the wrong tack somehow or another because this pc doesnt seem to be able to get rid of these phobias and nonsenses what process am i talking about i am just talking about r1c and then we add an m to it it gives you the meter follow the blowdown after you have finished the cycle of action you after while would decide you had better go off on new tack so you go off on new tack and youd run something else touch that wall or something like this see pc isnt going to improve now very minor improvement yeah you decide well i had better do something else so you do something else and you do something else and the pc doesnt improve sooner or later you are going to get mad at the pc and start moving over into the destruction cycle there is nothing calculated to make an auditor more mad with the pc than the pc not improving some pcs understand this very clearly and tell you with great propitiation that they are greatly improved when they are not do youdo you recognize that as little deficiency of understanding of what you are supposed to do supposing the auditor was deficient in that little piece of understanding the auditor isnt trying to knock out anything the auditor happily sits there and lets new things be added to the case well the only reason hed do something else other than watch these little bits get knocked outthe only reason that he would do something else is because he didnt understand he was supposed to knock out these little bits now another deficiency in delivering processing to the pc comes under the heading of not realizing that it is went this probably is the most mystifying thing to the new auditor and he is always hounding pc about the problem that has just gone he becomes completely baffled because he sees debris well his magic consists of asising without debris he has asised this thing the auditor who doesnt know his business doesnt recognize that he is blowing things hes asising things by the simple process of inspection and communication on the part of the pc order from the auditor the pc inspects it pc looks at it says something to the auditor about it and it goes so this fellow is something like trying to make steak dinner out of sliver of bacon see this auditor see he gets this little tiny sliver of bacon on the plate and thats all he can see he is ever going to have on his plate he gets the pc to admit that he has trouble in the office with some of the other people in the office see so hes got that now on the plate thats his sliver of bacon he starts treating it like steak dinner see he is going to process this he has got his timetable all figured out and further well im all set now got the next 75 125 hours of processing all fixed up ill straighten this fellow up with regard to the office see all set see so he says all right now the fellow saysthe pc is sort of all right what now about your difficulties at the office and the pc looks little bit blank for minute oh yes he gets it back again you see he kind of mocks it up once more now about your difficulties at the office who do you detest most at the office detest most at the office i dont detest anybody at the office i just always had sort of withhold i just didnt like to be there you know well yes very good lets make this bacon out of thebeginning to look little bit shriveled here theres something wrong going on well now how do we approach this problem the auditor is saying you see howhow do we attack this problem well hes in the same position of the fellow fencing air the dimensions of the problem were onethousandth of aof nothing by onethousandth of nothing to begin with dont you see and it went phfffft and that was the end of that now you could train an auditor if pc uniformly always cognited but on these little things there isnt enough horsepower in them to generate good cognition see so hethe pc would say oh i just realized i didnt like the boss gee i feel much better now the auditor would say oh well we dont have to have that steak dinner here we are all set see unfortunately all auditing is made out of these little slivers of bacon see and the auditor that really has tough time is trying to get piece of steak on the plate every time he has just got this bit of grease because its always blowing see its always blowing its insubstantial the pc is sitting there and he gives him all this long song and dance about something or other and the auditor takes it all down and figures it all out and then says we now have the design of the situation and we know now what we are going to attack on the case and its blown the new auditor probably has tremendous embarrassment of never really realizing what auditing is for why all these trs and these drills and why this adherence to comm cycle why all this sort of thing he never adds that in to any of this other of course theyre there to bring about the asis you ask question youre really saying heres something well see if you can asis it the pc says ooh oh yeapwhamfwhamfwhamfwhamf all right and the auditor is saying all right its asised see now thats actually what this auditing comm cycle is all about but people dont easily add that up to the other situation they dont recognize what auditing is all about because it looks very verymust be very complicatedit has made this fellow terribly sick for years it has made him sick unhappy miserable made him complete dope social pariah for all these years and at the end of thirtyfive minutes or something like thatobviously something like this should take long time you see at the end of thirtyfive minutes it might havebeit might just have blown up but if the auditor had estimated that it was long serious problem the auditor can keep chipping away at it for the next twenty hours of course he is making progress at all on the case because he is making the pc pull back things that have went he doesnt recognize the ease with which this basic auditing comm cycle can actually blow something so youre always having him ask about things that have blown quite common now an auditor gets so fixated this is the other side of the coin on having them all blow easily that once in while he runs into brick wall of it didnt and its just like stepping for the step you see you know youre at the bottom of the stairs and you try to go down one more step and it is with terrible shock that you hit the landing with your foot you see misestimation you know oh we figured this all out and we got it all out and we ran all this thing all out and uhhheeii still worried about it what happened well what happened there is that you happenedyou see all these little symptoms of existence can fall into two categories those that are floating loose and fancy free and those that have got roots so the pcs upsets and phobias are not always rooted unlike freudian assumptions you do not have to assume that the reason he is fond of eating with his spoon rather than his forkyou do not have to assume that this grows roots clear to the center of the earth you dont have to assume that at all those roots might go deeper you see than slight personal preference based on an idiosyncrasy he made up his mind with in the army see thats just nothing see doesnt have any depth theres depth there its like trying to jump into oneinchdeep swimming pool see and you try to go any deeper than that and you are in for an awful thud because there is nothing deeper see so you might say that it isnt any precise percentage but large percentage of these things that worry people have roots they arent deeply rooted in the ubconscious reconscious you understand theyrejust dont go down to the center of the earth and then there are few subjects and items the display of which in this lifetime is just little flag its just little flag and boy you pick up this little flag you think well it is justjust like everything else and you all of sudden pick up this little flag you know you thought you were catching minnows you know and boy you got whale on the other end of it and hes anchored right to the bottom of the ocean you move that flag and it is you that moved not the flag it is little telltale this thing goes clear to china see we dont know what happened here every once in while an auditor will hit one of these things which is simply symptom of some very very fundamental deeplying mass and significance in the case and of course it just doesnt shake this is about the only thing that ever gets in the road of clearing you go along the line pocketapocketapocketa everythings fine trada tada tada trada trada trada trada trada all of sudden why youre going to get rid of his lumbosis too see and ill show you exactly where you make the mistake you take something which has needle reaction or ta blowdown but which is obvious and visiblebut which doesnt respond on the meterand all these little flags bear that characteristic now your lumbosis now and that is just one smooth uninterrupted rise your lumbosis now has that gotten worse or better in the last few weeks just one long uninterrupted rise there is not the least quiver on that needle on the subject of lumbosis and there is not the least blowdown on the part of that tone arm and all the pc tells youhe has lumbosis and he knows he has lumbosis and he could discuss lumbosis for quite some time your ta just sits there and does absolutely nothing and your needle does not respond in any way shape or form its an obvious manifestation the guy does have lumbosis see this is obvious and it does not respond on the meter therefore it goes all the way to china and the more you talk about it the more trouble you are going to get into because if you force the pc into recognition of the reality of that conditionyou pin him instantly and at once to his most fundamental bank just like that its very very interesting you could take somebody who has manifestation about it he is nothis wife is going to leave him tomorrow you cant get him interested in the subject you see the auditor in each one of these cases where the auditor picks up this flag that goes all the way to chinaits going to be the auditor who recognizes it its going to be the auditor who puts in time on it its going to be the auditor who tries to force forward the reality of the situation on the pc its the auditor who is doing it its the auditor who is perceiving it the auditor who is doing it and it is not cooperated with by the pc except to the extent that the pc will answer the auditors questions in other words youve got an unreal subject fellow walks infellow walks in and hes got papiermâché head you know you dont say how are you mr jones how are you feeling today whats on your mind what you worried about today or something you would have to make this kind of goof hey were going to audit this papiermâché head see now if that papiermâché head had rise or fall speeded rise speeded fall rrs drops ta blowdownsnothing with relationship to it yes thats wrong with him but it goes all the way to china you are dealing with something there which is below any ability this pc has to perceive you can see it he cant he probably looks in the miin the mirror every morning and sees regular head you have to evaluate the importance of the thing for the pc you have to force the thing into existence and by the time you have done that you can actually push case all around and mess it all up and you can bog the case down so that it wont get tone arm action youre not giving him anything he can asis so he isnt going to have any victories you are giving him something that is totally unreal to him why is it totally unreal well its just too deep too fundamental too far gone itshes not about to have any recognition of it the main danger there is the auditor deciding what is wrong with the pc and then auditing it that is the main now if youif the auditor decides what is wrong with the pc and then audits it it very well may be what is wrong with the pc it may sometimes be that the auditor can change this with the pc that can happen too see once in blue moon but the pc will never find out about it and will be rather resentful and you wont have asised any cage the only cage the pc can asis is the one hes aware of he cant asis any other cage and youre dependent upon the ability of the pc to asis now if youre dependent on the pcs ability to asis then you had better depend on auditing what the pc can asis elementary now you can force the pc into all sorts of wild oddball physical manifestations this way i can just see lines of people walking into the psychoanalytic laboratories without limps and walking out on crutches i can just see lines of them doing it because they specialize in this they arrive at this through testing this is why we dont put very much pressure on testing its whywe could learn lot from testing but we dont really bother to you understand this is where testing deadends you can read deeper into the psyche than the pc can asis thats something to remember when you come up against tests so therefore little light shallow tests are far better than deep deep fundamental tests there might even be something to rorschach see there might even be something to it rather than the oldit actually started as kids game you know its the kids inkblot game you spill some ink on piece of paper and fold it together and display it out and ask the other kid what it is you see its kindergarten game and everybody got very fundamental and they found out that you could read various deep and connotationsand you found outthey found out that various psychologically disoriented psychodrams would occur in these things see and they coordinated it up empirically against tremendous number of neurotic and insane persons and they found out theres some coordinations in this then they could lay out one of these rorschachs in front of people and get the persons reaction to it and then they could evaluate the test and they could say this is what is wrong with you now look how that operates with the one i am just talking about the guy very often sits there and says thats what is wrong with it is beyond his ability to asis what you have done is restimulate him without any hope of destimulating it youin other words you could force him to assume the characteristics and dimensions of this neurosis or psychosis that operation could be put under the heading this is how to be nuts taught cheap see meter has only this valuethat it is at the level of reality of the pc if it reads on the meter it has the potential of being real to the preclear if it does not read on the meter either it is totally suppressed or its unreal to the pc thats the end and short of it therefore this meter is rather beautiful to that regard in that it can sort out things that the pc can find are real to him we takewe take meter lets take an assessment level operation at level iv we say on this meter we say grandma mother wife aunt and so forth flincka little tick there and so forth now if we want to be real swami gambola you see with the complete turban and the woolworth ruby all we would have to do is say we find that the realest person in your family was your aunt hed say oh true true true see that coordinates instantly and at once you see you hadyou had certain interpersonal relations with your aunt oh yes yes she used to talk to all the time and so forth you understand thats assessment for reality see you just name off his family members one of them falls you just say thats the realest person to you doesnt matter whether theyre the maddest at him see or what the interpersonal relationship is between him and this person we know his mind is on that person and we know that he can have reality on that person therefore we know what he can asis about his family he can asis sections relating to that person and by the time he has got unpinned off of that we could say the whole family over to him again and this time it would be grandmama and suddenly and mysteriously we would have lot of things of reality about grandmama and he all of sudden can asis those and we say all over to him again all the family names and now we have papa ah great because he now can asis something about papa who he dramatizes all the time but supposing we had gone about it this way much more intricately now you fill out this paper of your characteristics of the ideal person the ideal villain thewhatwhat novels you read most what type of tobacco you have now here is another piece of paper what are the types of tobacco and the reading habits of each family member and so forth and you say well youreyoure actually dramatizing your father hed say this is disasterhorrible and he would go off all beaten down see and develop all of papas ills see its just on this little simple trick of what can you do with pc well you can do with pc what is real to the pc you can asis in pc what the pc has reality on and having asised it you have little more cage taken apart so he can see little bit further so you can find something new for him to have reality on and you can asis that and its just progressive line of taking down the cage but you try to take down the moat while he is still in the deepest dungeon he could very easily drown without even coming near the moat dont you see i am suffering asphyxiation and i dont know why well you are taking down the moat well go on you know all about the moat yes yes the moats green scummy water and so forth now get the idea of beingdrowning in green scummy water and dont blame if you find your pc sitting there stonedead in the chair and the diagnosis is that he drowned this is what is known as running somebodywe have lot of little careless phrases that go by describes thisrunning somebody above their level of reality these are usually very glib but they have tremendous fundamental truth back of all these things therefore the auditor who sits there and audits pc in some other frame of reference than the pcbeing able to recognize where the pc is and audit him on things the pc can have reality onthe auditor who audits that way wins the auditor who doesnt audit that way loses thats the magic of auditing thats the magical trick now you could do almost anything with pcalmost anythingif you know these little things you see i dont care what process you are running processes are important because they tell you how to get to these points of reality now everybody unless he is stonedead and long gone everybody has some reality on some level of some level of r some level of c so we find processes which are based on r and c interpret with the wildest variability with the pc but yet hit some level of recognizability in the pc you say who do you like oh ii like joe now what does he mean when he said he liked joe the semantics of the situation are is he is fond of joe but he isnt answering that way at all little bit later he is telling you he is really apathetic about joe he keeps reinterpreting what his emotional reactions are on the line quite interesting what is real in this room is probably one of the most nebulous questions ever asked the auditor doesnt recognize it as nebulous question the pc walks overall the performancesthe question seems direct all the performances seem very directthe pc walks over and he picks up that wire over there that white wire and he says that is very very very real i dont know what he means but it means that he can recognize white wire i dont know what he means i dont even know what he means when he says he can recognize it but it means thatto for the benefit of just the process itselfthat he can see it recognize it and direct his attention to it great that is all i am asking i dont care what else he means it is nothing to see look around here and find something that is really real to you oh its an interesting question what goes on in the pcs head when he answers that question wow now beware of the pc when you are running processes like that who just glibly ticks off everything and you know he is in bad state but he can just tick off everything what is really real to well the carpet is really real to the roof is really real to and the beams are really real to and the walls are really real to and the windows are really real to and everything is really real to wha rrrrrrrammmmmmmm everythings all really real to and everythings all id conclude about that time that i was several stratospheres above where i ought to be running because one of two things will happen either his havingness will increase and hell be getting tone arm actionhell be getting quite bit of tone arm action if heif hes that good on reality why just the fact that he is shifting his eyeballs and looking around and getting havingness and so forth is going to shift his tone arm around you see this guy must be whizbang see he is going to get tone arm action he is going to get needle reaction yes its real see needle action bit of tone arm action tells him yes thats true the carpet is really real to him the beams are really real to him the walls are really its reacting here on the tone arm see on the needle see thats true but the case that always got the auditor in trouble was the person who had 8c completely flat run it off mile minute and never from the time they started it on would they ever get twitch or flick on that unless it was caused by body motion they suddenly jump up in the chair and sit down again and you see the needle move see but the action of running these things off you know talking about this or that one produced reaction on the meter and produced tone arm reaction wonder they could be so glib theyre going through some kind of circuitry response theyre not there they have been educated into naming of objects in areas or something and they dont have anything to do with it and they can just you knowhas nothing to do with themtoodoo toodoo tootoodoo not even in the universetadatadatadatada nothing worries im perfectly free as bird sitting down in the middle of this rock and they havent any recognition of location or position or anything else theyre disoriented and youll find out great many insane peoplenot describingthis case i just described to you is not even an insane person not even neurotic youll find lot of people are in that condition though theyre pretty badpretty bad off you find out they have lot of psychosomatic ills which they dont know they have they have headache all the time as youre auditing the case you suddenly quote turn on somatic hell you never turned on the somatic you turned on the awareness of the existing somatic the person is now aware that their head aches if they thought of it little while their headache really ached yesterday and the day before and its been aching for long time but they are up to an awareness of the fact they had headache all kinds of awareness shifts take place here and you get reactions very often which are not the same as they are advertised you pull mass in on pc one way or the other and he gets headache see all right the auditing brought in headache and the auditing will move the headache on out again eventually unless its some upsidedown process like what problem could you solve thank you what problem could you solve thank you you know thats one of the most remarkable processes that led us into r1c its many years old and if you ask pc thatif you ask pc that question what problem could you solve what problem could you solve what problem could you solve what problem could you solve you can very often see mass moving in on him what problem could you solve and this is closer what problem could you solve see and he answers and againand its closer this is very amusing because you can turn this thing around and head it out the other direction you just say think of problem think of problem think of problem think of problem think of problem and it has gone over the hill and far now you could turn around and say what problem could you solve and it turns right back its quite an amusing exercise in masses if pc can perceive masses he can watch this happen so when you are looking at pc and processing pc see the pc in regard to what the pc can see not what you can see but learn to look at pc from the point of view of what the pc can see dont then bother to limit your own vision see but recognize that there may be difference here pc can see something and you can see something else actually it would be perfectly factual because youre in two different locations and space is viewpoint of dimensionyou would of course see different things but the point is is the pc can asis what is real to the pc or what he can see what he can know what he can perceive what he can cotton on to and actually he cant do any more than that now after he has perceived something unless it is one of these deeprooted things the chances are its gone and the auditor is very stupid indeed if he thinks he has got to go on auditing it after it went because the pc will get very upset because you are now auditing nothing and pc will get very upset about this after while what about dogs what about dogs what about dogs what about dogs and finally the pc said yep yep dogs yeah dogs dogs been terrified of dogs see something like that he told you you know he is afraid of dogs well what about dogs what about dogs what about dogs what about dogs what about dogs i dont care its just process seeoff the bat see what about dogs what about dogs what about dogs see all right and he eventually looks at you and sort ofyeah he said well thats the point what about dogs now unless the auditor can perceive that he has now changed the pcs point of view with relationship to dogs by the process of asising the pcs fears and solutions to dogsasised the pcs reaction to dogsunless the auditor can also perceive that the pc has changed in other wordsthen the auditor will go on trying to audit out what he has audited out and he can park case the auditors ability to estimate then what he has asised is part and parcel to the creation of an effect on pc you have got to know what you have taken care of and therefore you have to know how it is taken care of it is taken care of by being perceived and asised and that is the only way it is taken care ofperceived and asised you ask the pc to look at something you know he can look at he looks at it and he asises it and thats the end product of auditing i dont care whether youre doing class vi or class ithe action is the same and that is how auditing works and that is the effect which the auditor creates on the pc and thats how he creates the effect on the pc thats the only way he does an auditor that doesnt know how auditing works and doesnt know why auditing works will commit several other sins amongst them is to address subjects that are not real to the pc another one is to run what has been run out another one is tonot to flatten what he has begun to asis these are the various crimes that the auditor can omitcan commit with his comm cycle so in the final analysis an auditor who knows how auditing works and why auditing works never really gets in much of bind he never gets into much of an upset i myself have had some gorgeous crashes on this particular line as one would have with magnitude in research work you work itbecause in this case you are always evaluating what is wrong with the case from the viewpoint of research so that you can add up the principles involved dont you see so youre always looking for this sort of thing so youre always wishing off on cases something that is wrong with them in order to find out if it is and i learned this the hard way very very early but i neveri never wouldwouldi am perfectly willing to give up theory theory to is not very valuable i can invent lots of theories see in most fields of science theory is so precious that it has to be set in jewels and gems and all ones work is involvedis in setting up theory and having set up this theory all the rest of the work is put in on asserting that it is right see there isnt any further action taken with the theory than those things that is quite common in the field of science and research always gone on the basis theres always lots of theories if this one doesnt work theres always another one nevertheless every once in while you still will get favorite theory youll get something that is very favored you see and you go down the line and you say there are this number of potentials with regard to this case and so forth and you say isnt that nice one you know isnt that particular onenumber 3 thereisnt that nice you say that would be real real cute you see if that is the right one you know so you start processing the pc and you favor number 3 you see you weight number 3 heavily the pc just sits there looking blankly at you you know his eyes sort of cloudy and so forth you feel like saying to him hey isnt this wonderful theory i mean you knowwhatwhatswhatwhats added up there aboutabout what ive cognited for you onon your difficulty with spinach you see andandand so forth and then hey hey you know isnt that wewonderful sits there his eyes cloudier and all of sudden he says you know that second one that you mentioned there he says thatthat makes some sensewith little change that makes some sense the second one hell you didnt care anything about the second one see he goes on and embroiders number 2 and then all of sudden you arrive at number 4 which is the correct one dont you see that he can asis and has got good reality on oh yeah thats it you know and it always leaves bad taste in your mouth see he got well on the wrong process awful upsetting so i know what youre up against you alwaysyou always will have these interesting theories for heavens sakes dont stop having them i know whats wrong with that guy and so on remember it isnt your brightness that is held in question its the pcs perceptive abilities and the pcit isnt real to the pc something else is real to the pc about this sort of thing well dont try then to get the pc to asis your concept of it because that isnt there to be asised what is there to be asised is his concept of it and he also may have much shallower concept and sometimes surprise you by having much deeper concept of reality than is being granted by the auditor so its within these variabilities that you can bring case out of the soup and so forth the odd part of it is the world is artificially and the universe is artificially divided into the constructive and the destructive when you get way up topside there is only the free and youve actually escaped these two things you can see that itwith an individual the most constructive action that you can take with the individual would be to bring the individual into an ability himself to create and handle his own problems and situations see that is an ultimate now that of course takes care of the other factor because what would be the ultimate in destruction would be the disappearance of the traps and pitfalls that lay in his path so youre actually not when you come right down to it doing onesided job it only appears you are you go off into this other destructive action toward pc only when he appears not to asis properly to suit you see and that swings you down from your olympian height of being able to cover all sides of action you see the ultimate in destruction of course is thewhew gone you see and the ultimate in construction when you are dealing with human being and when you are dealing with person or spirit and so forth is to bring it about so you say phew and the individual himself can create those are very olympian actions i assure you and when you lose on those things through your lack of understanding or bad luck or any other reason why you tend to drop down into the artificial segmentation of life into constructive sphere and the 50 percent destructive sphere and you start slapping back at the pc and you start creating men out of clay and you start doing all kinds of wild things and just recognize that when you are reacting reactively to the pc that you have dropped down from an ideal auditing action and have stepped into nice fat dramatization on your own part just get yourself by the scruff of the neck and say hey i must have slipped because i am dramatizing and you will bring yourself right back up scale again auditing in its most fundamental approach is basically simple because it evades by undermining all the complexities of life you are not now trying to dream up solution comparable to the problems this bloke has got thats true about life but its not true about auditing you are pulling the rug out from underneath his problems because youve got the answer to why they become problems in the first place you know how he got into the cage like you take ayou take an old smoothie on sec checking and he can go back down the line pocketapocketapocketa find the original overt take that thing apart and the whole chain just goes brrrrrzzzzzzz and the most complicated set of problems that you ever heard of just blow right off on that particular subject he just fishes out and so forth sometimes the reverse will be found he imagined he had problem which he didnt have or imagined he had an overt which he didnt have or something that can be uncovered too but youre pulling the string which unties the sugar sack and thats rather interesting otherwise it would be so complex that nobody could ever have anything to do with it you could never do anything with it auditing would have to be as complicated as life if auditing were solution to life and fortunately it isnt solution to life its an asisness of the less desirable parts of existence now all you have to do is know this one approach of what you are trying to deliver to the pc and you will be able to pull it off every time rather simply thank you
