for the army pr program and is consistent with federal statute dod and army policy it targets commanders and staffs at primarily the brigade through corps levels and provides them with single reference that articulates the army philosophy and policy towards pr the cornerstone of that phil osophy is leadership and personnel accountability and the core beliefs that mand we expend every possibl effort to recover and return all us military dod civilians and dod contractor personnel or other personnel as determined by the secretary of defense who are isolated missing detained or captured imdc in an operational envi ronment the manual focuses on task organization command relati onships planning considerations and execution tasks for army pr operations as well as how the army pr system fits into the join t pr system in order to support combatant commander pr requirements it presents stable body of operational doctrin rooted in actual military experience and demonstrates the integration of pr into xisting command and control systems across the three principal echelons of command the manual is composed of six chapters that include an introductory chapter that provides broad overview of pr and five chapters that detail pr operations in cluding command and control planning preparation execution and assessment the remainder of the manua l includes an additional six appendixes civil sar service capabilities checklists pr equipment pr in mdmp matrix rep orts and formats that provide consolidated pr focused information checklists and matrices in one location the key theme in this manual is to understand that pr is longer solely relegate d to air dedicated force or sof centric operation every soldier and every sensor on the battlefi eld is woven into seamless system as part of our everyday operations that enables the immediate recovery of any imdc person the four pr methods immediate deliberate and external support re quired esr and unassisted and the five

fallen comrade general peter j schoomaker chie f of staff united states army definitions 11 before we can address personnel recovery pr at large we must understand the answers to two important questions what is pr and who are isolated personnel 12 personnel recovery is defined di fferently in several documents the most current definition is contained in chairman of the joint chiefs of st aff instruction cjcsi 327001a which defines personnel recovery as the sum of military diplomatic and civil efforts t effect the recovery and return of us military dod civilians and dod contract or personnel who are isolated or missing while participating in us governmentsanctioned military ac tivity or missions in an uncertain or hostile environment or as determined by the secretary of defense also called pr 13 cjcsi 327001a further defines isolated personnel as us military dod civilians or dod contractor personnel or other pers onnel designated by the president or secretary of defense who have become separated from their unit or organization in an uncertain r hostile environment or denied area requiring them to survive evade or escape 14 the army defines personnel recovery as the sum of military diploma tic and civil efforts to effect the recovery and return of us military dod civilia ns and dod contractor pers onnel or other personnel as determined by the secretary of defense who are isolated missing detained or captured imdc in an operational environment also called pr 15 the expanse of this definition cues us to consider variety of possibilities available to recover isolated personnel by referring to milita ry civil and diplomatic options fo r recovery it so broadens our historical view of personnel who ma become isolated missing detain ed or captured on the battlefield individuals not specifically addressed within this definition may be included in our pr responsibilities at the direction of the secretary of defense secdef this expands army pr responsibilities considerably as multinational partners american civilians and citizens fro m other nations in our operational areas now become potential recovery obligations for the army as an example in november 2001 army forces conducted the recovery of religious missionaries heather mercer and dayna curry who had been imprisoned by the taliban in afghanistan 16 imdc personnel are defined as us military dod civilians or dod contractor personnel or other personnel as designated by the president or the secretary of defense who are beyond the positive or procedural control of their unit in an operational environment requiring them to survive evade resist or escape sere personnel who are isolated missing detained or captured imdc will be collectively referred to as imdc personnel contents definiti ons 11 army personnel recovery philosophy 12 command and cont rol 12 the army personnel recovery system 12 personnel recovery options 14 conclusi on 15 10 august 2005 fm 3501 11 chapter 1 17 readily evident from this definition is the fact that we are not just concerned with the recovery of soldiers it is every units task to have procedures in place to be ready to recover our own personnel whether soldier civilian or contractor examples of imdc personnel include ｺ individuals who are unaccounted for as result of break in contact eg while on patrol or during convoy operation or during routine 100 personnel and accountability check ｺ hostages ｺ prisoners of war pow ｺ individuals illegally detained by foreign governments ｺ crew of an aircraft experiencing mishap or shoot down army personnel recovery philosophy 18 the armys pr philosophy is one of leadersh ip and accountability it comprises primarily the soldiers creed directed responsibilities and practical considerations 19 the soldiers creed is major portion of our pr philosophy by neve r accepting defeat never quitting and never leaving fallen comrade behind we ensure that imdc personnel benefit from core beliefs that demand we expend every possible effort to recover them should they become imdc on the battlefield 110 the armys directed pr responsibilities stem from t itle x united states code usc directives and instructions issued by the ffice of the secretary of defense sd and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs policy issued by headquart ers department of the army hqda and joint pr doctrine 111 by creating robust welltrained and properly quipped force capable of conducting pr we ensure that our adversaries are denied the ability to explo it imdc personnel for purposes detrimental to the united states government or us military forces an effective pr capability als increases force morale by demonstrating that we will employ every effo rt possible to recove r our imdc personnel command and control 112 the key to effective pr is synchronized comma nd and control c2 preestablished and well rehearsed c2 procedures are essential to the recove ry of imdc personnel the integration of personnel recovery into established c2 systems is discussed in chapter 2 the army personnel recovery system 113 the pr system is collection of architecture and activities des igned to effect recovery of imdc personnel and allow pr to adapt to future changes on the battlefield the army pr system dovetails with the army operations process although presented in the sequential order of planning preparation execution and assessment it is important to understand that these activities can ccur simultaneously or in any sequence the army pr system like the army op erations process is iterative and the individual activities are interdependent change occurring in one p ortion can affect what is happening in the other three planning 114 pr planning includes the collectiv efforts of commanders and staffs forces and individuals to integrate and employ army pr capabilities for maximum effectivene ss during operations the integration of pr into established planning processes is discussed in chapter 3 preparation 115 pr preparation encompasses the activities of developing guid ance for providing appropriate equipment to and the education and training of comma nders staffs forces and potential imdc personnel fm 3501 10 august 2005 12 overview pr preparation occurs throughout the mobilizati on deployment employme nt sustainment and redeployment activities of operations see fm 30 the integra tion of pr into established preparation activities is discussed in chapter 4 execution 116 the execution portion of the pr system is comprised of the five pr execution tasks report locate support recover and reintegrate these tasks are central to any pr mission and must be accomplished the integration of pr execution tasks into ongoing ope rations is illustrated in figure 11 and discussed further in chapter 5 pr integration into the operations process cdr staff units potential imdc personnel individualcollective exerciserehearse pr task organization crossstaff coordination pr

task includes the recognition proper notification and validation that personnel have or may have become imdc reports can be generated by an accountability mechan ism visual sightings intelligence surveillance and r econnaissance operations or communi cations with an imdc person reporting the event 118 the locate task includes actions taken to precisely find imdc personnel location efforts using all necessary means begin with the initial report and continue unti l recovery of the imdc person 119 the support task includes actions taken to mentally physically and emotionally s ustain imdc personnel and their families throughout the five tasks support to imdc personnel includes establishing communications conducting re supply maintaining their morale nd protecting them support to families 10 august 2005 fm 3501 13 chapter 1 includes preparing them for potential media interaction and providing other support to reduce their anxi ety and possible frustration during recovery activities 120 the recover task includes the employment of forces to regain posi tive and procedural control of imdc personnel and does not end until the imdc personnel are hande d over by the recovery element to medical personnel for reintegration 121 the reintegrate task includes immediate medical assessment and appropriate debrie fings before returning recovered personnel back to duty and their family the task ends when the individual is returned to duty and requires further care relating to the imdc event assessment 122 assessment of actions taken during the planning preparation and execution of pr missions is vit if we are to successfully adapt to changes while presented as th last major portion of the pr system assessment is continuous process and occurs throughout the system pr assessment is di scussed in chapter 6 personnel recovery options 123 pr options are not intended to provide prescriptive set of rules for conducting pr missions ra ther they provide context from which to plan prepare execute and assess army pr by providing description of the various ways pr mission can be executed these options are introduc ed here and discussed in more detail throughout the fm 124 the united states government usg has three options available for recovery of imdc personnel military diplomatic and civil lthough discussed separately for illust rative purposes it is important to know that these options are often combined during single recovery mission military 125 the army uses four principal methods when pla nning and executing military recoveries immediate deliberate external supported and unassisted 126 immediate recovery is the sum of actions conducte d to locate and recover imdc personnel by forces directly observing the isolating event or through the reporting process determining that imdc personnel are close enough for them to conduct rapid recovery immediate recovery assumes that the ta ctical situation permits recovery with the forces at hand without detailed planning or coordination 127 deliberate recovery is the sum of actions conducted by army forces when an incident is reported and an immediate recovery is not feasible or was not successful weather enemy act ions imdc personnel location and recovery force capabilities are examples of factors that may require the detailed planning and coordination of deliberate recovery 128 external supported recovery esr is the sum of actions conducted when immediate or deliberat recovery is not feasible or was not successful esr is either the support provided by the army t other joint task force jtf components interagency or ganizations or multinational forces or the support provided by these entities to the army close ai r support cas intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr and airborne command and control are exampl of capabilities that may be required from different components to execute an esr 129 unassisted recovery comprises actions taken by imdc personnel to achieve their own recovery without outside assistance an unassisted recovery ty pically involves an evasion effort by imdc personnel in order to get back to friendly forces or to point where they can be recovered via another method while the code of conduct requires imdc personnel to make every effort to evade or escape commanders must strive to recover these personnel via one or combination of the other methods fm 3501 10 august 2005 14 overview diplomatic 130 this option may involve direct negotiations be tween the usg and other governments that have detained us personnel examples of employing the diplomatic pr option are the recoverie s of francis gary powers from the soviet union in 1962 and of the ep3 crew from hainan island in 2001 as we were not in state of declared hostilities w ith either the soviet union or th peoples republic of china at the time of these incidents employing military recoveries could hav been construed as hostile act and further exacerbated already tense and public situations 131 diplomatic recoveries can also occur as result of armistice or treaty agreements over 4000 pows were returned after the korean war armis tice brought the warring parties to ceasefire civil 132 in situations where diplomatic or military recove ry options may not be feasible or acceptable by themselves civil recovery option may prove usef ul international or nongovernmental ngo may be able to assist in the recovery of imdc personnel in th situations careful consideration must be given to this option as many of these organizations are limited b their charters andor international law as to the type of assistance they may provide or actions they may perform 133 in areas of the world where human itarian crisis has preceded the n eed for us military intervention international and nongovernmental orga nizations may have an established presence because of the nature of services these organizations provide they typically establish relationships with the local populations and have considerable influence in the international community 134 in the event personnel become imdc where intern ational organizations and ngo are established these organizations may be in unique position to provide critical information regarding an isolating event the organization may even find itself in possession of formerly imdc p erson military commanders must consider the presence of these organizations in military perational areas when planning and executing operations examples of such organizations are the international red cross and r ed crescent movement the american red cross and medicins sans frontieres msf also known as d octors without borders influential private citizens 135 in certain circumstances an influential private citizen may be able to recover imd c personnel in certain situations recoveries of this nature ccurred from syria in 1984 and during the vietnam war conclusion 136 the ability of the army to meet its pr responsib ilities hinges on leaders at every level preparing for the recovery of imdc personnel as surely as we feel the moral obligation to make every effort to prevent an isolating event and ultimately recover 100 of our personnel pr responsibilities are also based on public law dod directives and instructions and us army policy pr must be integrate d into ongoing planning preparation and execution activities and comman ders must consider broad range of possible options for successful execution 10 august 2005 fm 3501 15 this page intentionally left blank chapter 2 pr command and control the key to effective pr is synchronized command and control c2 preestablished and wellrehearsed c2 procedures are essential to the recovery of imdc personnel commanders and staffs should not create separate c2 system for pr missions instead commanders and staffs must integrate pr planning preparation execution and assessment into the existing command and control system at all echelons from the joint force commander to the indivi dual company commander on the battlefield we will use the term joint to include interagency and multinational forces s well while this is an army manual joint pr concepts are included to facilitate understanding until joint publica tion jp 350 is published pr missions require the collection processing storing displaying and dissemination of relevant information ri to develop situational understanding the collaborative efforts of individual staff members provide pr relevant information to assist the commander in gaining situational understa nding situational understanding enables commander to make effective and timely decisions and transmit them through his or her c2 system to direct rapid and effective recovery missions the composition and disposition of enemy forces weather conditions capabilities of recovery forces and the medical condition of imdc personnel are examples of pr relevant information required to gain situationa l understanding for pr missions this chapter discusses the integration of pr into existing command and control systems beginning with commanders pr responsibilities at different echelons of command concepts of c2 commander and staff responsibilities and concepts of monitoring and control of pr missions are also included echelons of command 21 we will consider three principal echelons of command

while decentralized execution is applicable to many pr missions there are situations where centralized command approach may be appropriate as an example this approach may be appropria when imdc personnel are in country that is ne utral to an ongoing conflict subordinate commanders may not have sufficient information to evaluate th impact of conducting recovery on the operation at large when facing these conditi ons other examples include ｺ missions requiring the assets of several components esr missions ｺ missions requiring interagency support ｺ missions taking place in the ar eas

clear ly defined command and support re lationships reduce confusion identify decision makers and facilitate unity of command when conducting pr operations they also describe the boundaries within whic h subordinate commanders may exer cise disciplined initiative when unanticipated opportunities to achieve the commanders pr in tent present themselves 211 when interagency and multinational forces are i nvolved in operations dir ect command relationships between army commanders and these forces may not be possible mili tary command relationships such as operational control opcon tactical control tacon and the various support relationships are often interpreted differently by interagency and multinational partners in t hese situations commanders and staffs establish cooperative relations hips through coordination with these organizations in order to achieve unity of effort when conducting pr missions 212 remember that imdc personnel can be contr actors or da civilians army commanders are responsible for integrating supporting and protecti ng these personnel as well army commanders exercise control over contract employees in accordance with the terms stated in the

delegate the authority to make pr execution decisions to the lowe st possible echelon subordinate commanders with the cap ability to gain and maintain s ituational understanding about pr mission within their ao should have the authority to execute that mission if they have forces capable of conducting the recovery factors to consider when delegating pr authority include the subordinate commanders pr capable forces and their ability to coordinate and conduc t recovery missions within their ao without adversely affecting the overall commanders intent and concept of operations figure

hone pr skills fm 3501 10 august 2005 410 chapter 5 pr execution general pr execution principles 51 during execution there is one overriding goal to employ sufficient combat power to return imdc personnel to safety all the elements of the pr architecture must work together t that end commanders staffs units and imdc personnel function as team during pr execution general execution principles include ｺ identifying the nature of the imdc event and designing workable solution ｺ monitoring the cop and recognizing significant elements of an imdc event ｺ using established and rehearse d processes and procedures ｺ using all available resources to collect and disseminate imdc event information ｺ effective coordination throughout the pr architecture ｺ employing the recovery method and units appropriate to the event report 52 timely delivery of imdc reports to the pr cell is crucial for success ful recoveries reports from the initial person or agency that becomes aware of an imdc event must be passed to the pr cell directly and quickly it is all too easy for an imdc report to flow into parallel staff or subordinate unit channel and never get passed to the operations channel potential method for preventing this from happening is including imdc events in the ccir 53 reports with missing data incorrect call signs in accurate positions or incorrect imdc identities all seriously hamper recovery efforts report data must be consis tent complete accurate and delivered shortly after initial awareness of an imdc event by any party comman ders staff members units and individuals must all have the means to transmit nd receive pr reports duri ng the report phase of pr execution the following actions occur ｺ transmit the report of an imdc event ｺ receive the report ｺ validate the report by crossqueuing multiple sources ｺ record imdc event information ｺ disseminate event information to all concerned ｺ establish communications with imdc personnel if possible ｺ request support as required ｺ start the pr incident folder ｺ alert units transmit the report 54 commanders staffs pr cells recovery forces and units in the field cannot react to an imdc event if they

mission 55 initial communications of actual suspected or potential imdc vents are often transmitted on the frequency being used to control th ongoing operation versus dedicated pr frequency pr cells should have the capability to monitor the primary operations frequency for ind ications of imdc events gathering the information directly from the initiating source saves time and reduces confusion by skipping the normal intermediate reporting stations and going directly to the pr cell 56 precious planning preparation and execution time is lost when an incident goes unreported or when the initial report is stuck in nonoperations channels the difficulty lies in surmounting the sometimes many communication obstacles between imdc personnel units observing an imdc event and the pr cell information about an imdc event must be transmitted via the most direct means to the pr cell so they can begin coordinating response 57 even if an immediate recovery mission is mounted by forces in the area the report must still be passed to the pr cell so they can monitor the progress of the immediate recove ry attempt and begin coordinating support also the pr cell can begin coordi nating deliberateexternal supported effort in the event immediate recovery is not possible 58 reports can come via variety of methods on scene observations lost unit accountability beacon transmissions on frequencies 2430 and 406 mhz or radio transmissions from imdc personnel are all methods of transmitting reports of imdc events pr ce lls must be prepared to receive imdc reports via any of these methods 59 reports of an imdc event have priority over routine communicati ons anyone receiving information about an imdc event mu st immediately cease routine transm issions which may interfere with the report and monitor the communications channel being used for the call 510 the ability of pr cell to respond to an imdc ev ent depends largely on the information it receives in the initial report since the initial report may not come to th pr cell directly from the imdc person the intermediate reporting entity onscene observer aircraft that heard it it with lost accountability performs pivotal role in the pr reporting process pr cells depend on these reporting middlem to provide accurate timely information about the event if the pr cell does not receive the initial report it must be retransmitted immediately to them the initial report cannot stay in personnel reporting intelligence or subordinate unit channe ls it must get to the pr cell c onversely if the report goes directly to the pr cell it must be retransmitted throughout the pr archit ecture once validated receive the report 511 reports may come from many sources figure 51 depicts possible sources of reporting information about single imdc event the critical skill of the pr cell is identifying that these separate reports may all apply to single incident 512 imdc reports have precedence over routine communi cation traffic on operati ons nets as soon as possible all communications concerning particular imdc event must be moved to dedicate d pr communication channels this prevents interference with times ensitive pr communications by routine or other operations communications messages record imdc event information 513 the pr cell must maintain accurate records of all information it receives intermediate reporting elements and units preparing for recovery mission are expected to do the same as events unfold during an imdc event they should be recorded in log wh ich will become part of the permanent event folder the entries in the log will be the primary record of the chronology of the case this is particularly important if the imdc is not recovered during th course of operations after combat operations unrecovered imdcs are still looked for the agencies conducting these operations require accurate records of the event in order to organize their operations th operations sometimes take place years after combat operations have ceased so gathering this inform ation at the time of the event is required fm 3501 10 august 2005 52 pr execution 514 the initial notification of an incident should be entered on standardized form use of standardized form will assist with gathering important event tails from the reporting source this is particularly important if the reporting

to be chronologically organized in the even t of protracted recovery effort maybe over days or weeks and provides sequential timeline of events for gathering lessons learned this is also important when determining what information was available at key decision points during an imdc event event time and location 518 ideally the initial report arrives with location information often however only partial information is available from which to estimate the time and location of the imdc event every effort must be made to obtain additional information which when analyzed will reduce the size of the area most likely to contain imdc personnel additional informa tion may include communications fro m the imdc prior to the event or observations by other persons whic h might be related to the event or the conditions that led to it t he effort to obtain more information should continue until all imdc personnel have been located and continue to be refined until they are recove red or otherwise accounted for cause 519 the cause of the event often has direct impact on which method of recovery is used and what type of assets will be employed if an aircraft was shot down by hig h volumes of small arms fire it may not be advisable to send more aircraft into the area to c onduct an immediate recovery attempt until the level of threat can be verified and appropriate countermeasur taken conversely if the event was caused by navigation error or equipment malfunction in friendl areas the range of recovery methods and units capable of conducting recovery may be much wider imdc location 520 accurate imdc locations are critical to pr missions if the wrong area is sea rched there is hope that recovery units will find the imdcs regardless of the quality of their tactics or the amount of the ir effort 521 initial reports often contain inaccurate or missi ng imdc location informa tion imdc locations contained in the initial report must be confirmed via another location method if po ssible dont confuse the event location with imdc location imdc location is often differe nt from the point at which the event occurred pilots evade from crash sites personnel may be captured

purposes their unit can be contacted if it was not the reporting source isoprepepa information can be obtained or their loca tion can be estimated if it is not already known or contained in the initial report imdc iden tification also facilitates initial family support activities at home station during the event imdc numbers 525 identifying the numbers of imdc personnel associated with particular incident has direct impact on which recovery resources will be used if there are 12 imdc located tog ether and it is determined that the suitable recovery vehicle is an armored asset suffi cient vehicles need to be sent to the location to recover all imdcs as qui ckly as possible imdc medical condition 526 the medical condition of the imdc personnel has di rect impact on assets used for recovery and time available to conduct that recovery seriously injured imdc even in uncontested environments may not have much time and requires definitive medical care immediat ely an uninjured imdc does not impose time restrictions from medical perspective recovery actions currently underway 527 if an immediate recovery attempt is in progress th details need to be comm unicated to the pr cell this allows the pr cell to determine what support is required if any by the units conducting the immediate recovery it also permits notification of the other staff and support elements to be gin coordinated effort to support the reintegra tion of imdc after successful recovery 528 if the immediate recovery is unsuccessful and th pr cell is aware of what actions were not successful it can avoid including those actions when coordinating deliberate or external s upported recovery other imdc info to gather 529 the following information should also be gathered ｺ imdc units ｺ copy of the

validation is to determine if the report is an ac tual imdc event false alert or 10 august 2005 fm 3501 55 chapter 5 deception effort by the enemy the principal methods of determining re port validity are determining source validity checking information with operational documents ch ecking information with unit operations 532 determine source validity the source of the initial and s ubsequent reports provides an indication about the validity of the report report coming to the pr cell or to an intermediate reporting element from an awacs aircraft via secure channels can be considered more reliable than voice transmission monitored on an unsecured emergency frequency such as 2430 mhz from an unidentified source this is not to say that the latter is automatically considered suspect bu t it requires additional scrutiny to determine the identity of the person making the emergency transmission 533 check report information with operational documen ts checking the information contained in the initial report with current operational documents furthers the p rocess of determining report validity if call sign of the imdc persons is contained in th report the call sign should be verified by cross checking ground air and maritime opords and fragos and comm unications plans 534 check report information with unit operations if th call sign is not contained in an operational document or call sign was used the report information must be c hecked with tactical units to determine if they are using that particular call sign or if th ey have personnel who are accounted for additionally other staff sections s hould be queued for any knowledge of th call sign or accountability problems 535 if the information in the initial report cannot be valid ated by any of these methods the event may be deception effort by the enemy if this is suspected this informati on is disseminated throughout the pr architecture for further analysis and any necessa ry adjustments opsec review frequency changes codeword changes etc although d eception efforts can cause wasted effort personnel should treat any alert of an imdc event as ge nuine until they know differently false alerts 536 if the initial report is not considered to be d eception effort and the imdc personnel listed in the report are accounted for and were not beyond p2 at any time this is considered false alert causes of false alerts include equipment malfunctions interference testing and inadvertent human error although false alerts can cause wasted effort pe rsonnel should treat any alert of an imdc event as genuine until they know differently 537 records must be kept of all false alerts and thei r causes if an alert is determined to be false prcc should transmit that fact to ll personnel in the reporting chain preventing false alerts 538 ensure individuals know how to operate their pr communications equipment the importance of avoiding false alerts and steps to be taken to preven t transmitting false alerts individuals must not transmit on dedicated pr frequencies to see if they work these frequencies are monitored for any indication of an imdc event often by several different organizations 539 if specific model of emergency communications equipment repeatedly transmits uninte nded alerts investigate the cause and inform appropriate organizations 540 give instruction to the units during battle drills on how emergency equipment should be used for emergency functions ensure battle drills are never allowed to caus false alerts 541 ensure equipment testing personnel are properly trai ned and have the appropriate testing equipment 542 use caution when working around emergency locati ng transmitters elts installed in aircraft including ejection seats to preven t inadvertent activation even t hough these devices transmit only beacon signals monitoring systems and agenci will detect the beacon and must respond to the transmission as an actual imdc event 543 if equipment is to be tested using exercise freque ncies this must be coordinated by the jprc to ensure that the pr architecture is informed of the test or exercise and does not respond as if it were an actual event equipment

be made to determine the location and status of the imdc without knowing where the imdc is recovery fforts cannot commence 548 confirm imdc location accuracy physical search of large areas are normally not practical therefore the next step is to develop sets of know n facts and carefully considered assumptions describing what may have happened to the imdc since they were last known to be

estimate based on the loca tion of the reporting source the accuracy depends on the ability of the reporting source to accurately determine their location and the method used to estimate the location of the imdc event possible sourc of this type of location information are air ground or maritim resources that are onscene or close by 554 location information provided by intelligence collec tion varies with the in telligence method used to determine that location these locations typically include an estimated position error estimated position error information should accompany the location coordi nates of the collection pr cell personnel should not assume that grid coordinate provided by intelligence c ollection is absolute if the estimated position error does not accompany the location pr cell personne l must ask for the information from the reporting source 555 location information provided by imdc personnel provided they do not indicate they are under duress should have high priority many times this location is the most accurate if several different locations are provided by different reporting sources method of determining location 556 coupling the method of determining location with the reporting source further enhances confidence in the accuracy of the location examples of methods of determining an imdc location are ｺ extrapolation of imdc travel from last known point ｺ imdc uses gps to determine their location ｺ imdc estimates their location by comparing their local surroundings with map ｺ imdc determines bearing nd distance to the sardot ｺ forces observing the event use distance and bear ing relative to their position to estimate the imdc location 557 sardot is geographic location known only to friendly forces which allows an imdc to pas s his or her location over an unsecured radio net without compromising their location the pr spins li sts sardot locations coordinate format map datum and gps programming procedures including bearing and distance formats 558 the sarneg is 10letter code word with repeating letters that corresponds to th numbers 0 through 9 it allows an individual to pass his or he r encrypted location over an unsecured radio net without compromising their position normal procedures are to pass latitude and longitude without regard for the directional indicators the pr spins or sop will normally direct coordinate format

imdcprovided location using properly prog rammed and initialized gps device is often the most accurate cross queue intelligence capabilities and all disciplines 561 relying on single intelligence disc ipline capability or ag ency to provide an accurate location may not provide the fidelity requi red if the imdc location is not known or is considered to be suspect cross queuing all intelligence disciplines can result in locations from different sources that can corroborate each other if several different locations from different collection capab ilities all plot closely together on map the confidence that the imdc is actua lly at or very near one of those locations is much higher than for example single sigint detection of radio transmission fm 3501 10 august 2005 510 pr execution 562 assets from several different agenci must also be coordinated to verify the accuracy and validity of location capabilities from subordinate component s can be combined with theater and national intelligence agencies to confirm the imdc location typically th jprc requests the use of national and theater assets while the prccs coordinate for the use of component intelligence assets pass location to pr architecture 563 once the location is determined with reasonabl accuracy it is disseminated throughout the pr architecture so they can begin refining plans for recove ry as further location updates arrive they must be vetted and disseminated in the most expeditious manne r the goal is for every one working the event to have the latest most reliable location information if there are c onflicting locations coming in from several sources decision must be made as to which location is most probable and should receive the most effort and attention the pr cell makes this decision for deliberate and external supported recoveries update location continuously 564 even if the imdc location is determined to be accurate and reliable it should be continuously updated until recovery forces take cu stody of the imdc survivors in ma ritime environments are subject to currents on land they may move to more suitable location or begin evading enemy forces begin mdmp 565 as planning for the recovery begins it is importa nt to evaluate all information and assumptions regularly and as new information becomes available reevaluating assumptions is especially critical if assumptions are not regularly ree valuated an otherwise sound rec overy coa may not succeed because the planners judgment was clouded by false assumption being interpreted as fact 566 as more information is collected and assumptions about the event are transformed int fact courses of action for recovery can be mo re accurately developed pr cells units and supporting organizations continue to refine their plans fo r recovery information concerning th event is continuously updated until imdc personnel are successfully recovered this is pa rticularly important for events of long duration 567 one of the main factors for recovery mission is th threat while threats to the imdc are identified and considered the primary th reat that must be determined is that which affects the recovery unitsforces ability to successfully conduct mission 568 enemy composition and disposition are primary factors when considering which method of recovery is most feasible enemy capabilities that prevent an immediate recovery might very well be manageable for deliberate recovery combining th capabilities of several major subordinate commands likewise enemy capabilities that prevent liberate recovery might be manageable for an external supported recovery utilizing the combined capab ilities of several components to perform the mission 569 threat levels should not be considered static when planning recoveries while the enemy situation is continually analyzed by the gs2 the pr cell considers all units availabl in order to successfully conduct recovery operations based on the intelligence analysis an imdc ev ent may even require that the threat be substantially degraded before any recovery is attemp ted for example imdc personnel in enemy territory that is heavily concentrated with enemy ground forces and protected with robust enemy inte grated air defense system iads may have to evade or remain concealed until those enemy forces can be attacked and degraded by friendly forces to point where recovery attempt is possible 570 enemy capabilities to counter recovery attempt ma even be so robust th at the only available method initially is to have the imdc evade to location wher the threat is less severe this was the case when multiple forces attempted to recover lt col iceal hambleton from north vietnam in april 1972 after multiple attempts to recover him in the middle of north viet namese invasion operation across the established demilitarized zone between north and south viet nam the only viable option that remained after over two weeks of effort and several lost recove ry assets and personnel was to have him evade to point where friendly ground forces could recover him and return him to point south of the concentration of enemy forces 10 august 2005 fm 3501 511 chapter

affect which recovery method is used fm 3501 10 august 2005 512 pr execution unit selection 572 using all information gathered to this point nd applying the known and ssumed metttc factors commanders and staffs identify units that are most capable of conducting recovery under the current event conditions commanders and staffs consider all available units forces and choose the initial task organization that best fits the pr scenario that is presenting itself based on know ledge of the developing situation commander may elect to begin movement of units toward the imdc to gathe r more information about the situation and position friendly forces closer to th imdc for rapid response 573 once potential unitforce recovery task organization is identi fied the commander passes warning order to those units selected for the recovery provi ding all information that the staff and pr cell has received thus far this permits subordinate units to begin detailed tactical planning for the recovery support 574 while planning continues imdc personnel require support until units can conduct recovery imdc personnel are authenticated to confirm their identities family support is initiated with the rear detachment and planning for the recovery is finalized and briefed to decision makers establish control measures 575 the staff in conjunction with the pr cell identifies any protection measures imm ediately required by the imdc air ground and fire support control measures may need to be established to protect the imdc personnel until they can be recovered airspace control measures restrict access into the airspace over the imdc to only those assets that are supporting or executing the recovery fire support control measures protect the imdc from friendly fires as an example if an imdc is located in the vicinity of preplanned fires target those fires may need to be delayed or otherwise adjusted to prevent fratri cide involving both the imdc and responding units coordination of control measures is particularly important for events of long duration in enemy held areas control imdc perimeter if possible 576 setting perimeter around an imdc controls movement into and out of the area around the imd c for example if the imdc is located on contested ur ban terrain and the exact location has not yet been determined but general location is known it may be possible for responding milita ry forces to control perimeter around the suspected location this enables further information gathering and may prevent enemy forces from transporting the im dc out of the immediate area in this example even if recovery units cannot immediately respond they may be given the mission to block or contain the im dc and enemy forces until recovery can be executed disseminate imdc authentication data 577 recovery forces require imdc au thentication data for use during the terminal phase of recovery missions several types of authentication are available to the force that does not apply to specific person operational pr authentication information such as the letter word and number of the day are typically used to authenticate imdc personnel during the report and location phases these authenticators should be used before other information pr wordletternumber of the day 578 the pr word of the day wod letter of the da lod and number of the day nod are means of authentication published in the special instruction these authentication it ems should be used first when authenticating imdc personnel they are changed on regular schedule and published with the regul ar spins updates 579 this information is to be used when onscene for ces observe an imdc event and attempt to establish communication with imdc personnel use of this inform ation should be reported to the pr cell as soon as 10 august 2005 fm 3501 513 chapter 5 practicable ideally with the initial report reporting the use of these authenticators establishes initial authentication of imdc personnel which can support validity of the initial report isolated personnel report information 580 isolated personnel report isoprep data is typica lly reserved for use by recovery forces to conduct final authentication just prior to recovery however the entire isoprep card should not be given to recovery force isopreps are designed to be used multiple times during recovery using only portions of the information on the isoprep as an example one of the four statements on an isoprep is typically reserved for use by an onscene commander making initial communications contact with imdc personnel while different statement is reserved for use by personnel who will be making the initial physical contact with imdc personnel challengepassword 581 there may be instances when an imdc may not have knowledge of authentication information in the spins in these instances the ch allengepassword combination being us ed at the time of the event can be used to authenticate the imdc 582 personal information provided by unit in cases wh ere other forms of authentication cannot be used personal information about the imdc can be obtained from their units while other forms should be used first this may be the only method recovery units have authenticating imdc during the recovery authenticate imdc 583 imdc authentication procedures sure pr units are not responding to deception or ambush effort by the enemy and that the imdc being recovered is the one that units are looking for there have been recovery efforts in past conflicts when recovery forces thought they were responding to an actual fri endly imdc when in fact they were greet ed by concentrated ambush effort when they arrived in the area authentication between recovery forces and imdc pers onnel is designed to confirm that the event is not deception 584 if the authentication alread accomplished during efforts to this point do not result in comfortable assurance that the identity of the imdc has been verified and that he or she is not currently under duress recovery forces have new unused authentication in formation to use on initial contact the information from the imdc isoprep 585 conversely imdc personnel may use authentication information to verify the identity of personnel communicating with them recovery forces must be prepared to identify themselves with mutually understood authentication information should an imdc person decide to use it to verify their identities 586 pr cells continuously track authentication informa tion that is used during recovery attempts and disseminate that information to the entire pr architecture if single pi ece of authentication information is used repeatedly on unsecured communication networks its security degrades this is particularly true in environments where adversaries have the capability to monitor u nsecured friendly communications if piece of authentication information is used to the point where its secur ity becomes doubtful that should be communicated throughout the force and that information should longer be used this is often subjective decision by pr cells and recovery units participating in mission confirm medical condition of imdc 587 confirm the physical condition of the imdc if it was not in the i nitial report reconfirm imdc medical condition when first contact voice or data contact is made with the imdc if th medical condition has changed this information is disseminated to th pr architecture ensure that any changes can be addressed by the responding recovery units fm 3501 10 august 2005 514 pr execution maintain

the staff and pr cell commanders staffs its and imdc personnel continually assess the situation and adapt as new information comes to ligh t support imdc family 590 as more information is gathered about the event coordination with rear detachment personnel to ensure the family is adequately supported should be confirmed for immediate recoveries the first indication that the family receives that their loved one was imdc may be news of the recovery for long duration events such as known captivity support to the family by casualty affairs officers publi c affairs chaplains etc becomes more

regain positi ve and procedural control of imdc personnel 596 recovery units should be provided with equipm ent to establish communications with imdc personnel during the mission and confirm their location if the imdc person has modern survival radio equipment that can determine the precise location of that radio should be employed by units when possible the location provided in the report gets the recovery units close to the imdc communications and precise locating equipment refines that location when recovery units arrive in the objective area and minimizes the time spent searching for the survivor 597 communications during the recovery are crucial for mission success minimum communications to be established during recovery are ｺ dedicated pr channel between aircraft and be tween aircraft and ground forces and between aircraft and c2 facilities involved in the recovery ｺ airtoground communications between aircraft and imdc personnel if the imdc has survival radio this communication will ta ke place on one of the dedicated frequencies programmed into that radio ｺ groundtoground communications between rec overy unitsforces and imdc personnel provide situation reports sitreps as needed or mandated by higher orders 598 during mission execution recovery units provide sitreps to the pr cell as new information becomes available or as mandated by local sop examples of

in the future examples include recovery forces encountering si gnificant enemy presence where it was not expected enemy ttp exhibited during the recovery that indi cates required change during future recovery operations or compromise of procedures used to c onduct recovery operations this information gathered during tactical debriefs by the gs2 must be immediately incorporated into existi ng documents for pr such as the special instructions or standing ope rating procedures used by recovery forces 5103 if information is discovered that affects the operati on at large pr cell personnel must ensure that that information gets to the appropriate staff element so adjus tments can be made in existing and future plans reintegrate 5104 pr execution does not stop with the successful r ecovery of imdc personnel it continues through the reintegration process the goal of reintegration is twofold attend to the medical needs of the recovered personnel and gather info rmation about the event that has immediate impact on current and future operations the overriding concern during reintegr ation is the health and welfare of the recovered personnel these factors take precedence over all others during the reintegration process reintegration team personnel must often balance these factors with the need to gather pertinent information from the recovered personnel the phases of reintegration and the activities that typically occur during each phase are detailed in appendix c transport survivor to secure location 5105 once recovered individuals must be transported to secure

recovered personnel ar transported to this facility reintegration can begin implement reintegration plan 5106 reintegration of recovered personnel is not optional it is similar to mission debrief for any other completed mission the length of time and extent of reintegration activitie s depend on each individual imdc personnel who were isolated from their units fo r very short time and were not captured may not require an in depth reintegration ffort conversely personnel who spent considerable time in captivity or evading the enemy may require an extensive reintegration effort in or der

monitoring throughout planning preparation and executionof the current situation and progr ess of an operation and the evaluation of it against the criteria of success to make decisions and adjustments fm 30 like planning assessments are conducted using one of two methodsdeliberate and time constrained assessment precedes and guides every activity within the pr operations process and concludes each pr operationmission or phase of an operation assessment begins immediately and includes three distinct tasks continuously monitoring the situati on and the progress of the operations evaluating the operation against measures of effectiveness and recording and disseminating the lessons learned together the three tasks compare reality to expectations and provide for adapting to the lessons learned planning 61 during pr planning the commander and staff make ssumptions about the nature of the situation at the projected time of execution as information becomes available plan s are adjusted to reflect the new reality tradition has it that napoleon used corporal to review hi s campaign plans to assess simplicity and comprehension by those who would be tasked to execute it 62 in the iraq war strategy tactics and military lessons author anthony h cordesman reported that gen franks established an assessment program early in the planning process one of m ost interesting aspects of the campaign was the fact that the lessons learned process began even before the contentswar began gen franks installed lessons learned team from joint forces command with his planning 61 preparati on 62 command from the start they did more than take executi on 62 notes to improve our performance for the next war they provided immediate feedback allowing pr assessm ent 62 centcom leadership to

humiliating as hell i think we ought to find out what caused it go back in and retake it if ever there was mandate to assess 10 august 2005 fm 3501 61 chapter 6 preparation 63 while assessing preparation information from unit brief backs nd rehearsals may also initiate changes to the plan this helps the staff refine the plan the commander and staff monitor the progress of readiness to execute the operation 64 in preparation for operation just cause small team had concluded day of rehearsals for their mission the senior nco organized an assessment of the plan in light of all the rehearsal s they had completed the brainstorming session consisted of four basic questions ｺ what could go wrong with this planoperation what else what else what the unit exhausted every scenario they could imagine that murphy could inflict ｺ how will we respond the question was as ked of every potential problem they had identified then the unit form ulated an alternate plan in response to each scenario ｺ what code word can we use on the radio to notify the unit that we have adjusted t one of the alternate plans ｺ how will we notify the unit if we cant use the radio 65 although it was very simple assessment technique it was highly effective and provided the unit with creative examination of th plan it helped them identify the potential problem areas develop solutions to those possibilities and prepare two ways to notify the organization that change to the basic plan was in effect this assessment coupled with the alternate plans that we re developed generated additional rehearsal requirements that proved critical to the success of thei r mission pr cells should ask similar questions during planning and prepara tion in every phase and of every operation execution 66 during execution plans and activities are revised based on the assessed progress of the operation and new information assessments during execution ma often be time constrained and require immediate changes to the plan under optimum conditions the ev ent that triggers the assessment and change was identified as potential event during the planning and preparation phases 67 during operation ivory coast the raid at the tay pow camp in north viet nam the heli copter carrying part of the ground forces including the task force commander col arthur bull simons landed at the wrong complex the ground force co mmander ltc elliot p sydnor was informed assessed the information and immediately notified the ground forces at the pow c amp that alternate plan green was in effect the ground forces adapted to th change when the helicopter carrying the green forces and col simons landed at the pow camp the ground force personnel adjusted again to inc orporate the green forces into their original positions this wellrehearsed force adapted to both changes and the mission continued without skipping beat pr assessment 68 in order to adapt our forces and method of opera tions pr planners must be diligent in assessing planning preparation and performance in every task agai nst the standard it is critical that planners assess the operations that have not succeeded to expectations it is equally important to assess the operations that have gone well or are going well to identify the prac tices that signal success additionally pr planners must be vigilant against establishing routine that the enem can exploit the goal of pr assessment is to ｺ validate the way we conduct pr operations ｺ improve the methods and results includes changing policies directives rsopstacsop spr sopappendix 5 to annex c etc ｺ identify emergent requirements to hi gher hq macom ascc hqda and jfc 69 pr planners must keep in mind that the enemy is ways watching just as we assess and adapt to the battlefield environment our adversarie s are also changing their methods of operations to take advantage of perceived vulnerabilities and static repetitive actions th at army forces exhibit through routine operations fm 3501 10 august 2005 62 assessment 610 when the british were occupying boston at the be ginning of the american colonists struggle for independence they formed routine of marching out of boston agains t the fledgling militia forces general gage of the british forces felt it was important for phy sical conditioning and to pr ovide the show of force against the rebellious citizens the minute men adopted routine of assembling to respond to the threat during the battles of lexington and concord the minute men ex ploited the british routine and used the lessons learned to assemble nd employ the minute men quickly and engage the british along their route back to boston 611 an assessment of that engagement by gen galvin in the book the minute men suggests t hat the british had in effect provided the minutemen with emergency deployment readiness exercise edre rehearsals several times in the months preceding th engagement that would ultimately become known as the shot heard round the world assessing personnel recovery 612 assessing pr begins with step 1 of the military decision making process receipt of mission the commander and staff units and individuals should review their current situations and assess their level of preparation for personnel recovery operations comma nders should encourage the staff and subordinate unit members to begin gathering data for the lessons learned immediately command emphas is is very important for the success of the assessment process the process includes ｺ review the taskprocessmission evaluating it from the focal points of command and staff unit s and individual and the aspects of organization guidance equipment and educationtraining ｺ identify the need for change and record the data initiate required chan ges immediately at all levels ｺ conduct formal aars on routine basis to identify shortfallsneeds and make recommendations ｺ evaluate the recommendations ｺ adopt the changes ｺ disseminate the information and adapt ｺ rehearse and assess the change for effectiveness 613 anytime during the operations process unanticip ated threats or opportunities may significantly change the situation requiring the planning process to restart and new plan to be developed continuous assessment including the identification of branches nd sequels reflected in staff running estimates is key to ensuring plans are revised and remain relevant to the situation 614 commanders and staffs must bear in mind that the after action review aar is not only for the benefit of upgrading the performance of the current staff it is also for each staff members successor so that the learning curve to becoming an effective pr cell member is s hortened mistakes in the critical aspects of the job could lead to deadly results the unit can t allow its effectiveness to dip due to the learning curve of the replacements 615 gather the information as already stated note taking for the assessment should begin i mmediately but critical information that requires an immediate change to operational procedures or to the current plan should not be held back until form aar adaptation begins immediately as an example receipt of intelligence or information that may affect individuals or the rec overy forces may require an immediate change in actions with one or both in any part of planning or execution capturing the data 616 routinely during the conduct of the operation every leader should step back and assess th sum of all parts of the operation and gain insight into developing better way to c onduct pr operations and to identify stumbling blocks to excellence all information that can be used to creat more effective unit is recorded but the data collection effort is not restricted to identifying poor performances aders should look for best practices also and remember short pe ncil is better than long memory dont trust your memory write it down 10 august 2005 fm 3501 63 chapter 6 617 good technique to use for

the recovery missions effective aars takes little tim and leaders can conduct them almost anywhere consistent with unit security requirements immediately following rehearsal leade rs should conduct an aar at the rehearsal site conducting aars help overcome the steep learning curve that exists in unit exposed to combat aars also help the unit sustain strengths and avoid repeat mistake s by

httpwwwcospassarsatcommainpagesindexenglishhtm the system can geolocate emergency beacons tran smitting on 406 and 1215 mhz 1215 monitoring will terminate in 2009 some military survival radios u tilize beacons that transmit on these frequencies the system can locate 406 beacons within 5 kilometers 100 meters if ther is gps encoded position in the beacon transmission this information is then re layed to the rcc responsible for the srr around the beacon location or the closest rcc when the beacon location is outside established srrs a20 civil sar forces also conduct physical searches for personnel in distress when an exac t location cannot be provided by cospassarsat there ar various air and maritime assets including international shipping capabilities which conduct these searches common concepts a21 operating concepts accepted by the international civil sar community are applicable to military pr as well these concepts include ｺ consider all available assets as potential recovery forces ｺ coordination and establishment of common procedures terminology and decision templates streamlines execution ｺ identify coordination centerscells with clearly defined responsib ilities for given dimension of geography ao ｺ execution decisions are made based on the best course of action to successfully recover distressed persons imdc personnel not on the identity of th persons nor their country of origin conclusion a22 the international civil sar community is wellestablishe d and capable of providing assistance to persons in distress over wide area international cooperation between soverei gn nations is common and governed by agreements accepted by the participating countries dod provides military support to civil sar both within the united states and in ar eas overseas and imdc personnel in permissive environments may be recovered by international civil sar assets the environment of cooperation coordination and use of common procedures by the inte
