auditing comm cycles lecture given on 6 august 1963 well how are you today audience good fine good well this is what audience 6th of august six august ad 13 we have three new instructors todaythree new instructors other vast changes are envisaged beyond the curriculum now that youve caught up all of your checksheets you see its time to change the checksheets this is inevitable that mixture which is not shaken stagnates this is was probably the earliest greek utterance so we dont want you to get stagnated the only changes which you get in curriculum and so forth is the change in w which has been in state of flux anyway and the definition of an auditor is being used in w and i have found some new ways of milking down tone armgetting the bestest and mostest out of that tone arm getting that tone arm to really wiggle and wobble thats very important and this piece of technology is hand in glove and it all goes back to very basic simplicities every once in while somebody says and this lecture does concern this definition of an auditor im not going to talk to you too much about the auditing cycle in this well i am going to talk to you about its particular aspects and how an auditor handles it every once in while somebody says well why dont you something or other something or other something or otherthats the crux of the situationwhy dont you change all administrative actions why dont you alter all central organizational lines why dont you so forth why dont we change everything in the course and so on what theyre dealing with is problem they actually dont see the breadth and depth of and that problem is this the character of this planet and the population hereon makes it practically impossible to do anything with this planet now im not taking off from failure point the stress and thought and prevention and cure and this and that which you have to go into on this planet to get anything done and running is absolutely fantastic now you want to ask why this is well we can go into that in moment but those of you who have on the backtrack an experience of you just get some guys together and you do something you see well thats been common experience and you still tend to operate in that zone and sphere of influence in other words you said well it was very easy we just whistle up joe bill and pete and the four of us will go down there and fix up the signboards and thatll take care of that see and youre all set see but that was yesteryear and elsewhere and you apply that basic feeling to this planet and youre in trouble at once why this planet is part of larger federationwas part of an earlier federation and passed out of its control due to losses in war and other such things now this larger confederacythis isnt its right name but we have often called it and referred to it in the past as the marcab confederacy and it has been wrongly or rightly pointed to as one of the tail stars of the big dipper which is the capital planet of which this planet is now all this sounds very space operaish and that sort of thing and im sorry for it but i am not one to quibble about the truth this gets in peoples hair every now and then and i dont see any point in lying in order to be acceptable it just doesnt seem to be right way to go about things particularly in the realm of science i dont think scientist should tell bunch of scientific quote unquote lies in order to be an acceptable scientist it doesnt seem to to be sensible proceeding however be that as it may these various planets united into very vast civilization which has come forward up through the last two hundred thousand years is formed out of the fragments of earlier civilizations now i cant tell you accurately exactly what these blokes are up to or where theyre from but this isnt quite germane to this galaxy thats the first thing you should know about it it isnt quite native to your track you find type of mental implanting and that sort of thing going on here in the last couple of hundred thousand years which are not native to your earlier track now this is all very important its very important because they have terrible problem they have the problem of people who are native to this galaxy and arent used to this kind of thing and they have the basic problem of how do you kill thetan and thats terrible problem to men who have very very guilty consciences and blood on their handsgreat problem probably the best way to hide your overts is to give somebody amnesia you see then they dont know what youve done to them and then tell them something else has happened well this is dramatization of very craven intelligence and that is what is going on here now the fellow who conforms to that society is in vast trouble perhaps some bloke who has military record against them and that sort of thing might possibly matter what he did find himself unable to satisfactorily conform but the point is that their ideal is the conformist now these conformists are pretty weird and the personnel of that particular society is pretty scummy to say the least lets supposing you were in the last shambling wreckages of redlight district youd have hightoned personnel compared to the personnel which makes up the other planets im talking to you about hightoned personnel much higher toned than their average run they practice cannibalism the stuff you get on race tracksonce in while some pc will run into race tracks and racetrack driversthis romancircustype entertainment dont you see all that kind of stuffthats all out of this zone and area were still with that planetary system so they specialize in the fellow who will conform now he ordinarily is worker who is content to draw wages and not do another single blessed thingyou know never really get up improve his lot you see and keep on plugging along somehow or even slump into indigence hes still their choice of personnel so this leaves this leaves the brilliant artist the brilliant engineer the manager the genius the criminal the pervert non persona grata and they sentence these peoplethe upper class that is to say the brighter gent because they cant control him and theyre afraid of him and the lower class because its too vicious even for themand they condemn these people to perpetual amnesia dead forever they call itthe problem of killing thetanand wrap them up in mothballs and ship them down here and here we are and that is the population of this planet all right heres population then of minimal workers maximal managers artists geniuses criminals and perverts what you going to make out of this lot huh now those are the blokes youre talking to when you say add up the lefthand column of the ledger well of course the artist says he could add it up much more prettily the guy who actually in his own right was very skilled manager he says he could devise much better systemits true too he probably could if the bird is criminal hes just sitting there trying to figure out how he can add it up so he can short you and theres your zone of operation there is your response to 8c in trying to get an organization running its all alteris because the basic crime was nonconforming the basic crime wasnt being criminal the basic crime was not conforming well actually this group has gone ahead and made up up until recent times totally different civilization than the civilization which planted it here in the last ten thousand years they have gone on with sort of decadent kickedinthehead civilization that contains automobiles business suits fedora hats telephones spaceshipsquite interesting but civilization which looks an almost exact duplicate but is worse off than the current us civilization therefore you find the current us and western civilization rather restimulative because it has moved up to look like the marcabian civilization its been moving up here rather rapidly and now were at point very high level of restimulation because the automobile design the train design ship design why theyve got ships in those areas look just like the queen mary you see and the fire engines and the stuff you do with mens clothes particularlyall of these things are the same image so youre going into highly restimulative era because weve not had this before see weve been moving up through strata of civilization but we hadnt matched this one and remember that this society at the present time looks dangerous it looks very dangerous one of the highest crimes you could pull in that marcabian society probably even today is income tax you make one comma wrong and its dead forever sounds weird doesnt it so they got everybody paying income taxawful restimulative probably nothing much wrong with income tax if it were administered as tax but it isnt its administered as punishment even on this planet today well its one of their prime punishments in the marcabian civilization all of this adds up to what an era going on right now of highly restimulative associations in the civilization and therefore highfelt level of danger people feel like they are in danger scientologists every once in while hearing talk like this feel even more in danger they say boy those guys are liable to land here tomorrow you know of course i pull this every once in while diana suddenly appeared on my right side last night while eating dinner and i didnt even know she was in the room you see and just out of the corner of my eye i saw pair of white spots that looked like the spats spaceman uses you know and for split second i said well here they are you know but anyway you should realize that the material on the betweenlives area has been much more broadly circulated than any of our material is now because it was laid down the line in all directions to the most unlikely places including russia and was contained in the book what to audit and other materials and that was 1951 and 52 i consider thats interesting because let point out to you thats eleven or twelve years ago and there hasnt been ripple i just want to point that out to you as an interesting point gents of this character who have system worked out this way wouldthe last thing in the world theyd do would be blow their own game see all theyd have to do is land one spaceship and they feel like everybody would go into convulsion of suddenly remembering everything and they do do you know any rumor of the men from mars or something like that and this planet goes into total convulsion they produced orson welless broadcast down in quito i think it was ecuador andthe radio station there i think seventeenstory building or large building or whatever the figures were on itand mobs tore that building to pieces and killed seventeen people in the process they practically slaughtered the staff of that radio station in other words they went mad so they know that great riots are attended by this but landing in force without any equivocation that it had been landing of some type or like this would be liable to restore everybodys memory i think thats what they feel whether this is true or not we couldnt worry less but here you are that is the point here you are that is this planet every once in while you get mad at government on this planet when in actual fact youre mad at the marcabian government and theres great deal of confusion every once in while somebody will get awfully furious with an organization very furious with an organization here on this planet when they have actually identified the organization with the marcabian civilization now you start hitting people here with restimulative materials of this particular type and it restimulates terrific unreality it restimulates amnesia i have to ask you this how hard do you have to hit somebody to bring about amnesia lets take joe out here and lets just see how hard do we have to hit joe in order to bring about amnesia on his part so he doesnt know who he is where he is or anything else how hard would we have to hit him boy thats pretty hard its almost unbelievable force is used to handle thetan and put him into this kind of condition ive been hit with some awful heavy force in this universe without losing my mind or forgetting who i am see so its pretty heavy duress and you restimulate that very easily by telling people things it gets awful unreal but you would find if you gave them the actual dope that they would be far more in agreement with you than if you gave them just touch of the dope do you see you wont find the citizens of this planet very far in disagreement with what youre doing so therefore youve got some kind of an explosion going well these guys are not going to blow their own show see theyre not going to do anything peculiar about it theyve probably got us all sized up if they know anything about us at all they probably have some dim idea of what were doing and saying oh yes hohum and give the devil his due they might even say well hey what do you know those guys might be producing type of technology which we ourselves desperately need look at that see now they know the problems exist they couldnt have had any decent solution or they wouldnt have taken the route to solution which they have they are beings too remember that so when we look at all this you are 1 organizationally handling people who are revolutionaries they are nonconformists probably the common denominator of this planet is revolution probably the one thing you could always start on this planet would be revolution because its state of perpetual revolution trying to hold any organization together of any kind whatsoever becomes almost impossible because everybody youre dealing with is nonconformist all right so far goes the civilization there are just those few statements on the thing i thought you might find of interest were dealing now with what is an auditor you are handling therefore the roughest case that you could find in the universe because the rehabilitation of the individual demands that you rehabilitate his knowingness if his knowingness does not increase independently he himself does not get well you see electrical charge on the case is simply symptom that measures his knowingness if hes got too much charge his knowingness is way down see thats an indirect measure of the amount of knowingness of the individual and as the case moves along up the line you get an odd factor you get an odd factor this case continues progressively to remember more now one of the things the case recovers is picture memory remembering by pictures i have picture of so therefore i was see you can call that picture memory and that goes from terrific unreality on it down to pretty good certainty on it so person at that stage of the gamean advanced stage of the game in inspecting his own picturescan tell the difference between false picture and an actual picture that has something to do really with him on his track and as his knowingness increases he can tell you where it belongs and what date it has and so on in other words he can spot it bang thats an increased knowingness its knowingness that is increasing all the way along the line now from picture memory the individual graduates up to simply knowing now right now you dont have to get picture of where you are living to know where you live you see that you dont have to get picture of your name to know what your name is in other words you know this well so does knowingness increase as the case improves and that knowingness increases up the line to point where you know who you have been and where you have been independent of any created evidence or cross proof you simply know and that factor is very slow factor to rise its not rapid factor under present auditing yes it is rapid but that is all within framework of hundreds of hours dont you see now ill give you an ideaan idea of this for instance i knowi know where i was and who i was and know with good certainty who i was and where i was in the last eighty trillion years see i know that thats not much of an argument with but the small details of that are liable to go fritterfritter here and there you know what did i have for breakfast two trillion years ago nix man nah did i even eat you see that sort of thing is getting pretty dim but now over the top of that which is an identity knowingnesswhich comes before detail knowingness you see between your picture knowingness and your total knowingness is this stage of just knowing your identitywhy then this detail knowingness starts to come up and follow in on this smaller basis and one of your gains on it youll know why you were here youll have tangled with it in session and that sort of thing and youll have picked data out of pictures and all at onceit will just getmore and more you know why you were here you know how you got here you know what you were doing ten thousand years ago do you see you know what was happening 11025 years ago dont you see youno pictures involved you just know it and that is the restoration of the beingness of the person and i have given you in very crude way here cycle of that restoration of beingness his beingness returns to him gradually bit by bit perhaps the lowest edge of it is something on the idea of maybe i possibly could know who i was you know possibly i could know what i am doing here or i might even be able to know who i am just some sort of feeling like one might be able to know and that crawls up forward to picture knowingness and the unreality of those pictures at first is fabulous so that anybody shows you any kind of picture man any kind of picture that ismust be yours and therefore you must have been there they could show you picture of an airplane falling apart and you at once say well i must have been in that airplane falling apart and later on you suddenly realize hell im looking at that airplane from two miles away what am i doing looking at it from two miles away this dawns on you after while your valence problem all of sudden comes up it hits you in the face whether youre coaxed to do it by the auditor or not im in that airplane see over there two miles away see so therefore i must have had an awful fall and it turns out eventuallyyoud begin to see this thingyou say hey wait minute i couldnt have been in that airplane it was somebody i shot down maybe its somebody i did this with and then youll finally say well shucks that thing is just false picture that isnt my picture at all and then whatever picture of yours is holding it in suspense that picture suddenly peels off the front of it like badly painted chrome and pshew and your own picture is right behind it and you say oh yerp there i was and youre in valence that various cycle of recognition takes place in this picture line but what does it take then to bring about such total amnesia lets look at that what does it take to bring about such total amnesia i was riding spaceship down one day side gaskets of the tubes blew out on one side and wiped out the engineroom crew i went in to drag them out just at the moment when the whole backblast of the rockets moved frontwards through the engine room and got hit square in the face and managed to crawl out of the place the ship went into the atmosphere melted and crashed and couple of minutes or oh couple of seconds after it hit all of its fuel went up and hit in the face and i lost my memory i lost my memory it took quite while sitting down very quietly to remember where base was and i sat there and figured and figured and figured actually id sent some people back to come and pick up the wreckage and so forth and i was pretty foggy and very shortly i snapped out of it you know of course you know but just how muchhow much force is force well this is the type of scout craft which has the engines of battle cruiser all packed into very tight spot you see and all of it redhot fuel cape canaveral has got nothing like the amount of force one of those things can deliver dont you see and to get all of that square in your thetan puss twice and get confused about where base was got the idea and how much force has it taken to destroy somebodys memory its interesting an interesting point isnt it well thats how much force youve been subjected to otherwise you wouldnt have case im not trying to make you afraid of force you get up to point after while as thetanforcesmorce who cares i had funny feeling the other day i didnt quite feel up to diving into the sun i just didnt feel up to it i didnt feel it would be healthy thing for to do just now i felt weak and i felt the interactive forces of the sun and i felt sort of drawn little bit toward the sun and i said i sort of did suppress and looked the other way i just didnt feel like taking sun bath today you get the idea you know you feel queasy too much forcetoo much force well now that force of course has to be combined with trickery and the trickery is mostly scrambling somebodys dates and giving them opposite opposing items that can suspend in time so that the scrambled dates will suspend in time you get the combinations you know them in our various technologies but lets not move away from the point into the trickery of it it does require the force force how much force does it take to destroy the memory of being well thats how much force an auditor is getting off case and of course youd much rather get off unknowingness and oddities and oddball things youd much rather because theyre easier to confront than raw force and theyre easier for the pc to confront too therefore you say what have you done and your pc said well i had hostile thought about you the other day i thought you really should do your hair up in back oh goodweve got big withhold off you get the gentle patacake that you will sometimes see in auditing sessions the proper auditing response of course is well thank you very much and so forth and ow is bit different than other brands of auditing you say what have you done done done and if you work very very hard you can get done in all these thinks you see behind all these critical thinks is done is an actual action and you can listen to critical thinks till the cow comes home and you will never get anybody raised up the line until youve found an actual action that is the secret of all sec checking and that is where people fall down in sec checking now why do they fall down well its much easier to confront this random little think than it is the energy contained in done do you see that therefore the mission of an auditor is the restoration of persons awareness which includes his memory his knowingness of himself and so forth restoration of awareness what is holding down that awareness what is holding down this knowingness what is sitting on this knowingness well you can say trickery and force but it is force used with trickery so that an individual will get an arc break with force and then become the effect of force so youre handling in actual fact somebody who has lots of arc breaks with other beings matter energy space time and location and form that is in direct definition this person is out of comm out of affinity and out of reality with matter energy space time location other beings and form now thats the pc so whats an auditor so whats an auditor well an auditor has to be somebody who can release this tremendously involved force somebody who can release this force from the pc obviously if its deranged force which is bringing about the amnesia of the pc then the auditor to get return of memory of the pc has to be capable of alleviating and removing that force i mean thats simple simple elementary my dear watson on your emeter you have tone arm force is removing itself from the case as long as that tone arm is in motion and the wigglewaggle of the tone arm as the pc is being audited tells you that force is being relieved from the case when you start to remove force that is aberrated by some trickery your tone arm hangs up until the trickery is resolved you know wrong date or something like thatand your tone arm action is restored all of these things are all cared for in the processes and technologies of auditing but if that ta isnt moving you will never make an ot thats just it now you oddly enough do not have to run process sometimes to get the ta moving providing the ta is movingproviding the ta is moving and you get good motion out of your tone arma person will eventually go operating thetan providing you can keep the tone arm moving the person will eventually go operating thetan if the tone arm is not moving the person will not go operating thetan and the case may even deteriorate lets just run this case on and on the case can run an engram and so you keep running engrams engrams engrams engrams and the tone arm is stuck right up here at somewhere in the vicinity of 50 and there it sticks at 50 and you go on and audit and audit and audit and there it is at 50 and there it is at 50 and there it is at 50 and there it is at 50 uhhahyoure never going to make an operating thetan now if you run the right significances off the case and produce tone arm action you make an ot much quicker but you can get tone arm action without running the right significances get this syllogism here and you can run the right significances without getting tone arm action oh well you can run r3r on somebody who cant handle r3r and you can run all the right significances and not get into tone arm action youre not going to make an ot now let go over this again now and youll see where you sit with regard to tone arm if you just keep tone arm moving on the pc long enough regardless of how and what youre auditing on the case the case will eventually make ot but if you run the right significancesif you run the right significancesand dont get any tone arm action youre not going to make an ot you got that now this is terribly important now it might take thousands and thousands of hours just to randomly keep this tone arm moving on the pc and lots of pcs can talk forever you know without getting any tone arm action but if you could keep that ta moving youd eventually get ot so you say then that moving tone arm is slightly senior to the right significance now this is right down to bedrock on the subject of auditing your job is to keep the ta moving now whats this ta doing the ta is indicating the blowing off of force that is measure of the amount of encysted force which is leaving the casethe amount of encysted force leaving the case youve got measure of it right there it goes up and down and it measures the amount of force which is going now of course you dont do this arithmetically or mathematically i imagine someday one of these days why we will well set up project that measures some guy from scratch right straight through to the end shows the exact number of motions of the ta on every process or type of process that is run on the person and these are all added together and we say theres this many hundred million ergs of energy were released and at the end of that line we had an ot but that is in essence what youre doing youre blowing the force because the more force is blown off the case the less amnesia the case has does it make sense to you now audience yes force created the amnesia and you got to blow it to get rid of the amnesia now theres an interesting oneforone now the amount of time in processing the amount of time in processing is enormously speeded up if you run the right significances because youre running the force off early track and you start to get force release which you dont see on the meter now lets not say that if the tone arm isnt moving its all okay the tone arm is also moving when this happens i was sitting down in session one day and i could feel energy masses disintegrating clear out to arcturus it sure wasnt registering on the meter if it had there wouldnt have been any more of an emeter here thered have just been charred wire you get the idea it was blowing off all over the place every once in while well get blowdown phenomenon well when you see that blowdown pshew pshew pshew pshew pshewim talking about repetitive down see you can see that needle go pshew pshew pshew pshew pshew it just keeps doing it and your tone arm is drifting lower and lower and lower youre watching remote force area blow up now if all this force blew up against the pcs face and the pcs body he wouldnt have any more body than rabbit its pretty hard to do research auditing and keep body over you it is because you make one little mistake here and another mistake there and chew into gpm someplace else the next thing you know there goes this and there goes that and your right ear looks like pretzel anyhow the point im making here is that your force measured through the emeter is only part of the force which is blowing off the case but if any force is blowing off the case you have an additional movement of the tone arm so if tone arm is moving youre blowing force and if tone arm is not moving youre not blowing force and thats all you have to know about it now there are several significances that can keep tone arm from moving such as wrong time and an arc break situation where the pc is out of comm and few things like this but were not now discussing the motion tone arm were discussing motion tone arm therefore it is of great interest to an auditor then to make that tone arm move and to make it move all he can make it move and your most fundamental method of making tone arm move is not running process it is the basic definition of an auditor listener the basic way to let tone armget tone arm move is to listen and that is the fundamental of auditing now somebody could probably talk for thousand years and never say the right things and you wouldnt get any tone arm motion but similarly how many pcs talk and get tone arm motion from doing so and are shut up or cut off by the auditor hahahohoho now there is an inhibition of blowing clear the auditor is not then doing his job an auditor is setting up barrier to blowing mass and youll find out the pc winds up at the end of the session stupider at the end of session he can remember less than he could remember at the beginning of session why well youve done something with the force you have moved it out of the bank and dumped it on the thetans head oh itll destimulate itll go out of restimulation and all that sort of thing the basic definition of an auditor is to listen hes listener his basic job is to listen not to restimulate all right now we stand around and we say well the marcabians are gonna get you tomorrow man and the size of the betweenlivesarea screen is 180 feet by 9 feet and so forth and people sit there and they go dzzzz thats doing what thats charging them up isnt it thats charging them up well actually they talk it over one with another and usually blow the charge its not grave matter its not difficult matter at all their knowingness increases and they feel all right about it and so forth well we get away with that why9 because we can talk to one another about it thats why the only method of blowing reactive charge is by communication linethere is other methodby communication line i think thats very interesting heres the auditor and hes supposed to listen and the only way the pc can possibly get rid of the charge is blow it by the communication line now this doesnt mean oddly enough that hes blowing it at the auditor he isnt blowing it at the auditor but that he can communicate it does cause it to dissipate and it doesnt hit either the auditor or the pc if the auditor wants to get hit by the charge he should put up barrier to prevent it from blowing and the pc has an arc break and the next thing you know the auditor is hit by the charge you can set up situation whereby the auditor is hit by the charge but only if he stops the charge how do you get rid of charge now get what i just said how do you get rid of charge i didnt say how do you handle charge restimulate charge or anything like that just how do you get rid of it listen thats how you get rid of it listen elementary my dear watson now all therapies since time immemorial have consisted of listeningone way or the other he is sympathetic person and people tell their troubles to him and very often feel lot better well all of that is very well and you can add that up to shortcircuited look at auditing but remember this factor entered in was the pc or was the patient talking with tone arm action oh thats the difference or was the pc just nattering or was the pc lying or something you let pc sit there and lie or patient sit there and lie for while and youre going to have one of the stuckest tone arms you ever wanted to see so that is the essence of the thing an auditor is somebody who listens with tone arm action thats the difference but remember the fundamental of all mental activities was listening prayer is based on god will hear and if theres ots around who is going to hear him actually the lama got so disgusted with this that he put all of his praying on automatic he puts them on little wheel he can turn the wheel and it goes brrrrrrp and thousand prayers go up and hes got that cared for and ill bet you his tone arm it didnt move bit so an auditor has the job and auditing consists of restimulating charge thats the auditing command received by the pc and then letting the pc blow the charge that is restimulated on the return communication line simple isnt it ill draw you picture of this thing you neednt take very accurate copy of this because this is an hcob i think 4 august and im having it squared around but ill draw you this thing heres causedistanceeffect that is communication cycle and here is the auditor and here is the pc the auditor utters an auditing command and it goes across this distance and hits something whats it hit the pc it hits the reactive bank that accumulated mass of force which the pc is packing around that is always kicking his head in and we get what is known as restimulation at this point there we are we get restim theres the living lightning pow goes the auditing command we know this guy is very sensitive to snakes so the auditor says recall snake pow see bang well now of course if were in some kind of weird situation whereby were fighting the pc why were not restimulating the bank were just trying to get the pc to fight us or something like that were notit hasnt anything to do with auditing just forget that the auditors address actually is to the reactive bank and he says recall snake bow now we get communication line bankdistanceeffect and here we have the pcthetan and the pc says hey what do you know there is snake in there and he goes causedistanceeffect and thats the end of that this line must follow in to take care of the charge restimulated in your first line causedistanceeffect thats the auditing command bow theres the charge he recalls the snake boom it starts to hit the thetan and the thetan recognizes it knows what it is and imparts that information on his causedistanceeffect line back to the auditor and there goes auditing your cycle then occurs and the charge is blown and you see it reacting on the emeter as blown these are not all the communication cycles there are in an auditing cycle but this doesnt happen to be lecture on that im showing the principal action of these basic lines now remember that life is always giving him commands that restimulates thingshere at on the pc this is our old ptp and other things of that character if you dont believe that put in your since mid ruds on the pc and see how superior your tone arm action is usually get marvelous tone arm action on since mid ruds unless the pc is protesting them and wants to get on with the session and you get marvelous tone arm action well thats just the restimulated charge thats been slapped at him out of this muckedup bank that he is gratuitously handed in full restimulation with much added force in every betweenlives session hes had with the little boys elsewhere hes trying to blow that charge so he comes into session and he sometimes will sit there and talk to you for quite while and the tone arm would just move and move and move and move hes getting rid of the betweensessions charges interesting isnt it you notice after hes talked for fifteen twenty minutes sometimeeven somebody who has had big upset on the thing youve got in your since mid ruds or you havent gotten in your since mid ruds you notice that your tone arm action dies down and then suddenly mysteriously the pc is insession whats happened youve emptied this reservoir of restimulation which life has handed him restimulated in him during the sessionbetween sessions you see and youve emptied that thing out now you want to know why your pc doesnt go into session sometimes well hes justhes got lot of restimulated charge that is all ready to fall back now youve got is it kinder to audit somebody one hour week or twentyfive hours week well of course there is comparison because in the one hour you cant even get rid of lifes restimulative action in this reservoir here at all so you spend that one hour indifferently getting rid of three days of the week which youre trying to cover dont you see and its losing proposition theres makebreak point in auditing where person has to be audited enough to get rid of this charge which is being consistently and continually restimulated got that well now this line here thenthis lower line with the pc at cause answering this question back to the auditor who in this case is at effect then that line must have some seniority to the upper line the auditor causedistanceeffect then is not quite as important astheyre both terribly importantbut is not quite as important as the line causedistanteffect to the pc in other words between the seniority of the two lines both in the same order of magnitude youll find that the pcs line to the auditor is slightly more important than the auditors line to the pc and in this line of causedistanceeffect to the pcin that line and an inspection of that lineyou will find all auditing failures providing any process at all that we have has been run in other words if case was loused up by auditing we dont inspect the process run as the first consideration we inspect the tone arm as the consideration because if you got good tone arm motion running that process then that bottom linethe cdistancee of the pcwas in now weve had processes for years its true our processes have to be very neat they have to be very important and they restimulate the exact amount of charge that then blows the outer bank charge and so forth and its all figured out very neatly and on some pcs its almost impossible to get tone arm action and you have to know what stops tone arm action you have to know all of these various things but im now just talking about the fundamentals of auditing and we inspect on failed case the ce the cdistancee of the pc not the process run thats the first thing wed inspect was the auditor auditing now anybody could sit there and say recall snake recall snake recall snake recall snake recall snake recall snake and the pc says well i well thats all right just dont bother with that recall snake recall snake and all of sudden the pc is dada dadada you know and hes swamped all right what happens in case like that well this is very very easy this restimulation when the pc puts it on this line goes bang straight back at the pc got it when that line goes out where else can it go its only got one place to go and thats the pc so whatever you restimulate in pc comes home on the pc unless it is picked up on the reverse communication line now the penalties of this the first symptom of the pcs causedistanceeffect linethe first symptom of its disappearance is dirty needle you can go down any line of auditors who are busy auditing right down any line of auditors and watch their meters you dont even have to listen to them you just see dirty needle bang this lines out the auditor isnt listening the first definition of auditor is missing pc is saying well thats snake isnakewell there was one in zoo urmuhuhurm i think it was zoothere was one in zoo the auditor said okay thank you good good thank you thank you good recall snake and the pc said well umsflasflassle hum yes yes good good thank you got this nonsense hes just backing up all the charge of the process on the pc ah i see some of you have seen this happen what occurs then well franklyfrankly in time the c with the pc at causedistanceeffect line in terms of time the one here from the pc over to the auditor may take upwards to hundred times as much time in the session as the line ce from the auditor oh it only took three seconds to ask that question recall snake and the pc says mmm and mmm he finally says was it in zoo i dont know zoo and so on what youre seeing is identification turning into differentiation youre seeing force and charge blow off the pc is inspecting this thing and the tone arm moves and it keeps moving it keeps moving and the pc says well he doesnt know and so on was it green snake or blue snake hes not quite sure if it was green snake or blue snake and so on he cant recall snake and so forth and so on snakesnightmare about snakebut was that recalling snakeifim not quite sure on it there was one down at the zoo when i was littleyeah yeah i got one yeah yeah it was green snake oh yeah yeah there was one yeah houston zoo yeah got it got one green snake at houston zoo when i was eight haha and you will see the cycle of the blowing force on your meter tone arm accompany returning knowingness on the part of the pc and the more you get that thing wobbling the more positive the pc sounds you just watch that because that in itself is little tiny proof of what im saying is as you get the force off the pcs knowingness comes back and you can see it in one cycle one auditing cycle the pc says snake my god id neveroh snake what snake where what why illoh sosssimi guess there was see where do they keepnow i just why yeah i was in zoo at one time yeah there are zoos lets see now so on and so on zoos and i must have been in zoo sometime or another zooswhen i was little bowell they used to take to zoo when i was little boy the zoothe snake house oh yeah there must have been one in the snake house and so forth thatyeah they had glass and so forth see yeah yeah i used to be fascinated by some cage in there lets see i cani gotyeah theyit was glassfronted cathey had green snake in there oh i remember now yeah i was eight yeah bing bang he knows youve pulled him up all the way through the force that tells him he doesnt know up to point where he knows and you think it winds up with his simply seeing the picture clearly he goes all the way through the picture stage which i have just given you you understand audience yes yeah now these two lines have names regardless of what they will be called on yourthe comm cycles of your auditing cycles they have numbers on the auditing cyclebut they have nice colloquial names that you can remember very easily and this is the whatsit line and this is the itsa line now the whatsit line is from the auditor to the pc and the auditor is saying whats it he says recall snake you know whats it and the pc says fumble fumble fumble fumble hes looking for an itsa see green snake houston zoo thats the itsa and youll see the tone arm blow down when he hits it too so your tone arm then follows this pattern your tone arm follows this pattern here is your tone arm heretwo tone arms and here is this is already in hcob august 4heres your regular tone arm positions and here is nice solid arm and here is dotted arm and heres an arrow showing the motion as up from 30 to 40 and thats whatsit you got that we havent quite determined the lowtonearm case but i think they run in reverse but thats whatsit thats the upward throw of the tone arm thats whatsit the pc says lets see snake snake whawhatwhatwhatsa recall snake its alets seewha hes saying whatsa whatsa whatsa whatsa whatsa whatsa see and youll see that tone arm go up and then hell get little bit of an itsa and you will see the tone arm go down and your tone arm dotted at 40 falling to solid at 30 and thats itsa and you frankly can monitor pcs tone arm on one question like mad he has an arc break with somebody and he sees that theres some differencesome similarityor he thinks maybe he knows somebody who looked like the person he had an arc break with this would be research test see he seeshe knows now already that theres some similar incident earlier that hes got this person associated with somebody he shouldnt have it associated withgot an identification going and you say well what reminded youwell you dont even know who that earlier person is see but what reminded you in the person you had the arc break with now what reminded you of the person in the past see whatsa and you see that pcs tone arm go right up you say whatsa tone arm goes up the pc says figure figure figure figure figure figure figure figure was it hiswas it his tie his shirt hisits atie shirt yup or is itthere some way he heldi think it was the way he mustve held his head then youll get an itsa and itll go right down yes just think it was the way he held his head and you say well was there anything else whatsa and itll go right up it goes right into the whatsit and the pc says well it couldve beenit couldve been the wayway hewaythehed stand there the kind of clothes he was wearingmustve been the kind of clothes he was wearing itsa and down comes the tone arm and you actually can sit there as an auditor and control the motion of the tone arm you can control it you can say whatsa and every time you give him whatsa youll see it goes up and make sure he gives you full itsa and then feed back in again another fragment of the whatsa see and up up goes the tone arm again and he gives you the itsa and down comes the tone arm again and you can just sit there and call your shots thats research project you normally wouldnt handle comm like that but youll see it in running almost any process when you say whatsa up she goes and youhe says itsa and down she comes so you say whats it to the pc and you get the up arm that charge is restimulated and unresolved and that high tone arm shows you restimulated but unresolved charge its sitting there in the bullpen its sitting there in the reservoir and its going to hit somebody or something and the pc plows through this charge that s been restimulated here and he puts it over on this line and he says itsa and if hes permitted to give you the itsa line then the charge channels rightdoesnt hit the auditor it just disintegrates see and there it goes boom its gone you see that the crudest auditing cycle is the whatsititsa whatsititsa whatsititsa and of course it doesnt take any time to say whatsit and sometimes takes quite while to say itsa so consequently this line is much more prone to be out than the upper linethan the whatsa line definition of an auditor to listen now youre handling case if you knew scientology in the galactic confederation at this particular moment man theyd practically put you on throne see cases well boo you take some of the old route 1 and you say all right be three feet back of your doll all right be on planet planet b planet planet planet planet b got it youre getting along fine planet planet b good ot thank you guy would say gosh you know this is terrificprovided you listened guyd say this is terrific i feel much better now i dont see why i have to be pinned in that dolls head im going around getting my sergeants stripes as an ot the situation would be very different from what youre operating with the character of the pc youre operating with is operating under an enforced and continuouslyeachlifereinforced amnesia and if the course of the case upward is to knowingness think of what stands in your road auditing an earth case and if you were up around in some other locales it would be about the same difference as right now auditing an earth case you would sort of feel odd ashow the hell do you audit an ant do you see well itd be that same gap between an earth case and an ant as case of more or less free thetan out there in space who doesnt have your technology and an earth case do you see that so i can feel for you trying to get wins on the cases youre trying to get wins on but you should recognize what type of case youre trying to get wins on and should recognize where your line is breaking down now i have never been able to describe this to you as succinctly as this i myself wasnt making much of this mistake it didnt call too much to my attention what it is but it must have been there if the original word which identifies you auditor means listenmust have been there all the time well understood now whats the course of having that line out whats the source course of it heres first 1 dirty needle 2 stuck ta 3 arc break one two threeas inevitable as nonsense from washington one two threejust like that if your pc has dirty needle stuck tone arm is incipient on that case its liable to happen any minute man youre already threequarters of the way over the cliff in fact the beginning of the piercing dwindling scream is about to sound and your arc break will follow immediately afterwards bypassed charge the most fruitful source of bypassed charge then is the itsa linejust it and thats allthat line that is the most fruitful source of bypassed charge then restimulate an engram dont let the pc tell you about it restimulate an engram dont let the pc tell you about it restimulate an engram dont let the pc tell you about it restimulate an engram dont let the pc tell you about it restimulate an engram dont let the pc tell you about it if you havent got an arc break by that time the pc must have been dead to begin with do you see that simply by filling up this reservoir full of charge and then not putting in the itsa linenot letting the pc tell you all about ityoure bypassing charge this is elementary that gives you change in your auditing training program at level w at level w were going to teach an auditor to be an auditor were going to teach them to listen before they restimulate anything life restimulates quite bit of charge the auditor should at least be able to handle that level iscientology i auditingwill consist then mainly of listening you see his ta stop moving you must have seen earlier dn and not noticed it so therefore if you see dn you know that your ta motion soon is going to cease it may not be the exact next session it may take two sessions for it to really stop two sessions of the same kind of treatment see and you know thats going to wind up in an arc break these people who are arc breaky pcs are not arc breaky pcs there is such thing there are only auditors who dont listen its very simple its very elementary i dont wish to give you too much stress on this because youre liable to go completely overboard and just sit there and let your pc do nothing but talk but the only crime that you can commit on letting the pc talkthe only crime you can commitis if the pc doesnt move his tone arm by talking pc is talking for while and you see that the tone arm isnt moving well you go on letting him talk forever youre foolish because the case is getting noplace and this question will come up the pc is motivatoring motivatoring motivatoring nattering nattering nattering first question that was thrown at we had student here one time that only talked in motivatorsdidnt talk english talked motivators and the questionquestion was asked of well what if we just let that person talk well in the first place she never would have gotten any ta as result of all this talk and the other thingshe was already in an arc break do you follow that you dont let people talk when theyre in an arc break you find what the bypassed charge is because your itsa line has already gone so far out that it wont put itself back in so you say when shouldnt you let pc talk ta action or the pc already in an arc break the time to do then is act and the ta action well lets give them another auditing command or something like that but that normally isnt whats wrong when you get stuck ta in that particular fashion if youre doing arc breaks of some kind or another like recall arc breaks and the pc has had an arc break in present time with themselves having called an arc break in the past that sort of thing can happen see or theyve suddenly bypassed and havent answered fifteen or twenty arc breaks they havent given them to you they threw them all away suppressed them that sort of thing is happening something weird has gone on in the session and you suddenly cease to get tone arm action now the pc could sit there and talk forever and wouldnt get him out of it it requires the auditor to locate what bypassed charge what has happened here he has two remedies for this he has the arc break assessments and he has his big mid ruds he has ways of getting people out of this mess but that is your basic problem were not talking about the ramifications of it let the pc talk and let him talk with tone arm action and let them talk as long as they want to talk and let them talk as long as you can get tone arm action by their talking where did you get so industrious if i could sit there for two and half hours with the pc telling all about early track engrams and its this way and that way and ive got ta that is banging here from 25 to 425 back and forth and back and forth im afraid i would just sit there and i know some of you sit and acknowledge oh i wouldnt shut that off id just sit there and look intelligent i wouldnt acknowledge thingno interim acknowledgments once in while they look up and they seem brighter about it so i look brighter and nod what do you want to work so hard for you realize that were talking now about case level ii auditing because that is case level ii auditing but all youd have to do is let the pc start talking about his backtrack and get tone arm action and never give an auditing command start and end sessions thatd be all there was to the auditing session see itd get that elementary well of course it can get that elementary all the way down but the worse off they are the more their attention has to be directed the more particularized the process has to be the way to bypass charge is not let the pc tell you now theres the basic anatomy of what youre doing and it should make an awful lot of sense and if you were to teach somebody just to listen scientology i seeyou say well you should go listen to peoples problems theyll have some weird little wins youre not even teaching them to run an emeter see just to let somebody talk to you then eventually hell find out that theres talk and talk theres the talk that moves emeters and the talk that doesnt by that time theyd be pro learn to listen and youve got it made you got this all wrapped up and figured out and you see it and you got it taped now audience yes yeah well watch those dns and get that itsa line in thank you very much
