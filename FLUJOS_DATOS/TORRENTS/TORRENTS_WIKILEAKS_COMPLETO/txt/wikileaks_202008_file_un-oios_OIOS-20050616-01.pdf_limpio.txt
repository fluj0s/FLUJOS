social development ae200438401 executive summary from november 2004 to january 2005 oios conducted an audit of the united nations research institute for social development unrisd an auton omous united nations entity under the supervision of board and entirely funded by volun tary contributions the audit covered programmes and activities with total expenditure of 123 million from january 2002 to october 2004 the review also included an impact assessmen t of unrisd activities governance and funding issues unrisd was established in august 1963 by secretar ygenerals bulletin stsgb126 as part of the decade of development to conduct ov er period of three to five years research into problems and policies of social development u nlike other similar entities like unicri unidir and unssc it does not have statute result ing from general assembly or economic and social council resolution unrisd would consult with the department of economi c and social affairs on the relevant procedures after more than 40 years the stsgb that establish ed the organization and administrative arrangements for unrisd is in many aspects longe r relevant issued to govern an activity envisaged for short time the stsgb provided ad hoc arrangements that do not reflect the current status and activities of the institute and provisions relating to the board unrisd needs to seek clear mandate from the sg and prepare draf t of statute establishing clear objectives and governance structure which could be promulgated th rough revised stsgb unrisd concurs that its statute needs revisiting after so many yea rs and that it would help unrisd to codify number of practices that have developed over the ye ars the board has not fully exercised the supervisory functions stipulated in the stsgb the board meets only once year for one or two days nd there were absentees among the nominated members and representatives of the specialized agen cies unrisd should review the role responsibilities and composition of the board and s ubmit proposal to ensure its full accountability to stake holders unrisd stated that the frequency of the boards eting depended on the nature of the work of the institute unrisd is entirely funded by voluntary contribution s and funding has been unstable from the beginning unlike other independent entities th stsgb does not envisage any role for the board in fund raising while the core funding remai ned stable there were wide fluctuations in project funding the targeted 11 ratio for the cor and project funding was far from being achieved unrisd needs to formulate strategies to nhance core funding to multiyear pledges and to broaden the funding base for projects it shoul d consider involving the board in fund raising efforts unrisd stated that engaging board members directly in fund raising was unrealis tic and probably not healthy for the operation of the board unrisds linkages with the secretariat and other specialized agencies were ad hoc although they are important to make its research ac tivities relevant to the work of the departments and specialized agencies and to avoid d uplication unrisd needs to formulate strategy to establish clear and welldefined linkag with various departments and specialised agencies unrisd will continue to work in consultation with ther agencies and will work to strengthen the linkages substantive issues an oios impact assessment showed that the outreach activities of unrisd like disseminatin g its research papers and publications covered vast geographical area and had wide sup port from academic and research fraternity unrisd activities were very useful or often useful to the work carried out by most of the recipients of its publications who found the quali ty of unrisd research publications very good and its research relevant to contemporary developme nt debates the impact assessment pointed out the need for unri sd to more closely target policy makers in the and in national governments to create mo re awareness in the outside community on its activities and to focus on improving its media cove rage unrisd had clear strategy to target departmen ts and specialised agencies or their staff members the dag hammarskjold library and the unog library only had few unrisd publications in their depositories instead of com plete collection unrisd will ensure that all future publications are sent to these libraries and past publications to the extent possible administrative issues the role and responsibilities of the director are n ot been adequately defined in the stsgb the director is fully responsible for the managemen t and direction of the institute he is also responsible for fund raising and ensuring the susta inability of the institute the term of the directo r has neither been defined revised st sgb or s tatute should define clearly the role and responsibilities of the director including the term of office unrisd agreed that the role responsibilities accountability and term of office of the director should be established in revised stsgb aside from the seven per cent support costs that risd pays unog for administrative services unrisd has its own administration and fin ance support some of which could be better provided by unog unrisd should review the arrange ments with unog and reduce expenditures on inhouse administrative support according to the stsgb requests for the recruitmen t of staff should be initiated against posts authorised by the board in practice the director established the posts as and when required and only informed the board through the annual report unrisd should ensure that the board authorizes the posts before they are established an d filled june 2005 table of contents chapter paragraphs i ii iii introduction audit objectives

audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 unrisd is an autonomous entity created i n 1963 to conduct research into problems and policies of social development and relationship s between various types of social development and economic development during differe nt phases of economic growth the secretarygenerals bulletin stsgb126 dated 1 au gust 1963 defines the purposes and general organization of the institute and establish the arrangements for the provision of financial personnel and other administrative servi ces to unrisd 3 unrisd is entirely funded by voluntary contr ibutions board established by the secretarygeneral governs unrisd the board meets annually reviews the unrisd progress report and the administrative and financi report and approves the following years programmes and budget unrisds annual expenditure amounts to some 49 million in 2004 in december 2004 the institute had 20 staff members including 13 professionals 4 unrisd is subject to the audits of the board of auditors boa on regular basis the last boa audit was in may 2003 this is the first udit by oios the former internal audit division carried out an audit in 1992 5 draft of this report was shared with the d irector of unrisd on 22 march 2005 whose comments which were received in may 2005 have been reflected in the report in italics unrisd has accepted most of the recommendations mad and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to review the relevance of stsgb126 on unrisd the dequacy and effectiveness of the current governance structure and unrisds linka ges with other entities review the current funding arrangements and their s ustainability determine the effectiveness of management practices to achieve unrisds programmesprojects objectives and determine the adequacy and the effectiveness of int ernal controls to ensure efficient use of resources and compliance with regulations and rules iii audit scope and methodology 7 considering that unrisd is an autonomous entity and that it was the first oios audit the audit scope included comprehensive rev iew of its governance structure funding arrangements research and outreach activities and its administrative arrangements the audit covered the period january 2002 to december 2004 an d covered an expenditure of 123 million the audit focused on stsgb126 funding resources and its sustainability various 2 unrisd research projects and their outputs and unri sd outreach activities the audit reviewed the unrisd submissions to the board the m inutes of the board meetings the annual work programmes and the annual reports impo rtant research project reports and other relevant documents 8 the audit team interviewed the director and other key staff members of unrisd to solicit their views on the functioning of unrisd r eviewed on sampling basis various programme documents and financial and personnel rec ords oios also undertook survey and sent out questionnaire to list of recipient s of unrisds publications to get their rating and comments on unrisd research and outreach activi ties this survey was intended to make an independent impact assessment of unrisd res earch and outreach activities oios also held discussions with human resources officers at unog oios utilized the governance structure and other arrangements establi shed by the for other similar independent entities like the united nations system staff college unssc the united nations interregional crime and justice research in stitute unicri and the united nations institute for disarmament research unidir as exte rnal benchmarks iv audit findings and recommendations governance issues clear statute needs to be established 9 in january 1961 the united nations resolved that the decade of the 1960s would be the development decade in connection with this the government of the netherlands made special contribution equivalent of 1 millio n for the establishment and operation of united nations research institute for social develo pment the secretarygeneral accepted the gift and established unrisd according to the report of the secretarygeneral to the ga at its eighteenth session ac5936 dated 22 octob er 1962 the purpose of the institute would be to conduct over period of from three to five years beginning in 1964 research into problems and policies of social development the fifth committee in its report a5391 dated 19 december 1962 took note of the acceptance of the gift to be used for the establishment and operation of unrisd 10 the secretarygeneral established unrisd by issuing bulletin stsgb126 dated 1 august 1963 the stsgb mentions the purposes and general organisation of the institute including the establishment of board to supervise unrisd as well as the arrangements for the provision of financial personnel and other adm inistrative services unlike other similar independent entities like unicri unidir and uns sc unrisd does not have statute stemming from ga or ecosoc resolution 11 after 41 years stsgb126 still governs th functioning of unrisd according to the stsgb the institute is an autonomous activ ity and the arrangements made in 1963 to meet the requirements of the envisaged three to fiv years were ad hoc however the institute continued its activities over four decade s therefore in oios opinion the stsgb does not reflect the current status and activities of the institute many of the administrative arrangements longer correspond to the provisions of the stsgb in many respects the stsgb is longer relevant unrisd should seek clear mandate from the secretary general and prepare proper statute establishing c lear objectives and governance structure 3 recommendation head2right the unrisd director in consultation with its board and the department of economic and social affairs desa should seek clear mandate for unrisd and prepare draft statute with clear objectives and arrangements w hich could be promulgated in the form of revised stsgb rec 01 12 unrisd agreed that the unrisd statute needs revisiting after so many years and that it would help unrisd to codify number of practice s that have developed over the years upon receipt of this report unrisd would consult w ith desa on the relevant procedures oios will retain the recommendation for followup r elating to the revision of the statute of unrisd the role and responsibilities of the board needs to be reviewed 13 according to stsgb126amend1 the board is composed of 14 members ie chairperson appointed by the secretarygeneral fi ve members nominated by the social commission and confirmed by ecosoc representativ of the secretarygeneral the director of the institute for economic and social d evelopment planning of the economic commission for latin america and the directors of t he development planning institutes for asia and for africa the director of the economi c and social office in beirut the representatives of two of the following specialized agencies particularly concerned the ilo unesco fao and who occupying these seats accordin g to scheme of rotation the director of the institute exofficio 14 the composition of the board has significan tly changed over period of time the current board consists of 20 members ie chairp erson appointed by the secretarygeneral ten members nominated by the commission for social development and confirmed by ecosoc representative of the secretarygeneral representative of desa the director of the latin american and caribbean institute for conomic and social planning the director of the asian and pacific development centre the di rector of the african institute for economic development and planning the executive cretary of the economic and social commission for western asia and the representatives of two of the following specialized agencies appointed in rotation ilo fao unesco and the who the director of the unrisd exofficio the term of the each nominated member is four years renewable once for further period of two years 15 according to the stsgb unrisd is under th supervision of the board the board has to lay down general rules governing the act ion of the institute in matters entrusted to it b to review and approve work programmes and the r elevant budgets and c to submit to the social commission now the commission for social velopment regularly progress report on the work of the institute in practice the board met only once year for one or two days and there was formal supervisory arrangemen t throughout the year oios noted that even during the annual meetings several members we re absent unrisd stated that the frequency of the boards meeting depends on the nat ure of the work of the institute the average programme cycle of an unrisd project is 18 24 months not much requiring the boards decisions happens between the boards appro val of the project the acquisition of funds for the project and getting the research star ted and the completion of the research project itself 4 16 during the annual meetings the board appro ved the work progress report and financial and administrative report submitted by th director the minutes of the board discussions disclosed that the board focused on the substantive activities relating to the focus areas the ongoing research projects and their stat us issues relating to the financial and administrative areas were not adequately discussed unrisd clarified that the board is presented with the administrative and financial rep ort each year and there is discussion if questions are raised on financial or administrative issues unrisd further noted that the major concern of the board is funding levels rathe r than daytoday financial and administrative matters which are considered the res ponsibility of the director in oios opinion the board should function as fullfledge d governing body not only in the research activities but also to supervise and oversee the ac countability of unrisd to its stakeholders including its donors unrisd stated that the role of the board would be t aken into account in discussions with desa and the board in revision f the stsgb 17 unrisd is entirely funded by voluntary cont ributions and funding has not been stable from the beginning of unrisd oios also noted that unlike the other independent entities the stsgb does not envisage any role for the board in fund raising however oios learnt that some of the board members informally as sisted the director in his fund raising efforts oios believes that unrisd should consider active involvement of the board members in fund raising their collective and conc erted efforts could help ensure the sustainability of the institute unrisd did not agree with oios opinion stating th at to engage board members directly in fundraising is realistic and probably not healthy for the operation of the board first it would divide the board between members with relatively easy access to donor countries and institutions and thos that do not have access second it would tend to make board members focus on the programmes for whose funding they were responsible third it would be assigning to the bo ard an executive role of the director and would most likely lead to confusion among donors u nrisd in this context considers it important that one person is fully accountable for the finances of the institute unrisd further stated that board members often assist the institute in funding by indicating to unrisd where opportunities are and also individuall lobby certain donors on unrisds behalf but leave actual administrative contacts wi th the director 18 oios however noted that at unrisd donors meeting held in 1999 the donors had expressed their concern about their lack of involve ment in the board and had stated that what role might there be for donors in unrisd governance structure to find an acceptable balance between institutional independence and the desire of donors to be involved beyond their current role as sources of funds only thei r inclusion in the board needs to be considered however unrisd for three reasons did not be accept this suggestion unrisd stated that i one important guarantee of resear ch institutions autonomy is that those who fund the institute should not serve on the board t his is to avoid conflict of interests among funders themselves and to protect the image of the institute as truly independent research institution ii number of key funding organizat ions do not allow their staff members to sit on boards of institutions they fund and iii this would go against the basic principle that once members give money to the united nations the money s must be managed by agencies themselves while duly respecting normal accountabi lity requirements regular reporting auditing etc 19 oios also noted that all the board members nominated by the commission for social development are researchers of excellence in the sa social research field as unrisd this may pose risk that some may participate in or dir ect unrisd research projects resulting in 5 potential conflict of interest though unrisd assu red the auditors that there is an unwritten rule that board members could not be involved in an remunerated unrisd research projects oios believes that this condition should be formalized recommendation head2right the director of unrisd as part of the establishmen t of the statute should review the composition role and th responsibilities of the board and submit proposal to ensure unrisds accountability to its stakeholders the s tatute should determine whether or not board members shoul d be actively involved in fund raising efforts and shoul d include clause prohibiting the participation of board membe rs in unrisds substantive activities rec 02 20 unrisd maintains that the revised roles and respons ibilities of the board should not include fund raising while respecting the views of unrisd oios wishes to point out that the statute of unicri an independent research i nstitute approved by ecosoc requires board members to be involved in fund raising oios retains this recommendation awaiting the review of the stsgb andor statute of unrisd nd the envisaged future role for the board members that should not be decided without co nsulting the stakeholders linkages with other departments and specialized agencies 21 unrisds linkages with the secretariat nd other specialized agencies are important to make its research activities relevant to the work of departments and specialized agencies and to avoid duplication acco rding to the stsgb unrisd is required to coordinate its work with that of the secretariat and the specialized agencies however the stsgb had not established any formal working relationship or arrangements with any of the departments like desa or any of the specialized agencies it only included their representatives in the board on ro tation basis unrisd clarified that it was required to report to the commission for social dev elopment for which desa is the secretariat therefore unrisd is considered under t he jurisdiction of desa and maintains close working relationships with the undersecretar ygeneral of this department and the division for social policy and development it is also member of the executive committee on economic and social affairs ecesa unrisd considers that the excessive focus on formal arrangements detracts from the clos relationship maintained with other agencies on number of issues including organizati on of conferences copublications consultancy services etc 22 the evaluation report on unrisd commissione d by the nordic countries in 1997 had pointed out that as organisation unrisd is xpected to maintain special relations with the other agencies of the system the findings s temming from its research programmes on social development are envisaged to be fed into the policies programme and projects of any organisation however there are established procedures for how these relationships could or should evolve it seems that relations to the extent that they do exist have evolved in an ad hoc manner it also should be noted that many organi sations rather than relying on unrisd inputs into their activities hav developed capabilities of their own in this field emphasis added 6 23 review of the existing linkages indicated t hat unrisd had made some progress in establishing linkages with the departments and s pecialized agencies unrisd undertook initiatives to strengthen interagency li nks by promoting exchange of views on issues of social development among officials fro m various agencies however these arrangements and efforts in oios opinion continue to be ad hoc it was also noted from the minutes that the board had time and again reiterate d the need for coordination with departments and agencies for example the board h ad emphasized the need for unrisd to link its activities to the timeline and core themes of the millennium development goals mdgs unrisd needs to follow its linkage to mdgs unrisd replied that its work on social policy is recognised as highly relevant to m dgs 24 in order to maximize its impact unrisd sho uld develop comprehensive strategy to establish strong linkages with other departments and specialized agencies this would facilitate multi disciplinary approach and involv ement of others in its research activities this would also provide an opportunity for unrisd t be involved in major international activities organized by the and the specialized agencies in the field of social development recommendation head2right the director of unrisd in consultation with the boa rd should formulate strategy to establish clear and well defined linkages with the various departments an d specialised agencies to avoid any duplication of th research activities and ensure that the results of unrisd re search are widely accepted and utilised by the system rec 03 25 unrisd did not accept the recommendation but state d that unrisd would however continue to work in consultation with other agen cies and would work to strengthen the linkages oios thinks that unrisd could more effectively man age its linkages with departments and agencies and coordinate its work th rough more concrete strategy that clearly outlines its approaches and direction in veloping relationships as pointed out in the evaluation report oios retains this recommendatio n for followup of the strategy and results after one year b funding issues unrisd needs to expand its funding sources 26 unrisd is entirely funded by voluntary cont ributions unrisd receives two types of contributions i core funding to support the core activities of unrisd pledged annually from eight member states and ii project funding f or specific research and outreach projects in order to ensure effective research activities i n october 2002 the unrisd director had set target of achieving 11 in terms of core and proj ect funding 27 during the period under review the core fu nding remained stable whereas there were wide fluctuations in the project funding and the pr oportion of core to project funding was far from the targeted 11 ratio unrisd clarified that the11 ratio was selfimp osed target that unrisd knew from the beginning was moving target and that the target ratio was not for 7 single year but over reasonable period the graph below highlights the proportion of the core and project funding unrisd funding 20022004 000 us 2434 2730 2441 1146 2601 1439 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 2002 2003 2004 project core 28 fund raising has been one of the major resp onsibilities of the director and unrisd has been able to stabilise its core funding to li mited extent by getting threeyear pledge from the united kingdom and sweden however the ne therlands cut its core contribution to unrisd in 2004 therefore the funding situation tinued to be unstable the director with the active involvement of the board should formulat strategies to enhance core funding to multi year pledges and attract wider funding for th projects unrisd stated that the trends are encouraging and that quite reasonable level h as been achieved 29 in oios opinion unrisd needs to interact w ith the wider donors to present its activities and projects to enhance their interest i n unrisd activities oios noted that the donor meeting held in 1999 was good initiative h owever such formal interaction took place after that except onetoone visits and prog ress reports by the director to the core funding donors unrisd needs to meet with wider donor community periodically to enhance its donors confidence and win more funding recommendation head2right the director of unrisd in coordination with the bo ard should formulate fund raising strategy aimed at b roadening the funding base and obtaining multi year pledges f or core funding unrisd should also regularly organise dono r meetings to publicise its activities to enhance don or confidence rec 04 30 unrisd agreed that donor meetings should be organis ed but in conjunction with programme cycle ie every 35 years unrisd added that new programme of work for the next five years 20062010 had been approved by th board would be submitted to donors at the meeting to be organized this autumn but it cou ld not influence government or other institution to provide funding on multiyear pled ge unrisd further stated that in line with the new fiveyear research programme unrisd would incorporate fundraising strategy document which would include broadening the fundin g base oios will retain this recommendation for follow up of the outcome of th proposed donor meeting by the end of 2005 8 c substantive activities impact assessment survey results 31 oios noted from the annual reports and the board discussions that unrisd with the support of the board had developed sound res earch and outreach strategy and detailed plans for specific projects and publications in 20 04 unrisd had 10 ongoing research projects and during 20022004 period organised on verage 13 international conferences and workshops every year in addition to its inhouse r esearch capacity unrisd engaged consultants throughout the world oios noted from t he minutes of the board meetings that one of the problems faced by unrisd was to assess i ts impact due to the scarcity of feedback and the difficulty in monitoring the impact of its outreach efforts 32 in order to make an independent and objecti ve assessment of the impact of unrisd activities oios developed survey questionnaire the questionnaire contained questions relating to the quality and relevance of unrisd res earch publications how unrisd activities like publications research activities meetings and expert networks were useful to the activities of the recipients of the publication s the most relevant focus area of unrisd research areas and the impact of its dissemination efforts and so on oios obtained three electronic mailing lists maintained and used by unr isd to send electronic information on or copies of its publications from the list oios sele cted specific categories of addresses like the list of departments and specialised agencies na tional government departments list of universities and their libraries research scholars in the mailing list oios selected 706 email addresses and sent the questionnaire by emails th results of the survey are given below i out of the 706 copies mailed 268 mails returned due to invalid mail address unrisds mailing lists were not regularly updated nd the existing mailing information system needed comprehensive review ios also noted that unrisd sends most of its publications in printed ve rsion instead of electronic version which leads unrisd to update only the reci pients post mailing addresses instead of timely updates to their email addresses unrisd stated that the lists of email addresses provided to oios are not strictly essential to the purpose of these mailing lists and are therefor not systematically updated ii oios received only 45 replies which was 10 per cent of the 438 successfully sent copies however the respondents were from 26 countries representing wide geographical area ranging from east timor kuw ait south africa uganda peru usa norway and so on unrisd had w ide geographical coverage of its dissemination iii the responses indicated that unrisd was able t make significant impact among research and academic community like professo rs researchers students and libraries however the response rate from inte rnational organisations like and specialised agencies and various government representatives was only was only 15 per cent unrisd should look into the causes of this low response rate from policy makers 9 iv significant percentage 93 of the respondents described the overall quality of the unrisd research publications in terms of topic and analysis as excellent or good in comparison to the publications by the peer research institutes they also attested that the research programmes by unris d were very relevant to the contemporary development debates in the field f social development v to the question how important was unrisds work to respondent or the organization he or she represented good percenta ge 71 of them rated the work of unrisd as important to the work of their or ganization vi the outreach activities of unrisd that had grea ter impact was through the dissemination of its printed publications and websi the media coverage of unrisd activities requires improvement and oios rec ommended that unrisd review its dissemination strategy to improve its profile in the general media unrisd agreed with the recommendation but its impl ementation awaits the restructuring of its dissemination unit vii unrisd has been consistent in sending their pu blications and other research papers most of the respondents have been receiving unrisd publications for more than year and about 40 per cent have been re ceiving them for more than five years they were receiving more than three pub lications in year viii of the various focus areas of unrisd like ci vil society democracy gender equity economic policy ethnicity governance hea lth hivaids information technology social movement social policy sustain able development rural development etc the respondents found that the risd focus areas that were relevant with more than 60 per cent responses for their work are sustainable development gender equity civil socie ty and governance the focus areas with less relevance below 30 per cent responses were health hivaids information technology water summits and public sector ix almost all the respondents believed that unrisd had to create more awareness to the outside community on its activitie s some of the suggestions were more publications in regional or specialized p rofessional newspapers more language versions more online documents acce ss to more networks and increased coverage by mainstream quality media etc x unrisd books and copublished books unrisd rese arch papers and the newly introduced research and policy brief were pub lications that had major impact on the recipients 33 in addition to the survey results oios not ed the following issues relating to the research projects and the dissemination of its publ ications i in order to measure its research accomplishments unrisd utilised various outputs such as number of publications produced an d number of recipients and website visitors as performance indicators however oios believes that additional performance indicators that measure impa ct of its outputs like the number of citations of its research publication by peer researchers specific cases that policy makers formulate policies based on unri sd research works should also be emphasized on an adhoc basis unrisd kept manual records of 10 citations by peer researchers plus some adhoc queries to research citation database but these citations were not used for any meaningful evaluation purposes and for the setting of any further action plans though the number of research citations was included in unrisd report unrisd commented that while it does not have an automated citation monito ring mechanism in place the information it manually gathers assists disseminati on staff in determining priority areas for planning dissemination and allow s the institute to identify new outreach possibilities and further develop interact ion with academic journals general media outlets and universities oios recommended that unrisd as part of its selfevaluation mechanism develop and include resultorientated performance indicators in its substantive research and outreach activities unrisd agreed with this recommendation which it wo uld implement in conjunction with oios recommendation to review unr isds dissemination strategy to improve its media profile unrisd furt her stated that it had already acquired better performing web site indicators and is envisaging steps to acquire commercial citation information ii unrisd needs to do more to target the depart ments and the specialised agencies or their staff members oios found that th dag hammarskjold library and the unog library had only few unrisd publicat ions in their depositories instead of complete collection unri sd could further intensify its interaction with policy makers in the system by exploiting more interaction channels such as complete publication deposit in t he main and specialised agencies libraries and enewsletter circulation to staff oios recommended that unrisd provide complete depository of its pu blications to the main libraries of the and specialised agencies to max imise its impact on the policy makers unrisd accepted this recommendation and added that they would ensure that all future publications are sent to these libraries and past publications to the extent possible they further s tated that it had started working on production of cdrom containing all reports available to date and would be made available to libraries of the and specialized agencies unrisds expected delivery date of the c drom is july 2005 iii unrisd has three independent mailing informati on systems owl track media hound and email alerts database the first two wer used for printed documents disseminations and the third one for elec tronic dissemination different staff member maintains each system the udit found that there was redundant and invalid information the mailing lis ts need to be reviewed unrisd should consider integrating these three syst ems to avoid data redundancy shifting its main mailing method from s ending printed documents to more economic electronic mailing and updating its m ailing contents according to the personalized choices of the recipients unrisd agreed that both unrisd main mailing database and the media hound database could be integrated but pointed out that the unrisd email alert database h ad clearly distinct purpose from the unrisd mailing database and the dia hound database and should not be integrated with the first two iv unrisd maintained very active and userfriendly w ebsite all inhouse publications were available on this site free of charge unris d relied on an external it company not unog icts to host the web server and for data back 11 up internally however unrisd neither prepares i ts own disaster recovery plan nor test runs such plan information securi ty on this website should become priority of unrisd oios recommended that unrisd prepare and test run the disaster recovery plan of its website to ensure information security unrisd accepted this recommendation to further impr ove the security of its website and stated that given the restructuring of its dissemination unit it could not indicate an estimated date of completion d administrative issues the functions of the director 34 stsgb126 states that the director of the institute is appointed by the secretary general after consultation with the board or its ch airman and that the director serves as an exofficio board member however the stsgb does not mention the role and responsibilities of the director except for some p rovisions stipulating the director as responsible for the preparation of annual budget timates head of unrisd staff and as an initiator of request for staff recruitment accordi ng to the stsgb the board has the supervisory authority over the institute however the directors accountability to the board or his independence from the board has not been est ablished properly 35 over the 41 years of unrisds operations t he role and responsibilities of the director had evolved and currently he is fully res ponsible for the management and direction of the institute he is also responsible for fund r aising the stsgb had not defined the term of the director and procedures for the extension of his contract the current director was appointed for period of two years on 1 may 1998 nd has been renewed every two years thereafter his current contract expires by 30 apri l 2006 in oios opinion the term of the director should be predetermined to provide longt erm stability and to enable the incumbents to have strategic directions in oios opinion the review of the stsgb as recommended in recommendation 01 of this report should also includ the establishment of proper role and responsibilities for the director including the lection appointment term of office accountability and reporting line of the director recommendation head2right the director of unrisd in consultation with the bo ard and as part of the implementation of recommendation 01 of this report should submit to the secretarygeneral pr oposal to clearly establish the role responsibilities accou ntability and term of office of the director of the institute re c05 36 unrisd agreed that the role responsibiliti accountability and term of office of the director should be established in revised stsgb oios will retain the recommendation for followup of the revision of the stsgb arrangements with unog 37 on the administrative financial and person nel arrangements between unrisd and 12 unog stsgb126 stipulates that such service shoul d be provided without charge except printing and translation however over the period the situation changed and currently unog is charging 7 per cent of unrisd expenditures as support costs in addition to the it support costs charged to unrisd since 2003 for th years 2002 2003 and 2004 unog charged unrisd the amounts of 209700 273800 an d 322300 respectively for programme support costs furthermore for the tran sitory period in 2003 unrisd paid separately unog for it support cost of 97000 th from 2004 based on service level agreement sla signed on 14 january 2004 unogs c harges for it support is 98000 yearly for general service salary plus service lev costs for 31 personal computers totalling 15655 in addition unrisd estimates the costs f or the administration and finance support that it carries out itself at 493000 and 48050 0 for 2003 and 2004 respectively oios estimated that overall unrisd spends about 16 per c ent of its resources on administration and finance support 38 regarding its arrangements with unog unris d had not established any memorandum of understanding mou listing out the s ervices to be provided by unog except the sla in oios view some of the expendit ure incurred by unrisd for its own administrative and finance support could be better arranged with unog according to the new delegation of authority provided to unog by the controller unog is reviewing the level of support it is currently providing to vario us entities in the absence of an mou unrisd should renegotiate the service arrangements with unog list the type of service that unog should provide for the programme support charg ed and include some arrangements currently carried out by unrisd on its own recommendation head2right unrisd should review its administrative support arrangements to reduce its expenditure for finance and administration support and sign an agreement with unog for services it can provide rec 06 39 unrisd accepted the recommendation and stat ed that it is not possible to indicate timeframe for finalization of an agreement with g since this should be discussed after the revision of the statutes oios will close this recommendation as implemented when it receives copy of new agreement with unog human resources management 40 according to stsgb126 the director has uthority to recruit staff subject to the staff rules of the united nations and their service is limited to unrisd the stsgb also stipulated that the requests for the recruitment sh ould be initiated against the establishment of posts authorised by the board in practice the dir ector established the posts as and when required and only informed the board expost facto through the annual report oios also noted that all professional unrisd staff members we re employed under the 200 series staff rules which is meant for shortterm project person nel 41 unrisd staff members are governed by sta ff rules however unrisd has not established any formal procedures for promotion or upgrading the levels of the staff members during the review period the director requested og to reclassify two l posts l6 and l 5 and upgraded two staff members without any compe titive process furthermore unrisd 13 had annual performance appraisal system to evalu ate the performance of its staff members it was therefore not clear to oios on what basis th contracts were extended and not extended in some cases unrisd clarified that an upgrading of post is onl approved when change in the tasks justifies this thereby resulting in promotion of the incumbent as unrisd has small number of servicelimited posts it is not feasible to envisage an internal promotion procedure since an upgrading of the post would only be warranted if the tasks change recommendation head2right unrisd should establish proper staffing table to be approved by the board before initiating recruitmen ts in accordance with stsgb126 unrisd should also blish procedures for appointment and promotion and an ann ual performance appraisal system rec 07 42 unrisd commented that its board approves unrisds r esearch programmes but it has very little control over the size of the projec t or funding which determines the staffing requirements unrisd therefore does not agree that the staffing table should be approved by the board before initiating recruitments unless t his becomes mandatory in the proposed revision to the stsgb unrisd agreed that an annua l performance appraisal for all staff should be established and would examine procedures in effect in other similar institutions with view to implement such system this year oios will record this recommendation as implemented when it receives copy of the staffing table as authorized by the board in accordance with stsgb 126 and of procedures for ppointment promotion and performance appraisal hiring of individual contractors and consultants 43 unrisd has been hiring research assistants on an average of seven per year as consultants working in unrisd most of them work up to the maximum allowable 24 months within 36month period they perform routi ne research work which according to stai19997 requires the consideration of the blishment of posts unrisd also authorised annual leave which is not allowed for c onsultants unrisd should consider creating posts and recruit staff members if the req uirement is needed for longer duration unrisd explained that since the project cycle is ge nerally around two years and given the funding insecurity the budgetary implications of c reating posts with full staff entitlements would mean that unrisd could only envisage hiring 2 or 3 assistants on regular posts rather than 68 persons on consultancy basis 44 in addition unrisd also hired external res earchers as consultants to carry out or co ordinate research projects in different countries during the review period unrisd signed total of 464 consultant contracts including cts signed with research assistants in 2002 2003 and 2004 till 30 november 2004 however u nrisd does not maintain roster of consultants and the procedures for the selection v erification of experience and credentials and the fixation of the fees were varied and were not lways apparent on the available files the consultants were selected by the responsible resear ch coordinators unrisd should establish roster of consultants on global basis and ensure that the selection procedures extension and evaluation of performance are done in accordance with the stai19997 unrisd stated that it does not maintain roster fo r research consultants because unrisd 14 project staff are specialists in different fields nd have knowledge of who is doing what in their particular area roster assumes fixed po ol of consultants but given the continually changing nature of research unrisd cannot rely on fixed database oios does not consider roster as fixed pool but as tool to identify specialists from different fields in transparent manner 45 since 1997 unrisd hired retired staff mber as an individual contractor to advise the director on financial and personnel issues eve ry year the consultant worked parttime from january to june and full time from october to december the annual fee paid to the consultant was about 22000 in oios opinion mo st of the tasks performed by this retiree could be executed by imis irfa and some tailormade worksheet programmes unrisd agreed that certain tasks could be provided by irfa and specific worksheet programmes and that unrisd will look into this recommendation head2right unrisd should establish roster of consultants on global basis and establish more transparent procedures for their selection rec 08 46 unrisd did not accept to establish roster of cons ultants for its research work oios wishes to point out that roster of consultan ts provides reliable and uptodate basis for selecting consultants in transparent manner oios will consider this recommendation after it verifies the list of consultants maintaine d by unrisd other administrative issues 47 oios reviewed the grant agreement signed by the directorunrisd with the ford foundation according to the grant agreement the foundation is authorised to conduct audits including onsite audits at any time durin g the term of the grant and within four years after completion of the grant oios notes that aut horizing third parties to audit entities is not in conformity with the financial regulations unrisd needs to revise this agreement and ensure that stipulations of this natu re are avoided in the future grant agreements an amended agreement in conformity with financia l regulations was subsequently requested and signed in early february 2005 v further actions
