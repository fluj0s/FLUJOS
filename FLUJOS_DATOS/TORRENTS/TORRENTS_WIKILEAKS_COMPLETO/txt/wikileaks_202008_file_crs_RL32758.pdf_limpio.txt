vigorous pursuit of insurgents what are natos longterm plans to provide adequate forces for security and stability and offensive operations has nato secured commitments from nato members for tr oops and military resources for at least the next ten years or will nato continue to pass the hat to obtain forces needed for afghanistan does nato have comprehensive and effective counternarcotics plan for afghanistan and does nato have longterm strategy to transition all security and offensive military operations to the afghan government and its armed forces and police counternarcotics operations in afghanistan congress might act to review current administration and dod policy concerning the us military role in afgh an counternarcotics ope rations while the insurgency remains threat the performance of the ana and the progress made toward governance suggest that the afghan national government and coalition are successfully meeting these challenges some suggest that despite the progress made to date afghanistans burgeoning drug trade has the potential to undermine the afghan government and provide the taliban with the financial resources needed to perpetuate the insurgency indefinitely the current us military role in counternarcotics operations is limited to training planning support and the tran sport of police and troops the rationale provided in the past for limited us milita ry involvement in afghan counterdrug operations was that active involvement was not achievable given us force levels in afghanistan and that it could sig nificantly undermine its counterinsurgency campaign153 while the united states has gone from participation policy to supporting role critics suggest that more active role is now essential some suggest that us strategy in this regard is contradictory senior us military leadership describes the afghan drug trade as the most significant security problem facing afghanistan yet it appears that some believe that the us is ceding its responsibilities in counternarco tics operations at time that such efforts should be intensified httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32758crs25 154 henry chu plan colombia fails to stem cocaine supply angeles times september 18 2005 and steven dudley farc is on the run for now miami herald september 26 2005 africa longterm strategy and command arrangements it is possible that congress may explore in greater detail how africa not only fits into the administrations long term strategy for the war on terror but also what the administrations specific strategy is for africa if such strategy exists while combined joint task force horn of afri ca cjtfhoa has been in existence for almost three years little is publicly know n about these longterm commitments to the region in terms of overall strategy and what resources both military and financial would be required to implement such strategy particularly if the administration intends to expand operations to other african nations congress may also choose to review w ith dod the prospects for establishing separate regional command for africa while there appears to be number of arguments favoring such course of ac tion there are also political and resource issues that might be examined in great deta il security for such headquarters if it is placed in africa could also be sign ificant issue for discussion given the volatile nature of the region removing africa from us centcoms and us eucoms responsibility could also have po litical and resource implications abu sayaaf and jemaah islamiyah reports that abu sayaaf and jemaah islamiyah are developing training relationship and operational alliance suggest to some the potential for an increase in terrorist activities throughout southeast asia while the majority of these activities would likely be against regional governments the potential exists for attacks against us concerns and citizens in the region us military presence and ongoing operations in the region are considered by some as modest at best and might do little to deter attacks or assist u s regional allies in pursuing those responsible given this possibility congress might act to review the adequacy of us military forces in the region as well as their current mandate in terms of training nd advising regional military forces farc operations congress may decide to examine the pr ogress being made against the farc by the ustrained colombian military while reports of demobilization and peace talks by the other insurgent groups are considered promising by some others note that the farc continues its campaign against the colombian government adopting some of the tactics employed successfully by insurgents in afghanistan and iraq some reports also suggest that while colombian military operations against the farc have enjoyed degree of success that joint uscolombian count ernarcotics operations have done little to stem the supply of cocaine154 critics note that profits from drug operations finance the farc and suggest that drastically reducing narcoticsrelated profits would have significant impact on the farcs ability to sustain operations against the colombian military
