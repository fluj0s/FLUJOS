upon the old ways and thinking of the middle of the 20th century its voting system longer satisfy the 6157 billion people on earth the challenges are different and require world organization up for dealing with the needs of all these people during the past several years the earth government has been pleading the united nations leaders to make changes in the organizational structure and ways of doing things there has been an urgent need for fundamental changes in the united nations organization the decision of the united states government to invade the middle east nations and afghanistan has shown to be result of this incapacity for changes on the part of the united nations lack of leadership at the united nations is major threat to the security of the world the world wants true democratic world organization the is not the most fundamental requirement of world organization is democratic system of voting democracy must be priority the right that the greatest number of people has by virtue of its number 50 plus one is human right it should be respected the actual system of voting is undemocratic unfair and noone likes it it does not work earth government has proposed voting system based on democracy of the 190 member states of the united nations it takes only one of the five permanent members to overthrow any decision or proposal during meeting this means 1189 or 05 of the membership is more powerful than the remaining 995 if that is not dictature what is it it does not say much about democracy at the more like dictature of the five permanent members in the preamble of the charter of the united nations it says we the peoples of the united nations but in fact it should say we the five permanent members the voting system for earth government is very simple and practical one representative per million people if all countries in the world had decided now to participate with this process we would have today 6114 elected representatives to form earth government they would form the legislative body of earth government they could actually all stay home to govern or from some place in their communities today communications are more than good enough to allow voting and discussing issues etc through the internet and video conferencing that would cut cost of governing down to minimum at least administrative costs the executive body would also govern in this way to cut cost down to minimum ministers can administer their ministries from where they live if they wish to there will be place for the headquarters we will show that it costs very little to administer earth government and that we can achieve immense results there is limit to the good the earth government can achieve in the world think what can do unified 6114 billion people

political rights of country belong to that country alone democracy is not to be enforced by anyone and to anyone or to any community every community can and should choose the political system of their choice with the understanding of the importance of such right on the scale of human and earth rights on the other hand representatives to earth government must be elected democratically in every part of the world an individual country may have any political system at home but the government of that country will have to ensure and allow verification by earth government that representatives to earth government have been elected democratically this way every person in the world can claim the birth right of electing democratic government to manage earth the rights to vote and elect representatives to form the earth government in order to elect representatives to earth government it is proposed the following each individual government in the world will administer the election of representatives to earth government with an ngo andor members of earth government be allowed to verify all aspects of the process to the satisfaction of all parties involved b representatives be elected every five years to form new earth government c it is proposed here that there will be one elected representative per 1000000 people population of 100 million people will elect 100 representatives this process will create feeling of belonging and participating to the affairs of the earth community and earth government d typical community of million people does not have to be bounded by geographical or political border it can be million people living in many different locations all over the world the global community is thus more fluid and dynamic we need to let go the archaic ways of seeing community as the street where i live and contained by border many conflicts and wars will be avoided by seeing ourselves as people with heart mind and soul and as part of community with the same earth population is now 6114 billion people if all representatives had been elected this year there would be 6114 representatives to form earth government they would be the legislative elected body of earth government they would participate in some ways in choosing the executive and judiciary bodies of earth government humanity has now vision of the earth in the years to come and sense of direction may
