permanently authorized programs to help farmers r ecover financially from natura l disaster including federal crop insurance the noninsured assistance program nap and emergency disaster loans since 1988 congress has regularly made emer gency financial assi stance available to farmers and ranchers primarily in the form of crop disaster payments and livestock assistance the fy2007 iraq war supplem ental appropriations act pl 11028 as amended is expected to provide an timated 34 billion in emergency agricultural assistance for crop and livestock losses occurring in 2005 2006 or 2007 for which applications are still being accepted in order to provide regular supplement to crop insurance and nap payments the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill includes

primarily in response to the recent midwest floods and other disasters the fy2008 supplemental appropriations act p l 110252 contains total of 480 million in emergency funding to eligible farmers to defray the cost of cleanup and rehabilitation of farmland and watersheds following disaster ongoing major usda disaster programs over the years usda has had at its dispos three major programs designed to help crop producers recover from the financial effects of natura l disasters federal crop insurance noninsured assistance program nap payments and emergency disaster loans all three of these programs have permanen t authorization and r eceive regular annual funding federal crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas risk management agency the program is designed to protect crop producers from unavoidable riskshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21212crs2 associated with adverse weather and weatherrelated plant diseases and insect infestations producer who chooses to pur chase an insurance policy must do so by an administratively determined deadline date wh ich varies by crop and usually coincides with the planting season crop insuran ce is available for most major crops the federal crop insurance program was in stituted in the 1930s and was subject to major legislative reforms in 1980 and ag ain in 1994 and 2000 the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 pumped 82 billion in ne w federal spending over fiveyear period into the program primarily through more gener ous premium subsidies to help make the program more affordable to farmers and enhance farmer participation levels in an effort to preclude the need fo r adhoc emergency disa ster payments since 2000 the federal subsidy to the crop insura nce program has averaged about 33 billion per year up from an annual average of 11 billion in the 1990s and about 500 million in the 1980s nearly twothirds of the current federal spending is used to subsidize producer premiums and the bala nce primarily covers the g overnment share of program losses and reimburses participating private insurance companies for their administrative and operating expenses in recent years pr ogram costs have been increasing steadily mainly because premium subsidies and co mpany reimbursements are based on total premiums and total premiums have been rising in tandem with farm commodity prices under the current crop insurance program producer who grows an insurable crop selects level of crop yield nd price coverage and pays premium that increases as the levels of yield and price coverage rises however all eligible producers can receive catastrophic cat coverage without paying premium the premium for this portion of coverage is completely subsidized by the federal government under cat coverage participating producers can receive payment equal to 55 of the estimated market price of the commodity on crop losses in excess of 50 of normal yiel d or 5055 coverage although eligible producers do not have to pay pre mium for cat coverage they are required to pay upon enrollment 100 ad ministrative fee per covered crop for each county where they grow the crop rising to 300 per crop per county in 2009 as required by the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 the f ee can be waived by usda for financial hardship cases any producer who opts for ca t coverage has the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage from private crop insurance company for an additional premium paid by the producer and partially subsidized by the government producer can increase the 5055 catastrophic coverage to an equivalent level of coverage between 50100 and 85100 ie 85 of yield and 100 of the estimated market price in increments of 5 for many insurable co mmodities an eligible producer can purchase revenue insurance under such policy farmer potentially can receive an indemnity payment when actual farm reve nue falls below the target vel of revenue regardless of whether the shortfall in re venue was caused by poor produc tion or low farm commodity prices insured producers also can be eligible for reduced coverage if they are late or prevented from planting because of flooding for more informati on on the federal crop insurance program see crs report rl34207 crop insurance and disaster assistance in the 2008 farm bill noninsured assist ance program nap producers who grow crop that is currently ineligible for crop insurance may be eligible for direct payment under usdas noninsured assistance program nap naphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21212crs3 has permanent authority under the federal crop insurance reform act of 1994 pl 103 354 as amended and is administered by us das farm service agency the programs principal clientele are farmers who grow crop that is ineligible for federal crop insurance nap is not subject to annual appropriations instea d it receives such sums as are necessary through usdas commodity credit corporation which has line of credit with the us treasury to fund an array of farm programs eligible crops under nap include any comme rcial crops grown for food or fiber that are ineligible for crop insurance and in clude mushrooms flor iculture ornamental nursery christmas tree crops turfgrass sod quaculture and ginseng trees grown for wood paper or pulp products ar not eligible to be eligible for nap payment producer first must apply for coverage under th program by the application closing date which varies by crop but is gene rally about thirty days prior to the final planting date for an annual crop like catastrophic crop insuran ce nap applicants must also pay 100 per crop service fee at the time of applica tion rising to 250 in 2009 as required by the 2008 farm bill in order to receive nap pa yment producer must experience at least 50 crop loss caused by natural disaster or be prevented from planting more than 35 of intended crop acreage for any losses in excess of the minimum loss threshold producer can receive 55 of the average market price for the covered commodity hence nap is similar to catastrophic crop insura nce coverage in that it pays 55 of the market price for losses in excess of 50 of normal historic produc tion producer of noninsured crop is subject to payment limit of 100000 per person and is ineligible for payment if the producers qualifying gross revenues exceed 2 million nap payments were 110 million in fy2005 66 million in fy2006 and an estimated 154 million in fy2007 emergency disaster loans when county has been

title iii of the consolidated farm and rural development act pl 87128 as amended and is subject to annual appropriations traditionally an appropriation was made for em loans within the regular

revenue assistance payment pr ogram for crop producers the program is designed to compensate eligible producers for portion of crop losses that are not eligible for an indemnity payment under the crop insurance program ie the portion of losses that is part of the deductible on the policy an eligible producer can receive payment equal to 60 of the difference between target level of revenue and the actual total farm revenue for the entire farm the target level of revenue will be based on the level of crop insurance coverage selected by the farmer thus increasing if farmer opts for higher levels of coverage to be eligible for payment producer must be in or contiguous to county that has been declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture payments are limited so that the disaster program guarantee level cannot exceed 90 of what income likely woul d have been in the absence of natural disaster1 the producer also must have at least the minimum level of crop insurance cat coverage for insurable crops and participate in the nap pr ogram for noninsurable crops the statute makes an exception for the 2008 cr op year by allowing producers who did not purchase crop insurance or nap coverage in advance to be eligible for the program as long as they pay the equivalent administr ative fee for coverage within 90 days of enactment final payments for 2008 crop
