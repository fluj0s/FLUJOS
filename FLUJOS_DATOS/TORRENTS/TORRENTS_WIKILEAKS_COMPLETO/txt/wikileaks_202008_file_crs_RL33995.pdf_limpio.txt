wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl33995 surface transportation congestion policy and issues william john mallett resources science and industry division february 6 2008 abstract although congestion is being experienced throughout the transportation system including at ports and airports this report is limited to discussion of congestion associated with the surface transportation system highways public transit and freight and passenger rail because these modes connect with ports and airports there is some discussion of intermodal issues at these nodes as well but the report does not discuss congestion in the waterway or airway systems per this report begins by outlining in broad terms some of the issues that congress may face in the reauthorization debate this is followed by history of transportation congestion in the united states and how congress has dealt with the issue in the recent past it then goes on to discuss transportation congestion concepts measures and trends followed by information on the national costs of congestion the Ô¨Ånal section lays out some of the major types of congestion remedies that have been proposed by transportation engineers planners and policy makershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995 order code rl33995 surface transportation congestion policy and issues

summary surface transportation congestion most lik ely will be major issue for congress as it considers reauthorization of the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetea pl 10959 which is set to expire on september 30 2009 by many accounts congestion on the nations road and railroad ne tworks at seaports and ai rports and on some major transit systems is significant problem for many transportation users especially commuters freight shippers and carriers indeed some observers believe congestion has already reached crisis proportions ot hers are less worried believing congestion to be minor impediment to mobility th byproduct of pros perity and accessibility in economically vibrant places or the unf ortunate consequence of over reliance on cars and trucks that causes more important problems such as air pollution and urban sprawl trends underlying the demand for freight and passenger travel population and economic growth the ur ban and regional distributi on of homes and businesses and international trade suggest that pr essures on the trans portation system are likely to grow substantially over the next 30 years although transportation congestion continues to grow and intensify the problem is still geographically concentrated in majo r metropolitan areas at international trade gateways and on some intercity trade routes because of this geographical concentration most places and people in america are not directly affected by transportation congestion c onsequently in recent federa l law congress for the most part has allowed states and localities to decide the relative importance of congestion mitigation visavis other transportation priorities this has been accompanied by sizeable boost in funding for public transit and more moderate boost in funding for traffic reduction measures as part of patchwork of relatively modest federally direct ed congestion programs congress may decide to continue with f unding flexibility in its reauthorization of the surface transportation programs states and localities that suffer major transportation congestion would be free to devote federal and local resources to congestion mitigation if they wish similarl congestionfree locales would be able to focus on other transportationrelated problems such as connectivity system access safety and economic development alternativ ely congress may want to more clearly establish congestion abatement as national policy objective given its economic development impact and take less flexible and in other ways more aggressive approach to c ongestion mitigation three basi c elements that congress may consider are 1 the overall level of transportation spending 2 the prioritization of transportation spending and 3 conges tion pricing and other alternative ways to ration transportation resources with limited government spending congress also may want to consider the advantages and disadvantages of specific transportation congestion remedies hence this report discusses the three basic types of congestion re medies proposed by engineer s and planners adding new capacity operating the existing capacity

norman mineta stated that congestion is one of the single largest threats to our econo mic prosperity nd way of life1 in similar vein the transportation research board trb currently has congestion on its critical issues list as one of the most pressing pr oblems of the transportation system arguing if the 20th century can be called the era of building the 21st may be called the era of congestion2 more recently in january 2007 the us government accountability office gao for the first time placed tr ansportation financing and capacity on its list of highrisk federal programs and operations3 not

aces several environmental gr oups argue that congestion is less the problem than the over reliance on the cars and trucks that cause it indeed this over reliance on hi ghway transportation th ey believe leads to more important problems such as suburba n sprawl and air pollution furthermore because the problem is geographically concentrated most places and people in america do not suffer noticeable levels of congestion thus many might question to what extent transportation congestion is national problem warranting federal government response in uncongested regions transportation

connectivity system access economic velopment and congestion relief are some of the objectives of national trans portation policy that also include mitigating the negative effects of transportation such as deaths injuries and environmental damage according to 49 usc 101 the national objectives of general welfare economic growth and stability and security of the united states require the development of transportation policies and programs that contribute to providin g fast safe efficient and convenient transportation at the lowest cost cons istent with those and other national objectives including the efficient use nd conservation of the resources of the united states to accomplish these objectives the federal government regulates transportation activities and provides funding to encourage states and local governments to build and operate transportation infra structure since the beginnings of this federalaid system there have been major debates bout how these funds should be distributed and spent an underlying tension thr oughout these debates has been whether to distribute funds to encourage the pursuit of nationally defined transportation goals such as the building of the interstate sy stem or to distribute funds equally between the states according to predefined formula and allow them to pursue their own objectives4 in safetea about 90 of highway funds are authorized to be distributed by formula nd states are guaranteed by fy2008 fy2009 92 return on money paid into the highway account of the highway trust fund5 because transportation congestion is ge ographically concentrated congress has tended to favor state and local approach to solving transportation congestion in the recent history of the federal surface transportation program this has been accompanied by several sizeable boosts in funding for public transit and traffic reduction measures directed to major metropolitan areas in an attempt to curb the negative effects of cars and trucks includi ng road traffic congestion congress also has enacted patchwork of other programs to deal with congestion at the national level with some success but these have generally been relatively modest efforts consequently the flexibility provisions of recent federal laws and with them the equity provisions that attempt to return to each state the taxes paid by its highway users into the highway account of the highwa trust fund have largely left it to the states and in some cases metropolitan pl anning organizations to decide funding priorities the extent to which congress decides

followed by information on th national costs of congestion the final section lays out some of the major type s of congestion remedies that have been proposed by transportation engineer s planners and policy makers issues for congress most experts agree that surface transportation congestion has grown over the past few decades and moreover that th demand for surface transportation services is likely to continue growing over the next few decades according to one national assessment of highway congestion by the texas transportation institute tti total delay in 437 urban areas increased five fold between 1982 and 2005 and delay per peakperiod traveler almost tripled6 anecdotal evidence suggests that overcrowding is growing problem in some major transit systems and that conflicts between freight and passenger rail trains commuter and intercity are an issue for both in the freight rail industry the congressional budget ffice cbo notes that average speeds one indicator of congestion are lower now than at anytime since the early 1980s except for the 19971998 period following the merg er of union pacific and southern pacific7 with dramatic increases in foreign trade many fear that ports and border crossings have become significant bottlenecks to the flow of commerce despite these trends the question remains as to whether or not congestion is national problem and therefor should be specific goal of national transportation policy although congestion has intensifie d and spread congestion is geographically concentrated in major metropolitan areas at international trade gateways and on some intercity trade routes because of this geographical concentration most states and localities do not suffer any appreciable transportation congestion directly moreover some argue that even

restaurant or nightclub congestion is sign of success nd its costs must be balanced against the benefits of access to jobs st ores recreational amenities etc that congested regions provide10 environmental organizations generally argue that road traffic congestion results from an unbalanced transportation sy stem one that favors cars and trucks and that urban sprawl air pollution and noise not road traffic congestion per should be the focus of national policy11 the alternative view is that transportation congestion is major problem national in scope and if unchecked problem that w ill intensify and spread over the next 25 years many experts point out that although congestion may be highly localized because transportation is network that serves the us population in variety of ways its economic effects are national most obviously freight movement is largely dependent on national transportation network in which bottleneck in one place such as southern california may ffect businesses and consumers in largely congestionfree nebraska moreover thes experts point out the national network effects are becoming increasingly important as supply chains lengthen and become more complex similarly lthough passenger transportation is mostly local affair congestion on roads that service airports and other passenger terminals may also result in inefficient interc ity passenger travel dra gging down the productivity of businesses that rely on it for managing farflung operations local congestion may also be thought of as national issue in that the places where it is found tend to be the hubs of th national economy and its costs therefore are not inconsequential in terms of the national economy for instance the 28 metropolitan areas that experienced 40 hours or more of annual delay per peakperiod traveler as measured in 2005 by tti account for more than 45 of total personal income in the united states in 200512 most businesses rely to one degree or another on the

kirk with the largest labor markets nd to have the highest productivity13 consequently when added together the local costs of congestion some argue are significant in national terms another commonly expressed view is that given current trends in the supply and demand for transportation the problems of congestion will affect more people and more businesses in the future road tr affic congestion for instance is growing fastest in the smaller urban areas incl uded in the tti study though admittedly from small base however research by the federal highway administration fhwa shows wider problem when it projects future demand on the current highway system14 underlying these trends are broa der trends in population and the economy for example the population is expected to reach 364 million by 2030 an increase of about 20 from 200715 over the same period the cbo projects gdp to increase by about 70 in real terms16 furthermore the fhwa predicts that freight movements will nearly double between 2002 and 203517 the federal surface transportation program approach to congestion tends to view it as state and local issue not as major national problem at least as far back as passage of the intermodal surface trans portation efficiency act istea of 1991 pl 102240 congress has tended to leave to the discretion of the states within certain planning parameters the relative weight to be placed on congestion mitigation visavis other transportation priorities in this regard many argue that governments and other stakeholders closest to trans portation problems are in the best position to craft solutions another issue since th 1980s with the near completion of the interstate system has been the controversy regarding state payments to and from the highway trust fund htf known as the donordon ee debate18 this debate focuses on the perceived fairness of the rela tive size of each states payments to and receipts from the highway account of the hi ghway trust fund increasingly over the years federal law has atte mpted to equalize these amounts rather than concentrate funding where needs are greatest several new federal programs to tackle

transportation congestion would be free to devote fede ral and local resources to congestion mitigation if they wish similarly congesti onfree locales would be able to focus on other transportationrelated problems such as connectivity system access safety and economic development alternatively congress may want to take less flexible and in other ways more aggre ssive approach to conges tion mitigation three basic elements to the problem that congress may want to consider are 1 the overall level of transportation spending 2 the prioritiz ation of transportation spending and 3 congestion pricing and other alternative ways to ration transportation resources19 transportation spending levels the amount of federal funding for surf ace transportation programs is major issue during all reauthoriz ation debates and will undoubted ly be an issue in the reauthorization of safetea some observers contend that america is underinvesting in transportation infrastruct ure resulting in teriorating conditions and worsening performance including growing congestion20 one alternative to addressing transportation cong estion in this view is significant increase in the overall level of infrastructure investment to deal with the existing backlog of projects and future needs the most recent needs assessment by the us department of transportation usdot suggests that the cost to maintain the current condition and operational performance of the highway syst em is about 12 more annually than is being currently spent by all levels of government for transit the figure is 25 spending to improve conditions and reduce congestion would be greater than this21 it should be pointed out that as with any attempt to estimate current and future system conditions and performance there are host of simplifying assumptions omissions and data problems that influence the results nevertheless this analysis suggests that if total government spending is not increased above current levels the physical condition of system elements may decline and cong estion particularly highway congestion will continue to increase an alternative view of the overall leve l of government tr ansportation spending is that it has not been dramatically deficient in this view deteriorating performance and in some places deteriorating c onditions are the result of resources not beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs7 22 ibid exhibit 611 23 ibid exhibit 68 the federal share of high way spending as whole is lower currently about 22 of spending by all levels of government the

s hows that total government spending in highways and transit including capital spending has generally kept pace with usage since the early 1980s although the federal share has decline d capital spending by all levels of government on highways per vehicle mile has remained relatively constant since about 1980 at around 25 cents per ve hicle mile in real terms22 over this period the federal share declined from close to 60 to little under 40 at the end of the 1990s but has since rebounded to about 44 in 200423 in terms of the nations transit systems the usdot analysis shows that total government spending on cap ital and operations grew by approximately 80 between 1980 and 2004 in real terms much faster than passenger trips which grew by 1224 the federal share of total spending declined from 42 to 25 over this period25 the federal share of capital spe nding in 2004 was 39 somewhat lower than the approximately 50 shar that existed in the mid1990s26 in 2004 the federal government funded about 36 billion of highway and transit capital expenditure with 86 going to highways and 14 to transit27 the transit share increases to about 16 if all g overnment spending is included28 consequently assessments of highways nationally re veal that conditions have generally improved overall during the past decade particularly in rural areas but have declined in large urban areas29 similarly bridge c onditions have improved but to much greater extent in rural areas than in urban areas30 as noted above operational performance on the urban highwa system has generally declined but there are also growing pressures on the higher elements of the rural highway system especially rural interstates31 transit conditions and performance have remained about the same over the past decade but rail system performance has declined to some extent32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs8 33 testimony of carl d martland senior research associate massachusetts institute of technology

officials aashto transportation invest in america freightrail bottom line report washington dc 2003 at httpfreighttransporta tionorgdocfreightrailreportpdfsome experts however believe that inve stment in the freight rail industry fell behind demand at some point over the past decade or so leading to rail congestion and higher prices for shippers33 freight rail as predominantly private industry depends on investment received mostly from railroad profits or from money borrowed in capital markets to be paid back with future revenues one view is that these sources of investment will be adequa to cope with fu ture demand another view is that because of the great risks inherent in investing in rail infrastructure and the demands of shareholders the railroads themselves will not be able to supply the necessary capital to expand capacity in that case some contend that government financial assistance will be needed otherwise rail congestion will grow and more freight will be diverted to the roads34 as the case of the railroads reminds us not all transportation infrastructure investment comes from federal state and cal government the private sector is major source of investment and not just in rail transportation flurry of recent major privatization efforts such as the chicago skyway and the indiana eastwest toll road have increased interest in this approach thus some argue that there is need for much greater investment in tr ansportation but that the federal government should consider using its resources to verage private investment through public private partnerships others argue that these types of pub licprivate partnerships will be limited to only few places with the hi ghest profit potential and that investment could be quickly cut off if m acroeconomic conditions change transportation spending priorities with growing pressure on transportation infrastructure but competing claims on governmental resources another issue fo r congressional consid eration is improving the efficiency of federal investments some argue that prioritizing investments may be better way to deal with congestion mitigation than the scattershot moreis better approach several aspects of prio ritizing federal transportation spending to mitigate transportation congestion could be of interest to congress these are prioritizing projects by location and project type and the issue of modeneutrality inherent in these discussions of course is how project decisions are made and the ways in which the relationships between fe deral state and local governments affect the outcome this is another aspect of prioritization that may be of interest to congress continued federal transporta tion funding likely will be needed to maintain and operate the transportation system as whol and to meet other national transportation goals such as rural access urban mobility safety and national security however it can be argued that if mitigating congestion in the name of enhancing national mobility and economic productivity is national goal then federal funding will needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs9 35 puentes robert and linda bailey increasing funding and accountability

return those with the most congestion the three major locales of transportation congestion are major metropolitan areas some intercity trade routes and foreign trade gateways an oftcited argument for targeting fe deral resources toward congested places is that while the project costs of congestion mitigation are local the benefits at least in part are regional or national in sc ope in addition fixing transportation bottlenecks is very often hugely expens ive proposition and therefore beyond the means of single locality or state moreover many point out that in addition to the pecuniary costs of large transportation facilities costs associated with local environmental and social disruptions must be mitigated another aspect of prioritiz ing federal funding to mitigate congestion is the way in which projects are planned and funded within states and regions for the most part project development and funding deci sions are made by state departments of transportation dots metropolitan planni ng organizations mpos have assumed greater role over the years but not enoug h to fundamentally change the traditional federalstate intergovernment relationship that has ex isted since the beginning of the federalaid highway program35 one effect of this some have suggested is that highway funding tends to be funneled disproportionately toward rural areas at the expense of urban and suburban areas wher needs including congestion mitigation needs are greatest study of ohio found this to be the case because many municipal roads are ineligible for state funding state gas taxes are limited by state law to highway projects and state appor tionments are made equally to counties without regard to needs such as population miles of road and traffic volumes36 some of the same processes may also occur within metropolitan regions that comprise many local jurisdictions for instance some observers contend that local government officials are often more cerned about receiving their fair share of funding than they are about solving re gional problems such as transportation congestion mpos also tend in most instan ces to be dominated by suburban areas at the expense of center cities because voting power is often not weighted by population size37 of course weighted voting is guarantee that central city will not be dominated by surrounding jurisdictions wh collectively they comprise larger share of the regional populationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs10 38 us general accounting office surface transportation many factors affect investment decisions gao04744 washington dc june 2004 at http

comparatively easy and quick to implement by contrast major capacity expansion projects are typically controversial and can take decade or two to complete added to this is the fact that densely popul ated urban areas often have limited space available for major new infrastructure and that old and inadequate infrastructure can be very difficult and expensive to expand choosing among the types of strategies that provide the most costeffective reductions in congestion could be done in number of ways the most effective projects are likely to vary from place to pl ace and situation to situation requiring local solutions rather than national dictat however congress may require project alternatives to be chosen after an asse ssment of the full benefits and costs with congestion mitigation and economic fficiency as high priorities39 major study of transportation in the united kingdom found that projects aimed at relieving congestion offer remarkably high returns with benefits four times in excess of costs on many schemes even once environmenta l costs have been factored into the assessment40 different approach is perfo rmancebased assessment in which federal standard or goal is set such as certain level of c ongestion reduction freeing state and local governments to determine the most efficient way of meeting the goal41 another important issue with respect to prioritization is mode neutrality traditionally federal surface transportation funding has been focused on highways and transit this has made it difficult to fund projects involving modes that fall outside these categories such as freight rail or multimodal projects42 program changes have been made over the years to allow greater flexibility but some arguehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs11 43 surface transportation

lic investment for private investment with net gain for the transportation system or that such assistance may provide some businesse s an unfair advantage over others mode neutrality in transportation congestion mitigation is still an issue in the relative balance between funding highways and transit some argue that highway congestion cannot be solved by buildin g more highway capacity or otherwise improving service because this only encour ages or induces more people to travel by highway thereby restoring the same or an even higher level of congestion instead they contend that alternatives such as public transit in concert with land use measures to encourage the use of alterna tive modes of travel are the only way around congestion43 others argue that so few people use transit to get to work and even fewer for other reasons that major new investments in transit capacity except in limited number of situations are not likely to reduce highway congestion appreciably if at all44 the problem and empirical measurement of induced demand are central element in many of the debates about road traffic congestion the theory of induced demand suggests that building more road capacity will not solve road traffic congestion because it merely induces travel ers using other modes driving on other routes or driving at other times of the da to travel on the new facility during the peak period resulting in congestion as bad as that suffered before the expansion45 some suggest it is even possible for congestion to become worse in the long run after road is built or expanded because the new capacity encourages more development resulting in pr oportionally more drivers th an the new capacity added46 attaining definitive answer to this stion is difficult because of the confounding factors of regional trends in population and employment gr owth and other things that lead to changes in transportation habits47 however several studies show that although induced demand is real it typica lly takes number of years for the new capacity to be absorbed suggesting that new capacity can reduce congestion in the medium term48 moreover other experts note th at while congestion may

still serve more travelers than before even if service qua lity is poor and the increase in travelers on the new or larger facility may take pressure off other facilities improving travel over the whole network49 congestion pricing and other alternative ways to ration resources many economists argue that transporta tion congestion is caused by the way in which service is rationed in highway transportation for example because the marginal cost of driving is so low cong estion is the main method for rationing peak period roadway space peakperiod road way space is in great demand for deep seated reasons that have to do with the need for facetoface interaction in economic and social situations thus at certa in times and in certain places demand for roadway space exceeds supply nd vehicles have to queue for the next available space to open up it is argued that road tr affic congestion could be reduced by using different rationing methods one approach is to limit roadway space to certain types of vehicles or vehicles carrying certain number of passengers such as buses or highoccupancy vehicle hov lanes anot her method is to ban vehicle or driver from driving at certain times for one or more days week the method generally favored by economists however is to use some sort of pricing mechanism known as congestion pricing or value pricing its supporters argue that not only does road pricing have the potential for solving conges tion it also promotes the most efficient use of highway infrastructure detractors argue that road pricing unfai rly favors higherincome drivers may cause severe mobility problems where reasonable alternative exists and may if it raises the cost of traveling in the most dense urban areas lead to more sprawl and highway congestion farther out from the ur ban core another argument against tolling in general of which congestion pricing is one form is that drivers have often already paid for the infrastructure and its maintenance through ta xes and fees and so it amounts to form of double taxation consequently some suggest that such strategies should be used only to fund and manage new capacity or should not be used at all demand for transit service in large cities is typically more concentrated both in time and by direction than demand for hi ghway travel the result can be vehicle overcrowding service denial and because overcrowding tends to increase vehicle dwell times ie time spent at station or bus stop to discharge and pickup passengers overall slower speeds despite this most transit agencies do not

might persuade some travelers to tr avel during less busy periods even where higher peakperiod fares are employed how ever they are not usually high enough to substantially reduce demand peaking proposals to introduce differentiated fare schemes to reduce overcrowding or in places that have them to raise fares even higher at congested times or places are often viewed skeptically as way for transit agency to generate more revenue pa rticularly from transitdependent travelers others fear such schemes might push public transit users to drive instead causing greater highway congestion in freight rail transportation prices r rates as they are more commonly known are already the main mechanism us ed to manage suppl and demand rates reflect the cost of providing freight rail service and demand mand for rail service is largely function of the overall streng th of the economy and the ability of rail transportation to compete with other modes particularly trucks and barges with strong demand and constrained supply economic theory would suggest all else equal that rates will increase providing greater resources for investing in expanding supply although the situation is complex because not all else is equal the evidence suggests that with greatly improved produc tivity and strong demand the financial health of the railroad industry has improve d substantially since deregulation this has allowed railroad companies to make significant investments to maintain the current system and to increase capacity in some places51 nevertheless there is widespread concern that the railroads will not be able to make sufficient investments to keep up with demand52 number of reasons have been posited for the inability of railroads to invest sufficiently in new capacity to keep up w ith demand clearly expanding capacity is slow process meaning it may take d ecades for supply and demand to find an equilibrium if it ever does moreover in many congested urban areas railroads find it difficult to acquire land for new capacity53 port areas that could benefit from new rail lines and terminal f acilities are notoriously space constrained the railroads argue that they suffer several inequities that hinder their ability to finance new capacity the railroads note that unlike truc king and barge firms they provide their own infrastructure and must bear the longt erm risks associated with owning fixed assets furthermore they argue other mode s pay less in taxes and fees than their usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs14 54 cbo 2006 55 ibid p20 56 ibid 57 illinois

their ability to compete for financing in capital markets55 in this context number of public polic alternatives have been suggested to alter the current rationing of public and private resources one controversial proposal is to impose greater taxes and fees on truck and barge companies to level the playing field with railroads another is to pr ovide government assi stance to railroads to mitigate some of the risks they face with the goal of increasing the level of investment and accelerating its current pace56 on the other hand some contend that the railroads ought to make greater financial commitment to solving problems where they impose high external costs such as places where rail operations contribute significantly to highway cong estion for example in 2002 northeastern illinois was

such as grade separation projects however tend to be relativ ely small share of the overall cost final consideration in the rationing of resources is what might be called the costs of debate review and approval some argue that the costs of complying with federal state and local regulation stemming from th multitude of planning environmental and community involvement laws have substantially increased project costs since the 1960s these costs include the direct compliance costs of staff time and the indirect costs of pr oject delay that results in foregone opportunities in terms of

transportation congestion meant road traffic congestion the ra pid rise of motor vehicle ownership particularly with the introduction of fords model t in 1908 together with rudimentary road and traffic control system s made urban road traffic congestion major transportation problem by the 1920s60 federal state and local governments responded with significant roadbuilding ffort in this period

use was widely di scouraged public transit ridership boomed again during this period reaching an alltime high in the united states in 1946 of 234 billion trips61 however car ownership and mo tor vehicle travel rose rapidly after the war causing another bout of concern with road traffic congestion particularly in and around cities62 congestion and the threat of future congestion were among the reasons cited by presid ent eisenhower in his push to create the interstate highway program63 although he was against th idea of urban interstates preferring instead bypasses that would llow through traffic to avoid the central cities nevertheless the cities themselves were insistent that urban interstates were needed to solve urban congestion problems and congress obliged in the federalaid

p a1public transportation public transportation conges tion has not been major issue since the end of the second world war when transit ridership wa s at an alltime high on the contrary the major issue particularly through the 1950s and 1960s was the overall lack of riders resulting from increases in moto r vehicle ownership suburbanization and other changes in work and leisure67 by the early 1970s transit ridership was only quarter of what it had been at its peak in 1946 dropping from high of 234 billion trips to low of 65 billion trips in response many streetcar systems were abandoned in favor of diesel buses and pr ivately owned and opera ted transit systems were taken over by public authorities public transportation has undergone something of resurgence since the mid1970s with the building of number of new rail systems particularly light rail but also heavy rail and commuter rail since then transit ridership has increased mode stly to about 10 billion trips in 200568 to put this in context however the proportion of all trips made on tran sit declined by half between 1969 and 2001 as trips by other m odes particularly in personal motor vehicles increased to much greater extent69 although not as widespread as road traffic congestion peakperiod transit overcrowding has become an issue in some cities with large numbers of transit commuters and heavily congested roads nd railways such as new york chicago san francisco washington dc and bo ston peakperiod overcrowding on the subway in washington dc for instance s led to proposals for substantially higher fares at the most heavily used times and stations70 in addition because most transit buses do not run on roads with contro lled access eg highoccupancy vehicle hov and bus lanes road traffic congestion also affects bus riders freight transportation until relatively recently congestion has not been major issue in freight transportation the building of the interstate s together with the existing rail water and pipeline systems provided adequa surface freight capacity from the 1960s through the 1980s according to many analys ts the biggest problem at this time was antiquated federal regulation from laws

highwa capacity does not any longer seem promising road to increased highway efficiency80 congressional leaders also expressed the c oncern that solutions to transportation problems that encouraged more driving w ould lead to more air pollution thereby undermining the provisions of the recently enacted clean air act amendments of 1990 caaa pl 101549 third major cern was that scarce resources should be used first and foremost to maintain and improve the current highway system over system expansion rather than design new roadbuilding program leaders in both the house and the senate sought

was authorized to provide ne w funds for projects to help states and localities meet the requirements of the clean air act amendments caaa of 1990 funding was aimed pr imarily at reducing pollutant s

concepts measures and trends transportation congestion exists when demand for transportation facility or vehicle is greater than its capacity and the excess demand causes significant drop in service quality such as speed cost and comfort depending on the mode and specific situation for exampl when too many drivers compete for road space the result is usually significant drop in tra ffic speed but also hi gher vehicle operating costs and with bumpertobumper stopa ndgo conditions an increase in driver stress in freight railroa d transportation train speeds may suffer when demand begins to reach capacity and because shippers di rectly pay for access to rail infrastructure higher rates theoretically ma be another indicator of congestion depending on the situation congestion in public transit may result in vehicle overcrowding possibly resulting in service denial and reduced passenger comfort slower vehicle speeds and higher peakperiod fares from the viewpoint of multimodal passenger trip or freight shipment the possibility for congestion exists not only within each mode but also in the connections between modes poor or overstretched intermodal connections are another part of the transportation system that may damage service quality moreover inefficient intermodal connections may cause problems within mode as unexpected delays interfere with other trips and shipments farther down the line for example delayed shiptotruck transfer in ma jor metropolitan area may result in the truck traveling during peakperiod traffic ideally transportation congestion shoul d be defined and measured from the perspective of the end user traveler or freight shipment congestion therefore could be measured by the extent to wh ich excess demand slows or otherwise harms passenger trip or freight shipment from the origin to the destination94 in some situations such as the transportation of p ackages by an express carrier such as ups and fedex it may be possible for the carrier to collect data and monitor movements for business purposes however in most situations for public policy purposes because measuring trips from origin to destination is difficult to accomplish in large scale and meaningful way measures of congestion typically focus on service problems within mode moreover within each mode many measures of congestion are limited to specific transportation facility this is especially the case in highway transportation for example highway engin eers typically refer to speed or level ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs28 95 taylor 2002 96 elgeneidy ahmed m and david m levinson may 2006service on particular road segment measurements on these segments are then sometimes aggregated to develop systemwide measures of highway congestion modespecific and facilityspecific measures of congestion are not wholly satisfactory indicators of capacity problems in transportation service because they fail to measure aggregate impacts across the whole system on the other hand some transportation experts have noted that the focus on facility congestion instead of the effect of congestion on passeng er and freight trips may also overstate its importance for instance freeway congestion may not be as bad as it seems if seen in the context of an entire automobile commute trip including the time it takes to park and walk to the office95 similarly it might be true that the effect of freight bottlenecks might not be as bad as is generally believed if seen from the pers pective of the entire supply chain whether facilitybased or tripbased nother criticism of transportationbased congestion measures is that they ignore the landuse context within which travel is taking place in transportation planning parlance they measure mobility but not accessibility accessibility explains the see ming paradox of why the most congested places are also the most ec onomically vibrant even when the congestion is long lived manhattan for example may be one of the most congested places on earth but it also provides access to an enormous number of opportun ities in terms of homes jobs retail outlets restaurants r ecreation etc study of accessibility in minneapolis mn for example found that while traffic congestion more than doubled between 1990 and 2000 measured in annual delay pe r person access to opportunities by car in this case the num ber of jobs increased more quickly96 seen from this perspective the performance of the transportation system in concert with landuse actually improved in the 1990s rath er than deteriorate d as congestion data alone would suggest unfortunately as it stands today national data do not exist to examine the effects of congestion on accessibility as oppos ed to mobility nor do we have the means to examine the effects of congesti on on passenger trips nd freight shipments from endtoend including the efficien cy of intermodal connections the transportation congestion measures employed in most instances including in this report are both facility and modallybased with the inadequacies this entails several measures of congesti on particularly in freight rail and public transit are gross indicators of capacity

pdfmeasures and trends in road traffic congestion efforts to define and measure road tr affic congestion have increased over the past few decades as congestion itself has grown97 still congestion has proven difficult to measure at the national level be cause of the size and diversity of the highway system and because traffic problem s can occur anywhere at any time of the day or night for number of different reasons moreover what constitutes congestion problem is highly subjective one frequently cited national road traffic research effort is the urban mobility program at the texas transportation institute tti tti defines traffic congestion as an excess of demand in relation to supply or capacity such that travel speeds are slower than normal where normal is defined as freeflow speed tti derives travel speeds by relating the theoretical capacity of roadway segment to the average number and type of vehicles traveling the segment speed estimates are then used to calculate travel delay tti uses data from fhwas highway performance monitoring system98 travel delay measures the extra time it takes to make trip and can be expressed in several different ways such as total delay delay per traveler and as travel time index the travel time index measures the ratio of travel time in the peak period to travel time at freeflow conditions thus travel time index of 135 indicates 20 minute freeflow trip takes 27 minutes in the peakperiod in related research tti is developing measures of travel time reliability travel time reliability measures the variability of travel times when the highway system is unreliable travelers and shippers must build in extra time to avoid being late tti measures travel time reliability via its buffer time index bti the bti measures the extra time needed to ensure that traveler or freight shipment will arrive on time according to predetermined standard typi cally 95 of trips bti of 43 for instance indicates that traveler needs to add an extra 43 to the average travel time of trip to arrive on time 19 out of 20 times 95 of trips99 some suggest that reliability is more important to both travelers and shippers than average delay it seems reasonabl to propose that most commuters would prefer to spend an extra 5 minutes to and from work each day than to endure an unexpected delay of 50 minutes on just one journey week delay causing problems with arriving at work on time or picking up child from school or daycare similarly shippers often place greater value on being able to predict reliably when shipment will arrive than on the speed with which it got there in some cases such as justin time manufacturing and distribution operations shippers and carriers can face penalties for making late or in some cases

and in some cases reliability at specific places such as bottlenecks100 truck bottlenecks101 and border crossings102 as well as roads on the federally adopted national highway system103 the fhwa is using similar measures to examine congestion on major travel corridors defined by interstate routes such as i5 traversing california oregon and washington however in this research pr ogram fhwa is using data collected from trucks themselves using global po sitioning system gps technology104 one of the main criticisms of ttis work on urban road traffic congestion is that it does not directly measure congestion in any urban area but relies instead on estimates of congestion based on number of theoretical relationships for time this meant that tti was unable to account for improvements in speeds resulting from operational improvement s such as freeway entrance ramp metering incident management programs and traffic signal coordination programs nor the effects of public transit tti has since begun incl uding these variables in its models but the overall criticism that its estimates of congestion are not direct empirical measurements still stands another major criticism has to do with the estimation of congestion by comparing traffic speeds to freeflow conditi ons number of experts point out that such models can never fully account for i nduced traffic and that as problematic as this may be theoretically as practical matter eliminating congestion for all peak period travelers is wholly unrealistic because the co sts would be overwhelming thus congestionfree peakperiod

national laboratory temporary losses of highway capacity and impacts on performance phase 2 oak ridge tn october 2004 at http wwwctaor nlgovfor105 moreover using freeflow speed in the calculation of congestion can lead to some results that do not square with reality for instance if widening road improves the peakperiod average speed but is accompanied by proportionally greater increase in the speed limit the calculated amount of congestion will increase after the improvement in ddition small change in average conditions such as decrease of few miles an hour may appear to be significant congestion problem when measured over large number of drivers106 empirical research on the relationship between freeway speed and vehicle flow shows maximum vehicle throughput at so mething less than freeflow speed about 50 miles an hour this too brings into question congestion calculation based on freeflow speed as figure 3 shows when there are few vehicles traveling on freeway segment as might be the case very early in the morning average speeds are high at about 60 miles per hour mph but overall throughput is low at around 300 vehicles per lane per hour as volumes build vehicle throughput increases to around 1800 vehicles per lane per hour and averag speeds decline by about 10 to 15 mph at this point as the number of vehicles coming onto the road continues to increase the volume of vehicles begins to overwhelm capacity and speeds decline precipitously as speeds decline in this instance vehicle throughput declines107 overall this line of criticism concludes that estimating congestion using the unattainable ideal of freefl ow conditions and with it the costs of congestion see below tends to overstate its impact on society this and other criticisms notwithstanding the tti estimates of urban road traffic congestion are widely used because they provide the only national pictur of road traffic congestion on an annual basis and hence are useful for mon itoring changes in congestion over time nevertheless figure s purporting to quantify the billi ons of hours of time lost and their associated monetary value numbers often used in newspaper headlines to dramatize the problem ought to be viewed somewhat skeptically very important finding from the work by tti and others is that both roadway demand and roadway capacity are subject to shortterm and longterm variations demand varies by day of w eek time of day and season and in response to planned special events such as professional football games music festivals and the like most road traffic congestion occurs on weekday mornings and evenings because of trips associated with jobs and school roadway capacity on the other hand is defined by the type of facility number of lanes access etc its condition and by events that may temporarily reduce capacity such as traffic incidents work zones weather railroad crossings toll facilities nd commercial truck pickup and delivery in urban

periods when the number of trains running on the track begins to reach the design max imum known as line capacity and passenger loads affect station dwell times137 when running at full capacity the

while commuter rail and heavy rail grew by 51 and 33 respectively light rail ridership almost tripled during these years because of the construction of several new systems138 although all urban areas

measures of congestion are average vehicle utilization as m easure of vehicle overcrowd ing and average operating speeds as measure of system congestion139 vehicle utilizati on as measured by the usdot is calculated as the ratio of the total number of passenger miles traveled annually on each mode to total number of vehicles operated in maximum scheduled service in each mode adjusted for the passengercarrying capacity of the mode in relation to the average capacity of the nations motorbus fleet140 the usdot notes that these two variables are related as changes in the capacity utilization of rail vehicles have influenced these vehicles operating speeds through changes in dwell times as vehicles become more crowded they take longer to unload and load increasing wait at stati ons and

highway tr ansportation works decisions about accessing the rail system are controlled by central authority each railroad that determines when shipment will be transported and for what price thus capacity problems tend to appear in different fo rm than they do on the highways and must be measured in different ways moreover because the rail system is primarily private the government has chosen not to collect and publicly disclose detailed data related to congestion as result some indications of congestion problems are impressionistic and anecdotal figure 7 transit vehicle utilization

congestion in the rail industry therefor is freight rates unfortunately understanding the relationship be tween capacity and prices is difficult as best rates are affected by any number of other vari ables including the competition of other modes morever rates can be regulated after the fact to protect captive shippers capacity problems may also result in deterioration in service quality or service at all for example in some cases there ma be promise to transport shipment at certain price but this shipment may be delayed as the operating railroad waits for space on the network in other cases some shipments may be denied access to the system completely and will have to travel by another means of transportation in theory centrally controlled access to the rail system should avoid the queuing seen on highways however in practice delay and unreliability do tend to increase as the number of trains on the system reaches maximum capacity this derives from the complexity of determin ing the timing and routing of trains with different dimensions such as single or doublestacked containe rs carrying different commodities over long distances and the rules that must be followed to ensure that trains do not collide particularly in places that are not signalcontrolled in addition tight schedules can be upset by unforseen incidents such as accidents bad weather and breakdowns and by interfere nce with passenger trains that by federal law are supposed to have prior ity over freight trains publicly available measures of freig ht rail congestion are traffic density speed and freight rates n one of these conclusively proves that congestion is problem because they are all influenced by other things such as efficiency gains derived from improved technology traffic density as the association of american railroads aar notes measures the average systemwide freight carrying utilization of the railroad track infrastructure higher figure indicates greater utilization efficiency but can si gnal the risk of congestion143 speed can be measured by average train speed or by net tonmiles per train hour freight speed again slower speeds might be an indicati on of congestion problem but

transportation congestion the negative effects of transportati on congestion are pr imarily economic transportation congestion par ticularly road traffic congestion also causes good deal of stress in some of those that ex perience it as well as certain amount of environmental damage because of the extra fuel that is used congestion may also have negative effect on road traffic safety although it is not clear from the available evidence if the damage done as result of slowing or stopped vehicles outweighs the reduction in crash severity due to lower speeds however the main effects are an increase in direct user costs particularly the extra time and fuel expended and number of economic distortions that d ecrease productivity and hurt competitiveness most of the available evidence on the costs associated with transportation congestion is limited to the effects of road traffic congestion little is known about the national costs associated with rail tr ansit and intermodal congestion hence if accurate existing estimates focusing excl usively on the costs of road traffic congestion understate the total cost of transportation congestion to the national economy it must also be borne in mind th at estimates of the cost of congestion are based on assumptions that are somewhat arb itrary time an important variable in transportation evaluation studies can be especially hard to value151 the direct user costs of road traffic congestion are the extra time and fuel expended to complete trip in its study of 437 cities tti estima tes that drivers lost 42 billion hours to road traffic congestion and wasted an extra 29 billion gallons of fuel at cost of 782 billion152 most of the cost is due to the time lost by travelers per traveler the cost is 710 annually or approximately 3 per work day in inflationadjusted terms the cost of congestion has risen from 149 billion in 1982httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs47 153 transportation research board economic

chief economist of the u s department of transportation adds ttis continuedin constant 2005 dollars these estima tes however do not include the cost of unreliability in that traveler s will often budget extra time to make sure they arrive on time even if it means arriving early in addition to direct user costs there are at least three other types of economic costs associated with congestion153 logistics costs the extra costs associated with businesses having to carry extra inventory as resu lt of slower and more unreliable transportation market scale and accessib ility costs as congestion reduces the area that can be served by pr oduction facility the reduced demand results in higher unit costs because of lowerscale efficiencies and lower access to specialized inputs business cost of worker commuting the costs associated with attracting and retaining workers and compensating them for higher commuting costs there may so be lower labor productivity resulting from the stress of longer or more unreliable commutes although not quantified congestion in other modes also has costs as demand for space on the rail system increases rates may begin to rise increasing shipper costs in addition railroads have been keen to accommodate generally more lucrative intermodal shipments over bulk shipments this is beginning to create significant problems for the movement of bulk shippers in some markets at certain times as they often have alternative to moving their goods by rail congestion on the rail system may also force more freight to move by truck some contend that there are number of public benefits associat ed with moving freight by rail such as less air pollution per tonmile of freight than trucking154 similarly congestion and overcrowding in passenger rail transportation and public transportation may divert travelers to other modes in urban areas congested transit service may lead to more singleoccupant driving during the peak period causing more road congestion likewise congested intercity rail transportation might shift few travelers onto the roads although it may shift them to interc ity buses or airplanes depending on the situation it is commonplace these days to attemp t to quantify the costs of congestion and add them together to arrive at total cost of congestion to the economy sometimes expressed as share of gdp this approach is particularly common in accounting for the costs of road traffic c ongestion as tti does in terms of extra time and fuel and other research ers have attempted to calculate more comprehensively155httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs48 155 continued estimate for 85 urban areas contained in the 2005 urban mobility report with the cost of urban areas not included and other factors

transportation institute 2007there are however some problems with this approach these cost estimates are often based on the premise of freeflowing traffic wh ich as discu ssed above tends to exaggerate the amount of congestion experienced furthermore total cost estimates suggest that there is monetary windfall waiting to be distributed to every household when in reality eliminating cong estion if it were possible would only save most travelers few minutes on peakperiod trips156 consequently number of experts question the calculation of total costs and suggest that what matters in practical terms is th change in the cost of congestion brought about by specific feasible projects or act of policy as economists would say we need to ch ange our thinking from total costs to marginal costs157 transportation congestion remedies transportation engineers and planne rs have devised large number of potential remedies for congestion although it is beyond the scope of this report to evaluate all of these it is worthwhile discussing some of the major remedies as basic guide for policy makers the many different remedies form three basic strategies for reducing congestion dding new capacity operating the existing capacity more efficiently and managing demand this section discusses these strategies and the institutional issues that affect the implementation of congestion remedies this is followed by disc ussion of rail congestion remedies and intermodalism in freight transportation building new road nd transit capacity building new roads or expanding existin g ones is one approach to reducing congestion proponents of road building point out that since the completion of the interstate system road construction has generally lagged behind the growth in motor vehicle travel moreover these proponent s argue that in some places lack of capacity is major contributor to road congestion ttis analysis of congestion found that adding to road capacity sl owed the growth in travel delay158 new capacity can range from major new freeways to major bottleneck reduction projects and much smaller projects such as widening arteri roads and improving street connectivityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs49 159 ibid 160 downs 2006few deny that highway travel has gr own more than highway capacity during the past few decades there is however major disagreement about whether new road capacity in the absence of tolling pric ing can solve congestion because of the problem of induced demand see earlier disc ussion other concerns about major expansions of road capacity have to do w ith the costs in labor and raw materials rightsofway acquisition in heavily veloped urban areas and social and environmental disruptions over the past few years the cost of raw materials has increased dramatically making this greater concern than just few years ago an added difficulty is the time it takes to plan design and build major new facilities consequently some experts argue that on ce congestion has devel oped it is very hard for an area to build its way out of the probl em because of the time it takes to add new capacity some suggest that road congestion is problem because other viable means of transportation are not wi dely available in this view new or expanded public transportation service is seen as major solution to urban road traffic congestion tti points out that if public transit servi ce disappeared and everyone used private vehicles delay in the 437 urban areas it studied would increase by 541 million hours about 13 increase159 by its estimates almost all of this extra delay about 80 would occur in very large urban areas population of 3 million or more this is because as noted above transit service is heavily concentrated in just few major metropolitan areas currently about 5 of workers commute by transit and in only the new york and chicago metropolitan areas do more than 10 of commuters use transit nevertheless much higher proportions of tran sit users are found for certain types of commute par ticularly those from suburb to central city it is probably in these sorts of situations where the dens ity of origins and destinations is high enough to make transit an attractive mode of travel in which new or expanded transit options are likely to contribute to reduction in road traffic congestion morever because buses can be caught up in road traffic congestion only dedicated bus lanes or nonhighway mode s of transit provide eff ective solutions generally speaking transit is not likely to reduce c ongestion in smaller urban areas or in the suburbs of large urban areas because the ar eas to be covered are too large and the densities of residences and jobs too low according to some experts new or expanded transit syst ems have improved travel options but have not noticeably reduced road traffic congestion160 to some extent this is because most new major transit systems are built in fastgrowing regions in which the growth in travel demand tends to swamp the extra capacity however some contend that peakperi od road traffic congestion is not reduced because if some people switch from road to ra il others are induced to travel by car at the most convenient times or because many rail riders are not former drivers but former bus riders morever even though th eoretically with more transit service greater number of people are able to trav at the most convenient times the new capacity may not serve the greatest need s such as suburbtosuburb

however transit can have positive social and environmental benefits such as potentially greater mobility for the poor and nondrivers as well as lower ai r pollutant emissions per trip new rail systems are the most costly although light rail can be cheaper alternative than heavy rail the cost of new commuter rail capacity depends largely on whether or not the existing freight rail network is ava

techniques ev ent management techniques ramp metering realtime traveler inform ation road weather information systems work zone management signal retiming and transit priority at signals many of these strategies rely on the deployment of intelligent transportation systems its technologies in general operational st rategies for reducing congestion can be quicker to implement and relatively lowcost for instance with large share of road traffic congestion caused by incidents and other nonrecurring forms of delay many areas have created transportation ma nagement centers to improve the response of state and local agencies to problems th at can arise at any time or place in the transportation system evaluations have shown that in many cases the benefits of these centers greatly outweigh the costs161 another advantage of thes types of programs is that they typically cause minimal disruptions unlike major construction projects on the downside operational strategies require much greater ongoing commitment from local and state dots this has been problem in some places because historically dots have functioned as road construc tion and maintenance agencies and have struggled to redefine their mission managing demand operational strategies reduce cong estion on the supply side of the transportation equation there are range of strategies that exist on the demand side known as demand management strategies among others these include congestion or value pricing highoccupancy vehicl hov lanes altern ative work schedule and telecommuting programs and landus strategies pr

road cong estion pricing variably priced lanes variable tolls on entire roadways cordon charges and variable areawide charge pricing163 cordon pricing like the one ins tituted in london in 2003 charges fee for entering an area at certain times facilitybased pricing charges fee to use specific facility usually freeway or freeway lane depending on the time of day and the amount of traffic on the facility variable areawide pricing would use some sort of vehicle tracking technology to char ge for the amount of travel and the types of facilities used over an entire area the main advantage of congestion pric ing is that demand can be managed to offer travel that is less likely to be subj ect to delay especia lly unpredictable delay another advantage is that on existing roadways congestion pricing can be implemented relatively quickly moreover with congestion pricing the negative external effects are minimal and the effects may even be positive such as reduction in air pollutant emissions from idling vehi cles for state and local governments congestion pricing provides revenue stream to pay for building and operating transportation facilities congestion pricing scheme s are often unpopular and ve been criticized in number of ways one criticism is that they discriminate against lowincome drivers although it is true that the to ll will represent greater burden for drivers with lower incomes research has shown that lowincome drivers do use tolled facilities suggesting that they often value the time saved others propose that pricing facilities ought to be reserved for new capacity particularly when it is made available alongside typically congested but free alternative another criticism of congestion pricing is that by making it more expensiv to travel downtown the types of areas or facilities most likely to be tolled businesses and consumers are likely to seek out locations away from the tolled areas resulting in more sprawl some contend that depending on how it is impleme nted traffic may be dive rted from the newly tolled facility to other roads that may be less wellequipped to deal with heavy volumes finally some have argued that charging new tolls on an existing roadway is formhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs52 164 downs 2006 165 us department of transporta tion federal highway administration regional transportation operations co llaboration and

asserted that low density suburban growth in housing and employment has c ontributed to road traffic congestion hence some have suggested that one pproach to congestion is to encourage different types of land use development that will reduce reliance on singleoccupant vehicle travel the two main types of land use strategies that are commonly proposed are 1 to encourage increased housing and employment density and 2 to improve the jobshousing balance the firs t often comes under the rubric of transit oriented development whereby more density will make transit walking and cycling more attractive transporta tion options the second ty pe of strategy does not necessarily entail alternatives to driving but driving can be reduced when people live closer to where they work although these are desirable strategies in many ways experts point out one of the main disadvantages of them is that landuse patterns take decades to evolve hence decisions taken today will take years to make difference in the overall transportationlanduse system experience with increasing landuse densities shows that such strategies are not likely to redu ce congestion per although they are likely to increase accessibility in addition some have suggested that such policies may raise the costs of developing housing ffices and other types of facilitie s primarily by making land more expensive anothe r disadvantage is that landuse decision making tends to be highly fragmented so that policies to slow growth in one jurisdiction may lead to leapfrog development in another jurisdiction causing more travel and more congestion research on improving the jobshousing balance shows that it is unlikely to reduce congestion because for number of reasons it is very difficult to get people to live near where they work164 institutional issues the problem of transportation cong estion is compounded by the highly fragmented planning and opera tion of the transportation system most urban areas comprise numerous local governments and some span multiple states important interstate corridors like i95 by definiti on suffer jurisdictional fragmentation even in single jurisdiction multiple agencies ar responsible for different aspects of the system transit systems for example ar often operated indepe ndently of local and state departments of trans portation highway incidents may involve whole host of agencies including state police local police ambulance fire and state and local dots in some cases fragmentation in volves publicversusprivate dimension the rail system is mostly privately owed and operated which can make it challenging to institute new passenger ra il service for example because of this fragmentation many anticongestion strategi require coordination nd collaboration functionally jurisdictionally and across the publicprivate divide165httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs53 165 continued together to improve transportation safety reliability and security fhwaop03008

crunch april 26 2006 170 cbo 2006efforts to promote voluntary coordina tion and collaboration between agencies and jurisdictions are typically uncontroversial more cont roversial are solutions that affect the funding and authority of diffe rent jurisdictions in the planning and programming of transportation improvements for instance some have suggested that because congestion tends to occur on the regional scale regional authorities such as the georgia regional transportation authority and metropolitan planning organizations should be given more power over the planning and operation of the transportation system visavis states and localities166 expanding rail capacity building new capacity in freight rail is seen as way of dealing with congestion issues particularly as host of technological changes that have improved operational throughput appear to have run their course167 in reasonable financial health today freight railroads are investing to increase capacity168 however there are concerns that this investment is not keeping up with demand169 number of reasons have been proposed for this ma ny having to do with the uniqueness of freight railroading as an industry to be gin with many note that because track and the accompanying operational systems are so costly freight railroading is one of the most capitalintensive industries in america170 also once constructed railroad track is fixed in space representing huge wager on future patterns of freight movement it has been argued that similar risks are borne by the public sector in the trucking air and waterborne freight i ndustries furthermore like most infrastructure improvements it takes relatively long time to respond to market signals that may change quickly another issue is whether or not railroads can be solution to road traffic congestion by taking truck traffic off the highways clearly rail will not be solution to roadway congestion if there is insufficient rail capacity but should public involvement for building rail capacity be predicated on relieving road congestion as it stands today there are host of si gnificant barriers to rail relieving road congestion including the fact that many industrial facilities are longer served by rail spurs either because they have been built away from them or because the spurshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33995crs54 171 bryan et 2006 p 114 172 bryan et 2006 173 federal highway administration 2007 174 bryan et 2006were taken out during the downsizing of rail capacity171 however the main reason that rail is unlikely to reduce urban road congestion is that in most places trucks make up small part of the traffic stream172 nationally trucks account for 8 of highway vmt173 although the effect of truck on the traffic stream is greater than passenger car on multilane highway with grade large truck represents 17 cars and at intersections between 3 and 4 cars174 nevertheless many support the idea of public funding for expanding rail capacity because it will improve the speed and efficiency of the freight system by allowing shipments to bypass urban road congestion moreover many point out there are range of public benefits to movi ng freight by rail including less wear and tear on the roads and possible reduction in air pollutant emissions corollary is that improved rail system capacity may also reduce the conflicts between freight and passenger trains improving the speed and efficiency of both systems intermodalism in freight transportation many of the solutions for intermodal problems in freight transportation revolve around the connections to truck and rail transporta tion at water ports the issues in these areas are particularly thorny because most ports are located in already congested urban areas with very limited space for expansion and because as very large facilities in the freight system they have major impact on their physical and social environment in terms of pollution nd noise etc moreover ports involve complex mix of public and pr ivate organizations blurring lines of responsibility and public and private benefits in this context number of improveme nts have been proposed to increase the speed with which freight moves through the system at these critical nodes without unduly affecting nearby residents thes improvements include extended truck gate hours congestion pricing of dock facilities tr uck appointment systems expanded ondock rail connections truckonly lanes and the development of inland ports connected by fast rail shuttles concluding observations like number of other public policy i ssues transportation congestion can be viewed as collection of interrelated pr oblems with severe c onstraints set in context of continual change these types of issues sometimes called wicked

types of problem s typically have other characteristics such as definitive definition wide variety of potential solutions but intense disagreements about the preferred ones and about what constitutes success and because of intended and unintended conse quences situation where each solution tends to modify the problem in such way as to make it manifest in different form or in different time or place when tackling these types of problems public policy experts advise that the traditional linear approach in which data are gathered analyzed and solution formulated and implemented is not work able by contrast they suggest that solving wicked problems is usually an ongoing complex and chaotic struggle that often requires incorporating multiple viewpoints and approaches at once moreover these experts note that when working on so lutions policy makers and planners often encounter new dimensions of the problem nd therefore they must be creative and opportunitydriven176 in terms of transportation congestion th is suggests few key ideas for policy makers to keep in mind as solutions to this problem are crafted and pursued in the future to begin with there is one solution that will ever fully solve transportation congestion and that paradoxically fully solving the problem may be undesirable because congestion can be good problem to have in some circumstances and may also be choice about how to distribute scar ce resources another key idea is that each solution applied to dimension of transportation congestion might create other unintended problems along other dimensions that require new creative solutions as such multiple iterative strategies likely will be needed including supplyside and demandsi approaches approaches that focus on passenger systems and those that focus on freight highway strategies and transit strategies and those that promise shortterm results and some that promise improvement in the longterm possibly and most importantly policy makers and planners should consider that the ultima goal may not be to reduce or liminate transportation congestion per but to focus instead on improving passenger and freight mobility and accessibility
