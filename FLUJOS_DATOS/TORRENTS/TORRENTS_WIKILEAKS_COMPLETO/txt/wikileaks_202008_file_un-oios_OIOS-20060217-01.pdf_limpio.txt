min review of eca grant to idep aa200571011 i introduction 1 in october and november 2005 oios conduc ted review on eca grant to african institute for economic development and planning idep the review was an addition to the oios work plan at the request of the controller of united nations 2 the draft of the memorandum was shared with the controller and the director of human resources and finance division on 9 decembe r 2005 whose comments which were received 22 december 2005 and 9 february 2006 respectivel have been reflected in this final memorandum in italics ii background and scope 3 the united nations through eca has been providing us942000 of grant per biennium since 1994 to support four core profe ssional posts of idep as per ga resolutions 45248 section v and 46185 c section xvii fo r this purpose specific budget line for the grant was established in ecas account and four posts were created in ecas staffing table 4 in june 2005 the then oic bfs reporte d in an interoffice memorandum to the director of human resources and finance division hrfd and to the controller the following two issues with regard to the grant to idep the fund allocated under the grant budget line would not be sufficient to cover the projected expenditure for the four ga funded idep posts until the close of the current biennium and b the staff assessment and other staff entitlements have been charged to common staff cost in an organizational unit other than idep which resulted in underreporting of the expenditure figures for the idep grant 5 upon receipt of the memorandum the contro llers office clarified that there was reference to supplementary support to idep and expressed concern on the charging of expenditures to allotment accounts other than the one for the grant in this regard eca was requested to undertake comprehensive investigation to determine the total amount of incorrect idep charges to eca regular budget accounts ce 1996 and to suggest ac tions for recovering the funds from idep further it was also reque sted to identify the officials who had certified and approved in parallel with the request to eca the controller requested review from oios on this matter 6 oios conducted review to provide the c ontroller with an independent assessment of the adequacy of the idep grant arrangements th is focussed on review of the work that eca carried out at the request of the controller with particular attention to whether ecas procedures were adequate to ensure identifica tion of accurate and complete idep expenditure figures and causes of overrun and incorrect accoun ting and whether additional measures were required to prevent reoccurrence 7 the review covered expenditures incurred for idep since 1996 oios validated the 2methodology used by eca to identify expenditure s and to confirm that the methodology was correctly used iii summary accuracy of idep expenditure figures produced by eca 8 whilst appreciating the extensive work undert aken by eca to identify the amount of the overrun which should be recovered oios determin ed that the figures were not accurate and that eca needed to perform several additional pr ocedures to establish accurate figures oios noted that the identification of idep staff needed to be more accurate b the identification and analysis of cost other than payroll was not sufficient c the review and reconciliation with the expenditures actually recorded in idep grant budget was required and d the procedures to identify where the idep expenditures were charged needed to be more accurate b causes of cost overrun and incorrect accounting 9 eca attributed the cause of the cost ove rrun to mismatch between the grant amount and the actual costs for the four posts supported from the grant this discrepancy had not been recognised until recently because of the practice of treating the four posts as part of eca payroll and overall common staff cost oios is of the opinion that the mismatch resulted from the fact that the grant was provided to idep in th form of four posts in the eca staffing table while eca did not seek clarification from oppba on the nature of idep grant and implications of any surplus or shortfall agains t actual staff cost arising from the arrangement 10 oios is of the opinion that the cost overrun could have been avoided or detected earlier had idep as an independent entity managed th grant in its own account with appropriate staffing structure commensurate with the amount of grant and had eca controlled the grant budget only to ensure that the expenditures remain within the limit 11 at the time of this review eca had in itiated certain corrective actions including ensuring that all expenditures would be reco rded in the grant budget in 2005 and initiating discussion with idep on recovery of overspent amounts for which eca and idep were in the process of determining the modality for recove ry when this draft memorandum was prepared c provision of support other than grant 12 in addition to the grant oios noted th at eca had also been providing idep with support from its regional advisory budget the additional support including provision of one l3 post on permanent basis was based on the ec policy of treating idep as an institution whose activities were relevant to the needs of member states and as such eca would provide technical assistance in its areas of competence1 1 eca designated idep in 2000 as category 2institution there are three categories in defining ecas 3 13 in the opinion of oios provision of technical assistance should have been in the form of an mou between eca and idep which would have detailed the form of the assistance and the proof required by eca to dem onstrate that the assistance had been used as intended this could have helped eca demonstrate how the assistance provided directly contributed to the achievement of ecas mandate such formal agreement would have made it much easier for eca to explain which activities were related to agreed support with an external entity that could be paid by eca and which were part of the idep grant in the absence of any documentation explaining otherwise oios could only consider th at the assistance given by eca in particular the provision of an l3 post was supplementary assistance to the grant this would have required approval by oppba as it effectively increased the size of the grant aid given to idep and did not provide any demonstrable dir ect benefit to achievement of the eca mandate 14 oios appreciated the acceptance of and or comments on the recommendations and findings on the draft of this memorandum from the controller of the united nations and eca which were received 22 december 2005 and 9 fe bruary 2006 respectively those comments were incorporated in the section below in italics iv findings and recommendations ecas investigation 15 eca reported the results of its own inve stigation on actual idep expenditures to oppba on 12 october 2005 as summarized in the table below table 1 idep grant allotments and expenditures in us biennium allotment actual difference 19961997 942400 74922811 19317189 19981999 942400 89723548 4516452 20002001

in the same memo eca explained the proce dures that it had adopted to arrive at the above figures relationship with institutions the definition of category 2 is those institutions whose activities are relevant to the needs of member states and for which they may wish to maintain their support eca will continue to be represented on their governing bodies provide necessary technical assistance in its areas of competence 2 additional us133000 of deficit was estimated for remaining three months bringing the total deficit over the five biennia to us482000 3 most of the charges were indicated to have been made to espd economic and social policy division 4a names and index numbers verified by eca human resources services section hrss as idep staff b data extracted from imis and sun system using index numbers c data screened eliminating entries that have effect on the budget line these entries include journals and advances d remaining data checked to actual imis entries for verification allotment verified by the budget unit f sun system data checked to actual entries in sun accounts 17 oios noted several substantial deficien cies in ecas cost overrun figures and determined that eca needed to perform severa l additional procedures as explained in the following section including more accurate iden tification of idep staff and review of expenditures actually recorded in the grant budget line to establish more accurate expenditure figures which eca agreed b additional procedures required to produce more accurate overrun figure recalculation of staff costs 18 oios noted errors in the expenditure calculations of staff with index numbers 401714 475727 995259 859176 and 813314 which in total would decrease the reported cost overrun by approximately us70000 for example eca erroneously included approximately us200000 for the staff member with index number 401714 who had been assigned to regional office in 2000 b staff member with index 995259 had been encumbering an l3 lecturer post in idep funded from the regional advisor budget of eca until 1 february 2002 when he was placed on one of the four idep posts eca had earlier indicated that the provision of an l3 regional advisor post was legitimate taking into consideration the nature of the budget which was for technical cooperation at the request of member states as such eca did not consider the payroll cost of the current incumbent of that post 4 as idep expenditures however eca inconsistently included the expenditures of staff even for the period when he was encumbering the l3 regional advisor post oios determined that approximately us138000 all cost until january 2002 needed to be excluded from idep expenditures to be consistent in its treatment of the expenditures of the l3 regional advisor post c eca did not identify staff member with index number 813314 as idep staff who was senior regional advisor of the economic and social policy division espd and had been assigned as senior advisor to idep effective 28 december 1999 oios determined that approximately us270000 of payroll expenditures related to his tenure at idep january 2000 to february 2002 should be included as idep expenditure b recalculation of costs arising from staff entitlements 19 eca could not verify the accuracy and comp leteness of idep expenditures related to 4 the provision of regional advisor post is addr essed as separate issue in section d 5various staff entitlements totaling approximate ly us1 million oios noted the following which eca should examine further whilst eca explained that reliable data on expenditures other than payroll for the period 1996 1997 was available from the old system used before imis it did not perform any alternative procedures such as review of the personnel file and reported expenditures for the said period b further while eca identified approximately us300000 of expenditures for other cost in 1998 2000 it appeared incomplete compared to the expenditures in the subsequent years c eca only identified disbursement from trav claims but not the other costs such as tickets for home leave education grant travel or mission travels d eca included all expenditures related to the idep staff without thorough examination of the nature of the expenditures c review of expenditure recorded in idep budget line 20 eca did not perform detailed review of approximately us3 million of expenditures recorded in the grant account while most of the expenditures were payroll that had been already identified as idep expenditure oios took random sample of disbursements and found approximately us163000 that should have b een included in the idep expenditures which suggests to oios that eca should undertak further review of this expenditure to confirm its accuracy oios findings incl uded approximately us24000 of consultant charges5 approximately us122000 of payment to ot her agencies mainly to undp dakar office and us17000 for various vendors it appeared that the payments to undp were related to the travel expenditures for idep staff which eca did not identify as idep expenditures d review of budget codes 21 in its memo to oppba eca indicated that more than half the total idep costs were charged to various eca organizational units incl uding espd however oios determined that only approximately us06 million might have been charged to other organizational units mainly to espd eca had indicated that approximately us2 million of payroll cost in 1996 to june 2002 cost was charged to espd this conclusion was based on the payroll location code which was espd rather than an examinati on of the actual budget code similarly eca indicated that all other costs of approxima tely us274000 from 1996 to 2000 were charged to espd without appropriate analysis of budget codes recommendation to establish an accurate overrun figure against idep grant eca should undertake work in consultation with idep to verify the completeness 5 it excluded us72000 of consultant fees paid from the fund from vacant regional advisor post 6and accuracy of payroll charges to id ep and expenditures recorded in the grant budget code rec 01 22 eca accepted the recommendation and comment ed that budget and finance section is verifying the accuracy and completeness of expenditures incurred by idep the final figures will be communicated to idep for their ver ification by the end of february 2006 the controller also commented that he fully supports the recommendation oios appreciated the provision of the timeframe for the implementation of the recommendation and will close the recommendation upon receipt of complete and verified idep expenditure figures c causes for overrun and incorrect accounting treatment of idep as sub unit of eca 23 the main cause of the overrun appears to be ecas treatment of idep as an eca sub unit which resulted in certain idep expenditure s being recorded as eca common staff costs rather than as grant budget this arises fr om the fact that the executive secretary of eca served as chairman of ideps governing council there had long been an understanding within eca that idep was part of eca unde r espd where the grant budget was allocated before 20042005 or as subprogramme since 2004 for that reason eca did not consider idep as an independent entity which would ma nage the grant received from eca in its own account with appropriate staffing structure wh ile eca would only control the grant budget to ensure that the expenditures remain within th limit eca did not seek clarification from oppba on the nature of the idep grant and the implications of any possible surplus or shortfall against actual staff cost arising from the arrangement that eca administered the four core posts in its staffing table recommendation to resolve the current mismatch between the grant amount and the actual cost involved in supporting four pos ts as part of eca staffing table oppba should modify the arrangement fo r the provision of the grant to idep oios would recommend removing the four posts from ecas staffing table and instead providing the grant directly to idep eca should control the grant budget line to ensure that the grant is used for intended purpose and remains within the limit rec 02 24 while eca commented that it is reviewing the recommendation the controller commented that he did not share the view of the auditor that the mismatch resulted because eca had construed the grant as four posts ra ther than an allotment of funds oppba has on file requests from eca seeking to convert the grant to posts since 2002 which had not been accepted by the general assembly this was the particular reason why the staffing tables issued by oppba to eca and forming an integral part of the regular budget spending authorizations have never included the four posts in question which consequently may not be part of the eca authorized staffing table on this basis and given the fact that this subsidy has been established and maintained as fixedam ount grant since the biennium 1992 1993 he is reluctant to concur with recommendation which proposes to base the level of the grant on the actual expenditures of the four posts at least through the next biennium we are constrained by the budget to continue the current approach the fi rst opportunity to present this issue for re consideration of the general assembly woul d be budget exercise for the 2008 2009 biennium 7 25 oios appreciated the comments and clarif ications from the controller while welcoming the suggestion to present the issue of converting the grant into normal posts to general assembly for the 2008 2009 biennium oios wishes to reiterate need to make change in the current arrangement where eca ad ministers the idep grant in the form of eca post which obligates eca to provide full salaries and other staff benefits and therefore would result in shortfall in the grant as such oios recommended removing the posts from eca and instead providing the grant directly to idep while eca should ensure that the grant is used for intended purpose and remains within the limit oios revised the recommendation to better clarify its position the recommendation will be closed upon receipt of decision on changes in current administering arrangement for idep grant b budget code 26 oios noted that ecas investigation did not identify the officials concerned so as to establish how the internal control mechanis m certifying and approving functions failed to identify and take appropriate action with regard to the inappropriate recording of certain idep related expenditures 27 as education grant costs represented over 50 percent of the cost overrun oios interviewed officials involved in certifying and pproving the education grant of idep staff that were recorded in the espds common staff co st as indicated in paragraph 21 above the officers concerned explained that they thought idep was part of eca and therefore did not undertake any special checks against the idep budget code 28 eca has already taken action to rectify the situation by bringing the issue to the attention of eca management and oppba and making sure that certifying and approving officers were aware of what should be charge d to idep and as such recommendation is raised d support for idep from sources other than grant 29 eca directly supported idep by assisting in mobilization of extrabudgetary xb resources providing services of regional advisor on an adhoc basis and providing an l3 lecturer post on permanent basis since 1996 from the regional advisor budget section the l3 lecturer post has been encumbered by three different staff for various periods since 1998 and also used to fund consultant when the post was vacant 2002 to 2004 30 these arrangements were established on the basis of letter dated 26 january 1996 from the former executive secretary of eca to the then director of idep further it appeared that the continuation of such support was based on ec policy of treating idep as an institution whose activities were relevant to the needs of member states and as such eca should provide necessary technical assistances in its areas of competence 31 in accordance with general assembly resolution 2803 xxvi of 14 december 1971 provision is made for system of regional and s ub regional advisory serv ices for the purpose of assisting developing countries that are memb ers of the regional commissions in solving problems that they may encounter in their nationa l development efforts the advisory services are made available in response to requests from governments and involve advisory missions on an individual or joint multidisciplinary basis in this context eca explained that the provision 8of the services of regional advisor to idep falls broadly under the mandate of the regional advisor and as such it should be considered separa from the grant support to idep with this understanding eca excluded the costs related to the provision of regional advisor including the l3 post but rather focused on the costs related to the four posts under the grant arrangement 32 however oios understood that the support to idep in the form of grant was result of review conducted in the early 1990s at time when the support from undp had been reduced as such although it was not clear whethe r the grant was meant to be an exclusive and comprehensive form of support to idep oios was concerned that eca did not seek clarification from oppba as to relation between the grant and provision of additional assistance further in the opinion of oios pr ovision of technical assistances should have been in the form of an mou between eca and idep which would have detailed the form of the assistance and what eca required as proof to demonstrate that the assistance had been used as intended and also could have helped eca monstrate how the assistance provided direct benefit to the achievement of eca mandates such formal agreement would have made it much easier for eca to explain which activities were related to agreed support with an external entity that could be paid by eca and which were part of the idep grant 33 in the absence of any documentation explai ning otherwise oios could only consider that the assistance given by eca in particular th provision of an l3 post that appeared to be more than technical assistance as indicated as possible support to category 2 institutions6 were supplementary assistance to the grant the supplementary assistance should have required oppba approval as it effectively increased the si ze of the grant aid given to idep and did not provide any demonstrable direct benefit to achievement of the eca mandate 34 eca explained that it had been requesting to convert the grant into regular posts on several occasions which had not been accepted by ga however oios did not consider it appropriate that eca did not establish an appropriate framework upon the nonacceptance of eca requests recommendation to enhance the effectiveness of eca support to idep eca should carry out an assessment of the type nd nature of support eca should provide to idep this assessment should have two components an assessment of whether the current grant aid from the ec needs to be changed and why and an assessment of how idep can contri bute to the achievement of the eca mandate with any other additional support and to formulate and enter into an mou dealing with those issues in particular eca should ensure an appropriate source of fund is used for the provision of an l3 lecturer post when such support proves to be valid rec 03 35 while eca commented that it is reviewing the recommendation the controller commented that it is recalled that general ssembly resolution 2803 xxvi entitled regional and subregional advisory services under the united nations regular programme of technical cooperation established regional component of the regular programme of technical cooperation unified system of regional and subregional advisory services earmarked for 6 please refer to footnote 1 for the definition of category 2institutions 9the operations of the regional economic co mmissions and the economic and social office at beirut was subject to the guidelines and modes of operations under the regular programme as the terms of reference of this budget section provide only for shortterm advisory services at the governments request the assignment to idep on permanent basis since 1996 of the l3 regional advisor or cons ultant financed from the eca part of the regular programme of technical cooperation was at variance with these terms of reference the controller further commented that the provis ion of technical assistance to idep in the form of an l3 regional advisor should have b een formalized by an mou between the two organizations is supported provided that appropriate sources of funding were used for this purpose the controller further commented on the recommendation that he would have expected the recommendation include more specific reference to this proposed action rather than only seeking assessments of whether current grant aid from eca needs to be changed and how idep can contribute to the eca mandate 36 oios appreciated the comments and clarifications from the controller oios revised the recommendation to include specific action requi red for the provision of l3 lecturer post the recommendation will be closed upon receipt of th results of an assessment of the type and nature of support eca should provide to idep 37 lastly the controller commented that he has not been appraised of which officials certified the expenditures in question and in light of the authority of his office to maintain the list of approved certifying officers he was most anxious to settle this matter quickly oios already responded to the controller that the na mes of certifying officers had not been given because it was not current practice in an audit report to provide names of individuals oios further responded that this issue was discusse d with eca during the audit and understood that eca was working on response to the request which oios will keep under review v further actions required on recommendations 38 oios monitors the implementation of its audit recommendations for reporting to the secretarygeneral and to the general assembly the responses received on the audit recommendations contained in the draft memorandum have been recorded in our recommendations database
