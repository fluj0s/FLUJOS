and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849climate change science and policy implications summary almost all scientists agree that the earths climate is changing having warmed by 06 to 09o celsius 11 to 16o fahrenheit since th industrial revolution science indicates that the earths global average temperature is now approaching or possibly has passed the warmest experienced since human civilizations began to flourish about 12000 years ago during the 20th century some areas became wetter while others experienced more drought most climate scientists conclude that humans have induced large part of the climate change since the 1970s although natural forces such as solar irradiance and volcanoes contribute to variability scientists cannot explain the climate changes of th past few decades without including the effects of elevated greenhouse gas ghg concentrations resulting from fossil fuel use land clearing and industria l and agricultural emissions over the past 150 years measured carbon dioxide concentr ations have risen by more than one third from about 280 parts per million ppm to about 380 ppm the united states contributes almost onefifth of net globa l greenhouse gas emissions some impacts of climate change are expected to be beneficial eg increased agricultural productivity in some regions whereas othe rs are expected to be adverse eg drought in some regions rising s ea levels in some coastal areas forecasting future climate conditions is challenging and so major processes remain poorly understood ho wever methods are improving to characterize the risks scientists have found it is very likely that rising greenhouse gas concentrations if they continue unabated will raise the global average temperature above natural variab ility by at least 15o celsius 27o fahrenheit during the 21st century above 1990 temperatures with small likelihood that the temperature rise may exceed 5oc 9of the projections thought most likely by many climate modelers are for greenhouse gasinduced temperature rise of approximately 25 to 35oc 45 to 63of by 2100 however the magnitude rapidity and details of the change are likely to remain unclear for some time future climate change may advance smoothly or sporadically with some regions experiencing more fluctuations in temperature precipitati on and frequency or intensity of extreme events than others some scientists emphasize potential beneficial effects of climate change or count on the ability of humans to adapt th eir behaviors and t echnologies to manage climate change in the future other scientists argue that the benefits of climate change may be limited even accounting for probable ad aptation and its costs and that there are risks of abrupt surprising change with accompanying dislocations the continuing scientific process has resulted in better understanding of climate change and generally confirms the broad conclusions made in previous decades by the preponderance of scien tists that human activities emit greenhouse gases that influence the climate with potentially serious effects details have been revised or refined but the basic conclusi on of the risks persists the principal questions remaining for the majority of scientists concern not whether greenhouse gases will result in climate change but the magnitude speed geographic details and likelihood of surprises and the appropriate timing and options involved in addressing the human components of climate changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849contents introduction 1 changes observed in the earths climate 7 global

ipcc assessment by sponsoring much of the re search and monitoring that underpins the assessment as well as many experts repr esenting broad range of views on specific topics and by coordinating both external expert and governmental peer reviews of the reports the continuing scientific process has resulted in an understanding of climate change that is increasingly robust and has withstood mu ltitude of challenges in most respects the evolving science confir ms the broad conclusi ons made in previous decades by the preponderance of scientists many details and co mplexities however remain nebulous although most scien tists are confident in their current understanding of climate change they are less certain about th future magnitude timing and geographic details climate change science is process the evolution of scientific understanding of climate change is an example of the process of science it is iterative beginning with statements of hypotheses followed by testing and observations scru tiny by other scien tists reproduction or repudiation of results and revisions to the state of knowledge the practice of critique and revision is desirable to support continuous improvement of knowledge some comments provide insi ghts while others may be refuted research may decrease certainty or enha nce it the objective like most science is to be able to produce ever more reliable predictions such has been the case following the di scovery described by joseph fourier in 1827 that earths atmosphere acts like the glass of greenhouse letting in solar energy then trapping some of its heat hence influencing the temperature of the earths surface related fi ndings have been tested cr itiqued refuted revised and improved over almost two centuries as result of the scientific process most scientists are confident in their current understanding of clima change and the role of human activities including emissions of socalled greenhouse gases ongoing research debate and refine ment have yielded broadly accepted agreement on climate change science httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs4 intergovernmental pane l on climate change climate change 2007 the physical science basis in february 2007 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc released its fourth assessment of the science of climate ch ange updated with research reported over the previous six years selected major findings from this report include the following global atmospheric concentrati ons of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide have increased markedly as result of human activities since 1750 and now far exceed preindustrial valued determined from ice cores spanni ng many thousands of years the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the past 650000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined by ice cores the primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide since the preindustrial period results from fossil fuel use with land use chan ge providing another significant but smaller contribution annual fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions increased from an aver age of 64 60 to 68 gtc per year in the 1990s to 72 69 to 75 gtv per year in 20002005 carbon dioxide emissions associat ed with landuse change are estimated to be 16 gtc 05 to 27 per year over the 1990s although these estimates ve large uncertainty changes in solar irradiance si nce 1750 are estimated to cause radiative forcing which is less th an half th estimate given in the tar third assessment re port 2001 of the ipcc

per decade over land and zero over the oceans new data now show that losses from the ice sheets of greenland and antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003 at continental regional and ocean basin scales numerous long term changes in climate have been observed these include changes in arctic temperatures and ice widespread changes in precipitation amounts ocean salinity wind patterns and aspects of extreme weather including dr oughts heavy precipitation heat waves and the intensity of tropi cal cyclones some aspects of climate have not been observed to changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs5 paleoclimate informa tion supports the interpretation that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1300 years the last time the pol ar regions were significantly warmer than present for an extended period about 125000 years ago reductions in polar ice volume led to 4 to 6 meters 13 to 20 feet of sea level rise most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations difficulties remain in reliably simulating and attributing observed temperature changes at smaller than continental scales for the next two decades at warming of about 02oc 036of per decade is projected for range of sres emission scenarios even if the concentrations of all greenhouse gases and aerosols had been kept constant at year 2000 levels further warming of about 01oc 02of would be expected the best estimate for the w sres greenhouse gas emission scenario b1 is 18oc likely range is 11oc to 29oc 32of likely range is 20of to 52of and the best estimate for the high scenario a1f1 is 40oc likely range is 24oc to 64oc 52of likely range is 43of to 95of warming is expected to be greatest over land and at most high northern latitudes and least over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic ocean it is very likely that hot extremes heat waves and heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent increases in the amount of preci pitation are very likely in high latitudes while decreases are likely in most subtropical land regions by as much as about 20 in the a1b scenario in 2100 continuing observed patterns in recent trends anthropogenic warming and sea vel rise would continue for centuries due to the timescales associated with climate processes and feedbacks even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilized based on current understandi ng of climate carbon cycle feedback model studies suggest that to stabilise at 450 ppm carbon dioxide could require that cumulative emissions over the 21st century be reduced from an average of approximately 670 630 to 710 gtc

panel the warming trend in globalmean surface temperature observations during the past 20 years is undoubtedly real and is substantially greater than the averag rate of warming during the twentieth century the disparity between surface and upper air trends in way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has been rising the troposphere actually may have warmed much less rapidly than the surface from 1979 into the late 1990s due both to natural causes eg the sequence of volcanic eruptions that occurred within this particular 20year period and human activities eg the cooling of the

changing the forces thought to be driving observed climate changes are discussed below including the evidence that human activities particul arly greenhouse gas emissions have contributed large influence on top of ongoing natural variability the earths climate is driven by the energy balance of the suns radiation coming into and leaving the earths atmos phere the more active the sun the closer the earth to the sun or the greater the ab ility for the suns energy to penetrate the atmosphere and be absorbed by the earth the greater will be the warming tendency on earth on the other hand the less active the sun the farther the earth is from the sun the more the earths atmosphere or surface reflect the ra diation back out to space the greater the cooling tendency th tilt of the earths axis in its orbit around the sun making one or the other hemisphere closer to the sun most of the year drives the heating and cooling of the s easons outside of the tropics scientists understand well the fundamental drivers of the earths climate through geologic time for example how the pattern of an irregu lar orbit around the sun has led to regular climate swings in and out of ice ages or how massive volcanic eruptions can spew particles into the atmosphere that block incoming radiation and cause temporary cooling until human populations grew to rge numbers fro m popul ation of about 5 million around 10000 years ago to ove r 6 billion today the global climate was almost certainly not influenced by human activities however human clearing of land use of fossil fuels for energy nd other activities have greatly changed the surface of the earth and the composition of the atmosphere leading almost certainly to changes the earths climate through the past 150 years during this period the population grew from about 13 billion in 1850 to about 65 billion today55 associated with land clearing increasin g affluence switch from wood to fossil fuels and industrialization all in

production of crops and lives tock and manufacture of various products now emit certain gases in sufficient quantities to have raised concentrations higher than they have been for hundreds of thousands of ears the elevated concentrations are changing the balance of solar radiation in and out of the eart hs atmosphere and consequently altering the earths climate greenhouse gases ghg in the atmosphere allow the suns short wave length radiation to pass through to the earths surface but once the radiation is absorbed by the earth and reemitted as l onger wavelength radiation ghg trap the

absorption or reflection of radiation in the atmosphere substances that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer such as chlororfluorocarbons cfc so indirectly affect the climate because the loss of stratospheric ozone causes local cooling and changes the patterns of temperatures and atmospheric circulation these radiatively im portant pollutants are controlled to varying degrees by regulations

one unit of ghg times its potency integrated over the atmospheric lifetime of that ghg gwps require selecting time period typically 25 75 or 100 years over which the effects are ta ken into account in other words using 25 year gwps gives greater emphasis to the forc ings that are potent but shortlived in the atmosphere eg methane having greater effect on shortterm global warming the 100 year gwps

but only included in climate modeling since th early 1990s sulfate aerosols are by product of sulfur emissions rgely from the burning of coal and oil as well as some industrial processes sulfur emissions and their aerosols have increased dramatically over the past century aerosol effects on temperature are both regional and shortlived as particles typically remain suspended in the atmosphere for days to weeks aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere fluctuate greatly are difficult to measure and consequently are uncertain by factor of two or more aerosols are also understood to affect precipitation pattern s downwind of their emissions although research is just beginning to reveal the processes invol ved they may influence monsoon water cycles69 as well aerosols may having amplifying or dampening effects when interacting with such factors as sea surface temperatures70 and snow cover71 the role of aerosols in driving various aspects of climate is one of the major uncertainties being tackled by monitoring and research emissions from aviation emissions from fuel consumption by aircraft and water vapor emissions in their exhaust both contribute to climate change in special ways first these ghg are emitte d at high altitudes where few other ghg are present and therefore do not overlap other gases absorbing spectra increasing their relatively small contribution to global surface temperatures they also affect the vertical distribution of temperatures in the atmosphere more complex the emissions of small particles and water vapor form ice crystals in aviation contrails that can produce more clouds in the uppe r troposphere these clouds can have cooling or warming effect depending on the characteristics of the ice crystals most scientists believe that the overall climate effect of contrails is net warming these are not globally distributed and therefore ve stronger regional than global effects land surface changes although the earths land surface changes naturally as part of ecosystem processe s humans have had major impact on land cover and land uses that in turn affect the climate system at least one scientist has provided evidence that human forest clearing and rice production beginning roughly 8000 and 5000 years ago respectively may have significantly affected carbon dioxide and methane concentrations as could the carbon

20th century co2 is emitted mostly through burning or decomposition increasing co2 concentrations in the atmosphere as vegetation regrows it absorbs co2 from the atmosphere albeit more slowly than emission occurred net deforestation is occurring globally mainly in developing countries the united states like many ot her countries cleared land decades ago but abandoned some of it with in dustrialization and migrati on to more fertile lands regrowth of forests on aba ndoned lands is in net timated to be removing co2 from the atmosphere in other words us forests overall are net sink for carbon not source at this time on the order of 780 million metric tonnes of co2 per year73 agriculture currently covers about onethird of the earths land surface agriculture can also alter the evaporation and transpir ation of plants on land and can alter local to regional climates and via atmospheric circulati on possibly modify global climate as well land cover feedbacks land cover change also results from climate change and therefore can be feedback within the climate system on the one hand co2 in the atmosphere is effectively nutrient to plants and this higher carbon fertilization will tend to increase vegetation growth and remove more co2 from the atmosphere where precipitation increases and to lesser degree where currently cool locations warm vegetation is expected to increase creating negative feedback to climate warming to the degree that vines and other weedy plants thrive better in higher co2 and warmer temperatures than w oody trees the enhanced carbon uptake may be shortlived moreover warmer temperatures and greater moisture will tend to speed up decomposition and even potentia lly cause dieback at high levels generating positive feedback to climate warming in addition trees and other vegetation transpire water vapor another ghg into th atmosphere also land cover can alter the amount of dust ra ised by wind into the atmosphere albedo the reflectivity of the earths surface is called albedo where the earths surface has low albedo ie is not very reflective the suns radiation is absorbed and warms the surface particles deposited on the snowice surface eg from pollution can darken the surface and increase melting in places covered with snow or ice the surface has very high albedo as the extent of snow and ice diminishes with climate warming the reflectivity decreases and creates positive feedback to climate leading to more warming land cleared of its vegetation may reflect light more than the dark leaves that previously shaded it increasing reflection of solar energy and having cooling impact when snow is on the ground the removal of trees can have particularly strong albedo c ooling effect but mostly in winter or locations with permanent snow or ice land clearing tends to warm temperatures near the equator nd cool them at high latitudes74httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs30 75 european project for ice coring in

d18 4347 2006methods to compare human and natural causes multiple factors simultaneously influence the earths climate and scientists have developed variety of methods that help dete rmine which forcings are contributing and are likely most important at any period several different lines of evidence discovered in the past decade have led large majority of scientists to conclude that humanrelated greenhouse gas emissions have contributed substantially to the increase in global mean temperature and other climate changes observed since the 1970s and probably over the past centu ry additional factors also contribute including solar variability volcanoes and natural variability the simplest method of analyzing th role of greenhouse gases in climate change is to compare co2 concentrations in the atmosphere with surface temperatures through the past million years or more co2 and ch4 concentrations have been tightly correlated with global temperatures in the paleologic records75 this correlation may be insufficient to discern the triggering cause of the changesbut most scientists are confident that once warming has been initiated there are strong positive feedbacks to co 2 levels and again to climate warming leading to strongly amplifying effect of the initial cause76 this would explain instances of timing mismatches where rising co2 concentrations lag behi nd rising temperatures evidenced in the paleoclimatological record however some scientists also raise problems in the proxy records pointing to time lags among the complex interactions within the climate system and to additiona l drivers of change that at times may exceed the forcing of co2 in the atmosphere77 another method scientists us to attribute climate change to various sources or to project future changes relates to the concept of causative radiative forcing figure 6 shows an estimation of the relative contributions of ghg and other agents to radiative forcing from 1950 to 200078 the apparent strength of greenhouse gas forcing has steadily grown and seems to do minate other known forcings in its effects on warming the earths climate volcanic emissions of stratospheric aerosols are also major but episodic and shortlived drivers tropospheric aerosols including sulfates black carbon and organic carbon ve had much smaller but growing cooling effect from these data the eff ect of solar variability on recent temperature change is apparent but small some scientists however contend that solar variability has larger rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs31 79 dt shindell et volcanic and solar forc ing of climate change during the preindustrial era journal of climate 16 2003 pp 40944107a third method scientists have developed especially since 2000 is the concept of fingerprinting the patterns of radiative fo rcing and observed change and comparing them79 different forcing agents produce different patterns of climate change over time and space and even vertically in the atmosphere for example volcanoes spew aerosols that persist only few years in the atmosphere creating temporary cooling effect over both land and oceans reductions in solar irradiance can last decades and affect land temperatur more than oceans these patterns are very different from for ex ample the influence of l onglived greenhouse gases that are expected to exert longlived global influence the observed warming of the climate scribed above in changes observed in the earths climate corresponds to expected greenhouse gasinduced patterns of warming greater in winter than summer more at night than daytime and of generally increasing precipitation nd more warming at high latitudes than low latitudes another piece of evidence is the observed cooling as expected at 50 km and higher in the atmosphere which cannot be explaine d by seasonal or solar cycles also the increasing heat content of the oceans cannot be explained by urban heat islands or other placementrelated problems with measurement stations fingerprint methods have proven critical in attributing the climate change over the past decades to greenhouse gas emissions ve rsus natural forcings several studies have tried to explain historical climate change by running computer models mathematical simplif ications of how sc ientists understand climate processes to work with different combinations of forcing agents see use of models for climate change analysis below the results from one are presented in figure 6 scientists have repeatedly found that they cannot reproduce the warming of the last half century with natural forcings alone but can generate warming patterns similar to observed c limate changes when including greenhouse gases and aerosols these studies constitute one of the important lines of evidence that lead scientists to conclude that r ecent climate change has been caused in large part by greenhouse gaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs32 80 thomas l delworth and tr knutson

much of the discussion of future climate change is based on projections produced by computer models that represen t as completely as possible the relevant factors that are today understood to influe

models have improved substantially over the past decade and experts believe that many now do better job of representing the current and historical climates it is disagreement about the ability of these models to predic t future climate change that drives much of the current climate change debate this section explains how projections of climate are produced and provides the ra nge of forecasts

can be narrowed with confidence see use of models for climate analysis below climate models generally predict more heat wave s droughts and floods extreme cold episodes are predicted to decr ease the centers of continents are likely to experience summer warming and dryness scientists expect precipitation will be more intense when it occurs therefore also increasing runoff and the risk of flooding86 but it will be substantially harder to establish the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle or even direction of change for some regions both because there are fewer historical observations on which to build scientific understanding and because the physical cons traints are weaker scientists expect atmospheric and ocean circulation are likely to change as well studies have found that fu ture climate change will not be evenly distributed geographically or temporally even if the global mean temperature were to change very little regional c limate changes could be dram atic because of the uneven distribution of forcings by different agents and the c onnectedness of regions within the climate system although almost all regions are exp ected to experience warming some regions are projected to become wetter while others become drier future climate change is not likely to proceed smoothly as often depicted by averaged model results but to swing up and down around rising average as has occurred in the past this variability around rising average may complicate the detection and prediction of change though the ability of scientists to understand and model changes is advancing there will re main major uncertainties in the forecasting of local and seasonal climate changes that accompany global warming climate models are not yet adept at capturing extreme events or abrupt changes and there is significant potential of important climate surprises that models may not predict it is unclear how serious future changes may be given the climate variability to which humans and ecosystems are already adaptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs35 use of models for c limate change analysis in deciding whether to take action to address climate change and what actions may be effective decisionmakers seek projections of what to expect in the future scientists cannot rely only on analogies to past climates because the earths current biological chemical and geologic systems and human ac tivities have preceden t scientists use models first to understand the system th ey are studying building from theory and validating with experiments and observations of the past in order to interpret the causes of past variability and to use that understanding to forecast the future models are simplified representations of systems almost all of the models used for climate change analysis are mathematical and they are developed using wide variety of disciplines including physics atmos pheric chemistry economics engineering ecology and others over time and especially in the past decade different disciplines have joined expertise and t ools to provide more integrat ed and complete models for analyzing climate change as important while climate models few decades ago were built primarily on theore tical understanding the recent expansion of monitoring computing capacity and funding has allowed data assimilation or the use of realworld observations to improve the models rigorous comparisons of models help to validate their performance by reproducing observations of todays climate althoug h good performance on this test does not guarantee reliable future projections of climate changes or their patterns models are also tested in their ability to reproduce pale oclimatic events and ar compared in detail to understand why models res pond differently to forcings since the 1990s climate models perform sign ificantly better in reproducing current and historical climates although m odels diverge in important wa ys in the patterns of climate that they produce since 2000 important imp rovements have been made in modeling changes in some regions while large discrepancies exist for few regions climate models are generally less successful in reproducing observed precipitation than temperature perhaps because of its higher natural variability and extreme events and local climate predictions requi re higher resolution than global climate models currently offer also different mode ls produce different results in longterm projections of climate change the differences be tween climate models for given ghg emission scenario can be larger than the differences produced by one model running the range of future ghg emission scenarios furthermore there is some scientific opinion that while research is critically important for improving scie ntific understanding of the climate system and for possible future changes research may well increase the range of uncertainty as new processes are uncovered or existing struct ures are tested and revised methods and models are improving in their ability to characterize important uncertainties and to support risk assessment and risk manage ment decisions in spite of the unknowns just as in other sectors such as finance security and medicine the application of risk assessment and management techniques to climate change decision making is nascent but is providing useful insights for incorporating uncertainties into decisionmakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs36 87 rb alley et brupt climate change science 299 march 28 2003 pp 20052010 88 feedbacks relating to human economies and population distributions may be very important as well however there are very few integrated models capable of exploring the physical and economic systems together 89 wigley t m l the climate change commitment science 307 pp 17661769another complication in forecasting c limate change is the importance of feedbacks both positive and negative national research council report concluded that feedbacks in the climate system have many times in the geologic record amplified small initial climate pert urbations into major climate cycles with global mean temperature swings of 5o to 6oc87 the close linkage over hundreds of thousand of years between past temperat ure swings and carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in the atmosphere strongly suggests that temperature change can trigger strong positive amplifications through the carbon cycle and water vapor feedbacks current models include such feedbacks but they are very uncertain the most important and uncertain feedbacks affecting future climate projections include water vapor feedback cloud feedbacks vegetation feedbacks and albedo88 thus while most climate scientists conclude with high confidence that future climate change forced by greenhouse gases land use change and natural factors is probable the magnitude rapi dity and details of the changes are likely to remain unclear for many years or even decades there is near unanimity among climate model projections that 1 past human emissions have committed the climate to some change over the next few decades89 and ghg emissions emitted from now on will begin to dominate global warming by mid century and 2 feedbacks to the carbon cycle tend to be positive amplifying initia l warming by greenhouse gases the latter suggests also that climate change may reduce the effectiveness of carbon uptake by oceans and vegetation and that more war ming would require proportionately greater ghg emission reductions to st abilize the climate system impacts of projected climate change projected impacts of future climate change indicate that there will be winners and losers among regions sectors and in come groups some groups may benefit from certain amount of climate change whereas others may suffer harm regions that fare relatively well may be negatively affected by changes in other regions through trade security and humanitarian demands and immigration pressures future generations are likely to experience more change but may also be wealthier and hence better able to adapt although not uniformly so many species may become extinct while others are likely to flourish the local effects of climate change may contribute more to decisionmaking than national or global aggregates in april 2007 the ipcc released its fourth assessment of the impacts of climate

possible vaccines carbon dioxide and ocean acidification climate change research has revealed that elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are changing the chemistry of the oceans to state not witnessed for at least 55 million years prompting cern by many scien tists about potentially large effects on the marine food chain as the oceans absorb co2 from the atmosphere normal pr ocess in the carbon cycle that helps to lower co2 in the atmosphere and slow climate change the dissolved co2 makes the normally alkaline seawater more acidi c one study has found that the oceans have become about 30 less alkaline si nce preindustrial times101 this process is popularly referred to as ocean acidification the high dissolved co2 decreases carbonate ions which are needed by shellforming creatures to make calcium carbonate for their shells research on more than dozen species of corals and plankton indicates that net calcification the process of shellbuilding w ould decrease by 4 to 56 if co2 atmospheric concentrations were to double from preindustria l levels around 550 ppm102 forecast by some models to occur as early as midcentury above varying thresholds the decrease in growth turns to dissolving of their shells some species that show small effects may indicate unus ual adaptive re sponses that may not be needed at lower co2 concentrations in some cases resource managers may be able to help protect species in some locations however the few forecasts available suggest potentially large impacts on the ability of coral reefs to grow under future conditions moreover scientists believe the current acidification is essentially irreversible on humantime scales as the natural processes to raise alkalinity operate far too slowly to reverse the current trend the main unknown in how rapidly ocean acidification will occur is the future trajectory of co2 concentrations in the atmosphe re which depends largely on future humanrelated emissions of co2 mostly from fossilfuel burning103 concerns for impacts are particularly great for areas wh ere the form of carbon needed for shelling building aragonite is already low ie the high latitudes or where the ecosystems are dominated by shellbuilding organism s in the case of the southern ocean encircling antarctica both conditions occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs42 104 for more information

variety of implications for the us federal government first scien tific attention and public questions about climate change have increased pressure for research to provide answers and for elected officials to make d ecisions about whether and how to address climate change the us government invests around 6 billi on yearly on climate change research104 voluntary programs and financial in centives to advance lowghgemitting technologies setting clear nd realistic objectives for re search and programs remain nearterm challenge for federal programs but such measures facilitate continuing oversight of program performance and improve ments of particular interest may be questions about the rate at which science also inte grated with economics can narrow uncertainties about the magnitude rate geographic distribution and other characteristics of climate change and the degree to which changes may be predictable hence facilitatin g effective and timely adapta tion these questions bear importantly on the tradeoff between acting sooner with imperfect information versus delaying action in expecta tion of reducing uncertainties second the federal govern ment manages many asse ts that are potentially affected by climate change for example climate change could bring benefits or threats to public lands particularly to na tional parks and other physical and biological assets valued for their high natural and cultural amenities as climate change alters grasslands forests fisheries and other resources their values will change as may appropriate management objectives and plans similarly climate change may affect the demand and supply of energy for the ope rations of government with implications for infrastructure planning expenses and supply choices the federal government may find it sirable to redefine objectives and provide for institutional flexibility and ad aptive management as climate and the resources that depend on specific conditions change for example such ecological impacts as competition among species may lead to conflicts among endangered species105 or other resource management goal s evaluations of objectives and practices in light of potentia l future climate change ma enhance future successes of resource management although some climate changes and their impacts may occur relatively smoothly ecosystems frequently exhibit abr upt changes in response to incremental pressures in terms of socioeconomic consequences abrupt changes may constitute emergencies or even disasters that require federal responses nd possibly financial and other resources preparedness for and managing aftermaths of hurricanes droughts pest infestations fires epide mics coastal erosion and deterioration ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs43 permafrost are few examples of the physical pressures climate change may bring such changes can also create social dislocations and strife the dust bowl of the 1930s as an illustration of regional envir onmental disaster resu lted in one of the largest dislocations in us history beyond immediate responses the federal government also frequently acts as the insurer of the last resort this role could expand if private insurance becomes less available or more costly or if people do not procure adequate insurance the dramatic increase in economic losses since 1980 resulting from extreme weather events makes clear that economic exposur to extreme weather events such as droughts floods hurricanes tornadoes and others can run in the billions in the united states and much higher globally many experts suggest that all levels of government may find it useful to consider possible climate change implications when planning their longlasting infrastructure or other proj ects including energy proc urement water supply and flood control investment in buildings and transportation systems etc this could lessen the problem of obsolete expensive or stranded assets that could arise with possible climate and policy changes further expected climate changes outside the borders of the united states could have important implications for the us federal government as well for example climate change impacts in mexic and many other developing countries could be more adverse than in the united st ates due partly to more severe projected climate changes and partly to lower capacity to adapt the differential between united states and foreign direct impacts may increase pressure on migration and terms of trade it may also increase demands for disaster relief development assistance and other types of interventions implications for policy the federal government and other institutions have invested billions of dollars in researching climate change over more than five decades human emissions of greenhouse gases have increased expone ntially since the industrial revolution leading to higher concentrations of car bon dioxide methane and other gases than have existed for hundreds of thousands m aybe millions of years measurements demonstrate with increasing confidence that the earths climate has been warming especially in the past few decades and changing in other ways science cannot explain the recent patterns of climate ch ange without including the influence of elevated greenhouse gas concentrations although many uncertainties remain concerning the future magnitude rate and other details of climate change preponderance of scientists conclude that greenhouse gase s emitted by fossil fuel use and other human activities are virtually cer tain to induce global average warming by at least 18oc 32of over the 21st century or as high as 4oc 52of and possibly more than 6oc more than 9of these scientists assert that some warming is virtually inevitable because of the accumulation of past emissions in elevated atmospheric concentrations of ghg the time lags inhere nt in the climate system are an importanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs44 aspect affecting the effectiveness of various policy options see time lags in the climate system below time lags in the climate system timing of changes there are long time lags between emissions of most greenhouse gases their accumulation as risi ng concentrations in the atmosphere and the induced climate change that may last from decades to millenia atmospheric lifetimes different greatly among ghg from minutes to tens of thousands of years with co2 typically assumed to have half remaining in the atmosphere after about 100 years the long lived gases continue to influence the climate as long as they remain in the atmosphere thus emissions of say co2 today are expected to continue to affect climate for hundreds of years conversely slowing the growth of concentrations or stabilizing them would require proportionately large cuts in emissions or enhancements of removals eg through uptake by trees dominant influence over the next 50 years is likely the accumulation in the atmosphere of past ghg emissions changes in climate would continue for many decades to centuries after ghg concentrations cease to grow several points made by climate experts are important most ghg emitted today will aff ect the climate system for decades to hundreds of years from now reducing some gases with short atmospheric lifetimes may achieve relatively quick effects on climate while the effects of reducing longlived gases will ve greatest effect over decades to centuries ie longterm climate change near term benefits may be small for avoiding climate impacts through ghg reductions though the benefits may be large when aggregated over the atmospheric lifetime of the gas the more concentrations increase the greater the emission reductions required to achieve any specified ghg concentration target at some point the more warming occurs the less effective natural removals may be requiring proportionately more ghg reductions to achieve any specified ghg concentration target these conclusions raise number of ques tions that may help direct further research or science to s upport public policy decisions what do policymakers need to know from climate science in order to decide whether to address climate change furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs45 are research priorities aligned with needs and are realistic objectives and timetables established to answer key questions of prospective decisionmakers are appropriate mechanisms in place for communication between researchers and decisionmakers of many types considering the risks and possible consequences of decision options how much confidence in the science or specific conclusions do decision makers need in order to make choices do researchers know what decisionmakers need from them what are realistic estimates from researchers of when critically needed information can be pr ovided at the desired level of confidence are decisionmakers ex pectations consistent with the time necessary for rigorous research and assessment since all uncertainties cannot be eliminated are ppropriate useful risk decision tools and management regimes in place or planned to facilitate use of the best scientific information for different types of decisions eg resource mana gement ghg control policies financial decisions is there process to incorporate learning over time as well as legal and institutional adjustments to adapt to emerging scientific information do communication channels exist to ensure that relevant decision makers in congress agencies states localities businesses and households have access to useful and reliable information to make appropriate and timely decisions are effective cooperative mechanis ms intergovernmentally and internationally useful and in place to gain efficiencies and share insights and yield results that are compatible with national goals current and emerging science also provides key information for policy makers that may help to resolve the details of specific decisions such as is it timely to act now over what timeframe should actions be taken what are the options for action and their relative effectiveness including consideration of scope of greenhouse gases or other forcing agents to cover benefits and costs of investing to learn more or acting now or both mechanisms to monitor achievements and refine strategies etchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs46 what is the appropriate balance between research acting on current knowledge adapting to anticipated change and informing decision makers public and private of choices and implications there are number of bills before the 110th congress proposing diversity of approaches to address climate change and greenhouse gas reductions there also likely will be more hearings both legislative and oversight thus assuring that the best scientific underp inning is available for policy related delibera tions will remain priorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs47 106 s fred singer human contribution to climate change remains

that influence climate the earths climate is va riable and scientists unde rstand to varying degrees the forces that have driven climate changes of the past many factors contribute to changes in climate regionally and globally and single factor acts alone106 the principal natural factors determining c limate through geologic time include the earths orbit around the sun solar activity ocean variability volcanoes release of methane clathrates from the ocean bed and chaotic variability human activities have grown to scale especially over the past century that it is almost certain that these human activities have contributed to the climate change observed in recent decades this appendix provides brief info rmation on the principal identified natural drivers of climate the hum an activities affec ting climate the principal reason demanding current policy attention are described in the human activities that influence climate change section above earths orbit around the sun the shape of the earths orbit around the sun is not perfectly round the earths axis is tilted and wobbles as it turns these and other ot her orbital behaviors are fairly well understood and predictable in the ways they influence the earths climate generally when the earth is closer to the sun the earth receives more incoming radiation and warms solar activity several aspects of solar activity have been suggested as contributors to climate change although they remain disputed total solar irradiance the ultraviolet component of irradiance cosmic rays and earthsolar magnetism although the validity and magnitude of these remain in dispute cosmic rays and earthsolar magnetism remain pa rticularly complex and poorly understood the variability of the suns total irradiance or how much solar energy the sun emits toward the earth influences th earths climate alt hough its significance is disputed on long time scales solar variability could have large influence as on the cold temperatures of the little ice age 107 but quantification of the solar role in climate variability over periods of centuries to milleni is poor for example while some scientists have found evidence that th suns activity may ve been relatively high during the medieval warm period ot her scientists have found evidence that estimated varibility of suns total irradiance has been sufficient to drive climate variations over the past 1000 years for ex ample one study of recent climate using very simple model found that solar variab ility may have accounted for approximately 40 of climatic variability over the pa st

solar sunspots and an 11year radiation cycle some scientists conclude that variations in solar output have been too small since 1978 to have significantly induced the observed global warming of the past three decades109 solar output of ultraviolet light has been postulated as causing the maunder minimum around 1650 to 1710 of the northe rn hemispheres little ice age when scientists believe that the sun was relatively quiet and emitted less ultraviolet light this in turn may have reduced the ozone in the stratosphere ozone is greenhouse gas that warms the earth so the reduction of ozone in the stratosphere due to less ultraviolet light may have cooled the northern hemisphere on average by few tenths of degree centigrade some scientists have f ound that estimated ultraviolet variance since 1915 correlates poorly with global average temperature110 ocean variability at least one scientist111 has hypothesized that the natural dynamics of ocean systems may be periodic and have an infl uence at least on regional or hemispheric climates understandi ng of the oceans may also eluc idate factors that can trigger abrupt climate changes for example evidence exists that periods of increased freshwater flow to the north atlantic and arctic oceans from the laurentide ice sheet over canada may be re sponsible for abrupt and si gnificant climate events in nw europe that took place in the lateglacial and early holocene volcanic eruptions the presence of certain aerosols or tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere can reflect sunlight away from the earth over geologic time and in certain recent eruptions the aerosols jetted into the atmosphere have caused significant cooling for one to several ears after an eruption about 71000 years ago an eruption of mt toga in presentda

clathrates or methane hydrates are form of ice with methane trapped in their cystalline structures that exist at cold temperatures and high pressu res on the earths ocean floor and in arctic continental shelves the latte r of which may be very sh allow or even above ground some hypothesize that the sudden releas of methane clathrates may have been implicated in the earths most severe extinction event which occurred suddenly about 252 million years ago resulting in 5oc temperature increase globally and with an estimated loss of about 96 of marine speci and 70 of terrestrial vertebrate species another rapid warming thought by some to have been caused by massive releases of methan clathrates or carbon dioxid and accompanied by major extinctions occurred at the beginning of the paleoceneeocene thermal maximum or the initial eocene thermal maximum sea surface temperatures rose between 5o and 8oc and in the high arctic sea rface temperatures rose to about 23oc73of todays mean annual temperature at the north pole is around 20oc4of there is corroborating evidence in rapid color change of ocean sediments that normal deposition of white calcite shells of cean animals stopped for some 50 thousand years which may have occurred with accompanying ocean acidification114 see carbon dioxide and ocean acidification above water vapor water vapor exists naturally in the earths atmosphere and is the most important greenhouse gas see greenhouse gases section accounting for around twothirds of the 33oc of additional warming our planet receives because of the presence of its atmosphere115 however change in water vapor content of the atmosphere can have warmin g or cooling effects depending on where it is in the atmosphere in latitude and altitude warmer temperatures globally will tend to increase the water vapor in the atmosphere positive feedback that tends to amplify the warming to the degree that certain clouds increase especially low clouds with increased water vapor negative feedback may result reducing the warming much of the warming predicted by climate models in response to ghg results from amplification by increased water vapor in the atmosphere from the initial increase in ghgforced temperature feedbacks to clouds are among the least understood processes and account for large differences among climate mode l results althoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33849crs50 significant scientific advances in understanding clouds have been made since the year 2000 it will be at least several years before these are fully incorporated into scientific assessments and doubt considerable uncertainty will remain for decades chaotic variability climate scientists say that there is natural or chaotic variability in the climate system meaning that there is certain amount of random or unexplained behavior of the climate to some degree this natural variability reflects what science has not identified cannot explain or does not find regular statistical pattern to describe the presence of unexplained variability does not mean that scientists cannot make meaningful and us eful statements about the pa st or future it means that there is an amount of uncertainty resu lting from unidentified or poorly understood factors or randomness that will rema in in forecasts of the future
