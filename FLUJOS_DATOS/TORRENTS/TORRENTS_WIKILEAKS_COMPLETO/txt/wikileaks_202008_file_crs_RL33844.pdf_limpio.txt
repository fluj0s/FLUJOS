legislative debate as members contemplate comprehensive immigration reform cong ress may face decisions regarding the possible renewal of the immigrant investor visa pilot program as well as the expansion of the e2 nonimmigrant treaty investor visa there are currently two categories of nonimmigrant investor visas and one category of immigrant investor visa for legal permanent residents lpr the visa categories used for nonimmigrant investors are e1 for treaty traders and the e2 for treaty investors the visa category used for immigrant investors is the fifth preference employmentbased eb5 visa category according to department of homeland security dhs statistics there were 217148 nonimmigrant treaty trader and investor visa arrivals in the unite d states in fy2006 for the same time frame dhs reported the arriva l of 749 lpr investors when viewed from comparative perspective the investor visas of the united states are most closely mirrored by those of canada the lpr investor visa draws especially strong parallels to the canadian immigrant investor visa since the latter served as the model for the former comparing the admissions data between these two countries however reveals that the canadian investor provision attracts many times the number of investors of its united states counter part yet both countries showed an upward trend in immigrant investor visas in the last two years the investor visas offered by the unite d states operate on the principle that foreign direct investment into the united states should spur economic growth in the united states according to the classical theory if these investments are properly targeted towards the us labor forces skill sets it should reduce the international migration pressures on us workers to ttract foreign investors research indicates that temporary migrants are motivated most significantly by employment and wage prospects while permanent migrants ar motivated by professional and social mobility theoretically however it is unclear to what extent potential migration provides additional incentive for investment activity investors from developed countries may sometimes lack incentive to ttle in the united states since they can achieve foreign direct investment fdi and similar standards of living from their home country yet in cases where fore ign investors have been attracted the economic benefits have been positive and significant immigrant investors have been subject to notable administrative efforts in the past couple of years in 2005 dhs devel oped the investor and regional center unit ircu to govern matters concerning lpr investor visas and i nvestments to better adjudicate petitions and coordina investments in part because of these efforts working with foreign financing from the immigrant investor program has become highly attractive for many domestic investors particularly through limited partnerships recent legislation s 1639 has sought to reduce the number of investor visas

try of foreign investors into the united states is likely to spark legislative debate for example the immigrant investor visa pilot progra m which was created to attract foreign investors to permanently emigrate to the united states is set to expire at the end of fy20081 additionally the government of denmark has lobbied for legislation that would allow its nationals eligibility to enter the united states as e2 nonimmigrant treaty investors if such legislation is succe ssful other government s whose nationals like denmark are currently only eligible for e1 nonimmigrant treaty trader visas would likely seek similar treatment granting visas to foreign investors provides many potential benefits including increased domes tic employment and capital levels yet extending foreign investor vi sas provides several potential risks as well such as visa abuses reduced foreign market gr owth and security concerns the central policy question surrounding foreign investors and particularly legal permanent resident lpr investors is whether the benefits reaped from allocating visas to foreign investors outweigh the costs of denying visas to other applicant groups the subsequent analys is provides background and contextual framework for the consideration of foreig n investor visa polic after brief legislative background this report will provide discussions of immigrant and nonimmigrant investors visas comparison of us and canadian immigrant investor programs an analysis of the re lationship between inve stment and migration and finally review of current issues background since the immigration act of 19242 the united states has expressly granted visas to foreign nationals for the purpos of conducting commerce within the united states although foreign investors had pr eviously been allowe d legal st atus under several treaties of friends hip commerce and navigation treaties the creation in 1924 of the nonimmigrant treaty trader visa provided the first statutory recognition of foreign nationals as temporary traders with the implementation of the immigration and nationality ac t of 1952 ina the statute was expanded to include nonimmigrant

aliens are nonimmigrants ch as tourists foreign students diplomats temporary agricultural workers exchange vi sitors or intracompany business personnel who are admitted for specific purpose and

investors are admitted into the united states as lprs5 with the immigration act of 19906 congress expanded the statutory immigrant visa categories to include an investor class for foreign investors the statute developed an employmentbased eb5 investor visa for lprs7 which allows for up to 10000 admissions annually and generally re quires minimum 1 million investment through the immigrant investor pilot program investors may invest in targeted regions and existing enterprises that are fi nancially troubled this pilot program was extended by the basic pilot program extension and expansion act of 20038 to continue through fy2008 foreign investors are gene rally considered to help boost the united states economy by providing an influx of foreign capital into the united states and through job creation for investor immigrants job creation is an explic it criterion while with the nonimmigrant visa categories economic ac tivity is assumed to spur job growth additionally foreign investor s are often associated with entrepreneurship and increased economic activity critics however believe that such investors may be detrimental since they potentially displace potential entrepreneurs that are united states citizenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33844crs3 9 the ina provides for permanent annual worldwide level of 675000 legal permanent residents lprs but this level is

of immigr ants has set of preferences for the classes within that category these preferences determ ine the priority of visa distribution for each category depending on certain formulas provided for

outputs are other than tangible goods65 this expanded definition of trade into the service sector allows for fairly broad understanding of what trade may entail the term substantial trade has never been explicitly defined in terms of monetary value rather the term is meant to indicate that there is an amount of trade necessary to ensure continuing flow of international trade items66 for smaller businesses regulatory qualification for tr eaty trader status may be derived from demonstrating that the trading activities would generate an income sufficient to support the trader and his or her family67 the qualifications fo r sufficient volume or transaction have not been explicitly set in the regulations68 but minimum qualification is that more than 50 of th businesss trade must flow

there are many countries with i nvestor visa programs including the united kingdom australia and new zealand the canadian inve stor program has the strongest parallels to those of the united states

programs in ot her countries constitutes zerosum game there are data available showing the motive for migration among investors or if they perceive the united states and cana da as interchangeable investment locations if the investors ar motivated purely by the economic returns then economic theory93 suggests that equalizing the program financial requirements should result in more equal rates of petitions furthermore lowering of the financial requirements should increase the supply for bot h countries however if the immigrant investors are motivated to migra by nonfinancial considerations then equalizing the united states program require ments with its cana dian counterpart is likely to have little impact on the current trends analysis of the relationship between investments and migration classical economic theory has posited that trade liberalization including the reduction of investment rest rictions establishes conditional inverse theoretical relationship between foreign direct investment fdi and migration94 in other words as trade increases migration pressures decreas the theory posits that an increased level of fdi should reduce migratory pre ssures through growth in the targeted economy as economic growth produces higher demand for labor workers in that economy feel less pressure to seek employ ment in foreign economies provided that the new jobs complement the workforces skills for example if economic growth creates demand for skilled labor then an unskilled labor force should not experience any reduced migration pressures thus while fdi increases hostcountry growth there is not necessarily direct reducti on in hostcountry migration pressures the investor visas offered by the united states operate on the principal that fdi into the united states should spur economic growth in the united states according to the classical theory if these investments are properly targeted towards the us labor forces skill sets it s hould reduce the migration pressures on us workers such economic growth from fdi should further spur greater demand for trade in fdi between capital abundant countries such as the oecd member states between whom marked majority of fdi flows the empirical evidence has largely supported this notion95 furthermore it has provided an in creased per capita income in these states as well as boosted the general

possibility that foreign investment and capital trade objectives of many investors are accomplished through multinationa l corporations under the construct of multinational corporation returns to the

1994states the classical trade theory asserts that trade and migration are substitutes96 and that trade liberalization should reduce migratory pressures97 these basic propositions are generally agreed to hold in the long term consequently in the long term classical trade theory suggests ther should be little migrati on of investors from countries with liberalized trade rrangements with the united states98 instead these investors would achieve thei r investments through conven tional fdi furthermore the theory suggests that investors would be more likely to migrate from countries with restrictive trade policies policy more highly correlated with less economically developed countries critics of the classical economic models contend that despite elegant predictions the models produced by the th eory frequently do not capture the costs of international finance such critics argue that foreign investments often occur at the expense of local businesses and result in exploitive practices of local labor99 these criticisms are particularly common when critiquing the economic relationship between capital abundant countries nd less economically developed countries ledc according to the argument more powerful countries can leverage their power to construct investme nt relationships that shif t disproportionate amount of profits to the capital abunda nt countries simultaneously greater share of the costs100 are shouldered by the less powerful c ountry classical economists generally respond by noting that these investments are still producing growth in the ledcs making the countries better off than w ithout the investments however ledcs remain source of contention between the classical economic theorists and their critics less economically veloped countries some scholars have expressed doubt about the posited tr ademigration substitutab ility suggesting that the relationship in the short or medium term could look different from the long term101 one of the

fdi does entail some degrees of risk and reward for both the home and host economies for the home economy fdi can improve competitiveness and performance of firms by providing valueadded activities better employment opportunities better export performance and higher national income at th same time engaging in fdi also runs the risks of lower additions to both domestic investment and capital stock as well as loss of competitiveness and jobs in certain parts of the economy for the host economies the benefits include increases in employment and potential multiplier effects on other parts of the economy through productivity growth acce pting fdi however does run the risk that domestic firms are crowded out of the market united nations world investment report 2006 107 from the classical economic perspective the immigrant investor pilot program is counter intuitive in the case of investors from devel oped countries there is little incentive for them to settle in the united states since they can achieve similar standards of living and all of their fdi objectives from their home country as for ledcs drain of their capital may provide shortterm benefits to the united stat but would inhibit growth and trade in the long run the flight of investors from hong kong in the late1980s and the 1990s was unique economic situation that has since subs ided other than the hong kong scenario there is seemingly little incentiv for investors to relocatecountries with different levels of development102 under such scenario economic growth in sending country would pr ovide potential migrants with the economic means to overcome relatively high migration costs other observers point to such factors as imperfect credit markets and currency fluctuations as significant push factors for potential migrants103 these latter factors however are generally more highly correlated with ledcs therefore both the complementary and substitutability theories of trade and migration suggest that higher demand for investor outmigration should currently lie in the populations of ledcs however as noted earlier investor visas issued to regions with ledcs are relatively few what makes the visa program distinct from conventional fdi is that it involves trade through the import of human capital consequently these visas have potential for creating socalled brain drain migration out of less developed sending countries104 ledcs are by definition limited in their capital levels and economic theory would suggest that exporting cap ital from capital scarce country would inhibit its growth and development105 classical theorists would argue that the united states would be better served by sendi ng fdi into ledcs thereby promoting economic growth in ledcs and subse quent higher demand for

whether to migrate differences in both gains and price levels should affect the costbenefit calculation of the potential migrants as these variables will affect potential levels of consumption and savings for perman ent migrants however the prospects for professional and social mobility are the main motivating factors the distribution of visas among asian c ountries shows marked countryspecific tendencies among investor visa petitioners specifically the polarization among petitioners towards ither immigrant permanent or nonimmigrant temporary visas suggests that significant proportion of applicants are substituting immigrant visas for nonimmigrant visas or vice versa for example while japan accounted for 378 of all the foreign nati onals arriving on nonimmigrant treaty trader and

united states the fact that china taiwan and south korea have had strong economic performance in the last decade and relativel higher levels of immigrant investors to the united states suggests that these investors are migrating for more than financial purposes these investors may be more strongly motivated by the family andor social network connections to previously migrated investors and other lprs in the united states these theoretically derived motives however must be further tested empirically before any conclusive be havioral statements can be made multiplier effects classical economic theory hol ds that investments provide for multiplier effects throughout the econom by increasing demand for other goods and services for example an increase in demand for corn may increase the demand

concerns were raised by both members and advocates that the ircu still did not process applications quickly enough121 and that staff members had competing obligations within ircu122 proponents of the immigrant investor pilot program believe it has attracted signifi cant amount of capital and that addressing these criticisms would further increase the levels of foreign investments through the lpr investor visa123 uscis has responded to these criticisms by expanding the number of regional centers available for lpr i nvestor investments most recently ircu has been expanded into western pennsylvania working with foreign financing from the immigrant investor program has become highly attractive for many dom estic investors number of current investment projects are using lpr investor financing because it is less costly for the domestic investors for domestic investor s employing lpr investor funds becomes significantly cheaper option than bank an since there is requirement to pay interest on the financing additionally because the enterprises are less saddled with financing debt they are more quickly able to turn profit the lpr investor visahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33844crs27

this regional cent er was the result of statewide effort to find an improved thod of attracting fore ign capital to south dakota from the states perspective the eb5 pilot investor program offered more promising solution than the e2 nonimmigrant visa since officials could offer investors the benefit of lpr status126 additionally the job creation criterion of the eb5 visa aligned well with the states

dairy farm investors uscis agreed to the designa tion on the condition that south dakota would allow for limited partnerships of foreign investors with domestic farmers127 as result south dakota

its dairy industry with an additional 10 applications still pending128 these foreign investors have injected approximately 30 million into the south dakota economy with an additional 6 milli on in matching funds coming from local farmers furthermore this combined 36 million in invested funds has resulted in almost 90 million in bank financing for the various dairy investment projects as direct
