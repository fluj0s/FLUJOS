the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 pl 109248 includes add itional federal re quirements related to criminal background checks of prospective foster and adoptive parents and newly requires states to check child abuse and neglect re gistries for information about prospective foster or adoptive parents section 1528 the law also requires the establishment of national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect section 633 criminal records checks state procedures for criminal records ch ecks of prospective foster and adoptive parents must now include check of nati onal crime databases ie an fbi check and must be done before the placement of any foster child can be finally approved with prospective foster or adoptive parents under prior law the kind of criminal record check for example state vs fbi vs local was not specified and the federal requirement for these checks extended only to children for whom state intended to make federal foster care or adoption assistance claims under title ive of the social security act as under prior law ex cept in those states opting out of the requirements see discussion below if criminal record check reveals certain felony convictions of prospective foster or adoptive parent state may not claim title iv foster care or adoption assistance for child placed in his or her home however this does not absolutely prohibit the state child welfare agency from placing foster child in the home of such prospective foster or adoptive parent if the agency nonetheless determines that the home is sa fe for the child at the same time use of this placement by the agency disqualifies th child for title ive and the agency may not then seek federal reimbursement of the otherwise eligible costs it incurs on the foster or adoptive childs behalf9 for most states these criminal record check requirements became effective with the first day of fy2007 however prior law llowed states to opt out of the federal criminal records check procedures and p l 109248 permits those opt out states to have until the first day of fy2009 to co into compliance with the prior law as well as the new requirements these states are idaho oklahoma oregon californiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34252crs7 10 these states were identified by hhs as the optout states in july 2006 pl 109248 eliminated the ability of any additional states to

permit the state to comply with the new federal rules child abuse and neglect registry checks many child abuse and neglect cases are not the subject of criminal court proceedings and information on the perpetrators is therefore unlikely to appear in criminal records check however this data may be included in state child abuse and neglect registry as of the first day of fy2007 pl 109248 requires all states to check any child abuse and neglect registry they maintain for information about prospective foster or adoptive parent nd any adult living in their household the check must be made before approving placement of foster child in the home and without regard to whether th state plans to claim title ive support for the child states must also request and all states must comply with such

cycle as the pssf program pl 109288 did not change the funding authority for this program which was set at 325 million beginning with fy1990 however funding for this pr ogram has never reached this full authorization level in fy2007 the program received 287 million program purposes pl 109288 emphasized that cws funds are provided to assist states in developing and expanding child and family
