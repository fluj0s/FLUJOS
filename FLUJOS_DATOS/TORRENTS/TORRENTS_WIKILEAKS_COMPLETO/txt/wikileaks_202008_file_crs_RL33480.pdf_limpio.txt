and controversies summary river management is complex and in many cases decisions must be made to balance conflicting values dams are built because they provide numerous benefits to society including flood control navigation irrigation and drinking water hydropower and recreation but they are not without their detriments dams also block fish passage alter natural river systems m odify sediment and water temperature regimes and i nundate sites of cultural impor tance every dam is built with an expected life span and will even tually need to be repaired replaced or removed while dams may once have been viewed as almost entirely beneficial today they are seen as having both positive and negative attributes in this light policy makers and the public have co to view dam removal as one option in the effort to balance the costs and benefits of river management congress has legislated dam removal through the elwha river ecosyste m and fisheries restoration act pl 102495 and the president requested fy 2007 funding for dam removal program the national marine fisheries services open rivers initiative congress had also made clear its intent to ensure oversight in dam removal issues as an example pl 10660 316 limited the authority of the bonneville power administration in its cost recovery to ensure that the agency did not generate surp lus revenue to be put toward snake river dam removal the benefits and detriment s of dam are casespecific and stakeholders evaluation of whether dam removal is an attractive option depends on the values that they assign to those qualities some federal dams notably four projects on the lower snake river in washington have generated contentious debate litigation and specific legislation cited above in recent years dam removal has become more commonly considered choice among th available options for managing the publics investment in our na tional inventory of dams in many cases there have been some 500 documented dam removals in the united states removal may provide greater economic envi ronmental public safety aesthetic and recreational benefits than dam ma intenance modification and upkee p particularly for aging and smaller dams but there are other circum stances when dam removal may not be the appropriate choice when re moval would cause socially unacceptable effects such as the loss of flood protection for critical areas the destruction of wetlands created by the dam or the loss of energy from hydropower project as americas dams age their owners regulatory agencies and the public must decide how to manage these structures although decisions regarding dams are unique to each location and highly reflective of local interests congress has been and will likely continue to be asked to fund dam remova l programs

the united states investment in dams has provided numer ous benefits such as flood control navigation irrigati on and drinking water hydropower and recreation but dams are not without their triments dams block fish passage alter natural river systems modify sediment and water temperature regimes and inundate sites of cultural importance while dams may once have been viewed as almost entirely beneficial today they may be seen as having both positive and negative attributes1 congress has legislated dam removal and has been asked to fund federal dam removal program2 dam removal continues to be legislative issue the energy and water development appropriations act of 2007 hr 5427 108 directs the corps of engineers not to spend any funds on removing oregons elk creek dam and the water resources development act of 2005 s 728 2037 would authorize the corps of engineers to remove small dams congress has made clear its intent to ensure funding oversight in dam remova l issues as an example pl 10660 316 limited the authority of the bonneville power administration in its cost recovery to ensure that the agency did not generate rplus revenue to be put toward snake river dam removal though da m removal can be controversial issue for local stakeholders there has been litigation in the columbia river basin based in part on whether the snake river dams should be considered for removal because they may threaten some species of salmon w ith extinction cong ressional involvement in decisions regarding the management of the united states inventory of dams3 will likely increase as these projects age requiring more frequent and extensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33480crs2 4 see httpwwwusbrgovpmtseconom icsreportsdamremovalpaper2pdfmaintenance or as they come due for re licensing and their current environmental conditions are reassessed many dams were constructed in the first half of the last century as they age maintenance and repair costs often in crease substantially making continued investments questionable d ecision older dams may not serve their purpose as well as they did when they were built as sediment accumulates and displaces the amount of water that can be stored in the rese rvoir at some point routine repair and maintenance may longer ensure the structural stability of the dam increasing the potential for dam failure and associated losses in property da mage and possibly human life for privately owned dams these situations may result in substantial increases in the costs of liability insurance and instead of spending large sums of money to repair these facilitie s it may make econo mic sense to remove the structure it is increasingly common for decisionmake rs and dam owners to view removal as an option in the effort to balance the costs and benefits of river impoundment and dam upkeep4 environmental safety regulatory economic and cultural issues may all be important aspects when deciding how best to manage river system perhaps an existing dams economic value is so great that the best way to address fish and wildlife concerns is through modifyin g the dam structure and operations community may decide that it would prefer natural river for aesthetic reasons and that it is willing to forego the recreati onal opportunities provide d by dam in favor of the recreational opportunitie s provided by freeflowing river power company might evaluate power production revenue against the cost of relicensing and environmental mitigation in its decision to maintain or remove dam reasons for dam removal there are number of reasons dam owne rs might conclude that dam removal would be the best course of action while one primary be nefit may be the principal reason for the decision avoiding costly repairs restoring fishery eliminating safety hazard it is likely that more than one reason will factor into the decision to remove dam shifting public values members of community may decide that they prefer the aesthetic value of freeflowing river to that of still water public perceptions can change over time and an areas residents may shift their collective desire to having more natural waterscape as part of their home similar issue of public sentiment beyond commun ity values is that dams and reservoirs are often located in relatively rural natural and seminatural settings many people have expressed distaste for manmade facilities in otherwise wild scenic and natural conditions this may especially be the case in communities where dams once served commercial purpose that is longer viable

httpwwwsilentsportsnetshorts_april_2004html9environment environmental concerns are among the primary reasons for dam removal dams block fi sh passage flood habitat nd dramatically change the characteristics of river affecting the river channel water velocity turbidity and temperature fish and wildlife issues are primary aspect of the environmental impact of dams dams block access to spawning habitat for anadromous or migratory species and can create new habitat that favors invasive species dam may create large warm body of water from river that was once swift and cold warmwater species such as bass that might be introduced to create sport fishery can thrive in this environment and threaten native fish by competing for food or through predation5 another environmental cons ideration is wetland habitat wetland areas are often eliminated or shifted by dams and the fl ood protection provided by dams reduces the frequency of inundation in cha nnels downstream as the ri ver flow is altered this tends to modify and move the area and na ture of wetlands and affects the floodplain by preventing inundation which brings sediment deposits6 sediment movement is an important component of river ecosystems dam construction impounds not only water but diment as well having impacts both upstream and downstream sediment accumulation behind dam reduces water depth and changes the characteristics of aquatic habitat conversely downstream areas may suffer from lack of sediment through beach erosion and damage to aquatic habitat brought about by too little sediment7 dams and reservoirs are often located in places of cultural historical or archeological significance and these resources may be affected by alterations in dam structure native american artifacts and burial sites may have been inundated by reservoirs and they could be exposed by dam removal the dam itself may be of historical significance based on its cons truction or role in the community an evaluation of the possibility of uncoveri ng cultural artifacts and the historical significance of the dam and facilities themselves may be important considerations when weighing dam removal as an option outdated purpose dam may be considered for removal because it longer serves its intended purpose an impoundment created to generate power for longgone mill would be an example an example is the white river dam in wisconsin the dam was built in the 1800s to support commercial shipping through locks but the locks were abandoned in the 1950s and the nolongeruseful dam fell into disrepair8 the removal

and meet regulatory requirements regulatory costs may include costs associated with mitigating environmental damage caused by the dam and could include altere d dam configurati on operational changes or habitat repair to name few common examples if the benefits provided by the dam are reduced owners may be reluctant to invest in maintenance this comes with its own potential cost in the form of increased liability risk10 there may also be considerable cost associated with federal energy regulatory commission ferc relicensing of dams that produce electricity ferc estimates the cost of relicensing to be 58 per kilowatt of project generation capacity11 pacificorp western us utility company is removing its 147 megawatt condit dam on the white salmon river in washington for this reason in 1991 the company filed an application with the ferc to renew the dams operating license which was scheduled to expire at the end of 1993 ferc issued its final environmental impact statement is for the project in 1996 the eis recommended fish passage f acilities that would cost an estimated 30 to 50 million rather than continue the relicensing proce ss and invest that amount of money in the project pacificorp agreed to consider dam removal as an option the company reached settlement agreement with inte rested parties and has plans to begin removing the dam in 2008 the estimated cost of removal is 17 million 1999 dollars12 safety dam that is in danger of failing or that presents other public safety issues posing hazard to navigation for example may also be candidate for removal public safety concerns are also closely linked to economics liability insurance and the necessary maintenance to make dam safe may outweigh the benefits the dam provides safety concerns are one of the most common reasons for dam removal13 in wisconsin safety concerns ar one of the primary drivers of dam removal and the removal of unsafe stru ctures is codified in state law14 multiple reasons in reality although there ma be primary reason for dam removal such as economics or safety there are likely number of complementaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33480crs5 15 see httpwwwpacificorpc

onomics and the environment 2003 hereafter referred to as dam removal research issues that make dam removal the final choice when considering river management pacificorps condit dam cited above ma be slated for removal primarily for economic reasons but the removal of the pr oject will address an environmental issue by improving habitat and river conditions for salmon and steelhead the economic issue for pacificorp was the expense of recommendation to provide fish access and additional flows from the dam15 the dams removal also has substantial public value as evidenced by the indicated interests who are parties to the removal agreement16 issues when considering dam removal the reasons why dam owner community or governing body might consider dam removal are outlined bove but several concerns may lead some parties to oppose dam removal or may have to be addressed when pl anning removal project concerns about the outcome of dam rem oval effort are ofte n based on perceptions about the final result for example community members may worry that the drained area behind the dam will be an unsightly mud flat or other practical decisions about the management of stored sediment and its impact on water quality societal concerns stakeholders may consider number of issues when evaluating dam removal those termed societal concerns in this report deal with the human factors that might be considered in dam rem oval planning when considering the social values associated with river dam or reservoi r the decisionmaking process is improved when interested and affected parties are presented with reasonable predictions about how the river dam owner and community will be affected in the short and long term both with and without the dam17 ownership and use of exposed land who owns land that was once underneath reservoir ownership can vary in each case and may be straightforward or more complex depending on the number of parties involved and different state property laws if single landowner bu ilt dam on his or her property then ownership is easy to determine however in cases involving multiple owners deeds may specify that property extends to the wa ters edge or the center of the river bed the outcome of these scenarios is unclear and is concern that may leave some landowners wary of dam removal as an option even if they support th idea of restoring the river18 recreation if an impoundment is popular for fishing boating swimming and other activities the loss of this recreation resource may be frustrating to its usershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33480crs6 19 ibid 20 ibid 21 american society of civil engineers guidelines for retirement of dams and hydroelectric facilities new york ny 1997 pp 7173 22 guidelines p 77stakeholders must consider whether free flowing river would provide some of the same or other recreati onal opportunities and whether users would adapt to the change conversely if reservoir has beco filled with sedime nt its removal may create new recreational pportunitie s for community members where there were none such as fishing or rafting opportunities19 aesthetic concerns one of the most consistent issues raised in discussions of dam removal is concern about the app earance of drained reservoir after dam removal some of these concerns re flect personal preference one persons appreciation of still water views over flowing river or vice versa other concerns may reflect lack of understanding about how river systems function for example two of the most common aesthetic issues ra ised are fears that without the dam the river will dry up or that the drained re servoir will remain permanent mudflat these concerns can be addressed by veloping restoration options and public education efforts as part of the removal planning process20 physical concerns physical concerns associated with dam removal go beyond personal or community values about the desirability of one landscape over another property rights or recreational choices physical concerns relate to the health of the river effects on structures in the river the potential for property damage and similar issues both societal values and physical concerns are important to address when evaluating dam removal as an option how ever health and human safety may be affected by the physical impacts of dam removal sediment rainfall melting snow and river erosion provide constant stream of sediment that is trans ported through river system in an undammed river this sediment is both deposited t and resuspended from the riverbed dam construction affects this dynamic causing more sed iment to be deposite d upstream and less downstream than if the dam were not there if dam is to be removed the sediment collected upstream must be managed to avoid uncontrolled release of the accumulated sediment which ma alter the river system nd affect navigation water quality fisheries and other important aspects of the river21 each dam is unique and diment

sedime nt management is genera lly the result of number of considerations listed bove including navigation fi sheries and water quality sediment that contains toxic material presents specific management problem and can complicate dam removal or limit the choices among sediment management strategies concentrations of hazardous contaminants in sediment that are significantly higher than those found elsewh ere in the river system may eliminate the possibility of dam removal or could likely limit the choices among sediment control options to physical removal or stabilization prior to dam removal23 flooding community members and other interested parties near dam being considered for removal may express cerns about the possibility of increased flooding in the area after the dam is remove d during the actual removal process it is important to plan carefully to regulate the release of stored water so that shortterm flooding does not occur however there is also often fear of more frequent flooding without the dam present many dams including larger runofriver dams that have little storage capacity but particularly the smaller dams that are most often considered for removal pr ovide little or flood control24 in some cases owing to disrepair or the manner in which they are operated some dams can increase flood risk to upstream and downstream areas25 nevertheless an evaluation of the projects flood control capacity is important if dam removal is consider ed if dam under consideration for removal doe s have significant flood reduction benef its removal options may be limited or alternate plan s for flood mitigation could be considered to ensure continued fl ood protection if desired26 inriver structures dam removal alters the flow rate and pattern of river and the results of this change can affect existing infrastructure such as storm water runoff culverts water intakes utility lines docks levees and bridges27 additionally the structure of the river channel may be altered to the point that it affects navigation28 the degree of any of these impacts would be unique to each dam and may not apply at all depending on circ umstances the important issues are awareness of the potential for this type of damage evaluation of its severity and planning to avoid or mitigate any structural impacts if dam removal is chosen as preferred option

other pollution47 because dams are blamed for the declin of fish populations in the basin some environmental and tribal interests are pushing for their removal to improve habitat and river flows for
