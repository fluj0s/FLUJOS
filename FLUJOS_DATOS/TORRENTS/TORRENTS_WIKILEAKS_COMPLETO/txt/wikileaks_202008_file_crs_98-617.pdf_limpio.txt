the meetings also reflected the deep desire for american congressional staff and chinese policymakers to learn more about each other to exch ange ideas and to find common ground the chinese hosts at every meeting in every city extended gracious hospitality the chinese sponsors of this trip also ensured that the delegation had the chance to enjoy the great cultural heritage that china s and in this way provided context of chinas history politics and economic growth members of the group were impressed by the broad size and scope of the chinese nation from the great wall outside of beijing to the dynamism in hong kong and from the rural expanses of the shaanxi province to the growth of development in shanghai beijing august 12th 16th most of the meetings that took place in beijing concerned broad trade and political issues between the united states and china the congressional staff delegation met with senior chinese government officials former members of the government both civilian and military officials in the us embassy and with representatives from the boeing corporation an overview of technology trade and security issues it became apparent during two weeks of discussions that chinas national technology policy is viewed by many polic ymakers business leaders academics and others as the engine for chinas fu ture economic growth and development3 invigorating scientific research and acce ss to technology innovation are at the core of chinas economic plan for the 21st century part of this strategy is domestic policy targeted at strengthening internal science and technology st resources this strategy is also global china seek s to obtain wide range of scientific and technological resources to hasten its deve lopment its relationship with the united states both in cooperation and competiti on is viewed by many as critical to nurturing and improving its technological capacity chinese national technology policy is complex mix of centralized industrializati on staterun tec hnology parks and economic development zones while there is coordinated national policy from beijing pockets of local entrepreneurial high technol ogy have sprouted all over the country there also continues to be reluctance to openly exchange many forms of scientific research and technology innovation with foreign entitie s yet china appears eager to embrace the best and the brightest that foreign research and developm ent sources have to offer this ambivalence was not surprising it is country that at once appears to be coming into 21st century as an advanced

biotechnology agricultural and energy in all of these areas the chin consistently expressed strong desire to improve scientific cooperation and technology tran sfer between the two nations trade issues usprc trade issues were consistently discussed during the two weeks the delegation was in china however during the time in beijing when most of the discussions were with chinese political and policy leaders trade issues dominated the four major usprc trade issues were the worsening us trade deficit with china in 1987 the united states had 28 billion merchandise trade defi cit with china by 1996 the merchandise trade deficit surged to 395 billion and in 1997 it was 497 billion5 from 1991 to 1996 us exports to china increased by 905 while us imports from china increased by 17146 the composition of goods and services traded between the two countries and why this composition is important to us policymakers according to the us department of commerce in 1997 small and mediumsized electrical machinery toys and sports equipment and footwear accounted for almost all of the imports from china to the united states in terms of us exports to china largescale machin ery aircraft and spacecraf t technologies electrical machinery and fertilizers constituted the majority of merchandise exported in 1997 talks between chinese official s and the us delegation revolved around whether this trade composition is reflection of real market demand or whether tariff and nontariff barrier s are causing distortions in trade composition chinas most favored nation mfn trading status with the united states is not permanent but conditional us po licy has been that certain issues need to be addressed by the chinese be fore mfn status becomes permanent chinese officials contended that this is serious issue for the chinese people some in the us delegati on contended that trade security and human rights issues must be addressed in china before mfn can be approved httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98617crs4 7while these were issues raised by the us gr oup during this trip it should be noted that the us trade representative does not link specif ic trade issues with nontrade issues in discussions with chinese officials chinas acceptance as member of the world trade organization wto the chinese consider wto membership as an important step which would indicate recognition of chinas importa nce in the global economy some us policymakers have economic and noneconomic concer ns regarding chinas wto membership among the issues discussed were those linking wto membership to ensuring us access to chinese markets greater democratization in china improvement in prc human rights issues greater access to information through the internet and telecommunications technologies and improving us export control policies to china7 major points of contention between severa l members of the us delegation and chinese officials during meetings in beijing were the size of the trade deficit which is large the direction the deficit is taking growing larger each year and the composition of the trade small manuf actured goods from china advanced technologies and value added services from the united states several members of the us group expressed the opinion that it was likely that any improvement in the usprc relationship would have to start with change in the trading relationship between the two nations chinese position in response to us concerns about the size structure and composition of the trade deficit chinese policymakers emphasized their view that the current merchandise trade deficit w ith the united states and particularly significant reduction in us exports to china is temporary aberration and will be brought to equilibrium by free market forces while the trade imbalance with the united states may create tensions the chinese policymakers contend that it is the result of market forces at work and not central government planning the us government has not accurately taken into account hong kong trade as part of the prc trade equation with the united states nor accurately accounted for us firms manufacturing g oods in china for sale in the united states the united states harms itself by maintaining complicated and unwise export control policies pa rticularly for dualuse tec hnologies and atomic energy these technology exports to china c ould greatly improve relations between the two countries as well as helpin g redress the trade imbalance issue us delegation position on each of these points several members of the us group sought to clarify the us position as well as address chinese concerns the us groups views while not always nimous are summarized in the following points httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98617crs5 8congressional research service mostfavorednation stat us and china history and alternative approaches to current law by wayne m morrison crs report 96992 10 december 1996 p 13 9ibid p 3 president clinton announced in 1993 that the us would provide conditions on renewing chinas mfn status howev er in 1994 the president announced s upport for its mfn status without conditions lin ked to human rights issues the trade deficit trend line between the united states and china can be traced over several years and is neither one year aberration nor short term development while honest disagreements can exis t regarding trade policies between nations much more can be done to eliminate chinese tariff and nontariff barriers on us imports while there may be some accounting discrepancies between the two nations us officials do not view this as major contributing factor to the trade deficit between the united states and china us export control policies are of cern to many us policymakers yet reflect balance between nationa l security and economic opportun ities for us firms linking trade to other issues two very contentious policy issuesmfn status and membership in the wto led to broader policy question often discussed between the us delegation and their chinese hosts as well as debated within the us delegation should the united states link trade and nontrade political issuessuch as human rightswhen dealing with china mfn status mfn treatment is conferred when one country extends to another any trade concessions privileges and imm unities which that country has granted or will grant to any trading partner in other words trade between the two nations is conducted with tariffs that are set at the rate lowest among common trading partners rather than at higher full rates the united states has extended mfn status to all but few nations but never extende d permanent mfn status to china it had suspended mfn status with china between 1951 nd 1980 but then revoked the suspension when diplomatic relations between the two nations were restored from 1980 through 1989 annual renewal of chinas mfn status was generally uncontroversial with some congre ssional disapproval8 the incident in tiananmen square in june 1989 caused strong congressional reaction in 1990 congress undertook series of legislative initiatives tying chinas mfn status with progress in the prcs human rights conditions several bills passed the 102nd and 103rd congress making renewa l of chinas mfn status conditional on progress in human rights yet president bush was opposed to linking mfn to human rights issues and vetoed th legislation gislation withdrawing or imposing further conditions on china s mfn status has passed congress during the clinton administration9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98617crs6

august 1997several chinese policymakers expressed frustration that the united states has considered linking mfn status to china s domestic issues they contended that china has made great progress since 1989 in providing democratic initiatives to the chinese populace they also contended th at the conditional mf n policy stick is longer effective in trying to make china comply with us ideals not renewing chinas mfn status would seriously impair the current trade relations with the united states as well as cause significant trade disruptions10 there was range of opinion on this issue within the us group some members flatly rejected policy linking human rights and other democratic ideals to trade relations with china they contended that to link human rights issues to trade policy unfairly imposes an american viewpoint on the current chinese political system america must view china through prism that reflects chinas culture history and political developmentnot u s ideals and aspirations for the prc others in the us delegation represen ted the view that mfn for china should be opposed based on the continuing structur trade deficit with the united states from this point of view the deficit is not shortterm phenomenon but longerterm problem before permanent mfn status is bestowed on china the structural imbalance of the trade deficit must be addressed this viewpoint articulated the concern that once chinas mfn status becomes permanent there will be incentive for china to redress the longterm trade deficit with the united states yet others in the dele gation supported mfn status but believe it should be linked to progress on human rights issues this viewpoint contended that it is perfectly within the political and philos ophical framework of the united states to insist that basic conditions of freedom and democracy are in place before permanent business and trading relationship is ratified by congress in particular there was concern that chinese dissidents continue to be imp risoned without fair trials and that free speech and other form s of expression are routinely suppressed advocates of this position in the us group called for the united states and china to exchange information on political prisoners and hold leadership summits in beijing and washington to discuss both nations humanitarian concerns membership in the wto chinese membership in the wto also was discussed at great length by americans and chin on this trip in 1995 the wto succeeded the general agreement on tariffs and tr ade gatt as the major forum for discussion of global trade issues since the inception of the wto china has sought membership in part to have forum to voice its trade policy and in part as sign of its growing importance and stature in th global community however many

privatization of enterprises inadequate protection of intell ectual property rights ipr and evidence of continued nontari ff barriers as some of the issues still unreconciled for chinese membership in the wto11 in response several chinese officials c ontended that it is critical for the global community to include major nation like china in the multilateral trading system china is the eleventh largest trading nation in the world and by some measures the third largest economy in the world12 chinese officials contended that wto membership will further open its economy to technology imports creating greater market for high technology firms seeking to do business abroad chinese officials also stated that other nations without ope n economies or complete ly free market trade policies such as india malaysia and thailand are members of the wto they asked is there double standard for china13 mfn status with the united states and chinas wto membership are important issues for both china and the united st ates the chinese position consistently emphasized the importance of resolving both issues in satisfactory manner members of the us delega tion stressed that the us government understands the importance of both issues to the prc an d that stable trading position with the united states and other global part ners is desired outcome technology and security during discussions on tr ade issues concerns were raised about technology transfer between the two nations chinese officials uniformly stated that one way to significantly alter the trade imbalance between the two nations was to change us expor t control policy and allow more high technology components to be sold to china in particular chinese officials stressed the importance of us high technologies and advanced research and development to the chinese economy several chinese g overnment and busine ss leaders called for greater us exports of telecommunications and computer technolog ies aircraft and

members of the u s delegation and chinese policymakers during this trip explored whether there may be increased opportunities for technology transfer between the two nations co mmon ground was found in those areas where us technological expertise can directly contribute to improving the quality of life for the chinese people eg telephone and telecommunications infrastructure it was also recognized that there continues to be tension between chinas desire for us commercial technology tr ansfers and us concerns regarding chinese use of dualuse technology for military applicati ons as well as proliferation of such technologies to other countries these nsions appear to have increased since august 1997 technology transfer and economic growth the importance of technology transfer to the prc was raised often by chinese officials technology was cited as the catalyst by which china would fully develop as nation some american observers of china believe longterm relationship is more important to the chinese than the relationship with the united states because of the need for us technologies leading to chinas advancement these observers view china as poised to make an historic political ec onomic and social transf ormation shedding many antiquated aspects of an older system as new society emerges15 chinese officials emphasized the importan ce of technology transfer as part of chinas selfimage among othe r developed nations in this respect us policies that deny technologies to china we re described as an affront to the chinese people some officials often expressed frustration with us views which they believe demonize or chastise chinese attempts to obtain advanced commercial technologies chinese officials contended that an developing country would seek out the most advanced and appropriate technology fo r economic growth several officials were of the opinion that there is double standard in us policy towards technology transfer to developing countries in which other developing nations receive appropriate technology denied to the chinese some officials appeared perplexed and angered by us technology transfer policies16 export controls chinese officials consistently raised two concerns with us technology transfer policy the first was over us export control laws and regulations the chinese position seemed to reflect confusion nd irritation over the direction and intent of us export control policies they expressed concern that certain technologies such as basic memo ry semiconductor chips can be exported to china while more advanced semiconductor chip technolog ies can be blocked under us military control lists similarly wh ile us policies restrict certain types of supercomputer technologies for sale to china chinese offi cials stated that they can obtain identical technologies from other count ries eg france or japan or the chinese can buy off the sh elf workstations and ot her commercial technologieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98617crs9

ess leaders also have questioned us export controls believing they are antiqua ted and at crosspurposes basic export control policies were established during the cold war when us national security interests were clearer and welldefine d some now argue that current export restrictions toward china may be attempts by some to create national security threat for the united states where none may now exist18 however numerous members of congress and several private an alysts have recently suggested that the post cold war deregulation of exports and particularly the liberalization of export controls by the clinton administration may be contributing to the strategic capabilities of potential adversaries in particular congress is currently examining the implications of us exports to chin of dualuse commodities licensed by the department of commerce nother issue is the transfer of several items from the us munitions list where they were licen sed for export by the department of state to commerce departments commodity list the effect of these transfers on export control decisions and the national secu rity nonproliferation and foreign policy implications critics in the united states and china also point to conflicting licensing policies and jurisdictions among the department s of commerce state and defense according to the general accounting ffice gao the department of commerce can justify the license of commercial tec hnology for export using economic and trade interests and it controls items to achieve specific national security and foreign policy objectives the department of state has broader authority to deny export and must take national security interests into account before providing export licenses the department of defense dvises both departme nts of commerce and state on their license cases and emphasizes military applications of t echnology transfer the gao contends that differing statutory authority among these three agencies has caused jurisdictional and procedur uncertainty for us export control policies19 however the gao upon examining specifi c technology transfer policies and actions between the united states and china also has determined that the chinese

1997diverting technology from the united states has raised additional questions about the purpose and objective of chinas technol ogy transfer from the united states20 most members of the us delegation acknowledged that more can be done to streamline us export licensing procedur clarifying jurisdictional problems between us agencies and making procedur decisions more transparent however most believed that serious technology tr ansfer problems between the united states and china still exist some members expr essed doubt that the united states would change its export control policies towards china unless the prc first made very transparent its policies of obt aining and using certain fore ign technologies this was underscored by the position that until these issues are discusse d more openly and frankly between both countries changes in us export control policies which might benefit the prc are unlikely proliferation several chinese officials protested that the united states has unfairly and incorrectly portrayed china as an agent of proliferation of military weapons and nuclear technologies to rogu nations during every discussion with chinese officials this portr ayal was denied chinese fficials consistently spoke of us government report which purportedly cleared china of this portrayal21 as well as the absence of proof from the international community at large that china was supplying iraq iran pakistan or any ot her country with military weapons or nuclear technology22 this claim was countered by official us representatives in beijing they stated that there has been evidence of chinas proliferation activities for several years however us officials indicated that china appeared to be curtailing some of its proliferation activities to other nations according to the us view in beijing in 1997 chinese officials recognized that pr oliferation was serious impediment to uschinese relations us officials also commented that when the united states raises proliferation concerns with chines officials china raises concerns about weapon sales to taiwan23httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98617crs11 24for background see congressional research service chinas

nascent national space program and how china and the united states could cooperate in this field24 members of the us group asked chinese officials about chinas national policies for containment of launch vehicle and related satellite technologies and the use of these technol ogies within national boundaries the us delegation was assured that chinas long march satellite launch program was purely commercial in nature and that there was intent to pass along vital launch and satellite technologies to other nations that could be used for launching missiles the delegation found this chinese position to be highly suspect25 national interests according to one source onethird to onehalf of all economic growth comes from technology progre ss and that it is the principal driving force for longterm economic growth and increased standards of living for modern industrial societies26 therefore it is understandabl why chinas national policy for obtaining and utilizing the best foreign tec hnologies is vital to its goals of economic growth however chinas national intere st in obtaining technologies may not be consistent with those nations that are the source of technology those nations often restrict or control technologies that they view as inimical to their national economic security the importance of technology transfer to national economic security policies was the focus of an animated discu ssion during luncheon at the boeing corporations beijing offices officials from boeing described what it is like to do business in china and cited two key elem ents for undertaking business in the prc the first is that it is never just business in china but that personal and political relations are key for any foreign firm tr ying to do business boeing officials acknowledged that meeting certain host c ountry concessions such as technology transfer required balancing of busine ss interests and objectives if certain technology transfer concessi ons would have to be made to capture chinese market share boeing likely would consider this as good longterm tradeoff27 the second key was to balance boeings corporate global perspective with us national economic and security interests for boeing officials us export control policies can hinder the company as it co mpetes against companies from countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98617crs12 28ibid 29discussions with zhang

high technology center is also part of larger high technology development plan to establish high technology zone in the shaanxi province according to the managers of this high technology cen ter china

opportunities and problems of agricultu ral trade between the two countries32 according to the foreign agricultural service fas of the us department of agriculture chinas large and growing population is driving greater need for wheat coarse grain corn and other ag ricultural goods domestic production of agricultural products while expanding rapidl cannot meet the needs of population now at 12 billion for example for corn production is being used to meet increased domestic consumption and is not exported33 china is an important market for us agricultural exports in 1996 the united states exported 2092 billion in agricultural goods to china in the same year the united states imported 597 million in agricultural goods from china through 1997 the united states had surplus in agricu ltural trade with china for nine of ten years the most important agricultural ex ports to china are wheat and cotton which in 1996 together accounted for 56 of us agricultural exports to china however these export levels for specific commodities can vary greatly from year to year for example the united states exported 11 b illion in wheat to china in 1989 in 1990 exports of us wheat to china was

that china and the united states can find common ground in their bilateral agricultural policy some members of the u s delegation especially those from rural states stressed the importance of increasing us agricultural exports to china as way of improving relations between the two nations china continues to indicate that it is receptive to increasing its agricultural trade with the united states but has linked that action with obtaining mfn status with the united states and eventual membership into the wto37 political and cultural history the visit to xian included several vis its to museums ancient burial grounds temples and other historical sites it provided members of the delegation an opportunity to better understand the political and cultural history of china and to better comprehend the enormous size scope and diversity of the nation one of the most important cultural and hi storical lessons learned during this part of the trip was that chinas long history has been marked by periods of unity and disunity in which imperialism and auto cracy brought together disparate groups interspersed by periods of separatism and provincial discord for some chinese policymakers and foreign sinologists this history provides cautionary note that political cultural and ethnic ties which appear to unite china today may be more tenuous than viewed from the

among the first of the philosophies developed was confucianism philosophy adapted by scholars who sought to create social and political ideal unifying the chinese people this system prescribed series of orderl relationships within society let the ruler be ruler and the subject subject based on ethical relationships and moral good41 chinese legalism also known as the sc hool of law was diametrically opposed to confucian thought and vied for followe rs during this period it was philosophy based on authoritarian cont rol of government not ethical or moral persuasion legalists exalted the state and sought pr osperity and marita l prowess above the welfare of the common people during the han dynasty the tene ts of confucianism and legalism were combined to create working imperial form of government the tension inherent in these two philosophies of the rule of man versus the rule of law approach to government is still evident in modern china42 shanghai august 18th 21st shanghai

kilometers and employ over 10000 scientists engineers and researchers45 the main purpose of the park is to encourage foreign investment and joint ventures in research and development rd preferential tax policy for foreign firms locating in this park was outlined by officials at the park this includes ta x moratoria and holidays for longterm rd investment by foreign firms46 while the official emphasis at shanghai zj hitech park is to encourage domestic and foreign private sector investment it was clear that american and chinese interpretations of how to implement this policy differed chinese officials at the park were asked by members of th us delegation what could be done to further encourage us high technology fi rms to consider shanghai zj hitech park for rd joint ventures the ch inese officials responded that the us government should lead companies to shan ghai and it should be us public policy to interest us firms in relocating to the park even when members of the delegation explained that this is not an appropriate ro for government in the american context the chinese position remained unchanged47 the issue of attracting foreign investme nt for technology development also was central to discussions with representativ of the us insurance firm american international groupamerican interna tional assurance co ltd aigaia representatives from this company stated how difficult it is to sell insurance and other forms of financial instruments in shanghai and the rest of china they contended that many chinese still have strong suspicion of foreign

being secondary market transactions among buyers and llers when asked about this chinese officials contended that while there will always be some speculative money most of the investment was sound as

government rem oves all support for these firms most will not be able to compete the potential fo r large scale unemployment if workers from chinese soes cannot find work elsewhere is major concern for china as of august 1997 there already was some indica tion of worker displacement and massive shifts of population as china tries to ddress issues of pr ivatization and free enterprise53 telecommunications and the internet shanghai also was representative of the great growth in telecommunications infrastructure applications and services in china there was evidence in central shanghai and pudong of long lines of fiber optic cable ne w satellite dishes on buildings and construction of terrestrial communications relay towers the shanghai stock exchange had just recently been completely rewired for global trading in the rest of china there has b een an explosion of telecommunications technologies and applications this has been most evident in the growth of the internet in china in 1993 only about 20000 chinese had access to the internet by the time of the delegations trip that figure was about 250000 in 1998 it is over 600000 chinese officials forecast that the number of internet users in china will be two million by 2000 and seven million by 200154 one of the impacts of this growth in internet use is its effect on the global economy from discussions with us

focused mainly on the impact of the turnover of hong kong from british to chinese rule other points of discussion included political freedom and territorial sovereignty hong kong after july 1 1997 at midnight june 30 1997 hong kong reve rted to chinese sovereignty after 150 years of british rule the transfer of power was the result of 1984 sinobritish joint declaration which established one

the hong kong which they have known survive as part of china while ec onomic conditions are somewhat guaranteed can the same be said for political freedom and protection of individual rights62 interestingly for many longtime residents of hong kong democratic ideals of political freedom and protection of individual rights have come somewhat late in hong kongs history many natives of hong kong were dise nfranchised during most of the british rule and chinese resentment over foreign rule was strong even at the time of the turnover still some would argue that real power in hong kong resides in the marketplace and not in legislative bodies63 as of august 1997 most hong kong observers with whom we met said that they expected smooth transition as th provisional legislative council

while described as part of the hong kong turnover were also part of almost every discussion during the tw weeks the delegation was in china several hong kong legal experts contended that am ong the many implications of this change in electoral representation hong kongs rule of law will influence or supplant the rule of man tradition in china they stated that despite british occupancyor perhaps because of ithong kong has enjoyed very clear and concrete legal system therefore china with its history of autocratic rule in beijing and interests of provincial party officials has had history of rule of man in which the mandate of an individual or the party may supersede legalisms65 the answer of which system will emerge as hong kong is assimilated into china is still unknown us officials gene rally viewed the developments postjuly 1 1997 with optimism tinged with realism some hong kong fficials contended that difficult issues such as protection of foreign intellectual property rights patents copyrights and trademarks abused in bot h hong kong and china may be resolved under unified rule of law yet some in hong kong stated that conversely freedom of the press and free speech may be curtailed if beijing rule of man is extended to hong kong chinese and amer ican observers commented that even third scenario which involves compromis of both the rule of law and rule of man may create peaceful if uneasy coexistence between hong kong and the rest of china66 territorial sovereignty67 many residents and observers in hong kong which the delegation met with expressed great confidence although mixed w ith some concern that hong kong will essentially retain its unique character in several meetings the issue was not whether china will influence and therefore change hong kong but how much hong kongs unique mix of economic trade political and democratic characteristics may change china the future of hong kong also involve s larger issues of chinese territorial sovereignty in the asia pacific region h ong kong has served as gateway for much of china and therefore can be seen as an aperture through which technology trade and security issues flow as part of an experiment in one c ountry two systems the chinese appear anxious to demonstrat that it can successfully and peacefully complete hong kongs transition still it was also very clear that many chinese now view hong kong as domestic issue and longer subject to outside interference for many chinese officials if hong kong can be successfully adopted into chinas national political and economic system then the next goal would be to lookhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98617crs22 68another territorial issue was tibet which came up infrequently during discussions most chinese officials we met consider tibet to be purely internal

uschinese relations since august 1997 appear to follow the old chinese proverb both blessing and curse may you live in interesting times variety of technology trade and security as well as other economic and political issues remain at the forefront of the usprc relationship the following developments are among the highlights of this changing relationship in september 1997 the chinese peoples c ongress met to elect party officials and to set national policies for the next year president jiang zemin was expected by some to emerge from the congress much weaker in power and with his economic reform policies greatly diluted however according to some observers jiang was able to handle internal party factions nd avoided open confront ation from both hard line conservatives and liberal reformers69 during the fall of 1997 the asian contag ion of falling curre ncy valuations in indonesia and thailand spread to korea nd affected other nations like japan and china as well in china the economic downturn came at time when official chinese policy encouraged the privatization or dismantling of many soes considered to be inefficient or inoperative the impact on unemployment was fairly severe causing disruptions in the workforce as currencies in several nations were devalued many us multinational corporations reported that their earnings some based in large part on overseas sale s would be adversely affected70 in october president jiang zemin visited the united states to meet with president clinton president jiang signed an order for the chinese government to buy fifty boeing
