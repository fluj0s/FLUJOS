consideration of the candidacies for member ship of albania croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom or the republic of macedonia these states are small with correspondingly sm all militaries and their inclusion in the alliance cannot be considered strategic in military sense however it is possible that they could play role in the stabilization of southeastern europe the allies issued invitations only to albania and croatia at bucharest nato decided not to offer membership action plan map to georgia and ukraine the map is viewed as way station to membership russias strong objection to the two count ries eventual membership as well as internal separatist conflicts in georgia and public opposition to allied membership in ukraine were among factors leading to the two governments failure to enter the map energy security for candidate states in future round of enlargement may also prove to be an important issue the bush administration supported the map for georgia and ukraine but number of allie s opposed the idea both the senate and house passed resolutions in the second session of the 110th congress urging nato to enter into map with georgia and ukraine sres 439 and hres 997 respectively an enduring dispute with greece over macedonias formal name delayed macedonias entry the allies expressed cl ear support for macedonias entry once the name dispute is resolved process is important in albanias and croatias efforts to join the alliance each of the current 26 allies agreed at bucharest to extend invitations by the end of july 2008 nato will send protocol on each successful candidate to all allied governments which will follow their respective constitutional processes to admit candidate again unanimity is required for state ultimately to join

introduction1 nato held summit in bucharest ro mania on april 24 2008 principal issue was consideration of the candidacies for membership of albania croatia and the former yugoslav repub lic of macedonia fyrom2 their candidacies initiated the third round of enlargement in the postcold war era in 1997 nato invited poland the czech republic and hungary to join the alliance they were admitted in 1999 in 2002 the allies invited bulgaria romania lithuania latvia estonia slovenia and slovakia to join the allian ce they were admitted in 2004 these last two rounds of enlargement were strateg ic in the sense that the new members territory lay in regions that russia once deemed critical to its own national interest and in the sense that the region had been intensely involved in conflict for much of modern european history in addition veral of these countries are sizeable with considerable armed forces and significant resources at bucharest the allies issued invitations to albania and croatia to join the alliance greece blocked an invitati on to macedonia due to dispute over macedonias name today natos purpose extends well bey ond the mission of collective defense of the cold war era while collective fense remains core function the allies now undertake missions against terrorism nd proliferation of weapons of mass destruction global military reach is necessary for such missions the bush administration has pressed the allies to develop more deployable forces able to go long distances and sustain themselves such resources are beyond the means of small member states which are expected instead to develop niche capabilities such as special forces or troops able to contain chemical weapons attack nato has also developed collective security mission such as its stabilization and peacekeeping mission in kosovo albania and croatia are sm all countries with corre spondingly small militaries croatia was part of the former yugoslavia communist state but one that

sense of their military importance and their general resources would not represent strategi c presence in the alliance although their consistent contributions to nato operations have been lauded however due to the continuing instability in the region further stirred by serbias and russias sharply negative reaction to kosovos independence the two countries are potential factor for stabilization in southeastern europe this report will review the process by which candidate states are selected including sketch of the responsibilities of congress and allied g overnments in final approval or disapproval of albania and cr oatia the report will review general political factors for qualification as well as external issues such as the views of russia and regional geopolitical considerations there will then follow an analysis of current conditions in the two states nominated to join as well as in macedonia in addition there will be brief analysis of the debate over the

allies were divided over the map for georgia and ukraine and they were not extended th map at bucharest an appendix will examine key legislation on enlargement during the past fifteen years process the washington treaty of 1949 natos founding instrument does not describe detailed qualifications for membersh ip it does require that member states be democracies and follow the rule of law it also requires that they take steps to strengthen their militaries and refrain from the use of force in settling disputes outside the treaty framework article x of the treaty leaves the door open to any states able to meet the general qualifications for membership including contribution to the security of member states the process by which governments interested in membership may join has been refined since the end of the cold war in 1994 nato established the partnership for peace pfp program in which non member states might train with nato forces participate in peacekeeping or other allied activities and seek avenues to draw closer to the alliance some pfp members such as austria are not necessarily interested in membership in 1995 nato published study on nato enlargement 3 the report remains the most detailed public roadmap for governments wishing to enter nato it describes the need for candidate states to develop democratic st ructures and market economy respect human rights and the ri ghts of ethnic minorities and build military capable of contributing to co llective defense the 1995 study nato included other requirements principally the need to settle all disputes such as

statebuilding as well as for collective defense after the admission of poland the cz ech republic and hungary in 1999 the allies led by the united states developed more detailed process for prospective members this process called the membership action plan map lays out in considerable detail specific steps that government must follow to become member such steps might include laws designating its parliament as having civilian oversight of the military or the downsizing and professionalization of large military or the settlement of border dispute with neighbor each countrys map is classified as is its evaluation by the allies during the 20032004 round of enlargement the map was made available to the united states senate for review some allies have criticized the map proce ss they contend that it is primarily creation of the united states and that the ultimate decision on whether map requirements are met is made principally in washington they say for example that the full range of qualifications outlined in the map in the 2003 round of enlargement was not adequately ssessed for several states that became members of the alliance they contend therefore that designation of candidate states as prospective members is above all political process and th at actual accomplishment of requirements is secondary to the will of the alliances leader us officials dispute this characterization4 for candidate state to have been invited to join the alliance at bucharest consensus among the 26 member gove rnments was necessary to approve an invitation each candidate wa s considered separately on or more votes against state means would block that states progress to the next stage in the process of becoming member it was greeces oppositi on to macedonia that brought

will go through their constitutional processes to amend the washington treaty and admit new state or states in some member states such as the united kingdom the government has the authority to determine whether the executive alone may decide to admit state nominated for entry or instead if issues of broad significance are involved may send the protocol to parliament for approval at the other end of the spectrum the netherlands has meticulous timeconsuming process i nvolving parliamentary study and debate before final vote is taken nato hopes to admit prospective candidate states at its next summit to be held on the frenchgerman border scheduled for late 20098 the united states senate has the constitutional authority to give its advice and consent by twothirds majority to the amendment of any treaty in the case of nato enlargement it must decide whether to amend the washington treaty to commit the united states to defend additional geographic territory the senate foreign relations committee is the committee holding the initial authority to consider the issue9 both the senate foreign relations committee and the full senate may decide whether to vote on each candidate state separately or all together during the previous two rounds of enla rgement house and senate committees held hearings on enlargement one purpose of the hearings is to create more widespread knowledge of possibly pending new obligations of the united states government in the past committees have also discussed such issues as the costs of enlargement the qualifications of the candidate states regional security implications of enlargement implications for relations with russia and new issues in natos future such as the viability of new missions policy of the bush administration the

defense budget proce ss civilian control of the military and free market structures the bu sh administration also supports the entry of nato governments into the european union as means to build stability some nato governments have contended that the bush administration is less interested in the alliance than its post world war ii predecessors this view more apparent in the first five years of the bu sh administration has brought challenges to us leadership of the alliance in the last several years however the administration has dropped former defense secretary donald rumsfelds use of what many consider the divisive terms coalitions of the willing and the old and new europe and sought instead to engage all allied gove rnments in decisionmaking about natos general missions and its specific operations some allied governments say that meetings of the north atlantic counc il nac natos political governing body have become more collegial and pr oductive in recent years as result10 the administration supported invitations to albania croatia and macedonia at bucharest while us officials acknowle dged that all three states must continue to improve their militaries and their political institutions they also believe that each state has made considerable progress over the last several years these officials also contended that the three governments would contribute to the political stabilization of southeastern europe11 the bush administration supports the id ea of nato with global partners this idea does not necessarily imply memb ership for countries beyond the euro atlantic region instead the administration has sought for example to engage such countries as australia new zealand and japa n in the effort to stabilize afghanistan but does not actively promote their membership in the alliance the administration does have however view of natos longterm membership roster that is broader than that of some allies at bucharest these allies questioned whether georgia and ukraine shoul d be invited to join the map process in the days leading to the summit president bush made highly visible tour of georgia and ukraine where he touted thei r qualifications

even though thes governments are not democratic these governments provide logisti cal support to allied operations in afghanistan the united states and its allies wish to encourage greater respect for

membership beyond the qualifications achieved by candidate state in the map process such matters as the stabilization of southeastern europe ru ssias voice in european security and bilateral relations between member state and candidate state also come into play stability in southeastern europe is an issue of great importance both to nato and the european union and current member governments believe that enlargement can serve this goal natos decision to go to war against serbia in 1999 to stop ethnic cleansing in kosovo and the allia nces subsequent creation of kfor to contribute to kosovos stability are evidence of this point further evidence is the eus decision to lead kosovo s supervised independence13 both serbia and russia reacted strongly against kosovos independence declared on february 17 2008 the united states and most eu governments recognized kosovos independence the following week on februa ry 21 the us embassy in belgrade was attacked as was the croatia n embassy and part of the slovenian embassy was sacked and burned serbian police re portedly stood by while mobs carried out these attacks most serbian government leaders have vowed never to accept kosovos

nationalism of the three candidate st ates albania and croatia have recognized kosovos new status but macedonia is exp ected to do so as well in the near future croatia has sought to serve as channel for the unite d states and europe with serbia and has resettled half of th 300000 serb refugees who fled croatia during the balkan conflicts of the 1990s according to range of european governments there is minimal discrimination in croatia against the serbian minority the ability of the three candidate states to put to rest enmity towards serbia resulting from the conflicts of the 1990s is an argument in favor of th eir serving as factor for stabilization in southeastern europe in the view of some member states their entry into nato could also serve as positive example for future nato

inclusion of the three candidate states in the alliance but its claim that their membership would be detrimental to russian interests is less plausible than its complaints during the previous two

membership defense reforms and ability to contribute to allied missions and albanias role in its region however natos decision on albanias candidacy was in the end political judgment of nato member states on whether albanias membership will contribute to their security domestic reforms most observers believe that the main challenges to albanias candidacy are questions about th pace of its political reforms albanias current government is led by the centerri ght democratic party of albania dpa which formed coalition with several smaller parties afte r the countrys 2005 parliamentary

2008 letter to the nato secretary ge neral may remove at least the first objection for the united states however both before and after nato foreign ministers meeting on march 6 2008 us secretary of stat condoleezza rice refrained from publicly expressing support for map for ukraine at the bucharest summit saying only that nato is performancebased organization and that the decision on map for ukraine will be not be taken until the summit during visit to kiev on april 1 to meet with president yushchenko president bush strongly supported granting map to ukraine at the bucharest summit key european nato allies were reluctant to consider map for ukraine at bucharest in part because they feel that ukraines qualifications for map are weak and in part because they are concerned bout damaging relations with russia on march 6 german foreign minister frankwa lter steinmeier said i cannot hide my skepticism about ukraines chances for map at the nato foreign ministers meeting french foreign minister bern ard kouchner and other european leaders stressed the need for maintainin g good relations with moscow65 possible russian response russian leaders have been hostile to ukraines possible nato membership russia has viewed the former soviet republic as lying within its sphere of influence in which western countries and institutions should play little role nato as military alliance is viewed with particular suspicion on february 14 2008 in response to question about possible ukrainian membership in nato president putin warned that russia might be forced to take military countermeasures including aiming missiles against ukraine if kiev hosted foreign bases or joined th us missile defense project66 in addition to changes in its military postu re russia could react in several other ways to the prospect of nato membership for ukraine judging by moscows past conduct in the region it could try to stir up regional conflicts between eastern and western ukraine russia could encourage prorussian groups to intensify antinato campaigns and stir up conflict by pushing for use of ru ssian as an official language in eastern and southern ukraine russia could even encourage those favoring more autonomy for these regions or even their separation from ukra ine particularly in the case of the crimean peninsula it should be noted however that such tactics have not always worked as moscow expecte d indeed they have sometimes produced backlash among the large majority of ukra inians who favor the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34415crs26 67 jamestown foundation eurasia daily mon itor april 14 2008 radio free europeradio liberty daily report april 9 2008 and agen ce france presse wire dispatch april 11 2008 russia could also exploit close economic ties between the two countries as it did in january 2006 russia could cut off natu ral gas supplies to ukraine or sharply increase the price it charges russia could also cut off or hinder other trade with ukraine or make life difficult for the many ukranian labor migrants in russia russia has used similar tactics in disputes with moldova and georgia both of which have sought closer ties with the eu or nato or both in any case russian ability and desire to punish ukraine politically and economically could exceed the ability and willingness of many nato states to respond another possibility is that after complaining loudly russia would grudgingly accept nato membership for ukraine as it did in the case of the baltic states poland and other countries in central eur ope many observers believe that this outcome may be less likely due to the particular sensitivity of ukraine to russians many of whom believe the c ountry should be closely tied to russia as much of it has been from the 17th century until 1991 in addition many observers note that russias foreign policy has been more assertive in recent years as high revenues from energy exports have improved its in ternal and external finances moreover the russian government regime has used antinato and antius rhetoric to shore up its domestic support outcome the allies declined to offer ukraine map at the bucharest summit however they expressed support for ukraines map pplication and said that kiev could receive map at the nato foreign ministers meeting in december 2008 if remaining ques tions over its application are resolved in move that surprised many observers the summit communique also contained an unqualified statement that ukraine and ge orgia will become members of nato without specifying when that might happen the ambiguous result of the summit cause d varying reactions within ukraine president yushchenko and the ukrainian government hailed the summit as key steppingstone on kievs path toward nat membership pointing in particular to the commitment made to admit ukraine into the alliance in contrast yanukovych and the opposition applauded the denial of map at the summit viewing it as blow to yushchenkos pronato policy russian leaders appeared dissatisfied with the summit outcome despite the fact that ukraine was not offered map acco rding to russian press accounts president putin reportedly told president bush and nato leaders at the natorussia summit that ukraine was not real state given its regional heterogene ity and that ukraine would cease to exist if it joined nato on april 8 russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia would do all that it c ould do to prevent nato membership for ukraine on april 11 chief of the russi an general staff gene ral yuriy baluyevsky warned that russia would take military and other measures if ukraine joined nato67httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34415crs27 68 prepared by paul gallis specialist in european affairsother countries beyond georgia and ukraine other countri that currently participate in the partnership for peace program could well seek full membership in nato in the future in the western balkan region thes include serbia montenegro and bosnia herzegovina for the time being serbia may not move much closer to the alliance at the bucharest summit however the alliance invited montenegro and bosnia herzegovina to begin an intensified dialogue with nato an interim step relating to membership aspirations both countries also agreed to deve lop concrete relations with the alliance through individual partnership action plans ipap the newly independent country of kosovo may also s eek closer ties with nato perhaps first through pfp conclusion68 the bucharest summit did not make significant strategic decisions concerning enlargement or the map process however most allies seem to believe that albanias and croatias road to membership in the alliance could lead to greater stability in southeastern europe especia lly given the recent independence of kosovo and the enduring hostility to nato of impor tant political factions in serbia an ongoing strategic concern of the alliance is the stabilization of afghanistan enlargement is only tangentially related to this issue albanias and croatias militaries and resources are modest but the united states and several other leading governments in the alliance expect new member states to develop niche capabilities to contribute to nato operations around the world and in afghanistan financial assistance to the government in kabul whether through the eu or other organizations is important not only to st abilize the country but as demonstration of solidarity in the effort to accomplis h the alliances most important mission nato is facing future challenges th at may shape any following rounds of enlargement strategically one of the most important is energy security gazprom russias national energy company is maki ng strong efforts to control parts of europes oil and natural gas distribution ne twork even without such control much of europe and the caucasus depend upon russia for portions of their energy supply gazproms repeated supply disruptions to customer countries underscores stark reality russia can cut off vital lifeline if it so desires countermeasures new pipelines skirting russia and drawing supplies from range of sources and conservation will require years to plan and implement probably at great expense some allies believe that energy security must be enhanced before new members in succeeding rounds may be extended invitations to join particularly if they are vulnerable to russian pressure concurrent efforts to imp rove relations with russia are likely to be centerpiece of eur opean allies policy during this period another important strategic consideration will likely be the ongoing effort to improve natoeu coordination one issue is the different membership of the two organizations governments in one of the two organizations sometimes blockhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34415crs28 coordination with the other organization to promote national agenda the two organizations are now working closely to gether to stabilize kosovo yet nato and the eu have different means to arrive at key decisions the essence of eu policymaking is in the social and economic sphere in that environment internal compromises and horsetrading are common when eu member states bargain for resolution of key issue while nato d ecisionmaking is often complicated the tradeoffs apparent in eu processes ar less common and decisions are often more quickly made nato and the eu have im portant objectives that are the same namely stabilization of country
