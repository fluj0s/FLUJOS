httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040 summary the environmental quality incentives program eqip provides farmers with financial and technical assistance to plan and implement soil and water conservation practices eqip was enacted in 1996 and amended by section 2301 of the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 it is mandatory spending program ie not subject to annual appropriations and funded through the commodity credit corporation ccc1 and is administered by the natural resources conservation service nrcs eqip is the largest conservation financial assistance program funding is currently authorized to grow to 13 billion in fy2010 major issues that congress might address in the next farm bill include 1 adequate funding 2 program accomplishments and 3 carving out eqip funds to address specific topics or needs in specified locations this report will be updated as circumstances warrant background eqip is the principal source of financial assistance costsharing payments and incentive payments for agricultural producers who wish to implement soil and water conservation practices it also provides participants with technical assistance participation is voluntary eqip was created by the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 april 4 1996 as an amendment that was placed in sections 12401240i of the 1985 food security act eqip replaced four conservation programs repealed in the same law these were the great plains conservation program 1 the ccc is administered by board of directors from agencies of the department of agriculture it has staff and all work done on its behalf is performed by staff of agencies within usda for eqip nrcs provides the staff crs2 the agricultural conservation program acp the water quality incentives program and the colorado river basin salinity control program eqip program today eqip was amended by the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 section 2301 of pl 107171 may 13 2002 commonly referred to as the 2002 farm bill the us department of agricultures natural resources conservation service nrcs administers eqip under final rule2 eqips legislative mandate is to optimize environmental benefits nrcs implemented eqip by establishing national priorities to reflect the most pressing natural resource needs and emphasize offsite benefits to the environment the current national priorities are 1 reduction of nonpoint source pollutants in impaired watersheds consistent with total maximum daily loads3 or tmdls 2 conservation of ground and surface water resources 3 reduction of emissions that contribute to air quality impairment violations of national ambient air quality standards 4 reduction of soil erosion and sedimentation from unacceptable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040 levels on agricultural land and 5 promotion of atrisk species habitat conservation nrcs considers these priorities in allocating funds to states and establishing cost share and incentive payment levels it makes the allocation to states using 31 factors about the characteristics of agriculture and land use and resource considerations factors are assigned weights ones with the largest weights currently include acres of cropland eroding above the tolerance level 61 and acres of fair or poor rangeland 614 how eqip works producers with eligible land5 can submit an eqip plan that describes the conservation and environmental purposes that will be achieved using one or more usda approved conservation practices usdaapproved conservation practices may involve structures vegetation or land management structural practices include the establishment construction or installation of measures designed for specific sites such as animal waste management facilities livestock water developments and capping abandoned wells vegetative practices involve introduction or modification of plantings such as filter strips or trees land management practices require sitespecific management techniques and methods such as nutrient management irrigation water management or grazing management 2 environmental quality incentives program final rule federal register vol 68 104 may 30 2003 pp 3233732355 3 for more information on tmdls see crs report 97831 clean water act and total maximum daily loads of pollutants by claudia copeland 4 the government accountability office criticized this system in september 2006 report gao 06969 concluding that nrcs could not document why it includes each factor how weights for each factor are assigned and adjusted and how each factor contributes to the programs mandate 5 eligible land includes cropland rangeland pasture private nonindustrial forest land and other lands as determined by usda crs3 producers can receive technical assistance to develop an eqip plan and after approval to implement it decisions about which plans to fund are made at the state level with local input the local conservation district will review the plan and then decide whether or not to select the plan for eqip funding if approved usda will provide costshare payments or incentive payments to help the producer offset the cost of each practice participants are eligible to receive costshare payments for both constructing structures and implementing land management practices in addition they may be eligible to receive incentive payments for implementing certain higherpriority practices such as developing comprehensive nutrient management plans contracts have term of one to ten years and are capped at 450000 total payments person or entity can receive over any sixyear period are also limited to 450000 individuals or entities with an average annual adjusted gross income agi of 25 million for the three years prior to the contract period are ineligible unless they received 75 of their agi from farming ranching or forestry usda will pay up to 75 of the projected cost of each practice however limited resource producers and beginning farmers and ranchers6 can receive up to 90of the cost initial payments are made the year in which the contract is signed but most payments are made after the practices are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040 completed of the total annual spending 60 is allocated to livestock practices eqip funding the 2002 farm bill section 2701 provided mandatory funds from the ccc to the basic eqip program through fy2007 this law authorized eqip at 400 million in fy2002 increasing rapidly in subsequent years as shown in table 1 as mandatory program it receives the authorized amount unless congress reduces funding through appropriations legislation table 1 also shows that congress has reduced actual funding by almost 10 below the authorized total between fy2002 and fy20067 eqip funding levels were amended in section 1203 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 to limit funding to 127 billion in fy2007 while extending the authorization through fy2010 and providing 127 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 and 13 billion in fy2010 table 1 eqip funding and reductions in millions fiscal year 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 total authorized funding level 400 700 1000 1200 1200 4500 actual funding 400 695 975 1017 1017 4104 funding reduction 0 5 25 183 183 396 6 limited resource producer or rancher has direct or indirect gross farm sales of less than 100000 in each of the previous two years adjusted for inflation and total household income at or below the national poverty level or less than 50 of county median household income in the previous two years beginning farmer or rancher has farmed for less than 10 years 7 the percentage reduction was very similar before the 2002 farm bill as the 1996 farm bill authorized funding at total of 10 billion between fy1997 and fy2002 but appropriators limited it to total of 897 million reducing it by slightly more than 10 of the authorized total crs4 main justification for the large funding increase in the 2002 farm bill was to respond to large backlog of producer demand that had been documented during the farm bill debate as shown in table 2 gap remains between the supply of funds and the demand for them although it has become much smaller portion of applications table 2 eqip applications contracts and funds obligated in thousands fiscal total contracts of backlog funds obligated year applications applications applications financial assistance 2000 53961 16249 301 37712 139606435 2001 47461 17648

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040 2006 73823 41190 558 32633 787967550 source usda nrcs new programs under eqip three subprograms enacted in the 2002 farm bill are implemented through eqip8 one of these the competitive conservation innovation grants cig is intended to leverage federal investment stimulate innovative approaches to conservation and accelerate technology transfer in environmental protection and agricultural production cig is authorized from fy2003 through fy2006 at an unspecified annual funding level grants must not exceed 50 of the project cost with nonfederal matching funds provided by the grantee nrcs currently allocates up to 15 million for national component and up to 5 million each for state and chesapeake bay watershed components in addition 22 states conduct state cig component which awarded nearly 3 million in fy2006 cig awarded total of 143 million in fy2004 220 million in fy2005 and 248 million in fy2006 awards for fy2007 may be announced soon second subprogram the ground and surface water conservation gswc program provides costshare and incentive payments to producers where the assistance will result in net savings in ground or surface water resources in the producers agricultural operation funding is authorized as separate amount in addition to eqip at 25 million in fy2002 45 million in fy2003 and 60 million annually from fy2004 through fy2007 congress limited funding to 51 million each year since fy20049 in the third subprogram producers in the klamath river basin in california and oregon receive money from separate and additional 50 million authorization which was to be 8 in addition the administration has undertaken other initiatives including pilot projects that provide marketbased incentives for water quality and target small and limited resource farmers 9 in fy2005 gswc provided approximately 63 million in funding to producers includes 51million congressionally limited funding and 12 million through another farm bill provision that requires minimum total funding to each state in support of regional equity crs5 provided as soon as practicable to install conservation practices and manage irrigation waters10 selected policy issues eqip continues to enjoy widespread support in the farm community and in congress as it remains the major source of financial and technical assistance to help producers implement conservation practices that address specific resource and environmental problems major issues that might be addressed in the next farm bill include 1 funding levels and the continuing backlog of interest that is not being met 2 assessing more precisely what is being accomplished through the eqip program and 3 using eqip to address specific topics or needs in specified locations adequate funding and the applications backlog funding levels will be contentious issue for all farm programs because of both overall budget constraints and the increased number of farm interests seeking additional httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040 assistance through the farm bill in this setting debate over future eqip funding could be particularly contentious between those seeking higher funding to clear the backlog and those who favor other funding priorities as show above in table 2 the gap between the supply of funds and the demand for them expanded rapidly in fy2002 and fy2003 when only 22 and 15 respectively of the applications were funded in fy2004 and fy2005 the number of contracts continued to grow and the backlog decreased to levels not experienced since fy2001 also since the number of applications reached high of more than 200000 in fy2003 it has been declining each year as result nrcs awarded contracts for more than half of the applications in fy2005 and fy2006 the backlog was major justification for higher funding in 2002 and it could be strong argument in the next farm bill debate however from fy2004 to fy2005 very large number of backlog applications were not updated for unknown reasons and are therefore longer considered as result the total backlog declined by almost 103000 even though only 50000 applications were funded detailed information is not available on the characteristics of applications currently in the backlog answers to questions such as whether there are any agricultural regions where much smaller portion of applications are being funded whether some practices are more likely to remain in the backlog than others whether some applications stay in the backlog for much longer time period than others and whether recent backlog declines are due in part to declining interest because of long delays could provide important insights for this debate one reason why higher funding has not resulted in the elimination of the backlog is that the average contract size has grown since the last farm bill in 2002 prior to 2002 the average cost of an eqip contract was 7750 since 2002 it has been 1625011 reasons for this may include raising the funding cap in the 2002 farm bill allowing large 10 this program has been used to apply conservation practices on almost 110000 acres and irrigation water management on more than 62000 acres 11 data compiled by soil and water conservation society and environmental defense for march 2007 report environmental quality incentives program eqip program assessment crs6 scale livestock operations to fund waste management facilities and installing more expensive conservation practices measuring eqip accomplishments nrcs can provide considerable information about eqip contracts including which conservation practices are being installed and their design and maintenance standards however until recently relatively little was known about what is actually being accomplished through eqip contracts to start to fill this void nrcs has compiled information about which resource concerns eqip addresses these data show that between 2002 and 2006 the primary resources concerns addressed through eqip spending included water quality 38 of the total spent in those years soil management 29 and water management 24 the remaining three resource concerns wildlife management air quality and wetland conservation together received slightly less than 10 of the total little is known however about how enduring those conservation practices might be after the contract ends among the questions that nrcs is trying to address for all its conservation activities including eqip are how to evaluate performance how to measure environmental changes how to evaluate costeffectiveness httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040 which methods to use to identify environmental effects and which types of data should be collected to measure output nrcs initiated national review called the conservation effects assessment project ceap to develop better answers to all these questions but only few initial results are currently available regarding eqip specifically nrcs has proposed to periodically review state prepared reports to determine how the program is being delivered at the state and local level nrcs will require states to prepare reports describing eqip implementation and accomplishments tied to performance measures of particular interest may be livestock production practices which receive 60 of total funding each year policy makers may seek more information about the development and adoption of comprehensive nutrient management plans especially by confined animal feeding operations referred to as cafos cafos are large livestock operations the minimum number of animals varies with the type of animal some have expressed concern that the effects of cafos on the environment and public health have not been adequately assessed and may seek to address those concerns in the next farm bill targeting eqip small portion of eqip funding is now targeted as result of provisions enacted in 2002 to the three new subprograms described above one the klamath basin is targeted to specific area and the other two are targeted to specified topics ground and surface water conservation and innovative conservation technologies question that may be addressed in the farm bill debate is whether more subprograms should be created and if so what topics these programs will address and how much money will be committed to them interests may promote many different topics or geographic areas for such programs but if funds for these subprograms are carved out of the general eqip program that may attract opposition especially if eqip funding appears to be constrained in the current budget environment
