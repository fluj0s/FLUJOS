security introduction noaa operates under statutory authority to warn the public about severe weather hazardous atmospheri c conditions and unsafe seas1 the duties noaa undertakes as part of its routine mission include 1 protecting the public from disasters 2 maintaining healthy marine environment for humans and other living creatures and 3 supporting robust us economy by providing weather services although these duties may not appear to rela to combating terrorism many experts say that they are vital for effective homeland security nonetheless if the united states were confronted with conta mination of the atmosphere or marine environments noaa would be among thos federal agencies participating in emergency response and recovery noaas weather operations and air quality research

relief f und to reimburse the agency for infrequent services noaa lack s authority to receive repayments for services except in cases specified in w government officials concerned with reducing federal spending have argued that noaa provision of emergency assistance has been successful through reprogramming of annual appropriati ons in the past however those who argue for dedicat ed source of funding attribute former successes in large part to generous presidential budgets and appropriations during historical periods of sustained economic growth and budget surplus and also to emergency supplemen tal appropriations in the aftermath of september 11 2001 noaa provided activities and services for purposes not previously authorized by congress these included 1 nesdis and collaboration to

activities with the us coast guard then an agency of dot the coast guard used to assist noaa by tran sporting marine data buoys great distances for servicing or deployment the prima ry concern of nbdc being the potential deterioration of the noaa buoy network nd the loss of important environmental data officials stated that noaa would need to make up the difference in funding manpower and equipment which are require d to operate the program as congress intended prior to september 11 2001 noaa s acting administrat or testified to the importance of the coast guard to the ma rine program the deployment schedule for buoy varies from 1 2 years and can depend on the type of buoy availability of coast guard ship to deliver the buoy production capacity at the national data buoy center and

rs22109 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa budget for fy 2006 presidents request congressional appropriations and related issues conclusion noaa has provided various resources fo r preparing for detecting and responding to disasters natura l or otherwise and terrorist attacks looking to the future some noaa officials are concerned that reductions in discretionary funding could not only hinder the agen cys homeland security role as envisioned by the bush administration but also customary progra ms and activities recent budget authority provided to noaa for homeland security has been provided through emergency appropriations or by reprogramming the ag encys budgets however emergency appropriations funded ac tivities can also be victim to changing budget priorities if not eventually annualized adopted in the agencys regular budget in addition noaa officials venture that programs and activities that are not authorized by congress are likely targets of discretiona ry funding cuts when pl 105567 the noaa authorization act of 1992 was enact ed on october 29 1992 it was the last time the agency was authorized as whole21 finally lacking necessary tools facilities and pe rsonnel to sustain emergency preparedness and responserelated programs noaa officials are concerned th at resulting need to reprogram funds could compromise the agencys traditional research and operations mission that are not related to homeland security
