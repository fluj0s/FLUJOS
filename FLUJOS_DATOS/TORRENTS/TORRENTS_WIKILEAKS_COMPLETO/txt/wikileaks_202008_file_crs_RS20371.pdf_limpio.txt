and appropriation of federal spending to carry out government activities while the power over appropriations is granted to congress by the us constitution the authorization appropriation process is derived from house and senate rules the formal process consists of two sequential steps 1 enactment of an authorizati on measure that may create or continue an agency or program as well as authorize the subsequent enactment of appropriations and 2 enactment of appropriations to provide funds for the authorized agency or program for more information on the budget process see the crs guides to congressional processes at httpwwwcrsgov productsguidesguidehomeshtml the authorizing and appropriating duties in this twostep process are carried out by division of labor within the committee system legislative committees such as the house committee on armed services and the senate committee on commerce science and transportation are responsible for authorizing legislation related to the agencies and programs under their jurisdiction most standing committees have authorizing responsibilities the appropriations committees of the house and senate have jurisdiction over appropriations measures as discussed belowbelow house and senate rules generally prohibit the encroachment of these committee responsibilities by the authorizers and appropriators agencies and programs funded through the annual appropriations process referred to as discretionary spending generally follow this twostep process not all federal agencies and programs however are funded through this auth orizationappropriations process funding for some agencies and programs is provided by the authorizing legislation bypassing this twostep process such spending referred to as direct spending currently constitutes about twothirds of all federal spending some direct spending mostly entitlement programs is funded by permanent appropriations in the authorizing law other direct spending referred to as appropriated entitlements such as medicaid is funded in ap propriations acts but the amount appropriated is controlled by the authorizing legislation

period of time it also may set forth th duties and functions of an agency or program its organizational structure and the responsibilities of agency or program officials authorizing legislation also authorizes the enactment of appropriations for an agency or program the amount authorized to be appropriated may be specified for each fiscal year or may be indefinite providing such sums as may be necessary the authorization of appropriations is intended to provide guidance regarding the appropriate amount of funds to carry out the authorized activities of an agency

senate are each responsible for one of the regular appropriations acts the regular appropriations acts provide budget authority for the next fiscal year beginning october 1 congress usually adopts one or more supplemental appropriations acts to provide additional funding for unexpected needs while the fiscal year is in progress if the regular appropriation acts are not completed by october 1 then congress must adopt continuing appropriations act commonly referred to as continuing resolution providing stopgap funding in some years instead of adopting the regular appropriation measures individually congress may include several in an omnibus appropriations measure or continuing appropriations bill providing funding for the full fiscal year

the separation between the two steps of the authorizationappropriations process is enforced through points of order provided by rules of the house and senate first the rules prohibit appropriations for unauthorized agencies and pr ograms an appropriation in excess of an authorized amount is considered an unauthorized appropriation second the rules prohibit the inclusion of legislative language in appropriations measures third the house but not the senate prohibits appropriations in authorizing legislation while the rules encourage the integrity of the process point of order must be raised to enforce the rules also the rules may be waived by suspension of the rules by unanimous consent or in the house by special rule if unauthorized appropriations are enacted into law through circumvention of house and senate rules in most cases the agency may spend the entire amount g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
