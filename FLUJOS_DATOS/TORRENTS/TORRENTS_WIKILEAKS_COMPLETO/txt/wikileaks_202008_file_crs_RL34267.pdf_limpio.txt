federal land ownership began when the original 13 states ceded their western lands between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river to the central government between 1781 and 1802 substantial land acquisition in north america via treaties and purchases began with the louisiana purchase in 1803 and culminated with the purchase of alaska in 1867 in total the federal government acquired 18 billion acres in north america the us constitution addresses the relationship of the federal government to lands article iv 3 clause 2the property clausegives congress authority over federal property generally and the supreme court has described congresss power to legislate under this clause as without limitation the equal footing doctrine based on language within article iv 3 clause 1 and found in state enabling acts provides new states with equality to the original states in terms of constitutional rights but has not been used successfully to force the divestment of federal lands the policy question of whether to acquire more or to dispose of any or all federal lands is left to congress to decide the initial federal policy generally was to transfer ownership of many federal lands to private and state ownership congress enacted many laws granting lands and authorizing or directing sales or transfers ultimately disposing of 1275 billion acres however from the earliest times congress also provided for reserving lands for federal purposes and over time has reserved or withdrawn areas for such entities as national parks national forests and wildlife refuges the taylor grazing act of 1934 was enacted to remedy the deterioration of the range on the remaining public lands this was the first direct authority for federal management of these lands and implicitly began the shift toward ending disposals and retaining lands in federal ownership in 1976 congress formally declared that national policy was generally to retain the remaining lands in federal ownership in the federal land policy and management act the sagebrush rebellion was collection of unsuccessful state and local efforts beginning in 1978 to assert title to federal lands or force their divestiture it also included efforts by the reagan administration and in congress to divest of many federal lands which also proved unsuccessful legislation on federal land disposal continues to be considered bills for the wholesale disposal have not been introduced in more than decade but legislation has been introduced to limit federal land ownership or acquisition to expand disposal authorities at least in some areas to sell lands to pay for other activities and to accelerate currently authorized land sales because the extent of federal lands and the authority to acquire and dispose of federal lands are an enduring policy question congress faces continued consideration of federal lands legislation

it acquired in north america1 these lands are heavily concentrated in 12 western states including alaska but not hawaii where in total the federal government owns more than half of the land ranging from 30 in montana to 84 in nevada2 many western citizens and members of congress continue to express concerns about what they feel is excessive federal influence over their lives and economies and assert that the federal government should divest itself of many of these lands others support the policy of retaining these lands in federal ownership this report describes practices and authority for

began when the original 13 states ceded title to more than 40 of their western lands 237 million acres between th appalachian mountains and the mississippi river to the central government between 1781 and 1802 federal land acquisition from foreign countries began with the louisiana purchase 530 million acres in 1803 and continued via treaties with great britain and spain 76 million acres in 1817 and 1819 respectively other substantial acquisitions 620 million acres via purchases and treaties occurred between 1846 and 1853 the last major north american land acquisition by the us federal government was the purchase of alaska 378 million acres in 1867 at its inception the federal government did not own land in the original states of the union rather ownership of lands between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river was ceded by the original states and additional states were formed from those lands 3 west of the mississippi river except texas lands were primarily acquired by the us federal government from foreign governments as was florida which was acquired from spain the means by which the federal government came to own its lands can affect which laws govern the lands management the public domain lands primarily those obtained from foreign sovereign typically are governed by different laws than are lands acquired from states or individuals

and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states this provision provides broad authority for congress to govern the lands acquired by the federal government as it sees fit and to exercise exclusive authority to decide on whether or not to dispose of those lands the us supreme court s described this power as without limitation stating that while congress can acquire exclusive or partial jurisdiction over lands within state by the states consent or cession the presence or abse nce of such jurisdiction has nothing to do with congress powers under the property clause absent consent or cession state undoubtedly retains jurisdiction over federal lands within its territory but congress equally surely retains the power to enact legislation respecting those lands pursuant to the property clause and when congress so acts the federal legislation necessarily overrides conflicting state laws under the supremacy clause 4 one authoritative commentary noted that appropriation of public lands may be made for any purpose except by authority of congress congress may limit the disposition of the public domain to manner consistent with its views of public policy it the property clause empowers congress to act as both proprietor and legislature over the public domain congress has complete power to make those needful rules which in its discretion it determines are necessary when congress acts with respect to those lands covered by the property clause its legislation overrides conflicting state laws absent action by congress however states may in some instances exercise some jurisdiction over activities on federal lands 5 thus it is accepted law that the federal government may own and hold property as congress directs6 issues such as whether some or all of the remaining federal lands should be retained or divested how to dispose of lands or whether to acquire additional federal lands appear to be policy questions for congress

the union on an equal footing with the original states10 the us supreme court has clarified what those rights are in the context of land the equal footing doctrine has been held to mean that states have the authority over the beds of navigable waterways some have argued that the equal footing doctrine prohibits permanent federal land ownership this is contrary to the plain wording of the constitution the doctrine and some language within the us supreme court case of pollard s lessee v hagan11 have been combined to provide an argument that the federal government held the lands ceded by the original states only temporarily pending their disposal however this theory has been rejected by other supreme court cases furthermore in pollard s lessee v hagan the supreme court ruled on the narrow issu of federal ownership of submerged lands beneath navigable waterways finding those lands belonged to the state under the equal footing doctrine because the original states had kept ownership of the shores of navigable waters and the soils under them 12 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g14g138g151g141g561g6g146g156g153g152g156g138g149g561 the initial policy of the federal government generally was to transfer ownership of many of the federal lands to private and state handsto pay revolutionary war soldiers to finance the new government and later to encourage the development of infrastructure and the settlement of the territories in october 1780 even before the articles of confederation were ratified the continental congress adopted general policy for administering any lands transferred to the federal government the lands were to be disposed of for the common benefit of the united states were to be settled and formed into distinct republican states which shall become members of the federal union and shall have the same rights of sovereignty freedom and independence as the other states the lands were to be granted and settled at such times and under such regulations as shall hereafter be agreed on by the united states in congress assembled 13 the need for revenues to pay off the national debt was driving force in the debate over land disposal systems14 the continental congress balanced the need for revenue with other needs eg compensating veterans and providing for public schools in enacting the land ordinance of may 20 1785 to address the lands in the ohio territory north of the ohio river and west of pennsylvania after extensive debates the continental congress essentially followed an approach for land disposal that included several provisions that were used in most federal land disposal legislation over the next 50 years including prior rectangular survey before disposal 10 see eg nevada enabling act 13 stat 30 18631864 11 44 us

section 136th of every 6mile square township for the maintenance of public schools within the said township15 questions about the governance of these lands including potential statehood were resolved by the continental congress in the northwest ordinance of 1787 and at nearly the same time and in nearly the same manner by the constitutional convention drafting the new us constitution the decision was to have initial administration by federally appointed governor followed by shared authority between an appointed governor and representative assembly culminating in statehood on an equal footing with the original states the constitutional convention also addressed concerns about statehood for the western lands robert morris pa expressed apprehensions about the impact on the developed east by western congressional representation by unschooled frontiersmen 16 this concern was addressed in article iv 3 cl 1 which requires the consent of both congress and the legislatures of the existing states from which new state is created charles carroll md noted the concern of small states that the consent provision together with the existing state claims to the western lands ie the ohio territory could prevent eventual statehood for those lands because the state claiming the land could deny its consent17 this was then addressed by requiring the original states to cede title to those western lands to the central government the new federal government took various actions regarding lands including settling conflicting claims granting lands to veterans for military service and other purposes and selling the remaining lands under various programs the first land offices to resolve land claims and sales were established by congress in ohio in 180018 and the general land office was established in 1812 to administer the disposal of federal lands congress enacted numerous laws to grant sell or otherwise transfer federal lands into private ownership including the homestead act of 1862 and the general mining law of 187219 grants to railroads in the 1870s gave them incentives to create much of the nations transportation system nearly 816 million acres of the public domain lands were transferred to private ownership between 1781 and 200620 most 97 occurred before 1940 homestead entries for example peaked in 1910 at 183 million acres but dropped below 200000 acres annually after 1935 21 because the best agricultural lands were already taken the federal government also granted 328 million acres to the states22 the single largest state grant was in 195823 under the alaska statehood act the state of alaska could select up to 15 these provisions were subsequently enacted in various statutes following ratification of the constitution beginning with the land act of 1796

federal policy generally was to dispose of many of the lands it had acquired increasingly over time congress withdrew landsremoved them from disposal under some or all of the disposal lawsor reserved landswithdrew them for particular national purpose for example the land ordinance of 1785 reserved section 16 of every township to maintain public schools 27 the act of 1796 made permanent many of the provisions of the land ordinance of 1785 and provided that instead of reserving scattered sections for future disposal by congress the four central sections of each township were to be retained28 in 1798 congress authorized and funded military reservations for building fortifications at the discretion of the president29 early withdrawals were primarily to retain lands for future disposals or for indian trading posts for military and mineral reservations or for other public purposes30 the establishment of yellowstone national park in 187231 led the way to preserving certain lands for recreation and for the future with other national parks designated later32 this eventually led to the national park organic act33 and to the national park system in 1891 the president was authorized to protect other federal lands by proclaiming forest reserves34 this eventually led to the creation of the national forest system in 1903 president theodore roosevelt began the practice of withdrawing federal lands to protect wildlife habitats which led to the national wildlife refuge system today the national park service the us forest service and the us fish and wildlife service manage the lands to preserve parks conserve forests and protect wildlife and wildlife habitat respectively these three agencies manage 360 million acres about 55 of all federal lands see table 1 below additional

oversee the disposal of the public lands through land sales homesteading grants to railroads and to states and other means35 the offices division of forestry was responsible for the forest reserves beginning with their establishment in 1891 but in 1905 this division was transferred and merged into the department of agricultures bureau of forestry to form the new us forest service 36 the general land office remained in the business of principally overseeing the disposal of many of the remaining federal lands and maintaining federal title records and documents the us grazing service was created in 1934 to administer many of the public lands for livestock grazing under the authority of the taylor grazing act of 193437 although the act referred to managing those lands pending their disposal the act implicitly began the shift in federal law toward ending disposals and retaining lands in federal ownership this act was intended to remedy the deterioration of the remaining public lands apparently due to overgrazing and the drought and depression of the 1920s and 1930s it was the first direct authority for federal management of lands which previously were freely available for transient grazing and reflected the significant decline in homestead entries in part because of controversies over its management efforts the grazing service was terminated in 1946 by merging it with the general land office to form the bureau of land management blm 38 the debate over federal retention of the remaining public lands endured for decades the shift toward explicit federal policy to retain these lands continued with two laws enacted in 1964 one created the public land law review commission pllrc to review existing public land laws and regulations and to examine the policies and practices of the federal agencies which administered the federal lands the 1970 pllrc report contained 137 specific legal and policy recommendations for improving federal land management 39 the first recommendation was that the existing federal lands should generally be retained in federal ownership we therefore recommend that the policy of rgescale disposal of public lands reflected by the majority of statutes in force today be revised and that future disposal should be only those lands that will achieve maximum benefit for the general public in nonfederal ownership while retaining in federal ownership those whose values must be preserved so that they may be used and enjoyed by all americans the other 1964 law the classification and multiple use act directed blm to classify lands for retention or for disposal and to manage the lands for multiple purposes pending the pllrc recommendations by 1970 when the pllrc report was released blm had classified more than 90 of the remaining unreserved public domain lands for retention this reflected the decline in federal land disposal to nearly zero in the 1960s 35 gates history of public land law development pp 127128 the

disposal was debated in three congresses following the release of the pllrc report finally enactment of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma formally ended the previous disposal policy expressly declaring that the national policy generally was to retain the remaining lands in federal ownership40 section 102a of flpma states the cong ress declares that it is the policy of the united states that1 the public lands be retained in federal ownership unless as result of the land use planning procedure provided for in this act it is determined that disposal of particular parcel will serve the national interest flpma also amended many previous management authorities and public land and resource laws and repealed most land disposal laws section 702 repealed the many statutes and sections authorizing homesteading although the effective date of the repeal was delayed for 10 years in alaska section 703 similarly repealed and delayed the effective date in alaska most other statutes authorizing land sales or transfers flpma did authorize the sale of some specific tracts of public lands at price not less than their fair market value under conditions specified in the act blm currently manages 258 million acres of land395 of all federal land and 114 of all land in the united states third of blm lands 835 million acres are in alaska the remainder is substantially concentrated in 11 western states and accounts for significant amounts of land in most of those states blm also manages 387721 acres in states east of the rocky mountains with 70 of those lands in south dakota blm lands are administered for the sustained yield of multiple uses including recreation livestock grazing timber harvesting watershed protection and wildlife and fish habitat management although users typically want higher outputs than blm provides while environmental groups typically want more protection and lower outputs table 1 below summarizes the current federal lands reserved

made to turn over remaining unreserved public domain lands to the states until 1976 many westerners retained the hope that the substantial federal presence might be reduced through additional federal land tr ansfers to private or state ownership however flpma repealed most of the authorities for such ownership transfers and established an official policy of retaining the remaining lands thus these western interests faced future with substantial and permanent federal presenceas much as 84 of the land in nevada 69 in alaska 57 in utah 53 in oregon and 50 in idaho 41 the sagebrush rebellion was largely reaction to these facts the sagebrush rebellion was collection of efforts to force the federal government to divest itself of federal lands these efforts took the form of state and local legislation court challenges federal administrative changes and efforts at federal legislation the target was usually blm lands but sometimes included national forests these efforts failed for number of reasons fundamental obstacle was that nevada and other states agreed as condition of statehood to disclaim forever all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within said territory and that the same shall be and remain at the sole and entire disposition of the united states 42 this language was part of the enabling act creating the states and was incorporated into their constitutions therefore the state laws asserting title to those federal lands appeared to contravene 41 gsa federal real property profile 42 john d leshy unraveling the sagebrush rebellion law

enacted state law asserting state title and management and disposal authority over public blm lands within nevadas boundaries 46 similar state laws asserting state authority over public lands were passed in arizona hawaii idaho new mexico north dakota utah and wyoming47 other attempts to enact similar state laws were less successful legislation in california colorado and south dakota was vetoed although weaker version of the california bill was passed that did not require the governors signature48 washington state measure contingent on an amendment to the states constitution failed in 1978 the state of nevada began its court challenge of the constitutionality of the federal land retention policy in 102a of flpma nevada argued that the federal government could only lawfully hold public lands in temporary trust pending eventual disposal and that retention of the lands violated the equal footing doctrine the federal district court for the district of nevada dismissed the case for failure to identify claim upon which relief could be granted 49 the court found that any limitations on holding lands ceded by the original states did not apply to western lands acquired after the constitution went into effect and that the equal footing doctrine did not mean that the newer western states were entitled to the public lands the court noted that the equal footing doctrine applied only to political and sovereignty rights and not to economic or geographic equality and that the constitution reserved to congress the authority to decide which federal lands to sell or to keep on the symbolic date of july 4 1993 nye county nv took action on federal lands using bulldozer to open closed roads based on the assertion that nevada held title to the lands the united states filed suit seeking declaratory judgment that it owned and had authority to manage the disputed lands within nye county and that the county resolution regarding roads and right of way was invalid the united states prevailed in federal court 50 43 richard m mollison and richard w eddy jr the sagebrush rebellion simplistic response to the complex problems of federal land management harvard journal on

authority over federal lands and attempted to specify management of those lands catron county nm was vanguard in asserting local control over federal property51 its ordinance was repealed year later however local laws that impose direct management requirements on the lands or require local approvals for land use changes almost certainly are preempted under the supremacy clause article vi clause 2 of the us constitution if they conflict with federal laws regulations or purposes52 private entities have also challenged federal land ownership in one case the plaintiffs asserted that they did not need permit to graze livestock in national forest because the state of nevada owned the lands53 both the lower and appellate courts again rejected the arguments that nevada was entitled to the lands under the equal footing doctrine or that the federal government had any obligation to turn lands over to states g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g7g143g143g152g155g157g156g561 president reagan attempted to address the issue administratively in the early 1980s that administrations concept of reducing federal influence in the west slowly changed from transferring the lands free of charge to selling the lands at fair market value several factors stimulated this shift including pressure from c ongress and the rising federal deficit eventually president reagan issued an executive order establishing the property review board to review federal real property for potential disposal 54 it was not clear how this initiative related to existing laws such as flpma that provide statutory criteria for reviewing lands for disposal and contain an express policy of retention the asset management program eventually stalled however because the administration sought clear congressional authorization for land disposal before it would identify which lands might be disposed of and congress refused to consider legislation to authorize such disposal until the administration had identified which lands might be disposed of 55 g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g7g143g143g152g155g157g156g561 the history of the foregoing state local and administrative efforts made it clear that reducing federal land ownership would require an act of congress bills were introduced in the 95 th 96th and 97th congresses 19771982 to change the retention policy in flpma in general these bills would have authorized transferring the unreserved lands to the states upon application if the state had land management agency with multipleuse mandate however none of these

legislate reduction in federal land ownership were revived in 1994 with the election of republican majorities in the house and the senate and the vision of shifting federal control toward the states was embodied in the house republican contract with america organizations supporting this vision such as the cato institute have advocated extensive disposal of federal lands through privatization andor transfer to state ownership or management several bills were circulated or introduced in the 104th congress for the wholesale transfer of blm lands or for the transfer of ownership or management of specific federal units eg specific wildlife refuges or national park system units in one state56 hearings were held on some of the bills but none was reported by committee or considered on the floor general legislation to dispose of federal land saw less congressional attention in the 105th congress one bills 1254 the federal lands management adjustment actwould have authorized management of the forest service or blm lands in state for renewable 10year terms by the state or qualified nonprofit organization but with legislative authorization required for each management transfer hearings were held on the bill bills to promote broad divestiture of the federal lands have been introduced since the 105 th congress numerous bills have been introduced in most congresses to transfer individual or groups of parcels for instance to local governments for public purposes several bills and amendments have been offered to prohibit or restrict federal land acquisition in states with 50 or more federal land ownership the federal lands improvement act was introduced in the 106 th 107th and 108th congresses to accelerate blm sales of lands identified for disposal under 203 of flpma hearings were held on these bills in the 109th congress two bills the action plan for public lands and education act of 2005 hr 3463s 2569 would have allowed western states to select from the unappropriated federal lands as defined in the bill up to 5 of the federal land acreage in the state which could then be leased or sold to generate state funds for education hearings were held on the

effect of those landsand of federal decisionmaking about the management of those landson their lives and economies legislation addressing the issue continues to be offered although in recent years the bills have not been for wholesale disposal rather the bills tend to be more limitedcapping federal land acquisition or ownership expanding disposal authorities typically in limited areas or otherwise accelerating currently authorized disposals the agencies have numerous authorities for acquiring and disposing of federal lands nonetheless numerous bills are introduced and considered in each congress on specific acquisitions disposals and exchanges often because of the limitations in or difficulties with the existing authorities other initiatives have been offered to sell federal lands to

and about acquiring and disposing of federal lands are policy choices for congress such choices are combined with interests in reducing federal presence in the west and with possible sales of federal assets ie lands to pay for programs often including federal land acquisition thus congress is likely to continue to consider legislation that would alter federal land ownership
