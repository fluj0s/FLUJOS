measure this report focuses primarily on the interethnic adoption provisions enacted into law during the 104th congress adoption tax credits and amendments to icwa are briefly discussed and references for further reading are provided interethnic adoption background pl 104188 amends legislation that was originally passed during the 103rd congress named for its chief senate sponsor the howard metzenbaum multiethnic placement act mepa was enacted on october 20 1994 pl 103382 passage of mepa reflected congressional concern that many children in foster care particularly minority children wait too long for adoption and that any barriers to adoption resulting either from discrimination in placement or shortage of adoptive homes should be eliminated as stated in the act its purposes were 1 to decrease the length of time that children wait to be adopted 2 to prevent discrimination in the placement of children on the basis of race color or national origin and 3 to facilitate identification and recruitment of foster and adoptive families that can meet childrens needs mepa prohibited any agency or entity that received federal assistance from categorically denying someone the opportunity to adopt or foster child solely on the basis of the race color or national origin of the individual or of the child the act further prohibited such agencies from delaying or denying the placement of child into adoption or foster care or otherwise discriminating in making placement decision solely on the basis of the race color or national origin of the prospective parents or of the child however mepa did allow agencies to consider the childs cultural ethnic or racial background and the capacity of the prospective foster or adoptive parents to meet the childs needs as one of the factors used to determine the best interests of the child the act established that individuals who were aggrieved by an action that they believed violated mepa could seek relief in us district court and that noncompliance with the acts provisions was deemed violation of title vi of the civil rights act the act further required states to provide for the diligent recruitment of potential foster and crs3 adoptive families that reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of children in the state who need foster or adoptive homes the department of health and human services hhs issued policy guidance in the april 25 1995 federal register with respect to compliance with mepa agencies or entities covered by mepa were required to be in full compliance by october 21 1995 in may 1996 hhs reported that all states except three arkansas kentucky and minnesota were in compliance to comply with mepa these three states had to enact statutory changes extensions were granted until july 1996 kentucky and minnesota and april 1997 arkansas because of the schedules of their state legislatures 1996 amendments following passage of mepa concern was raised about whether the act was sufficiently strong to achieve its goals in particular some observers objected to the provision that allowed agencies to consider childs cultural ethnic or racial background in making placement decisions concern also was expressed about the lack of an enforcement mechanism other than judicial action as result congress included interethnic adoption provisions in budget reconciliation hr 2491 and omnibus welfare reform proposals hr 4 which were vetoed by president clinton in december 1995 and january 1996 similar provisions were included in the adoption promotion and stability act hr 3286 and in the minimum wage legislation that was passed by congress on august 2 hr 3448 and signed into law on august 20 pl 104188 as enacted pl 104188 repeals the mepa provision that allowed states to consider childs cultural ethnic or racial background in making placement decisions the new law requires states in their foster care and adoption assistance plans under title ive of the social security act to provide that neither the state nor any other entity that receives federal funds may deny person the opportunity to adopt or foster child on the basis of the race color or national origin of the person or of the child nor may they delay or deny the placement of child on the basis of the race color or national origin of the prospective parent or child this provision is effective on january 1 1997 these prohibitions are similar to those formerly contained in mepa however the word solely does not appear in the new provision in addition mepa established that agencies could not otherwise discriminate in making placement decisions on the basis of race color or national origin this language was originally included in the introduced version of hr 3286 but deleted during ways and means committee markup after members expressed concern that the bills language might be overly restrictive the specific concern raised was that if two otherwise qualified families of different racial backgrounds wished to adopt child the adoption agency would be unable to select the family of the same race as the child because that would constitute racial discrimination therefore the final version of the interethnic adoption provision does not explicitly allow consideration of race color or national origin in making placement decisions however the law does not explicitly prohibit consideration of these factors unless such consideration resulted in denying or delaying the childs placement because pl 104188 makes these prohibitions components of state foster care and adoption assistance plans they are automatically subject to review by hhs as part of the federal review of state child welfare programs pl 104188 also provides that if state is found to be in violation of these provisions either as result of federal review or crs4 otherwise hhs must reduce quarterly foster care and adoption assistance payments otherwise due to the state states will have up to six months to implement corrective action plan and thereby avoid the penalty these penalties will equal 2 of federal funds for first violation 3 for second violation and 5 for 3 or more violations hhs may not reduce any fiscal year payment to state by more than 5 private agencies that violate the interethnic provisions will be required to pay back any federal funds received as under mepa private individuals may seek relief under these provisions in us district court however pl 104188 provides that action may be brought more than 2 years after the alleged violation occurs the law also applies these discrimination prohibitions to any person or government involved in adoption or foster care noncompliance will be deemed violation of title vi of the civil rights act pl 104188 does not affect the current law provision in title ivb of the social security act that requires states to diligently recruit ethnically and racially diverse foster and adoptive families likewise these provisions do not affect the application of icwa issues at the end of fiscal year 1990 the most recent year for which detailed data are available adoption had been established as the goal for 69000 foster children1 of these children 20000 were legally free for adoption and waiting for placement during the same year adoptions were finalized for approximately 17000 children who formerly had been in foster care comparison of the children who were adopted in fiscal year 1990 and those who were still waiting for an adoptive home at the end of the year indicates that africanamerican children in particular are more likely to wait for adoption than to be placed specifically 29 of the children whose adoptions were made final in fiscal year 1990 were africanamerican compared to 43 of the children who were still waiting for adoptive homes among children of all races who were waiting for adoptive placements at the end of the year 46 had been waiting 2 years or longer an analysis by the american public welfare association apwa of foster children in 12 states during the period 1984 to 1990 indicates that the rate at which african american and hispanic children leave foster care is slower than that of white children and was substantially lower in 1990 than it was in 19842 apwa further noted that in fy1990 the number of black children in foster care in 31 states exceeded the number of white foster children in the same states in sum black children are more likely than white children to enter foster care in the first place and stay in foster care longer interethnic adoption particularly adoption of africanamerican children by white parents is highly controversial and emotional issue on the one hand as noted above minority children are disproportionately in need of adoptive homes and spend more time in foster care than white children there is concern that state policies or practices that prohibit or discourage interethnic adoption exacerbate the plight of these children allowing children to be adopted by the first suitable family available regardless of race or 1 characteristics of children in substitute and adoptive care voluntary cooperative information system american public welfare association

welfare association washington dc june 1994 crs5 ethnicity could speed up adoptions and reduce stays in foster care for minority children in addition adoption advocates point to studies that show successful outcomes for africanamerican and other minority children who are raised in white homes on the other hand some argue that minority children are disproportionately placed in foster care because of shortage of family support services including services that recognize cultural differences among families that could avoid the need to remove children from their biological families in the first place and help reunite families after children have been removed in addition aggressive recruitment of minority families could result in more and faster adoptions for minority children observers express concern about the longterm adjustment of children raised outside their racial or ethnic heritage and point to research that indicates confusion among these children about their cultural identity and adjustment difficulties in school and in the community some advocates of samerace placements argue that agencies should be able to discriminate at least as long as such discrimination does not prolong childs stay in foster care for additional reading see transracial adoptions and foster care placements by gina m stevens crs general distribution memorandum american law division and state statutes which consider race as factor in foster care placements and list of state agencies responsible for regulating foster care by gloria p sugars crs report 91193 adoption tax credits pl 104188 also is intended to promote adoption through tax incentives as enacted the law establishes nonrefundable personal tax credit of up to 5000 for qualified adoption expenses incurred by families including adoption fees court costs and attorney fees for parents adopting child who is not an american citizen or resident the credit can be taken only after the adoption becomes final in the case of adoptive children with special needs the credit can equal up to 6000 after december 31 2001 the tax credit will be available only for adoptions of children with special needs the definition of special needs child is the same as in the title ive adoption assistance program ie child that the state has determined cannot or should not return to his or her parents and for whom it would be reasonable to conclude could not be placed for adoption without assistance because of specific factor or condition such as ethnic background age membership in minority or sibling group medical condition or physical mental or emotional handicap the adoption tax credit is reduced for families with adjusted gross incomes above 75000 and ends entirely for families with adjusted gross incomes of 115000 or more if family does not have sufficient tax liability to claim the full amount of its adoption expenditures eligible for the credit in single year the family may carry forward any unclaimed part of the credit into subsequent tax years for up to 5 years the tax credit may not be taken for any adoption expenses if the family received funds for such expenses from any federal state or local program in addition to the adoption tax credit pl 104188 establishes an exclusion from income of up to 5000 received by family from an employers adoption assistance program or up to 6000 for special needs adoptions again the amount of income that crs6 can be excluded is reduced for families with incomes above 75000 and eliminated entirely for families with incomes of 115000 or more this exclusion from income will terminate after december 31 2001 finally pl 104188 requires the secretary of the treasury to study the effects of the adoption tax credit and income exclusion on adoptions including special needs adoptions and report to congress by january 1 2000 for further information on the tax credit and accompanying revenue offsets see adoption tax credit and exclusion by louis alan talley crs report 96692 indian child welfare act amendments icwa was enacted in 1978 to promote the stability and security of indian tribes by establishing minimum federal standards for removal of indian children from their families and for their placement in foster or adoptive homes implementation of icwa has been controversial with adoption advocates arguing that the act has had chilling effect on all adoptions because of the possibility that child may have distant relative with indian blood at the same time the tribes have strongly opposed attempts to limit icwas scope claiming they would infringe on tribal rights to determine their own membership as passed by the house hr 3286 would have limited the cases in which icwa would apply specifically the bill provided that icwa would not apply to child custody proceeding involving child who does not live within reservation unless at least one of the childs biological parents is of indian descent and at least one of the childs biological parents maintains significant social cultural or political affiliation with the tribe of which either parent is member the bill also would have required that individuals age 18 or older who are not already members of an indian tribe could become tribal members only upon their written consent and that for purposes of child custody proceeding tribal membership would be effective from the date of admission and not be retroactive the house resources committee objected to the icwa provision in hr 3286 stating in its bill report that the amendment would create gigantic loophole in icwa by allowing state courts instead of tribal courts to determine whether icwa applies in individual cases representative young again attempted to delete the icwa provision through house floor amendment which was defeated the senate indian affairs committee also voted to strike the icwa provision from the adoption bill representative young and senator mccain subsequently introduced identical bills to amend icwa hr 3828 s 1962 as an alternative to the language in the adoption bill the senate indian affairs committee reported s 1962 on july 26 srept 104335 and the full senate passed the bill on september 26 hr 3828 was reported by the house resources committee on september 19 hrept 104808 however the 104th congress adjourned without taking final action on this legislation hr 3828 and s 1962 would have defined the exclusive jurisdiction of indian tribes in child custody proceedings involving indian children provided conditions for voluntary termination of parental rights to indian children established conditions for the withdrawal of consent to adoption of an indian child and the revocation of voluntary termination of parental rights to an indian child established timetable for notice and the specific contents of the notice to be given to indian tribes in the case of voluntary placement of crs7 an indian child or the voluntary termination of parental rights to an indian child defined conditions under which an indian tribe could intervene in voluntary child custody proceeding in state court and established criminal sanctions for anyone convicted of fraudulent representation in proceeding subject to icwa for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96376
