21 2008 clay wilson specialist in technology and national security foreign affairs defense and trade division high altitude electromagnetic pulse hemp and high power microwave hpm devices threat assessments summary electromagnetic pulse emp is an instantaneous intense energy field that can overload or disrupt at distance numerous electrical systems and high technology microcircuits which are especially sensitive to power surges large scale emp effect can be produced by single nuclear explosion detonated high in the atmosphere this method is referred to as highaltitude emp hemp similar smallerscale emp effect can be created using nonnuclear devices with powerful batteries or reactive chemicals this method is called high power microwave hpm several nations including reported sponsors of terrorism may currently have capability to use emp as weapon for cyber warfare or cyber terrorism to disrupt communications and other parts of the us critical infrastructure also some equipment and weapons used by the us military may be vulnerable to the effects of emp the threat of an emp attack against the united states is hard to assess but some observers indicate that it is growing along with worldwide access to newer technologies and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the past the threat of mutually assured destruction provided lasting deterrent against the exchange of multiple highyield nuclear warheads however now even single lowyield nuclear explosion high above the united states or over battlefield can produce largescale emp effect that could result in widespread loss of electronics but direct fatalities and may not necessarily evoke large nuclear retaliatory strike by the us military this coupled with published articles discussing the vulnerability of us critical infrastructure control systems and some us military battlefield systems to the effects of emp may create new incentive for other countries to rapidly develop or acquire nuclear capability policy issues raised by this threat include 1 what is the united states doing to protect civilian critical infrastructure systems against the threat of emp 2 could the us military be affected if an emp attack is directed against the us civilian infrastructure 3 are other nations now encouraged by us vulnerabilities to develop or acquire nuclear weapons and 4 how likely are terrorist organizations to

from high altitude electromagnetic pulse emp commission was established by congress in fy2001 after several experts expressed concern that the us critical infrastructure and military were vulnerable to emp attack1 on july 20 2008 the commission presented report to the house armed services committee hasc assessing the effects of an emp attack on us critical national infrastructures the 2008 report contained analysis of results of tests for modern electronics and telecommunications equipment for public networks supported by the power grid and by temporary isolated power supplies including cell phones computer servers and internet routers and switches the report also made recommendations for preparation protection and recovery of us critical infrastructures from emp attack the commission reported that the ubiquitous dependency of society on the electrical power system coupled with the emps particular damage mechanisms creates the possibility of longterm catastrophic consequences for national security comparison was made to hurricane katrina in 2005 where the protracted power blackout exhausted the limited fuel supplies for emergency generators however in the case of an emp attack widespread collapse of the electric power grid could lead to cascading effects on interdependent infrastructures possibly lasting weeks or months the commission stated should significant parts of the electrical power infrastructure be lost for any substantial period of time many people may ultimately die for lack of the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities and the federal government does not today have sufficiently robust capabilities for reliably assessing and managing emp threats2 at prior hearing on july 22 2004 panel members from the emp commission stated that as us military weapons and control systems become more complex and as portions of the militarys administrative communications systems continue to rely on the us civilian infrastructure for support they may be increasingly vulnerable to the effects of emp the consensus of the commission in 2004 was that large 1 michael sirak us vulnerable to emp attack janes defence

infrastructures apr 2008 ppviviii and p 79 crs2 scale highaltitude emp attack could possibly cause widespread damage to unprotected civilian and military electronic equipment for an extended period3 however the consensus of the emp commission in 2008 was that the united states need not remain vulnerable to catastrophic consequences of an emp attack and that the nations vulnerability can be reasonably reduced by coordinated and focused effort between the private and public sectors the committee stated that the cost for improved security in the next three to five years would be modest especially when compared with the costs associated with the war on terror and the value of the national infrastructures threatened4 the emp commissions reports in both 2004 and 2008 focused only on the effects of high altitude emp hemp and not necessarily the effects high power microwave hpm devices which are nonnuclear radiofrequency rf weapons that can also produce damaging emp but with different characteristics and covering smaller geographic area both types of emp are discussed below the widely published vulnerability of us civilian and some military electronics to emp along with technical accessibility and lower cost could make smallerscale hpm weapons attractive in the future as weapons for terrorist groups also some observers argue that unless the united states openly describes how it is taking action to reduce emp vulnerabilities within critical infrastructures perceived inaction will increase the likelihood that rogue nation will seek to employ the asymmetric effects of hemp against our computer systems the emp commission the emp commission was reestablished by pl 109163 the national defense authorization act for fy2006 the new commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack note that the new title longer includes the phrase high altitude and adds the new word attack continues with the same membership and the secretary of defense is authorized to appoint new member in the event of vacancy5 the emp commission is tasked to monitor investigate and make recommendations about the vulnerability of electricdependent systems of the department of defense government agencies and the private sector on july 22 2004 members of the emp commission testified before the house armed services committee and presented report consisting of the following five volumes volume 1 is an unclassified executive summary volume 2 is classified threat assessment volume 3 is an unclassified assessment of the us critical infrastructure 3 daniel g dupont panel says society at great risk from electomagnetic pulse attack inside the pentagon july 15 2004 p1 4 william graham testimony before the house armed services committee jul 10 2008 5 pl 109163 section 1052 reestablishes the emp commission crs3 volume 4 is classified discussion of military topics volume 5 is classified assessment of potential threats the report stated that high altitude emp is capable of causing catastrophic consequences for the nation and that the current vulnerability of our critical infrastructures which depend so heavily on computers and electronics can both invite and reward attack if not corrected6 specifically referring to the us military the report states emp test facilities have been mothballed or dismantled and research concerning emp phenomena hardening design testing and maintenance has been substantially decreased however the emerging threat environment characterized by wide spectrum of actors that include nearpeers established nuclear powers rogue nations subnational groups and terrorist organizations that either now have access to nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles or may have such access over the next 15 years have sic combined to place the risk of emp attack and adverse consequences on the us to level that is not acceptable our increasing dependence on advanced electronics systems results in the potential for an increased emp vulnerability of our technologically advanced forces and if unaddressed makes emp employment by an adversary an attractive asymmetric option7 the emp commissions 2004 report proposed fiveyear plan for protecting critical infrastructures from emp and from other largescale terrorist attacks the fiveyear plan is briefly summarized in volume 3 of the report however some portions of the fiveyear plan that are related to military equipment may remain classified the commission is currently preparing review of the dod response to recommendations made in 20048 testimony at the 2004 hearing included questions such as 1 how would the united states respond to limited hemp attack against the us homeland or against us forces where there is loss of technology but directly caused loss of life 2 does the current lack of us preparedness invite adversaries to plan and attempt hemp attack and 3 are the longterm effects of successful hemp attack leading to possible widespread starvation and population reduction potentially more devastating to the us homeland than an attack by surface nuclear weapons 2008 report on critical infrastructure vulnerabilities the 2008 emp commission report discussed vulnerabilities and interdependencies among 10 us critical infrastructures findings showed that only limited emp vulnerability

emp commission staff mar 26 2008 crs4 systems that help support these infrastructures in addition the commission expressed concern that widespread use of automated supervisory and control data acquisition scada systems for the critical infrastructure had allowed companies and agencies to systematically reduce the size of their work forces having the necessary technical knowledge needed to support manual operations of these infrastructure control systems as might be needed during prolonged emergency the commission concluded after reviewing national capabilities to manage the effects of nuclear weapons and emp on modern systems that the country is rapidly losing the technical competence in this area that it needs in the government national laboratories and industrial community9 private sector and state government poorly prepared experts on the commission have asserted that little has been done by the private sector to protect against the threat from electromagnetic pulse and that commercial electronic systems in the united states could be severely damaged by emp attack10 commercial electronic surge arresters commonly used for lightning strikes reportedly cannot be relied on because most do not clamp fast enough to protect against the nearinstantaneous effects of emp see section below on electromagnetic pulse overview11 in march 2007 survey of state adjutants general who oversee national guard units throughout the country found that most statebased emergency responders are not actively preparing against an attack on the united states by electromagnetic pulse the survey entitled missile defense and the role of the states was conducted jointly by the anchoragebased institute of the north and the claremont institute of claremont california survey questions were sent to adjutants general of all 50 states with more than half responding although 96 of state adjutants general indicated significant concern over an emp attack the majority had done little or analysis of the effects of an overhead emp attack and little or training or preparation to harden electronic equipment none of the adjutants general surveyed indicated that they were actively involved in formal planning process for response to an emp attack12 9 report of the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack critical national infrastructures

httpwwwinstitutenorthorgservletdownloadid261 crs5 inaction may increase emp threat to the united states some analysts discount the likelihood of largescale emp attack against the united states in the near term and the extent of possible damage stating that the critical infrastructure reportedly would survive and that military communications would continue to operate and high percentage of civilian phone calls would continue to connect the argument is that limited testing has shown that modern commercial equipment may be surprisingly resistant to the effects of electromagnetic pulse and that some military systems using commercial equipment are also retrofitted to be made more emp resistant before they are fielded13 however other analysts maintain that some past testing done by the us military may have been flawed or incomplete leading to faulty conclusions about the level of resistance of commercial equipment to the effects of emp these analysts also point out that emp technology has been explored by several other nations and as circuitry becomes more miniaturized modern electronics become increasingly vulnerable to disruption they argue that depending on the targeted area and power of an emp attack it could possibly take years for the united states to recover fully from the resulting widespread damage to electronics and the power grid14 commission members have stated at hearings that as time passes without visible effort to show the world that we are protecting our computer systems and critical infrastructures the perceived inaction may actually invite possible emp attack15 in the past the threat of mutually assured destruction provided lasting deterrent against the exchange of multiple highyield nuclear warheads however single lowyield nuclear explosion high above the united states or over battlefield can produce largescale highaltitude emp effect resulting in widespread loss of electronics but possibly without direct fatalities therefore an emp attack directed against the united states involving violent destruction nor instant death for large numbers of us citizens may not necessarily evoke massive nuclear retaliation by the us military where for example large numbers of innocent civilians of nation with rogue leader might be killed such perceived lower risk of assured destruction by the united states and widespread knowledge about the

nuclear capability electromagnetic pulse overview electromagnetic energy characterized as weapon potentially threatening to national security can be created as pulse traditionally by two methods overhead nuclear burst and microwave emission highaltitude electromagnetic pulse hemp is nearinstantaneous electromagnetic energy field that is produced in the atmosphere by the power and radiation of nuclear explosion and that is damaging to electronic equipment over very wide area depending on power of the nuclear device and altitude of the burst highpower microwave hpm electromagnetic energy can be produced as nearinstantaneous pulse created through special electrical equipment that transforms battery power or powerful chemical reaction or explosion into intense microwaves that are also very damaging to electronics but within much smaller area in addition while hemp weapons are large in scale and require nuclear capability along with technology to launch high altitude missiles hpm weapons are smaller in scale and can involve much lower level of technology that may be more easily within the capability of some extremist groups hpm can cause damage to computers similar to hemp although the effects are limited to much smaller area description of highaltitude electromagnetic pulse hemp is produced when nuclear weapon is detonated high above the earths surface creating gammaradiation that interacts with the atmosphere to create an instantaneous intense electromagnetic energy field that is harmless to people as it radiates outward but which can overload computer circuitry with effects similar to but causing damage much more swiftly than lightning strike16 the effects of hemp became fully known to the united states in 1962 during highaltitude nuclear test code named starfish prime over the pacific ocean when radio stations and electronic equipment were disrupted 800 miles away throughout parts of hawaii the hemp effect can span thousands of miles depending on the altitude and the design and power of the nuclear burst single device detonated at an appropriate altitude over kansas reportedly could affect all of the continental united states17 and can be picked up by metallic conductors such as wires or overhead power lines acting as antennas that conduct the energy shockwave into the electronic systems of cars airplanes or communications equipment 16 nuclear explosion produces gamma rays which interact with air molecules in process called the compton effect electrons are scattered at high energies which ionizes the atmosphere generating powerful electrical field this emp effect is strongest at altitudes above 30000m and lasts so briefly that current cannot start flowing through human body to cause harm to people 17 the federation of american scientists nuclear weapons emp effects httpwwwfasorgnukeintronukeemphtm crs7 figure 1 estimated area affected by highaltitude emp source heritage foundation jack spencer americas vulnerability to different nuclear threat an electromagnetic pulse backgrounder 1372 may 26 2000 httpwwwheritageorgresearch missiledefensebg1372cfm high altitude nuclear explosion that creates hemp produces three major energy components that arrive in sequence and which have measurably different effects that can be cumulatively damaging to electronic equipment the first energy component is the initial energy shockwave which lasts up to 1 microsecond and is similar to extremely intense static electricity that can overload circuitry for every electronic device that is within line of sight of the burst secondary energy component then arrives which has characteristics that are similar to lightning strike by itself this second energy component might not be an issue for some critical infrastructure equipment if antilightning protective measures are already in place however the rise time of the first component is so rapid and intense that it can destroy many protective measures allowing the second component to further disrupt the electronic equipment the third energy component is longerlasting magnetohydrodynamic mhd signal about 1 microsecond up to many seconds in duration this late time pulse or geomagnetic signal causes an effect that is damaging primarily to longlines electronic equipment there are two components to this third late time energy pulse which experts call blast and heave the blast results from distortion of the earths magnetic field lines by the expanding fully conductive fireball the heave comes from the heating and ionization of patch of atmosphere directly below the bomb that rises crs8 and being conductive also distorts the earths magnetic field both of these are considered mhd signals and are termed slow because they depend on the dynamics of cloud or fireball expansion as the fireball expands localized magnetic effect builds up on the ground throughout the length of long transmission lines and then quickly collapses producing the mhd latetime power surge which can overload equipment connected to the power grid and telecommunications infrastructure this latetime effect can add to the initial hemp effect and systems connected to longlines power and communications systems may be further disrupted by the combined effects smaller isolated systems do not collect so much of this third energy component and are usually disrupted only by the first energy component of hemp18 it is also important to note that this third latetime pulse depends on the total energy of the nuclear detonation and therefore is usually associated only with larger yield nuclear weapons however the first energy pulse is saturationlimited effect and is produced by all nuclear weapons both small and large yield description of highpower microwaves microwaves are characterized by electromagnetic energy with wavelengths as small as centimeters or millimeters and can be used at moderate power levels for radio frequency communications or for radar19 highpower microwaves can be created as an instantaneous electromagnetic pulse for example when powerful chemical detonation is transformed through special coil device called flux compression generator into an intense electromagnetic field20 other methods can also be used to create reusable hpm weapon such as combining reactive chemicals or using powerful batteries and capacitors to create emp hpm energy can be focused using speciallyshaped antenna or emitter to produce effects similar to hemp within confined area or over limited distance unlike hemp however hpm radiation uses shorter wave forms at higherfrequencies which make it highly effective against electronic equipment and more difficult to harden against mechanically simple suitcasesized device using chemical explosive and special focusing antenna might theoretically produce onetime instantaneous hpm 18 the federation of american scientists nuclear weapons emp effects httpwwwfasorgnukeintronukeemphtm and report of the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack vol1 executive report 2004 p5 19 for example microwaves with wavelengths about 57 cm long cband or 20 cm long lband or 3 cm long xband are often used for radar or communications 20 flux compression generator consists of explosives packed inside cylinder all of which is contained within cylindrical copper coil structure the explosive is detonated from rear to front causing the tube to flare in wave that touches the copper coil which produces moving short circuit this compresses the magnetic field and creates an electromagnetic pulse that is emitted from the front end which is then directed by special focusing antenna crs9 shockwave that could disrupt many computers within 1mile range21 also hpm energy at higher power levels megawatts and powered for longer time interval reportedly could cause physical harm to persons near the source emitter or possibly in the path of narrowly focused energy beam22 disruptive effects of emp studies related to the effects of electromagnetic energy used as weapons have been published infrequently or remain classified23 nevertheless it is known that powerful hemp field as it radiates outward can interfere with radio frequency links and instantly produce damaging voltage and currents in electronic devices thousands of miles from the nuclear explosion effectiveness is increased if the electronic devices are connected to any other metal that could also act as an antenna because infrastructure computer systems are interconnected widespread hemp effect could lead to possible longterm disruption of the power grid fuel distribution transportation systems food and water supplies and communications and equipment for hospitals and first responders as well as military communications systems which utilize the civilian infrastructure an hpm weapon has shorter possible range than hemp but it can induce currents large enough to melt circuitry or it can cause equipment to gradually fail over period of minutes days or even weeks in 2001 us comanche helicopter flying in new york while performing radar test involving hpm weapons generated lowlevel energy pulse that reportedly disrupted for two weeks the global positioning systems gps being used to land commercial aircraft at nearby airport in albany new york24 hemp attack directed against the unites states continent might involve onemegaton nuclear warhead or smaller one using burst several hundred miles above the midwestern states to affect computers on both coasts25 however creating hemp effect over an area 250 miles in diameter an example size for battlefield might only require rocket with modest altitude and payload capability that could loft relatively small nuclear device if medium or higher range missile with nuclear payload were launched from the deck of freighter at sea the resulting 21 dr robert c harney naval postgraduate school april 12 2004 personal communication

crs10 hemp could reportedly disable computers over wide area of the coastal united states the disruptive effects of both hemp and hpm reportedly diminish with distance and electronic equipment that is turned off is only less likely to be damaged26 to produce maximum coverage for the hemp effect nuclear device must explode very high in the atmosphere too far away from the earths surface to cause injury or damage directly from heat or blast also hemp produced by the nuclear explosion is instantaneous too brief to start current flowing within human body so there is effect on people however microwave energy weapons hpm are smallerscale are delivered at closer range to the intended target and can sometimes be emitted for long duration these characteristics of hpm can sometimes cause painful burning sensation or other injury to person directly in the path of the focused power beam or can even be fatal if person is too close to the microwave emitter27 both hemp and hpm can permanently immobilize vehicles with modern electronic ignition and control systems however older electrical components such as vacuum tubes and induction coils for spark ignition are generally built more massively and are more tolerant of emp as modern electronics shrink in size circuitry is becoming increasingly tiny and more vulnerable to electromagnetic interference therefore countries with infrastructure that relies on older technology may be less vulnerable to the disabling effects of hemp or hpm than countries that rely on higher level of technology28 recovery after attack the simultaneous loss of communications and power that would likely result from an emp attack would also complicate the restoration of systems without communications it would be difficult to ascertain the nature and location of damage or to order personnel out to make repairs the estimated recovery times for various elements of the electrical system are provided in list that appears on pages 5051 of the 2008 commission report 26 experts may disagree on whether the damaging effects of hpm actually diminish following the familiar inversesquareofthedistance rule michael abrams the dawn of the ebomb ieee spectrum november 2003 httpwwwspectrumieeeorgwebonly publicfeaturenov031103ebomhtml some experts state that the severity of hemp effect depends largely on the bomb design so speciallydesigned low

business need to improve and expand the electric power system provides an opportunity to improve both the security and reliability of the entire system in an economically acceptable manner29 the commission reported that the seriousness of loss of the electric power grid could be reduced through focused coordination between industry and government the commission recommended that the federal government according to standards it determines should validate proposed enhancements to protect systems against damage from emp attack and fund those security related elements economic damage estimates after attack on washington dc region in september 2007 the sage policy group of baltimore and instant access networks ian published study of the potential economic impact of hemp attack on the baltimorewashingtonrichmond area the study focuses on the economic effects of emp experienced by region after highaltitude emp pulse generated by nuclear device detonated between 3080 miles above ground impacting an area at least 500 miles in radius in these instances of highaltitude emp one would feel the heat or blast but merely experience the effects of the disruption or damage to the electronic and power infrastructure the baltimorewashingtonrichmond area likely comprises only onetenth of the economic loss that would occur for the total geographic area affected by regional emp event the report was presents range of low medium and high estimates of economic damage all within bounds accepted by broad range of emp experts the methodology relied on assumptions about disruption and damage to the regional electrical power system communications systems system control and data acquisition scada devices and other critical infrastructure that might occur as result of an emp and on the time required to repair that damage and fully restore economic activity these assumptions were used in combination to estimate the ultimate effects of an emp on the regions economy the cumulative effect of an emp on critical infrastructure was assumed to be largely determined by effects on the electrical grid and communications systems cumulative damage was then determined by multiplying the remaining capacity of the electrical grid by the remaining capacity of communication systems under three scenarios for example under the high case an emp damages 50 of the capacity of the electric grid and 50 of the capacity of communication systems the analysis assumed that the economy was then able to operate at only 25 of capacity ie 50 multiplied by 50 the study concluded that an emp attack affecting the baltimorewashington richmond region could result in economic output loss potentially exceeding 770 billion or 7 of the nations annual gross domestic product even under the most favorable assumptions including both shielded and unshielded critical infrastructure 29 report of the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack critical national infrastructures apr 2008 p 52 crs12 an emp might still result in damage that would require one month of recovery and economic loss of 9 billion and 34 billion respectively table 1

duration of disrepair lasts for years in such cases there are numerous complicating factors that could slow the recovery process the quantity of replacement equipment needed to restore the economy may quickly exhaust readily available supplies and in extreme cases existing manufacturing capacity in such cases the availability of skilled labor to replace and restore key infrastructure elements may also be in extraordinarily short supply highaltitude emp would also affect much larger parts of the region than the immediate baltimorewashingtonrichmond area further complicating recovery efforts it is unlikely that restoration would occur in an orderly linear fashion more likely restoration efforts would start slowly and gather speed as basic infrastructure is gradually brought on line portable data centers and hardening against emp electronic equipment may be made more resistant to emp by surrounding it with protective metallic shielding which routes damaging electromagnetic surges away from highly sensitive electrical components this method commonly known as faraday cage protection is often used to protect electronic equipment from lightning strike however these devices must be constructed carefully any wires crs13 running into the protected area could act as antennae and conduct the electromagnetic shockwave into the equipment these points of entry into shielded area must be protected from emp by using specially designed surge protectors special wire termination procedures screened isolated transformers spark gaps or other types of specially designed electrical filters30 additionally an emp surge from very powerful nuclear blast possibly involving 200 kilovoltsmeter electric field could pass through some protective shielding31 microsoft sun microsystems and other vendors have recently marketed new product commonly called portable data center pdc where computer equipment is placed on racks that are pregrouped inside modular room which can be moved and connected to other portable computer room modules as needed32 for example portable module can hold as many as 1200 servers along with power supply and cooling system all this computer equipment fits into box that can be placed inside 40foot standard freight shipping container which can also be mounted on truck for portability33 this new method for housing computers is intended to reduce the cost for computer facility installation however additional features may also transform pdc into an effective method for making us computer equipment less vulnerable to emp attack for example instant access networks ian specialized technology vendor now offers portable modular equipment room that reportedly can meet military specifications for emp protection34 the ian product uses welded metal enclosures of precise composition and thickness recently filed patent application involves unique construction method to block different emp frequencies and also reduce 30 electrical systems connected to any

intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr facilities hemp protection systems chapter 27 31 recent russian military writings claim that they have superemp weapon that can generate more than 200 kvs per meter which is 4 times greater than the level of emp hardening tested by the united states kilovolts per meter is the standard measure for describing the strength of an emp field in laymans terms the statement that russian superemp weapon could generate 200 kilovolts per meter means that conductive object exposed to the emp field will experience surge of 200000 volts for every meter of its length so if the object is 2 meters long it gets 400000 volts if 3 meters long it gets 600000 volts and so on testimony from the emp commission before the house armed services committee

location could possibly operate as an empprotected scada system or multiple shielded modules could be connected together at central headquarters location for highcapacity protected computing dod has also published milstandard 188125 which describes methods for protecting against highaltitude electromagnetic pulse for groundbased command and control facilities36 however not all military systems are currently hardened against emp in addition some dod systems rely on commercial facilities such as communications satellites and groundbased stations for support of military operations hardening most military systems and massproduced commercial equipment including pcs and communications equipment against hemp or hpm reportedly would add from 2 to 3 to the total cost if the hardening is engineered into the original design to retrofit existing military electrical equipment with hardening would add about 310 to the total cost37 dod vulnerabilities and research in 2004 the emp commission held the collective the opinion that dod had not engaged in any tabletop exercises and simulations that anticipate and emp attack in fact an emp commissioner observed that over the past 40 years dod has tended to not introduce emp attack into exercise scenarios or game scenarios because it tends to end the game and that is not good sign38 in april 2005 the defense science board dsb task force on nuclear weapon effects nwe test evaluation and simulation published report for dod describing current and emerging threat environments this included comprehensive evaluation of future dod capabilities for successful operation in nuclear environments the dsb findings were independent but are highly consistent with the findings and recommendations of the congressionally mandated

to us conventional superiority and as counter to us preemptive doctrine factors that should make decision makers concerned about the survivability of critical warfighting elements in nuclear environment these include the shift to commercialofftheshelf cots based electronics aging of key systems the growing reliance on historically soft c4isr2 assets the general neglect of nuclear hardening as requirement and the general neglect of nuclear environments as factor in gaming and exercises the bottom line is that commanders and planners cannot be assured that todays weapons platforms command and control c2 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr and associated support systems will be available should nuclear detonation occur39 underground testing of nuclear devices done in 1992 at the nevada test site were designed to research protection techniques to harden military systems against hemp effects resulting from nuclear exchange40 the limited test ban treaty of 1963 prohibits nuclear explosions in the atmosphere in space and under water since then testing to calibrate the effects of largescale hemp on the critical infrastructure has been restricted the design of new simulators to help measure these effects would call for complex computations to represent the large number of possible interactions between components found in the circuit boards network connections wireless systems hardware modules and operating environments of modern electronic systems that support the critical infrastructure dod research on pulsedpower hpm electromagnetic weapons is currently being done at kirtland air force base in albuquerque new mexico weapons now being developed by the us military for electronic warfare can disrupt the trajectory of missiles while in flight and can overpower or degrade enemy communications telemetry and circuitry other hpm weapons being tested by the military are portable and reusable through batterypower and many are effective when fired miles away from target these weapons can also be focused like laser beam and tuned to an appropriate frequency in order to penetrate electronics that are heavily shielded against nuclear attack the deepest bunkers with the thickest concrete walls reportedly are not safe from such beam if they have even single unprotected wire reaching the surface41 because instantaneous hpm energy can reflect off the ground and possibly affect piloted aircraft above much testing currently involves hpm devices on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and on the air force conventional air launched cruise

ground wave emergency network during the cold war the us military designed an innovative communications system to relay emergency messages between strategic military areas in the continental united states using signals that travel by means of low frequency ground waves electromagnetic fields that hug the ground rather than by radiating into the atmosphere the ground wave emergency network or gwen system was intended to allow continuous communications despite emp disruptions however the hardware was reportedly transistor based leaving the system with some level of vulnerability to emp in addition the fixed locations of gwen sites were known to adversaries and thus vulnerable to direct attack43 as the cold war ended the us military took steps to reduce its nuclear arsenal and associated infrastructure44 after 1998 the usaf decommissioned gwen assets and replaced the entire system with the single channel antijam manportable scamp terminal scamp uses extremely high frequency ehf technology is resistant to emp and offers more flexibility than gwen because the equipment is lightweight transportable and interoperable with dod satellite networks45 emp capabilities of other nations reportedly several potential us adversaries such as russia or china are now capable of launching crippling hemp strike against the united states with nucleartipped ballistic missile and other

electromagnetic pulse weapons and has devoted significant resources to development of other electronic warfare systems and laser weapons the report also noted that chinas leaders view offensive counter space weapons and other spacebased defense systems as part of inevitable scenarios for future warfare the report noted that china could have as many as 60 icbms capable of striking the united

reportedly made extensive preparations to protect their infrastructure against hemp by hardening both civilian and military electronic equipment and by providing continuous training for personnel operating these protected systems53 other sources have reportedly stated that russia may also have some of the leading physicists in the world currently doing research on electronic warfare weapons and electromagnetic pulse effects54 policy analysis preparedness what is the united states doing to protect critical infrastructure systems against the threat of electromagnetic pulse what is the appropriate response from the united states to nuclear hemp attack where there may be widespread damage to electronics but relatively little or possibly loss of life as direct result how could the united states determine which nation or group launched hemp attack after experiencing hemp effect the united states may retain its capability to use strategic weapons for nuclear retaliation but will the us industrial base and critical infrastructure be crippled or incapable of supporting sustained military campaign during such time would the united states be capable of making an effective

information systems are outweighed by the benefits gained through access to innovative technology and increased communications flexibility that come from using stateoftheart electronics and from maintaining connections to the civilian internet and satellite systems the effects of largescale hemp have been studied over several years by the defense atomic support agency the defense nuclear agency and the defense special weapons agency and are currently being studied by the defense threat reduction agency dtra however the application of the results of these studies has been uneven across military weapons and communications systems some analysts argue that us strategic military systems intercontinental ballistic missiles and longrange bombers may have strong protection against hemp while many other us weapons systems used for the battlefield have less protection and that this is undoubtedly known to our potential adversaries57 some analysts reportedly state that limited testing has shown modern commercial equipment may be surprisingly resistant to the effects of electromagnetic pulse and some military systems using commercial equipment have been retrofitted to increase resistance to emp58 however there is disagreement among observers about whether the procedures used by the us military to test emp survivability may have been flawed leading to erroneous conclusions about the effects of electromagnetic pulse on commercial electronics59 department of homeland security as part of its risk analysis mission the department of homeland security dhs has developed set of

capability will countries now view the development and acquisition of nuclear weapons even small arsenal as strategy for cyber warfare during the cold war hemp attack was viewed as the first step of nuclear exchange involving many warheads but the threat of mutually assured destruction provided lasting deterrent today the proliferation of nuclear technology makes the threat of hemp attack more difficult to assess would the leader of rogue state be motivated to use small nuclear arsenal to launch crippling hemp strike against the united states with resulting fatalities if it believed the us likely would not retaliate with nuclear salvo destroying thousands or millions of innocent people would hemp strike over disputed area during regional conflict be seen as way to defeat the communications links and network centric capability of the us military and gain battlefield advantage from an existing supply of smaller nuclear warheads62 terrorists smallerscale hpm weapon requires

that the leadership of some terrorist organizations may increasingly become aware of the growing advantages from an emp attack launched against us critical information systems in addition the use of new weapon directed at us information systems would attract widespread media attention and may motivate other rival groups to follow along new pathway66 human rights hemp and hpm energy weapons primarily damage electronic systems with little or direct effect on humans however these effects may be difficult to limit or control as hemp or hpm energy fields instantly spread outward they may
