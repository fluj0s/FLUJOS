m serafino and martin weissaccording to united states institute of peace report section 1207 was introduced in response to requests from fense secretary donald rumsfe ld and secretary of state condeleezza rice to help jump start the s crs by providing authorization and funding for projects that would involve interagenc coordination this action was taken in recognition of the fact that congress was unabl to pass state department authorization bill that would authorize scrs to conduct comparable program1 and because of the perception that it was easier to obtain funding from congress in the dod bill rather than the state department bill2 conditions section 1207 authority requires that any services defense articles or funds provided or transferred to the secretar of state comply with the authorities and limitations of the foreign assistance act of 1961 the arms export control act or any law making appropriations to ca rry out such act the secretary of defense must notify

transferred total of 995 million to the st ate department for programs in seven countries and regions dod described the projects funded in fy2007 as few small focused activities in various critical

reflecting perceived need to clarify intended purpos and restate the original congressional intention that section 1207 was to be temporary authority in its report accompanying s 3001 s rept 110335

provision by the s ecretary of state of reconstruction security or st abilization assistance to fore ign country sasc further stated such assistance could include providing early civilian resources to avert crisis that could otherwise subsequently require us military forces to assist or intervene6 in its report accompanying hr 5658 hrept 110652 hasc stated that it reaffirms that the resources provided unde r this authority are intended to meet immediate shortterm needs the committee reiterated the concern expressed in the conference report accompanying the original section 1207 legislation hrept 109360 that dod should not provide longterm fundin g in order to enable the department of state to fulfill its statutory requirements this concern according to hrept 110652 applied to both longterm deve lopment programs and to the broader security assistance initiatives that would be better suited for traditional foreign military financing authorities in addition to some members of congress so outside analysts believe that section 1207 activities would be better funded through the state partment dod has never requested that section 1207 be made permanent law althoug h it did as mentioned above request in 2008 that congress extend the authority for five fiscal years while noting the utility of dod section 1207 funding which enable s the us government to meet critical needs and to take advantage of key opportun ities the usip report mentioned above urges that in the future congre ss appropriate such quick r eaction funding to the state department the dod could s till participate in deciding on project proposals but the money would be guaranteed and could be ma available more quickly this would require coordinating the efforts of various congressional committees but it would restore the traditional role of the dos department of state in funding us foreign assistance7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22871 crs5 section 1207 funded projects by country or region fiscal
