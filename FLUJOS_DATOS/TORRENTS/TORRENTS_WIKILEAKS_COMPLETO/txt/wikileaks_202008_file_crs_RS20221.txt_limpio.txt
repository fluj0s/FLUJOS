kosar analyst in american national government government and finance division summary more than 1800 commemorative stamps have been issued since the first in 1893 in recent years they have been marketed to attract noncollectors and children in 2007 the us postal service usps will issue 99 different commemorative stamps in considering subjects for commemorative stamps the usps citizens stamp advisory committee guided by 12 basic criteria reviews and appraises the approximately 50000 proposals submitted for commemoration each year the postmaster general pmg has the exclusive and final authority to determine both subject matter and design number of resolutions are introduced in congress each year urging that consideration be given to particular subject for commemoration but few are passed and the advisory committee accords them special status the commemorative stamp program contributed an estimated 2259 million in retained revenues for the usps in 2005 this report will be updated for each congress the commemorative stamp program postage stamps were introduced in 1847 but for half century the designs were limited to images of presidents and founding fathers1 the first commemorative postage stamps were issued in 1893 to mark the columbian exposition of that year the success of the columbian stamp series prompted the post office department to continue offering stamps to commemorate historic events and places the commemorative stamp became fixture of mail service contributing to civic education and drawing millions into the hobby of philately 1 this report originally was authored by nye stevens who has retired from crs since that time it has been updated by kevin r kosar who may be contacted by readers with questions on postal issues crs2 when usps was established in 1971 with an expectation that it would be self supporting the revenue potential of commemorative issues became more prominent consideration social issues such as conservation employment of the handicapped and higher education were added as commemorative features to the traditional mix of historical and patriotic themes in 1993 usps released the elvis presley stamp which generated unprecedented enthusiasm among postal customers as distinguished from collectors and still holds the record for stamps saved 124 million with face value of 359 million the usps has been criticized by collectors for issuing too many commemorative stamps as well as for producing too many stamps of particular issue concerns have been expressed that too many stamps diminished the value of the stamps to the hobbyist and had the potential to drive collectors away under postmaster general pmg marvin runyon former collector himself it became usps policy to produce and market fewer commemorative stamps however in the effort to expand and appeal to wider range of interests usps in the late 1990s began designing stamps not only to attract non collectors but also children2 this expansion has increased the number of commemorative stamps produced and marketed the number of separate commemorative stamps issued rose from 26 in 1997 to 81 in 1998 to 121 in 2002 in 2007 usps will issue 99 commemorative stamps3 errors and subject selection in commemorative stamps have sometimes generated controversy for example in 1994 postal officials belatedly discovered that stamp featuring wild west star bill pickett depicted the wrong man to prevent such occurrences in the future historian has been hired by the usps to authenticate all chosen stamp designs widelycirculated news story in 2000 pointed out that of 1722 commemorative stamps issued since 1893 only 133 8 featured women or womens issues4 also according to widelyread stamp publication the pmg was stunned by the negative reaction to the stamp issued in honor of frida kahlo in 2001 ms kahlo mexican artist and the wife of diego rivera was also communist and the stamp was strongly criticized by senator jesse helms5 the citizens stamp advisory committee the citizens stamp advisory committee csac was established by the pmg in march 1957 before it was established political influence often determined what stamps were issued6 the committee operates under 39 usc 404a 45 and its primary 2 stamps that may appeal to children include looney tunes peanuts teddy bears and bright eyes grouping of various brighteyed animals and fish 3

continued crs3 purpose is to provide philatelic history and artistic judgment and experience in the selection and design of commemorative stamps the committee consists of 15 members none of whom is postal employee and whose backgrounds reflect wide range of educational artistic historical and professional knowledge members are appointed and serve at the pleasure of the pmg for threeyear staggered terms with member able to serve more than four terms current members include joan mondale actor karl malden graphic designer michael brock and harvard professor henry louis gates jr member may serve more than three terms the pmg appoints one member to serve as chairperson and another member as vice chairperson each serving twoyear terms the committee meets quarterly in washington dc or at the call of the csac chairperson to review the thousands of suggestions that are received by the usps its meetings are not public csac itself employs staff to expedite its work employees of the uspss stamp development group analyze all stamp subject suggestions upon initial receipt subcommittees of staff researchers are formed on special themes such as sports medicine transportation black heritage and performing arts to provide additional background and research occasionally commemorative ideas require considerable research to explore an ideas merit or to devise strong visual appeal all supporting materials are then presented to the committee along with any suggestions while the primary responsibility of the committee is to review and appraise all proposals submitted for commemoration the pmg has the exclusive and final authority to determine both the subject matter and the designs for us postage stamps thus for example although the advisory committee recommended in 2003 that stamp be commissioned for tercentenary of the birth of 18th century theologian jonathan edwards pmg john potter refused to approve the recommendation7 members of congress are often asked by constituents to support particular commemorative theme or event in doing so member may choose to write the pmg expressing support for particular stamp proposal this usually results in referral to the advisory committee it is not uncommon for members to introduce congressional resolutions encouraging the commemoration of specific subject in the 108th congress 28 resolutions for this purpose were introduced in the 109th congress 23 resolutions were introduced however congressional endorsement of proposal accords it special status in the committees deliberations the house committee on oversight and government reform has discouraged members from introducing bills endorsing the issuance of new commemorative stamps for the 110th congress the committees rule 20 reads the committee has adopted the policy that the determination of the subject matter of commemorative stamps is properly for consideration by the postmaster general and that the committee will not give consideration to 6

which can be by letter post card or petition after proposal is determined not to violate the usps criteria each proposed subject is listed on the committees agenda for its next meeting inperson appeals by stamp proponents are not permitted proponents are not advised if subject has been approved until general announcement is made to the public the usps encourages the submission of

to encourage stamp collecting usps maintains philatelic centers in more than 300 population centers in the united states and in 7 foreign countries while it is feasible to track the gross revenues usps gets from the sale of commemorative issues determining how many stamps are saved ie not used for postage is difficult this is because commemorative sales and usage are interchangeable with and not counted separately from other stamps and other forms of postage 9 for discussion of the semipostal stamp program see crs report rs20921 semipostal stamps authorization revenue and selection process by kevin r kosar crs6 in an attempt to gain some knowledge of the contribution its commemorative program makes to its bottom line usps has tried number of approaches to measure the retention rate for commemorative stamps before 1989 clerks collected intent to retain data from customers on six to eight issues per year and projected retention revenues from the responses in the following years usps launched quarterly surveys of representative sample of approximately 60000 households asking them to report the stamps they bought and those they intended to retain this was an expensive approach however in part because 84 of the households reported that they retained stamps and thus analysts could learn little from them about relative appeal of various types of issues in 1999 usps launched what it termed more costeffective design using 10250 quarterly surveys 61 of which were to go to households prescreened by market research company to be stamp retaining households the resulting revenue estimates are still inexact and because of frequent methodological changes cannot be directly compared however there seems to be ample evidence that the commemorative postage stamp program provides net revenues measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars for usps according to usps estimates retention revenues have been as follows year retained revenues 1998 1899 million 1999
