amend section 1322b2 of the bankruptcy code david h carpenter american law division november 19 2008 abstract the recent downturn in the housing market has likely played role in the rise of late mortgage payments and foreclosures occurring across the country some in congress expect it will lead to increased ﬁlings for bankruptcy additionally there are number of obstacles such as legal liability tax regulations and accounting standards that may discourage mortgage servicers and creditors from performing loan modiﬁcations in advance of petition for bankruptcy even in situations in which modiﬁcation would be the most economically beneﬁcial outcome for most interested parties allowing modiﬁcation of debts secured by the debtors primary residence in bankruptcy may encourage the provision of modiﬁcations prior to default or delinquency as result at least six bills seeking to amend section 1322 of the bankruptcy code have been introduced in the 110th congress these bills are hr 3609 the emergency home ownership and mortgage equity protection act which was ordered to be reported favorably by the house judiciary committee s 2133 and hr 3778 the home owners mortgage and

is the worst housing finance environment since the great depression of the 1930s1 as result there has been significant rise of late mortgage payments foreclosures and bankruptcies nationwide2 many believe the market will get worse in the absence of changes in laws andor regulations for instance sheila bair chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation testified before the house committee on financial services on november 18 2008 that over the next two years an estimated 4 to 5 million mortgage loans will enter foreclosure if nothing is done 3 in an attempt to stem the tide of foreclosures and bankruptcies number of voluntary loan modification programs have been initiated4 these programs seek to make mortgage payments more affordable to homeowners who are having or likely will have difficulty meeting their mortgage obligations while also avoiding the costs for both debtors and creditors associated with foreclosure or bankruptcy however there are number of obstacles that have operated to discourage mortgage servicers and creditors from performing loan modifications in advance of foreclosure or petition for bankruptcy even in situations in which modification would be the most economically beneficial outcome for most interested parties these obstacles include potential contract liability tax regulations accounting standards and payment schemes 5 some argue that these voluntary modification programs have not been effective enough in letter sent to speaker of the house nancy pelosi and house minority leader john boehner the attorneys general of 22 states and the district of columbia stated in recent months state attorneys general have especially focused on urging mortgage servicers to avoid unnecessary foreclosures by modifying unaffordable loans in manner that serves holders servicers homeowners and the public through the multistate foreclosure prevention working group we collected data which demonstrates that 1 see eg jon

mortgages are securitized multiple stakeholders may be involved in the decision to modify mortgage loans causing continued paralysis although some major lenders have recently embarked on loan modifications on wide scale many servicers and secondary market investors remain unwilling or unable to act even when their own economic interests dictate otherwise 6 proponents of amending the bankruptcy code beli eve allowing strip down of primary residences would have two important results first it would encourage the voluntary modification of mortgages before default or delinquency that may drive borrowers into bankruptcy second they believe that where voluntary workouts prior to bankruptcy could not be achieved strip down would adjust the mortgage terms such that the costs and benefits are efficiently spread among debtors and creditors while allowing debtors to remain in the home after bankruptcy senator durbin before the senate committee on the judiciary stated as we heard at last years hearing the benefits of this proposal to allow the modification of certain mortgage debts in bankruptcy are clear we heard testimony that my legislation would significantly reduce the number of foreclosures and help hundreds of thousands of families stay in their homes mortgage modification in bankruptcy benefits everyone the homeowner the lender the neighboring homeowners and the economy far more than foreclosure my proposal would give lenders servicers and investors real incentive to voluntarily rework mortgages 7 professor adam levitin at the same senate judiciary committee hearing explained in perfectly functioning market without agency and transaction costs lenders would be engaged in largescale modification of defaulted or distressed mortgage loans as the lenders would prefer smaller loss from modification than larger loss from foreclosure voluntary modification however has not been happening on largescale for variety of reasons most notably contractual impediments agency costs practical impediments and other transaction costs if all distressed mortgages could be modified in bankruptcy it would provide method for bypassing the various contractual agency and other transactional inefficiencies permitting bankruptcy modification would give homeowners the option to force workout of the mortgage subject to the limitations provided by the bankruptcy code moreover the possibility of bankruptcy modification would encourage voluntary modifications as mortgage lenders would prefer to exercise more control over the shape of the modification an involuntary public system of mortgage modification would actually help foster voluntary private solutions to the mortgage crisis allowing bankruptcy to serve as forum for distressed homeowners to restructure their mortgage debts is both the most moderate and the best method for resolving the foreclosure crisis and stabilizing mortgage markets unlike any other proposed response bankruptcy 6

by securitization addresses both problems of payment reset shock and negative equity screens out speculators spreads burdens between borrowers and lenders and avoids both the costs and moral hazard of government bailout 8 others argue that amending the bankruptcy code alone would not promote voluntary modifications outside of bankruptcy because ch legislation would not directly address the litigation tax accounting and payment concerns that are the main deterrent to voluntary modifications9 for instance group of columbia university professors argue that proposals to change the bankruptcy code could dramatically increase bankruptcyfiling rates servicers will prefer mortgage modification in bankruptcy because their expenses are reimbursed in bankruptcy not outside it thus proposed reforms could push millions of borrowers into bankruptcy delaying the resolution of the current crisis for years still others believe allowing modifications of these mortgages in bankruptcy will reduce market stability for instance professor mark s scarberry resident scholar at the american bankruptcy institute believes allowing strip down of primary residence mortgages would cause problems in the secondary mortgage market and would substantially change the risk characteristics of home mortgages 10 additionally david g kittle chairman of the mortgage bankers association has testified one of the greatest potential destabilizing initiatives is the topic of discussion today allowing bankruptcy cramdown for home mortgages we understand the well intentioned goal of such legislation is to provide back stop against the large numbers of foreclosures however the unintended result would be large numbers of bankruptcies higher losses to servicers lenders and investors and reduced ability by the financial industry to extend affordable credit such bankruptcy reform will have negative impact on individual borrowers housing recovery and the economy as whole 11 at least three bills that would amend section 1322 of the us bankruptcy code12 have been introduced in the 111th congress these bills are s 61 and its house companion hr 200 the helping families save their

three bills seek to amend chapter 13 as these bills in some cases deal with matters beyond the scope of this report the analysis of them is limited to proposed effects on when the modification of mortgages secured by the debtors primary residence would be allowed when prepayment penalties on these loans could be waived whether and to what extent repayment of these loans would be allowed

reorganizations for most individuals reorganization generally means that debts are paid from the debtors future income outside of bankruptcy debtors and creditors may attempt to consensually modify the terms of their contractual obligations if the parties attempt to reach voluntary workout outside of bankruptcy the chapter 13 framework may serve as baseline for negotiations with the parties understanding that if they cannot agree the terms may be modified in accordance with the parameters of the code if the debtor files and qualifies13 for bankruptcy when qualified debtor cannot meet outstanding obligations or negotiate revised payments with his or her creditors14 the debtor may file petition for an individual reorganization in most cases debtors must receive credit counseling before filing chapter 13 petition15 under chapter 13 the debtor is required to file proposed reorganization plan with the court16 the proposed chapter 13 plan generally is submitted at the same time as the petition for bankruptcy17 section 1322a states the requirements for all plans section 1322b states additional parameters that plan may meet if applicable if the plan meets the codes requirements including the guidelines 13 for instance 11 usc 109e requires chapter 13 petitioner to have regular income and limited amount of secured and unsecured debt 14 voluntary mortgage modifications were relatively rare prior to 2008 see statement of henry j sommer president of the national association of consumer bankruptcy attorneys the looming foreclosure crisis how to help families save their homes us senate committee on the judiciary dec 5 2007 if cramdown is not permitted for debtors who cannot pay their mortgages debtors and creditors have several other alternatives none of which is more favorable to the mortgage creditor 4 voluntary modification which lenders rarely agree to in which an arrangement similar to cramdown results emphasis added but the truth is that voluntary modifications are not being made in any significant numbers in dramatic example it was recently reported that when state housing finance agencies sought to help borrowers by asking lenders to modify loans so the agencies could then refinance them they had success because lenders would not make the modifications if mortgage companies will not modify loans even when they will receive an immediate payoff through refinancing they certainly will not modify them in cases where they will be paid over long period of time however voluntary modifications are becoming more and more common as the housing market has continued to lag and market participants have devised ways to perform modifications see eg crs report rl34372 the hope now allianceamerican securitization forum asf plan to

section 132518 chapter 13 plan disputes among debtors and creditors are settled by the bankruptcy judge19 the code provides courts some leeway to adjust the value of certain debts for many secured debts the court has strip down also commonly referred to as cram down authority strip down is the power to lower over the creditors objections the amount the debtor must pay the creditor for the secured claim to as low as the collaterals fair market value amounts in excess of fair market value are treated as unsecured debt and may be discharged 20 among the secured debts that the court may not strip down under the current chapter 13 are those that are secured by the debtors principal residence21 section 1322b2 states in relevant part the plan may modify the rights of holders of secured claims other than claim secured only by security interest in real property that is the debtors primary residence other real property liens however are commonly modified in bankruptcy reorganizations as general rule real property lien is only protected as nondischargeable secured debt up to the market value of the collateral indebtedness under mortgage or security interest is treated as unsecured and therefore modifiable or potentially dischargeable to the extent that the amount of indebtedness exceeds the value of the collateral22 the code allows court to modify mortgage secured by the debtors vacation home investment home and family farm23 for instance but by virtue of 1322b2 and parallel provision in chapter 1124 court may not strip down the claim on mortgage secured by the same individuals primary residence even after this provision was enacted by the bankruptcy reform act of 1978 some courts interpreted the code as allowing strip down of primary residences until they were overruled by 1992 us supreme court decision25 hence the codes prohibition on the modification of liens that secure primary residence is arguably the exception not the rule the purpose of the exception at least based on analysis of its legislative history as expressed in concurring supreme court opinion by justice stevens was to encourage the flow of capital into the home lending market26 18 11 usc 1325 provides the standards by which bankruptcy court may confirm reorganization plan 19 11 usc 502 and 1325 20 11 usc 1322b2 to determine the fair market value of collateral for the purpose of exercising its strip down authority the court generally holds hearing during wh ich the parties submit evidence to support value after this hearing the court determines the appropriate fair mark et value and that amount is used to set the reduced debt value which is plugged into the debtors reorganization plan 21 11 usc 1322b2 an exception to this rule is provided for primary residence mortgages in which the final payment under the original terms would be due during the reorganization plan 11 usc 1322c2 see in re paschen 296 f3d 1203 11th cir 2002 while modification generally is not allowed

for ce rtain modifications of debts secured by the debtors primary residence that is the subject of notice that foreclosure may be commenced the foreclosure process varies by state in some states the process can start and finish in matter of days requiring foreclosure notice before debtor may take advantage of the strip down in bankruptcy may limit the laws effectiveness because it could force debtor to file bankruptcy petition within short period of time making the decision to file for bankruptcy may be difficult to do quickly because potential debtors may desire to compare bankruptcy to other options based on the effect reorganization is likely to have on their ability to retain certain property their credit worthiness their future income etc potential debtors may need to discuss their situation with bankruptcy attorney in order to make knowledgeable decision news sources indicate that changes to these two bills are imminent the specifics of the changes are not yet available but according to these sources the bills may be amended to limit mortgage modifications in bankruptcy only to loans entered into prior to the bills enactment in addition debtors would have to certify that they sought contact with their lenderservicer to attempt loan modification prior to filing petition for bankruptcy in order to benefit from the change in law 27 the remainder of the analysis in this report is based on the bills as introduced the report will be updated as new details become available if qualified debtors mortgage meets the above requirements then the debtors chapter 13 reorganization plan may modify the terms of the mortgage debt in several different ways first the secured claim may be stripped down to the fair market value of the property and the remaining balance would be treated as an unsecured claim 28 continued stevenss statement it is unclear whether encouraging capital into the mortgage lending market was the only or even primary legislative purpose of 11 usc 1322b2 the language of 1322b2 was the result of compromise between the house and senate versions of the bankruptcy reform act of 1978 pl 95598 however there was conference report for this bill and crs research of the reco rded legislative history of 1322b2 yielded little to explain the purpose behind the exception for debts secured by the debtors primary residence grubbs s conclusion which was relied upon by justice stevens appeared to be based on witness testimony during hearings on the act which were conducted in the 94 th and 95th congresses some of the more relevant testimony cited was given by edward j kulik during the hearings from the 95th congress mr kulik representing the real estate division of the massachusetts mutual life insurance company expressed concern about provisions of the bills that would allow modification of secured debts he stated these provisions may cause residential mortgage lenders to be extraordinarily cautious in making loans in cases where the general financial resources of the individual borrower are not particularly strong mr kulik contin ued serious consideration should be given to modifying both bills so that at the least mortgage on real property othe r than investment property may not be modified see bankruptcy reform act of 1978 hearings on s 2266and hr 8200 us senate subcommittee of improvements in judicial machinery of the

interest rates29 this provision would address in part mortgages that started w ith relatively low fixed rates but subsequently adjusted to significantly higher variable rate these low initial rates are often referred to as teaser rates borrowers who could meet the payments at the introductory rate may not be able to afford the higher adjusted rate third the plan may allow for payment of the qualifying mortgage debt for 40 years less the number of years the loan has been outstanding or for the remaining payment term whichever is longer30 this provision would not adjust the payment of other debts beyond the normal three to fiveyear term of repayment plans in other words the bills would allow for repayment of modified primary residence debts over 40 or more years but the repayment period of all other debts would not be changed by the bills requiring debtors to pay off potentially large debt like primary residence mortgage in five years or less could be prohibitively difficult and could undermine the effectiveness of the law this provision of s 61 and hr 200 is important because most courts interpret the current code as requiring debtors to pay off the entire secured claim of nonprimary residence mortgages that are modified in accordance with 1322b2 during the three to fiveyear plan 31 fourth plans may provide fixed interest rate based on the prevailing rate as published by the board of governors for the federal reserve system plus reasonable yield for risk32 this provision would allow the reduction of fixed interest rates to levels consistent with current market conditions for comparable mortgages fifth plans may waive prepayment penalties that are provided for in the loan document33 prepayment penalties are intended to cover the mortgage holder for lost interest payments incurred due to early payment these fees were especially common in subprime mortgages finally the bill would allow for the elimination of the codes credit counseling requirement if the debtor certifies to court that foreclosure sale has been scheduled on the debtors principal residence34 this waiver would remove procedural hurdle that could slow the debtors ability to file bankruptcy petition which may be important in light of the streamlined foreclosure process as discussed above 29 s 61 4 and hr 200 4 30 s 61 4 and hr 200 4 31 see eg in re enewally 368 f3d 1165 1172
