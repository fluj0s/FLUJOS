from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to michael mann mannvirginiaedu folland chris ckfollandmetogovuk subject re fw mann etal date fri 11 aug 2000 134030 0100 cc jfbmitchellmetogovukkbriffaueaacuk chris and john and mike for info im basically reiterating mikes email there seem to be two lots of suggestions doing the rounds both are basically groundless 1 recent paleo doesnt show warming this basically stems back to keith briffas paper in nature in 1998 vol 391 pp678682 in this it was shown that northern boreal forest conifers dont pick up all the observed warming since about the late 1950s it was suggested that some other factor or combination of factors related to humaninduced pollution eg nitrogen deposition higher levels of co2 ozone depletion etc hence in new paper submitted to jgr recently we develop new standardization approach called age banding and produce largescale reconstruction calibrated over the period 18811960 against nh land north of 20n back to 1402 if you want copy of this can you email keith and hell send copies once hes back from holiday this background is to illustrate how singer et distort things the new reconstruction only runs to 1960 as did earlier ones based solely on treering density all the other long series mikes tom crowleys and mine include other proxy information ice cores corals historical records sediments and early instrumental records as well as treering width data which are only marginally affected all these series end around 1980 or in the early 1980s we dont have paleo data for much of the last 20 years it would require tremendous effort and resources to update lot of the paleo series because they were collected during the 1970searly 1980s it is possible to add the instrumental series on from about 1980 mike sought of did this in his nature article to say 1998 was the warmest of the millennium and i did something similar in rev geophys but there is way singer can say the proxy data doesnt record the last 20 years of warming as we dont have enough of the proxy series after about 1980 httpwwwco2scienceorgediteditorhtml takes the argument further saying that as trees dont see all the warming since about 1960 the instrumental records recently must be in error ie this group believes the trees and not the instrumental records this piece by idso and idso seems to want to have the argument whichever suits them 2 everyone knows it was cooler during the little ice age and warmer in the medieval warm period all of the millenniallong reconstructions show these features but they are just less pronounced than people believed in the 1960s and 1970s when there was much less paleo data and its spatial extent was limited to the eastern usnatlanticeuropean and far east areas the issue seems to revolve around the average temperatures we have for earlier centuries in the millennium i use the argument that for the instrumental period we need sites located over much of the nh land and marine regions in order to claim we have reasonable record for the whole hemisphere we wouldnt dream of extending the nh series based on longer european records and in the extreme just cet so with the paleo data we need records from as many regions as possible the coverage still could be better but it is far better than it was 25 years ago when the ideas embodied in the mwp and lia became sort of mainstream the typical comments ive heard generally relate to the mwp and say that crops and vines were grown further north than they are now the vines grown in york in viking times etc similarly statements about frost fairs and freezing of the baltic so armies could cross etc frost fairs on the thames in london occurred more readily because the tidal limit was at the old london bridge the 5ft weir under it the bridge was rebuilt around the 1840s and the frost fairs stopped if statements continue to be based on historical accounts they will be easy to knock down with all the usual phrases such as the need for contemporary sources reliable chroniclers and annalists who witnessed the events rather than through hearsay as you all know various people in cru maybe less so now have considerable experience in dealing with this type of data christian pfister also has lifetime of experience of this there is paper coming out from the cru conference with reconstruction of summer and winter temps for holland back to about ad 800 which shows the 20th century warmer than all others evidence is sparser before 1400 but the workers at knmi aryan van engelen et take all this into account i hope this is of use and hasnt been total waste of time in victoria last month did you discuss how the policymakers summary will report the millennial temperature series are there any tentative phrases youre working on balance of evidence etc is chapter 12 thinking of new sentence to supercede the above any sentence on the millennium record should be in ch 2 cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research
