campaign reform act of 2002 bcra1 is the most recently enacted federal law regulating money in the political sphere one of the first such federal campaign finance law dates back to the 1907 tillman act2 which responded to president roosevelts request for legislation prohibiting all corporate political contributions in 1925 with the federal corrupt practices act congress extended the prohibition on corporations making contributions to include anything of value and criminalized both the acceptance of corporate contributions as well as the making of such contributions 3 with the labor management relations act of 1947 congress prohibited labor union contributions in connection with federal elections4 in 1972 congress enacted the federal election campaign act feca5 as first enacted feca required disclosure of contributions and expenditures over certain amount prohibited contributions made in the name of another person and by government contractors and ratified the earlier prohibition on the use of corporate and union general treasury funds for contributions and expenditures but permitted corporations and unions to establish and administer separate segregated funds also known as political action committees or pacs for election related contributions and expenditures citing deficiencies in the 1972 law and responding to watergate congress amended feca in 1974 to include limits on individual pac and party contributions limits on candidate spending and the establishment of the federal election commission fec 6 primarily in response to the supreme court striki ng down the appointment process of the fec in its 1976 seminal decision buckley v valeo7 congress amended feca in 19768 and again in 1979 in an effort to make the law less burdensome to participants and to foster greater grassroots activity9

constitutionality of certain provisions including 1 contribution limits to federal office candidates12 2 disclosure and recordkeeping provisions13 and 3 public financing of presidential elections14 the court found other provisions unconstitutional including 1 expenditures limitations on candidates and their political committees15 2 the 1000 limitation on independent expenditures16 3 expenditure limitations by candidates from their personal funds17 and 4 the method of appointing members to the federal election commission18 in general the court struck down expenditure limitations but upheld reasonable contribution limitations disclosure requirements and public financing provisions so long as participation is voluntary not compelled in considering the constitutionality of these statutes the buckley court applied the standard of review known as exacting scrutiny which is standard applied by court when presented with regulations that burden core first amendment activity exacting scrutiny requires regulation to be struck down unless it is narrowly tailor ed to serve compelling governmental interest g343g495g561g5g152g151g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g7g161g153g142g151g141g146g157g158g155g142g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561 when analyzing first amendment claims court will generally first determine whether the challenged government action implicates speech or associational activity guaranteed by the first amendment notably the buckley court held that the spending of money whether in the form of contributions or expenditures is form of speech protected by the first amendment number of principles contributed to the courts analogy between money and speech first the court found that candidates need to amass sufficient wealth to amplify and effectively disseminate their message to the electorate19 second restricting political contributions and expenditures the court held necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed the depth of the exploration and the size of the audience reached this is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in todays mass society requires the expenditure of money 20 the court then observed that major purpose of the first amendment was to increase the quantity of public expression of political ideas as free and open debate is integral to the operation of the system of government established by our constitution21 from these general principles the court concluded that contributions and expenditures facilitated this interchange of ideas and could not be regulated as mere conduct unrelated to the underlying communicative act of making contribution or expenditure 22

different degrees of first amendment protection23 recognizing contribution limitations as one of fecas primary weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence on candidates by contributors the court found that these limits serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process24 thus the court concluded that the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large financial contributions was sufficient compelling interest to warrant infringements on first amendment liberties to the extent that large contributions are given to secure quid pro quo from candidate 25 short of showing of actual corruption the court found that the appearance of corruption from large campaign contributions also justified these limitations reasonable contribution limits the court remarked leave people free to engage in independent political expression to associate by volunteering their services and to assist candidates by making limited but nonetheless substantial contributions26 further according to the court reasonable contribution limitation does not undermine to any material degree the potential for robust and effective discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual citizens associations the institutional press candidates and political parties finally the court found that the contribution limits of feca were narrowly tailored insofar as the act focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions27 on the other hand the court determined that fecas expenditure limits on individuals political action committees pacs and candidates imposed direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech and were not justified by an overriding governmental interest the court rejected the governments asserted interest in equalizing the relative resources of candidates and in reducing the overall costs of campaigns restrictions on expenditures the court held constitute substantial restraint on the enjoyment of first amendment freedoms 28 as opposed to reasonable limits on contributions which merely limit the expression of persons support of candidate the primary effect of limitations on expenditures is to restrict the quantity of campaign speech by individuals groups and candidates restriction on the amount of money person or group can spend on political communication during campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed the depth of their exploration and the size of the audience reached the court noted 29 the court also found that the governments interests in stemming corruption by limiting expenditures were not compelling enough to override the first amendments protection of free and open debate because unlike contributions the risk of quid pro quo corruption was not present as the flow of money does not directly benefit candidates campaign fund30 upon similar premise the court rejected the governments inte rest in limiting wealthy candidates ability to 23 see id at 24 24 id at 59 25 id at 27 26 id at 28 27 id at 29 28 id at 39 29 id at 19 30 id at 55

upheld fecas disclosure and reporting requirements but noted that they might be found unconstitutional as applied to certain groups while compelled disclosure in itself raises substantial freedom of private association and belief issues the court held that these interests were adequately balanced by the states regulatory interests the state asserted three compelling interests in disclosure 1 providing the electorate with information regarding the distribution of capital between candidates and issues in campaign thereby providing voters with additional evidence upon which to base their vote 2 deterring actual and perceived corruption by exposing the source of large expenditures and 3 providing regulatory agencies with information essential to the election law enforcement however when disclosure requirements expose members or supporters of historically suspect political organizations to physical or economic reprisal then disclosure may fail constitutional scrutiny as applied to particular organization 32

language in buckley prompted analysts to label electionrelated communications as either issue or express advocacy communications in order to pass constitutional muster and not be struck down as unconstitutionally vague the court ruled that feca could only apply to noncandidate expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate for federal office ie expenditures for express advocacy communications 33 in footnote to the buckley opinion the court further defined express words of advocacy of election or defeat as vote for elect support cast your ballot for smith for congress vote against defeat and reject 34 31 id at 5154 32 see national association for the advancement of colored people naacp v alabama 357 us 449

associational rights were abridged by state statute compelling disclosure of its members and agents without regard to their position and responsibilities in the association the organization did not comply with the disclosure requirement finding for the naacp the court held that the freedom of association is an inseparable aspect of the freedoms guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments see id at 46061 that compelled disclosure of the associations membership would effectively restrain that freedom see id at 461463 and that under strict scru tiny the states inte rests in disclosure were insufficient to overcome the associations deprivation of right see id at 463366 the court stressed that the vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in ones associations was

footnote became commonly referred to as issue advocacy communications35 in its rationale for establishing such bright line distinction between issue and express advocacy the court noted that the discussion of issues and candidates as well as the advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application that is according to th court candidates especially incumbents are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions36

landmark decision in buckley various developments persuaded congress that further legislation was necessary to regulate the role of corporations labor unions and wealthy contributors in the electoral process the supreme court in mcconnell v fec outlined changes in three specific areas over the years that led to the enactment of bcra the increased use of party soft money soft money spent on issue advertising and the 1998 senate investigation into the 1996 federal elections 37

to funds that are raised and spent according to the contribution limits source prohib itions and disclosure requirements of feca while the term soft money or nonfederal money is used to describe funds raised and spent outside the federal election regulatory framework but which may have at least an indirect impact on federal elections since feca narrowly defines the term contribution to include only gift of anything of value for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office 38 donations with the purpose of influencing only state nd local elections are unregulated by feca therefore

constitutionality of the system of voluntary presidential election expenditure limitations linked with public financing through voluntary income tax checkoff codified at 26 usc 9001 et seq the court found that restricting taxpayers from being able to earmark their 100 checkoff to candidate or party of the taxpayers choice did not violate the first amendment as the checkoff constituted an appropriation by congress it did not require outright taxpayer approval as every appropriation made by congress uses public money in manner to which some taxpayers object the court also rejected number of fifth amendment due process challenges including challenge contending that the public financing provisions discriminated against minor and new party candidates by favoring major parties through the full public funding of their conventions and general election campaigns and by discriminating against minor and new parties who received only partial public funding under the act id at

soft money to political parties for activities with the intent of influencing state or local elections after the buckley decision was issued questions arose regarding contributions that were intended to influence both federal and state elections as the mcconnell court observed literal reading of fecas definition of contribution would have required such mixedpurpose activities to be funded with hard money39 however in 1977 the fec ruled that political parties could fund mixedpurpose activitiesincluding getoutthevote drives and generic party advertising in part with soft money40 extending its ruling in 1995 the fec ruled that parties could also use soft money to defray the costs of legislative advocacy media advertisements even if the ads mentioned federal candidate so long as they did not expressly advocate election or defeat41 as result of the increase in the permissible uses of soft money the amount of soft money raised and spent by the national political parties increased dramatically from 5 216 million of total party receipts in 1984 to 42 498 million of total party receipts in 2000 the national parties transferred large amounts of their soft money receipts to the state parties which were permitted to use larger percentage of soft money to fund mixedpurpose federal and state election activities42 as the mcconnell court noted many soft money contributions were dramatically larger than the hard money contributions permissible under feca indeed in the 2000 election cycle the parties raised almost 300 million from just 800 donors each of whom contributed minimum of 120000 often such soft money contributions were solicited by the candidates who directed potential donors to party committe and taxexempt organizations that could legally accept soft money after donor had already contributed the hard money maximum to the candidates committee moreover the court recognized that the largest corporate donors often made significant contributions to both parties thereby bolstering the perception that such contributions were made with the purpose of gaining access to elected officials and avoiding being placed at disadvantage in the legislative process rather than being based on ideological support such solicitations transfers and uses of soft money according to the court enabled the parties and candidates to circumvent fecas source restrictions disclosure requirements and contribution limits 43

advocacy federally unregulated soft money could be used to finance such advertisements also known as issue ads the mcconnell court acknowledges that at first blush the distinction between issue and express advocacy appears meaningful however the two categories of advertisements have proven functionally identical in important respects that is both types of ads have been used to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identifi ed candidates even though issue ads steadfastly avoid using the magic words of express advocacy there is little difference the court found between an ad that urged voters to vote against jane doe and one that condemned jane does record on given issue and urged viewers to call jane doe and tell her what you think 45 the conclusion that such ads were designed to influence elections according to the court was confirmed by the fact that nearly all of them were broadcast within 60 days of federal election since such ads could be legally financed with federally unregulated soft money they were attractive to organizations and candidates indeed according to the mcconnell court when the candidates and parties were running out of m oney they would work closely with friendly interest groups to sponsor socalled issue ads 46 moreover the amount of spending on the ads increased significantly in the 1996 election cycle 135 to 150 million was estimated to have been spent on multiple broadcasts of approximately 100 ads as compared with an estimated 500 million spent on more than 1100 different ads in the 2000 cycle as with the case of soft money contributions to the political parties the court concluded that candidates and parties used the availability of issue ads to circumvent fecas limitations soliciting donors who had already contributed their federally permissible hard money quota to donate additional soft money funds to nonprofit corporations to spend on socalled issue ads 47

that the soft money loophole had resulted in meltdown of the federal campaign finance regime that had been designed to keep corporate union and large individual contributions from influencing the

comprehensive campaign finance ruling since buckley v valeo56 in 1976 most notably the mcconnell court upheld by 5 to 4 vote against facial constitutional challenges two critical bcra provisions titles i and ii in the first 119 pages of the 248 page majority opinion coauthored by justices stevens and oconnor and joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer the court upheld the limits on raising and sp ending previously unregulated political party soft money and the prohibition on corporations and labor unions using treasury fundswhich is unregulated soft moneyto finance directly electioneering communications instead bcra requires that such ads may only be paid for with corporate and labor union political action committee pac funds also known as hard or federally regulated money in upholding bcras two principal complementary features the court readily acknowledged that it is under illusion that bcra will be the last congressional statement on the matter of money in politics the court observed money like water will always find an outlet hence campaign finance issues that will inevitably arise and the corresponding legislative responses from congress are concerns for another day 57 the following section of this report provides an analysis of the courts opinion upholding titles i and ii and discussion of the courts ruling with regard to several other bcra

first amendment as well as art i 4 of the us constitution principles of federalism and the equal protection component of the due process clause of the 14th amendment the court upheld the constitutionality of all provisions in title i finding that its provisions satisfy the first amendment test applicable to limits on campaign contributions they are closely drawn to effect the sufficiently important interest of preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption rejecting plaintiffs contention that the bcra restrictions on campaign contributions must be subject to strict scrutiny in evaluating the constitutionality of title i the court applied the less rigorous standard of reviewclosely draw n scrutiny citing its landmark 1976 decision buckley v valeo and its progeny the court noted that it has long subjected restrictions on campaign expenditures to closer scrutiny than limits on contributions in view of the comparatively marginal restriction upon the contributors ability to engage in free communication that contribution limits entail61 the court observed that its treatment of contribution limits is also warranted by the important interests that underlie such restrictions ie preventing both actual corruption threatened by large dollar contributions as well as the erosion of public confidence in the electoral process resulting from the appearance of corruption62 the court determined that the lesser standard shows proper deference to congress ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise63 finally the court recognized that during its lengthy consideration of bcra congress properly relied on its authority to regulate in this area and hence considerations of stare decisis as well as respect for the legislative branch of government provided additional powerful reasons for adhering to the treatment of contribution limits that the court has consistently followed since 197664 responding to plaintiffs argument that many of the provisions in title i restrict not only contributions but also the spending and solicitati on of funds that were raised outside of fecas contribution limits the court determined that it is irrelevant that congress chose to regulate contributions on the demand rather than the supply side indeed the relevant inquiry is whether its mechanism to implement contribution limit or to prevent circumvention of that limit burdens speech in way that direct restriction on contribution would not the court concluded that title i only burdens speech to the extent of contribution limit it merely limits the source and individual amount of donations simply because title i accomplishes its goals by prohibiting the spending of soft money does not render it tantamount to an expenditure limitation 65 in his dissent justice kennedy criticized the majority opinion for ignoring established constitutional bounds and upholding campaign finance statute that does not regulate actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements 66 according to justice kennedy buckley clearly established that campaign finance regulation that restricts speech without requiring

withstand constitutional challenge if it regulates conduct that presents demonstrable quid pro quo danger the mcconnell court however interpreted the anti corruption rationale to allow regulation of not only actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements but also of any conduct that wins goodwill from or influences member of congress justice kennedy further maintained that the standard established in buckley defined undue influence to include the existence of quid pro quo involving an officeholder while the mcconnell court in contrast extended the buckley standard of undue influence to encompass mere access to an officeholder justice kennedy maintained that the court by legally equating mere access to officeholders to actual or apparent corruption of officeholders sweeps away all protections for speech that lie in its path67 unpersuaded by justice kennedys dissenting position that congress regulatory interest is limited to only the prevention of actual or apparent quid pro quo corruption inherent in contributions made to candidate the court found that such crabbed view of corruption and specifically the appearance of corruption ignores precedent common sense and the realities of political fundraising exposed by the record in this litigation68 according to the court equally problematic as classic quid pro quo corruption is the danger that officeholders running for re election will make legislative decisions in accordance with the wishes of large financial contributors instead of deciding issues based on the merits or constituent interests since such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize the court reasoned title i offers the best means of prevention ie identifying and eliminating the temptation 69

regulation of such communications to pass constitutional muster under the first amendment absent express advocacy lower courts have held communication is considered issue advocacy which is protected by the first amendment and therefore may not be regulated73 effectively overturning such lower court rulings the supreme court in mcconnell held that neither the first amendment nor buckley prohibits bcras regulation of electioneering communications even though electioneering communications by definition do not necessarily contain express advocacy the court determined that when the buckley court distinguished between express and issue advocacy it did so as matter of statutory interpretation not constitutional command moreover the court announced that by narrowly reading the feca provisions in buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth it did not suggest that statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be required to toe the same express advocacy line74 the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from true issue ad the court observed75 while title ii prohibits corporations and labor unions from using their general treasury funds for electioneering communications the court observed that they are still free to use separate segregated funds pacs to run such ads therefor the court concluded that it is erroneous to view this provision of bcra as complete ban on expression rather than simply regulation76 further the court found that the regulation is not overbroad because the vast majority of ads that are broadcast within the electioneering communication time period 60 days before general election and 30 days before primary have an electioneering purpose77 the court also rejected plaintiffs assertion that the segregated fund requirement for electioneering communications is underinclusive because it only applies to broadcast advertisements and not print or internet communications congress is permitted the court determined to take one step at time to address the problems it identifies as acute with title ii of bcra the court observed congress chose to address the problem of corporations and unions using soft money to finance virtual torrent of televised electionrelated ads in recent campaigns 78 in his dissent justice kennedy criticized the majority for permitting new and serious intrusion on speech by upholding the prohibition on corporations and unions using general treasury funds to finance electioneering communications finding that this bcra provision silences political speech central to the civic discourse that sustains and informs our democratic processes the dissent further noted that unions and corporations now face severe criminal penalties for broadcasting advocacy messages that refer to clearly identified candidate in an election season 79 73 for further discussion regarding lower court rulings holding that express words of advocacy are the

funds for financing electioneering communications to nonprofit corporations the mcconnell court found that even though the statute does not expressly exempt organizations meeting the criteria established in its 1986 decision in fec v massachusetts citizens for life mcfl80 it is an insufficient reason to invalidate the entire section since mcfl had been established supreme court precedent for many years prior to enactment of bcra the co urt assumed that when congress drafted this section of bcra it was well aware that this provision could not validly apply to mcfltype entities81

the court upheld section 311 of bcra which requires general public political ads that are authorized by candidate clearly indicate that the candidate or the candidates committee approved the communication82 rejecting plaintiffs assertion that this provision is unconstitutional the court found that this provis ion bears sufficient relationship to the important governmental interest of shedding the light of publicity on campaign financing83

by 5 to 4 vote the court invalidated bcras requirement that political parties choose between coordinated and independent expenditures after nominating candidate84 finding that it burdens the right of parties to make unlimited independent expenditures85 specifically section 213 of bcra86 provides that after party nominates candidate for federal office it must choose between two spending options under the firs t option party that makes any independent expenditure is prohibited from making any coordinated expenditure under this section of law under the second option party that makes any coordinated expenditure under this section of lawone that exceeds the ordinary 5000 limitcannot make any independent expenditure with respect to the candidate feca as amended by bcra defines

defeat of clearly identified candidate and that is not made in cooperation with such candidate87 according to the mcconnell court the regulation presented by section 213 of bcra is much more limited than it initially appears party that wants to spend more than 5000 in coordination with its nominee is limited to making only independent expenditures that contain the magic words of express advocacy although the court acknowledges that while the category of burdened speech is relatively small it is nonetheless entitled to protection under the first amendment furthermore the court determined that under section 213 partys exercise of its constitutionally protected right to engage in free speech results in the loss of longstanding valuable statutory benefit hence to pass muster under the first amendment the provision must be supported by meaningful governmental interest and the court announced the interest in requiring parties to avoid the use of magic words does not suffice 88

g11g151g159g138g149g146g141g138g157g142g141g561 by unanimous vote the court invalidated section 318 of bcra which prohibited individuals age 17 or younger from making contributions to candidates and political parties89 determining that minors enjoy first amendment protection and that contribution limits impinge on such rights the court determined that the prohibition is not closely drawn to serve sufficiently important interest 90 in response to the governments assertion that the prohibition protects against corruption by conduitthat is parents donating through their minor children to circumvent contribution limits the court found scant evidence to support the existence of this type of evasion furthermore the court postulated that such circumvention of contribution limits may be deterred by the feca provision prohibiting contributions in the name of another person and the knowing acceptance of contributions made in the name of another person 91 even assuming arguendo that sufficiently important interest could be provided in support of the prohibition the court determined that it is overinclusive according to the court various states have found more tailored approaches to address this issue for example counting contributions by minors toward the total permitted for parent or family unit imposing lower cap on contributions by minors and prohibiting contributions by very young children the court however expressly declined to decide whether any alternatives would pass muster 92

comprehensive overhaul of the federal campaign finance law most notably the supreme court upheld restrictions on the raising and spending of previously unregulated political party soft money and prohibition on corporations and labor unions using treasury funds to finance electioneering communications requiring that such ads may onl be paid for with corporate and labor union political action committee pac funds as some commentators have observed the fact that the court upheld both key provisions of bcra was unexpected and many experts continue to sort out the implications of this complex decision on the regulated community as well as on the courts campaign finance jurisprudence 95

g3g141g159g152g140g138g140g162g561 one important question that has been raised in the wake of mcconnell v fec is whether the line between issue and express advocacy retains any constitutional significance on the one hand some have interpreted mcconnell to mean that the court has rejected the constitutional protection of issue advocacy and the attendant requirement that campaign finance laws can only regulate electionrelated and uncoordinated with any cand idate communications that contain terms of express advocacy96 however recent development appears to revive the issue of whether and under what circumstances issue advocacy can be regulated on january 16 2004 in anderson v spear the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit found that the supreme court in mcconnell v fec left intact the ability of courts to make distinctions between issue and express advocacy w here such distinctions are necessary to cure vagueness and overbreadth in statutes which regulate more speech than that for which the legislature has established significant governmental interest97 reversing district court decision the sixth circuit ruled unconstitutional kentucky statute prohibiting electioneering within 500 feet of polling place the statute defines electioneering to include the displaying of signs the distribution of campaign literature cards or handbills the soliciting of signatures to any petition or the solicitation of votes for or against any candidate or question on the ballot in 93 id 94 2 usc 315a 95 kenneth p doyle bcra supporters meet to assess impact of

this case hobart anderson who filed to run as writein candidate in kentuckys 1999 gubernatorial election challenged the definition of electioneering on the grounds that it would regulate constitutionally protected issue advocacy including the distribution of writein voting instructions in striking down the statute the sixth circuit found that mcconnell v fec in way alters the basic principle that the government may not regulate broader class of speech than is necessary to achieve its significant interest accord ing to the court unlike the record in mcconnell the record in anderson lacks evidence that such broad definition of electioneering is necessary to achieve the states interest in preventing corruption further distinguishing this case from mcconnell the court noted that unlike bcra there is evidence that an express advocacy line would be functionally meaningless as applied to electioneering proximate to voting places 99

notable aspect of the supreme courts ruling in mcconnell v fec is the extent to which the majority of the court deferred to congressional findings and used pragmatic rationale in upholding bcra according to the court the record before it was replete with perceived problems in the campaign finance system circumstances creating the appearance of corruption and congress proposal to address these issues as the court remarked at one point its decision showed proper deference to congress determinat ions in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise 100 furthermore congress is fully entitled the court observed to consider the real world as it determines how best to regulate in the political sphere101
