site an d new evenaged stand of trees is grown clearcutting is the primary method of timber production and management in the national forests however this method of harvesting trees has been controversial since at least th 1960s many enviro nmental and citizen groups object to clearcutting in the national forests citing soil and water degradation unsightly landscapes and other damages the wood products industry argues that clearcutting is an efficient and successfu l silvicultural system between 1984 and 1997 clearcutting accounted for 59 of the area harvested for regeneration in the national forests this excludes salvage thinning and other harvesting not intended to est ablish new stands other evenaged cutting systems which result in areas that appear similar to clearcut areas ccounted for another 28 of the area harvested beca use of the continuing public outcry over clearcutting the chief of the forest service announced on june 4 1992 that the forest service would reduce clearcu tting by 70 from 1988 levels and that this would reduce shortterm harvest volumes by about 10 data show that half of the proposed reduction i n acres clearcut had already been accomplished by 1991 but the total harvest volume declined proportionally because of the economic recession litigation to protec t spotted owls and variety of other factors acres clearcut annually over the past 5 years fy1993fy1997 were 71 less than the fy1988 level fulfilling th promised reduction however average annual harvest s were 66 below the fy1988 level much more than the projected 10 decline the choice of clearcutting or other silv icultural systems depends on number of factors clearcutting is efficient with lower costs for timber harvesting than othe r silvicultural systems and has proven succes sful for regenerating stands of certain tree species on the other hand clearcutting and other evenaged systems often hav greater impacts on soil wa ter and aesthetics and result in different plant and animal communities than do selection harvesting systems foresters argue that clearcutting is legitimate forest silvicultural system under certain circumstances and should be used when and where appropriate for particular species and specific site conditions and on public lands when it also conforms with the pu blics values and goals for those lands interest in clearcutting has increased in the past few congresses several bills have been introduced in the 105 and preceding congresses to ban clearcutting orth all evenaged management systems in the national forests if congress were to enact specific management res trictions such as ban on clearcutting in federal forests the professional flexibility and discretion of federal employees managing the land s entrusted to their stewardship would be reduced substantially if however publi c tolerance continues to be eroded by the use of clearcutting or other evenaged silvi cultural systems wher they are unacceptable to the public and by recurring environ mental damage from clearcutting pressure for congressional intervention will likely increase this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917contents the

hereafter referred to as usda forest service silvicultura l systems the clearcutting controversy clearcutting particularly on federal lands is controversial environmentalists and many other citizens often describe it as harmful and abusive many group s advocate complete ban on c learcutting in federal forests sometimes supporting the use of selection harvesting see defi nitions below as substitute that they consider less abusive to the land and resources other groups would ban all commercia l timber harvesting in federal forests but an analysis of this zerocut option is beyond the scope of this report professional foresters represented by the society f american foresters have stated that clearcutting is an appropriate silvicultural method for regenerating tree species that ar shadeintolerant and the opti mum method to achieve other management objectives although it can have undesirable effects if not used properly2 the woo d products industry defends clearcutting as an efficient and successful system for harvesting and regenerating certain commerciallyva luable tree species and has expressed concerns that restricting or eliminating the use of clearcutting would unnecess arily restrict timber supplies and raise the costs of harvesting and woul d consequently increase timber and wood product prices definition silviculture is defined as the proces s whereby forests are tended harvested and replaced resulting in forest of distinctive form systems are classified according to the method f carrying out the fellings that remove the mature crop with view to regeneration and according to the type of forest thereby produced3 four primary silvicultural systems have traditionally been used to harvest timber and regenerate forests ie for regeneration harvesting in the united states clear cutting seedtree shelterwood and selection harvesting the first three clear cutting seedtree and shelterwood systems are called evenaged management systems because the resulting stands of trees are essentially the same age and often though not ne cessarily about the same size because the results are similar other evenaged systems are often decried as another form of clearcutting the fourth system select ion harvesting is an unevenaged system because the resulting stands contain intermingled trees of many ages and variety of sizes in clearcutting all trees are cleared from site and new evenaged stand of trees is g rown naturally from seeds from the surrounding trees or artificially fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917crs3 timber harvesting where

planted seedlings with the seedtree system the area is nearl y4 cleared but several seed producing trees are left to regenerate the area naturally and the seed trees are remov ed after the seedling stand is established about 5 years after the initial harvest in the shelterwood system trees are removed in two or mor cuts some trees are left for several years to provide eds and to protect the seedlings before being rem oved the selection system removes trees either singly or in small groups over time r egeneration of new trees is continuous these four silvicultural systems for regeneration harvesting are defined further in appendix two additional silvicu ltural techniques are also commonly used intermediate harvesting also called thinning includes an array of harvests between establishin g and regeneration harvesting the stand often to improve the growth or value of th remaining trees sanitation or salvage cutting is used to remove trees that are dead damaged or threatened by insects or disease typically to control the spread of th pest or pathogen and to use the wood before it deteriorates these latter types f5 harvests could clear all or most of site but would not be considered clearcutting or other evenaged regeneration harvesting because the principal purpose is other than establishing new stand of trees concerns about the shortcomings of clearcutting and other traditional silvi cultural methods have led researchers to various alternative approaches initially researchers devel oped new forestry kinder gentler forestry than traditional silviculture research has continued to develop and assess alternative approaches silviculturists are challenged as never before by multiplicity of man agement objectives and by recent scientific insights into forest ecosystems an d landscapes basic pre mises underlying traditional practices have been rendered obsolete the simplistic notion that four regener ation harvest practices designed with the knowle dge and objectives of the 19th century can meet the objectives of the 21st century must be given up in the 21st century silvicultural prescripti ons must be viewed as the working hypotheses that they are rather than as treatmen ts with determinate and predictable ends adoption of the principles of adaptive management are essential hopefully silvicult urists will be leaders in creating the infinite array of silvicultura l prescriptions that will be needed to achieve the complex multiple objectives t abandon the straightjacket of the traditional regeneration harvest systems and to embrace the view that silviculture is the art and science of manipulating fores t stands regardless of objectives6httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917crs4 see for example randal toole reforming the forest service

into 6g3 d and f of nfma these sections of nfma are reproduced in appendix b enactment of nfma did not end the clearcut ting controversy at various times since the forest service has finetuned its clearcutting policy but clearcutting is still widely used for timber harvesting on national forest l ands and many conservation and citizen grou ps continue to object to its use efforts to reserve old

forest ser vice announced new policy of ecosystem management for the national forest system the policy paper directing this new approach states9 this policy would reduce clearcut ting where it has been used as standard timber harvest practice on the national forests clearcutting would be limited to areas where it is essential to meet forest plan objectives and involve one or more of the

r volume over the shortrun is likely to be about 10 percent there would be little reduction in timber volume over the longterm conservation groups and others questioned whether this announcement would actually reduce clearcutting and increase the use of other silvicultural systems be cause the new clearcutting guidelines were similar to those mandated in nfma in 1976 which they assert were never really implemented industry argued that th policy would reduce the amount of timber from national forests by more than th estimated 10 and would increase the cost of timber harvesting national forest

future forest impacts on soil and water and implications for nontimber values existing stand conditions the current stand of trees the distribution of sizes and spec ies the health and quality of the trees and the species composition limit the feasible management options for example trees of poor health or w quality would provide substandard seed source for establishing new stand an d thus clearcutting might be the preferred silvicultural system since it is more efficient for artificial regeneration tree planting similarly stand of mixed species might be an undesirable seed source if the landowner objectives are to maximize timbe r production thus current stand conditions m ay limit the silvicultural options that are feasible since the current stand m ay be unable to provide the

studying the forest ecosystem throug h various stages of development such as before and after clearcutting as with an forestry research results are sitespecific however generalities based on research results can often be extrapolated to other cas and sites regarding the acceptability of the environmental consequences of clearcutting in forest ecosystem scientist s from hubbard brook have stated13 our studies suggest that many similariti exist between redevelopment occurring in clearcut ecosystems and in openin gs in the forest created by naturally occurring tree fall this suggests to us that clearcutting has the potential to work with nature rather than against it and that clearcutting may be considered as an ecologically acceptable pr ocedure in white mountain northern hardwood forests

generation harvest these differences have been described by thomas and radtke16 unevenaged management tends over time to reduce the horizontal diversit of plants and animals in the forest the resulting stands often have high structural vertical diversity because of the intermingling of the different ages and sizes of trees but there is gradual reduction of shadeintolerant trees and understor plants such forests lack the variety of distinct successional stages that ensure diversity and myriad of habitat niches uneven aged management however can be useful wildlife management tech nique it benefits wildlife and plant species adapted to more mature forest ditions and it can be used to preserve the integrity of delicate and dispropor tionately important wildlife habitats such as riparian zones forest under evenaged management usually has low vertical diversity because of the comparative simplicity of the stand structure evenaged systems produce distinct successional stages and high degree of horizontal diversity be cause there are numerous stands of various age scattered through the forest that provide variety of habitats including conditions not available in th more mature forest single system of forest management can be panacea for wildlife manage ment the decision about which system to use must be based on specifi c managemen t goals the forest structure must

years following timber harvesting increased yields are often seen as benefit if water quality is not degraded however since spring snow mel t typically occurs earlier in clearcut areas the increased flow can also add to potential spring flooding and can decrease summer streamflows water quality characteristics most affected by timber harvesting are sedimen t loads dissolved nutrients and water temperature undisturbed forests generall result in low levels of dissolved or suspend ed matter except during floods sediment loads and dissolved nutrients generally increase with the level of disturbance to th forest timber harvesting adjacent to stream channels typically increases sedimen t flows into streams and raises stream temperatures because it removes the streamside vegetation that buf fers the stream buffer strips typically 50100 feet on either side of stream are often suggested to mitigate these effects clearcutting an d other cutting practices however are not the primary cause of erosion or water quality deterioration resulting from timber harvesting operations rather the associated skiddin g hauling logs to loading site and road construction are typically the major sources of soil and water degradation18 felling trees alone seldom causes erosion although some soil compaction an d surface gouging may occur during this operation in contrast road building skidding and stacking logs and some si preparation activities can produce major soil surface disturbance that greatly increases the erosion on site in fact clearcutting may result in less road construction and thus less wate r quality degradatio n than other silvicultural methods clearcutting typically requires fewer roads than other silvicultural systems because cable logging systems can b used to transport the timber from the stump to the loading site with systems using cable skidding however partial cutting ie silvicultural systems other than clear cutting is rarely practical as residual trees are apt to be damaged or destroyed during harvesting clearcutting usually leads to less road maintenance becaus e19 activities occur in one peration other evenaged systems typically require access to the site two or thr ee times while the selection system essentially requires permanent access to all timber stands of course timber harvesting or road constructio n would yield the highest water quality prescribed fires are often used on sites that have been clearcut to remove th combustible fuels from t he area and to prepare the site for reforestation the effects of fire on soil and water depends primarily on the intensity of the fire generally lowintensity fire increases the availability of nutrien ts to plants and generally does not increas soil erosion intense hot fires may completely burn the forest floor expose mineral soil and accelerate soil erosion in steep terrain however pre 20 scribed fires conducted under proper weather and fuel conditions can avoid most of the

because it is more efficien t than other methods bo th in harvesting timber and in regenerating stands efficiency is importa nt because harvesting timber crops is usually the most expensive opera tion conducted in the forest efficiency is typically measured as expenditure pe r24 unit of output eg per million board feet of timber cut this often excludes th nonfinancial cost of environmental damages discussed above however and thu s incompletely accounts for economic impacts nonetheless cost efficiency th financial element is one consideration in selecting silvicultural system clearcutting is more efficient than other silvicultural sys tems for harvesting trees because it yields greater volume of wood from one site and in one operation and thus the average unit cost is lower than under other silvicultural systems selection systems are particularly expensive because the variety of tree species and sizes i n unevenaged stands requires greater variety of treatments25 one disadvantage that limits the use of the selection system is the complexity of all operations conducted in the intermingled mixtures of different age th difficulty and expense of harvesting operations i s usually greater than in evenaged stands as noted above clearcuttin g can have additional advantages in areas with steep terrain because it typically requires fewer roads and road construction and main tenance are expensive as well as environmentally damaging operations clearcutting c an also be more efficient for regenerating timber stands cleared sites reduce the cost of site preparation because there is need to avoid damaging residual trees furthermore artificial regeneration planting seedlings is sometimes preferable to natural regeneration26 the significant advantages of planting are close control over the arrange ment composition and genetic qualit ies of new stands b shortening of period of establishment c avoidance of dangers to which seed and new seedlings ar exposed in the field and d freedom from restrictions on harvesting techniques planting if properly done creates stands that can be treated more efficiently and yield greater volumes and v alues than naturally regenerated stands

reforestation requirement may increase the emphasis on and incidence of clearcutting because clearcutting increases th assurance of adequate reforestation within 5 years other landown er objectives harvesting techniques selected for public and private forests are linked to all the landowners goals for the lands being managed and those lands may hav variety of objectives the objectives may depend in part upon whether the land is publicly owned or is in private ownership owned by an individual such as farmer or by corporation wood products company may have timber production as the primary objective for its forestlands and thus financial conside rations may be paramount farmer may plant trees as windbreak or t protect soil from erosion and then decide to harvest the trees to put the land bac k into crop production or to generate cash sometimes an individual owning small tract of forestland may decide to manage the land primarily for camping ando r hunting and may choose to harvest certain trees that would enhance particularl beautiful view or increase habitat for certain game species increasingly privat lands are being leased for hunting leading to potential landowner profits from timber harvesting that benefits game species many public forestlands include some timber harvesting multitude of law s govern which federal forestlands are available for timber harvesting for example some land has been designated by congress as wilderness where timber harvesting is prohibited sec tion 6k of nfma requires the agency to designate lands that are not suited for timber production considering physical economic and other per tinent factors and as noted earlier national forest lands and resources are managed for variety of purposes under the multipleuse sustainedyield act of 1960 harvesting level and other silvicultural decisions for the national forests ar determin ed in land and resource management plans developed for each forest planning process mandated by nfma because the national forests are essentiall owned by the public nfma requires the forest service to involve the public in the planning process to enable the forest service to understand the values and goals the public envisions for those forests these objectives differ for various tracts of land with some areas managed for more than one resource and objective at the same time objectives can include producing andor protecting water timber minerals an d forage wildlife fisheries and other animal habit at biological diversity recreation and aesthetics wilderness research and other resources and values public opinion about how federal lands should be mana ged change over time and have become greater influence in selecting silvicultural systems in recent years public attitudes especially with regard to clearcutting have become factor that can longer be ignored by the land manager the selection of silvicultural system is guided by what people think t hey want as well as by what is biologically possible technically feasible and economically realistic27httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917crs15 continued27 silvicultural systems the scien tific basis for silvicultural and management

silvicultural system many of the concerns over clearcutting result because the damages caused b abuses of clearcutting are more apparent than are the damages caused by misuse of other regeneration harvesting systems study on the use of clearcutting in main describes these concerns thoroughly although written about clearcutting in maine many of the sentim ents discussed in this report also explain views about clearcutting throughout the united states it is reaction against abusive overused clearcutting and intensive industrial monoculture of trees it is based on the belief that most nontimber values f forests are best fostered by eliminating clearcutting from consideration29 abuses of clearcutting are highly visible while abuses of other cutting methods are not logging selection cu t on wet soil with poor skidtrail layout can result in as much erosion as clearcu tting mishandled selection cutting over several rotations can undermine stand productivity and eliminate desirable species managin g without clearcutting and cutting the same total vo lume means that more acres must be logged to obtain given harvest volume and m ore roads constructed selection cuttings when poorly managed often lead to root and stem damage that can sap future productivity30 shoddy exploitive clearcutting is clearly one of the more destructive fores t managem ent practices it is not forestry and it is certainly not lan dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917crs16 ibid part 1 pp 353631 ibid part 1 p 3632stewardship clearcutting in these cases is simply cheap logging and not planned silvicultural practice31 clearcutting is financially efficient silvicultural method for harvesting timbe r and regene rating stands as described above the environmental effects of clear cutting are generally worse than under other silvicultural systems if properl planned and administered silvicultural treatments under clearcutting or othe r systems can only be judged by how well they are applied on the ground however such monitoring has not been performed at level to determine the quality of timber harvesting efforts planned supervised clearcut ting has an important role to play in modern forestry when due regard is given to the specific conditions clearcutting contribute s to forest management objectives without significant environmental damage t meet this test however cutting must be carefully planned and coordinated wit h other resource values but to say that clearcutting properly applied has role is to beg majo r question that question for land stewardship as well as for public policy is how many clearcutting operations actually are properly done the answer unfortunately is not known in any statistical sense for clearcutting or for it s alternatives32 much of the public outcry against clearcutting and demand for reducing its use in the national forests has its basis in section 6g3fi of nfma which directs the use of clearcutting only where it is determined to be the optimum method to meet the objectiv and requirements of the relevant land management plan when written these guidelines were thought to have been specific enough to prevent th overuse and abuse of clearcutting while still allowing the agency the flexibility t choose when and where to clearcut despite such direction the use of clearcutting in the national forests s apparently not declined as much as many believe it should given the agencys history many do not believe t he forest service can or should be trusted to comply with public desires and congressional guidelines for the proper use of clearcutting and seek to ban clearcutting from use on the national forests in citing apparent continued abuses and implying t hat clearcutting is not the optimum method for achieving objectives and has not always been properly planned an d implemented t hey argue that the forest service should not be allowed to use this useful but potentially abusive silvicultural tool however ban on clearc utting would not necessarily stop abusive and harmful land manageme nt practices as stated above many of the problems associated with clearcutting result from its implementation on t he ground clearcutting may have been an appropriate silv icultural choice for the species the setting and the site to achieve the stated goals but the sale and road layout and design were inconsistent with the goals or were applied without enough environmental safeguards similarly clearcutting may be publicly acceptable in one area but not another such potentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917crs17 conflicts can happen not only with clearcutting but with any silvicultural method selection harvesting was used widely in the early development of american fores t resources and led to much highgrading of the forests harvesting the desired high quality timber while leaving the less desira ble species and unmerchantable trees as the source for natural regeneration as result the character of many forestlands especiall federal forests in the east now differs substantially from presettlemen t conditions also more roads are typically required for selection harvesting systems than for clearc utting and since road building is often the major cause of soil erosion and stream siltation associat ed with timber harvests substituting selection harvesting for clearcutting potentially could cause more environmental degradation the issue is how to assure that the choice of silvicultural system and th implementation of the m anagement practices will achieve the stated goals for federal land and resource management congress enact ing specific management restrictions such as ban on clearcutting on national forests would remove much of the flexi bility and discretion of agency employees in managing the lands entrusted to thei r stewardship however if public trust continues to be eroded by persistent use f clearcutting when and where the public objects and by continued environmenta l damage from clearcutting pressure

definitions of silvicultural systems the following definitions d escribe the four primary silvicultural systems used to harvest timber and regenerate forests in the united states clearcutting seedtree shelterwood and selection rvesting the first three clearcutting seedtree and shelterwood systems are evenaged man agement systems which result in stands of trees that are essentially the same age and often but not necessarily the same size the fourth system selection har vesting is an unevenaged management system resulting in stands with intermingl ed trees of many ages and variety of sizes these definitions are taken from the usda forest service publi cation silvicultural systems for the major forest types of the united states agriculture handbook 44 5 dec 198333 the clearcutting system clearcutting is the harvesting in one cut of all trees on an area for the purpose of creating new evenaged stand regeneration is obtained through natura l seeding through sprouting of trees that were in or under the cut stand or throug h planting or direct seeding this system requires careful location of boundaries to fit the landscape and appropriate cleanup of debris to improve the appearance of th harvested area the absence of reserved trees on the clearcut area facilitates sit preparation and other areawide cultural treatments the seedtree system the seedtree system involves harvesting nearly all the timber on the selected area in one cut few of the better trees of the desired species are left well distri buted over the area to reseed naturally when feasible the seed trees are harvested after regeneration is established this system applies mainly to conifers the shelterwood system in the shelterwood system the mature stand is remov ed in series of cuts over relatively few years regeneration of the new stand occurs under the cover of partial canopy or shelterwood final harvest cut removes the shelterwood an d permits the new stand to develop in the open as an evenaged stand this syste m provides co ntinuing cover of either large or small trees it is especially adapted to species or sites where shelter is needed for the new reproduction or where th shelterwood gives the desired regeneration an advantage over undesired competing vegetationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917crs20 the selection system the selection system involve s the removal of mature and immature trees either singly or in groups at intervals regeneration is tablished almost continuously the objective is maintenance of an unevenaged stand with trees of different ages or sizes intermingled singly or in groups when properly applied the system is estheticall pleasing but is difficult to apply successfully in most forest types the two types of selection are individual tree selection and group selection individual single tree selection involves the removal of individual tree s rather than grou ps of trees in mixed stands it leads to an increase in the proportion of shadetolerant species in the forest group selection can be used to maintain higher proportion of less shad tolerant species in mixture than individual tree selection for this purpose large r groups are more eff ective than smaller ones in eastern timber types groups frac tion of an acre in size are generally suitable in some western timber types where the stands are open or the trees are very tall the groups may be as large as an acre r two when groups are of maximum size they resemble small clearcut patches the group selection is distinguished fr om clearcutting in that the intent of group selection is ultimat ely to create balance of age or size classes in intimate mixture or in mosaic of small contiguous groups throughout the foresthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98917crs21 appendix b national forest management act of
