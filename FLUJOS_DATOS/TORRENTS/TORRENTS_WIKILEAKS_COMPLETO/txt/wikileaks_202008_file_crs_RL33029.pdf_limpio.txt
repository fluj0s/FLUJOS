oversight committees in the 109th congress have held joint hearings on the republic of the marshall islands rmi changed ci rcumstances petition which requests 522 million in additional compensati on for lossofuse of enewetak and bikini atolls due to us nuclear testin g the 522 million appears to be significantly overstated because the methodology sample rent data assump tions and statistical procedures ie the sampling technique and the use of the exponential regression model overestimates the peracre rental rate for land on enewetak and bikini the key variable in the lossofuse calculation rents on enewetak and bikini are overestimated because an exponential regression model was applied to rents established not in competitive free market for agricultural land on enewetak and bikini but rather to governmentestablished and predominantly commercia l rents on the more urbanized and densely populated majuro and kwajalein atolls most land in the rmi is leased at the official government rate established by the rmi cabinet this rate which was set by the rmi at 2500acre on january 1 1979 and increased to 3000acre on october 1 1989 serves as the benchmark for all lease transactions the rmi government is not only the tenant in over 40 of the leases major source of the demand for rmi land but rmi government officials were also effectively the landlords during the estimation period when rents were governmentcontrolled applying this methodology to unrepresentativ sample rent data leads to projected rentacre of 112995acre for the year 2027 which is equiva lent to land asset value of nearly 1774024acre the nuclear claims tribuna ls nct methodology also assumes that vaporized islands were not vaporized undervalues the rentals on alternative atoll habitation and assumes that 100 of the rental proceed s would have been saved the ncts estimated average rentacre eg 4105acre in 1996 also appears overstated when compared to aver age agricultural rents in the united states for similar periods 1750acre in mont ana 115acre in oregon 210acre in california 88acre in new mexico 1995 figures and 6650acre for the united states generally 1998 figures using an alternative economic methodology and applying it to rmis national income and product accounts data the congressional research service crs has developed alternative estimates of agricultural land rents for enewetak and bikini for the peri od 19821990 which are more consistent with the underlying real rental value of the two atolls and the rmi economy as well as with agricultural rents observed in the united states and in regions in the pacific crs estimated rentacre at 115acre for the year1982 rising to 258acre for 1990 as compared with the ncts estimates of 1902 for 1982 rising to 2939 for 1990 based on these

testing in the marshall islands analysis of the nuclear claims tribunals methodology and alternative estimates introduction and background the republic of the marshall islands rmi is an archipelago of approximately 1200 islets in 28 atolls and 5 separate islands ll coral located in the southwestern pacific about 2100 miles southwest of hawaii and 1700 miles northeast of new guinea between 160o 175o longitude and 4o 12o n latitude after evacuating the inhabitants between june 30 1946 nd august 18 1958 ie over period consisting of 4432 days the us govern ment conducted an in tensive program of nuclear testing on bikini and enewetak two remote northwesterly atolls in the rmi sixtysix underwater surface and atmo spheric nuclear tests atomic and thermonuclear were conducted on these two atolls which were considered to be ideal locations for such testing th total yield of these weapons was 108000 kilotons the equivalent of more than 7200 hiroshima bombs an average of over 16 hiroshimaequivalent bombs da ily during the testing period damage from us nuclear testing us nuclear testing on the marshall islands inflicted significant damage to property lands vegetation lagoons and surrounding ecosystems as well as to peoples health twentythree nuclear vices were detonated on bikini atoll1 the hydrogen bomb dropped on february 28 1954 as part of the bravo test which had the explosive power of 15000 kilotons the force equivalent of 1000 hiroshima type bombs was the most powerful nucl ear weapon ever tested by the united states2 it completely vaporized five of the atolls northern islands total of about 68 acres of land or 4 of the pretest nds the underwater baker test of july 24 1946 left 500000 tons of radioactive mud in the atolls lagoon bikinis southern islands were mostly covered by concrete and asphalt for the nuclear testing facilities bikini atoll was so devastat ed nearly all of the atoll s vegetation was destroyed and the islands sufficiently contaminated as to render them all uninhabitable through at least the year 20273 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs2 3 continued ncts memorandum of decisions and order for bi kini the date of safe

bravo test see statement of jonathan m weisgall on behalf of the peoples of bikini enewetak rongelap and utrok before the house resources committee may 25 2005 6 gary lee postwar pacific fallout wider than thought washington post february 24 1994on the enewetak atoll 43 aboveground nuclear devices ranging in size from 18 kilotons to 10400 kilotons were ex ploded from april 14 1948 to october 18 1958 the tests on enewetak atoll pulverized four islands about 10 of the land nearly 200 acres and rendered about 60 of the remainder about 1120 acres uninhabitable at least through the year 2026 the mike testof 1952 vaporized the islet of elugelap and left crater in the atolls reef 200 feet deep and 1 mile in diameter the northern half of the enewetak atoll remains seriously contaminated by plutonium radiation limiting habitation to the southern half of the atoll the island of runit contains 110000 cubic yards of ra dioactive contaminants eg plutonium 239 and remains radioactiv waste site the atolls s outhern islands were mostly covered by concrete to support the weapons infrastructure so that nearly all of the vegetation there was destroyed also4 in addition to rendering all of bikini and most of enewetak atolls dangerously irradiated and uninhabitable radioactive fallout from nuc lear testing on bikini and enewetak accidentally spread to other popul ated areas of the rmi fallout from the 1954 bravo test on bikini for example unexpectedly fell on total of 253 residents of the rongelap 86 people nd utrik atolls 167 people 95 miles and 255 miles east of bikini respectively5 some experts argue that the nuclear tests on bikini and enewetak caused high incidences of birth defects miscarriage and weakened immune systems and caused high rate s of thyroid cervical and breast cancer throughout the marshall islands they cont end that more than dozen marshall islands atolls rather than only four were seriously affected6 other analysts counter that the extent of radioactive fallout was limited to the four northern atolls and that rmi experts overestimate the link between radiogenic illnesses in the marshall islands and the nuclear tests us government compensation the us government has accepted respons ibility for the injuries to the people of bikini and enewetak and to other affect ed marshall island atolls as well as the damage to their land lagoons and surroundi ng ecosystem it has provided financial and program assistance services access to benefits in the united states and trade and other economic incentives and every recent

differe nt groups of litigants representing approximately 5000 inhabitant s of the marshall islands inhabitants of enewetak bikini rongelap and utrik brought class action cases in the united states court of claims against the united states to recover damages said to result from nuclear weapons testing10 these lawsuits were dismisse d because in 1986 an agreement called the compact of free association the compact of free association act of 1985 pl 99239 was reached between the marshall islands and the united states this agreement inter alia provided for an alternativ compensation system 150 million nuclear claims fund ncf funded by the united states the agreement also established nuclear claims tribunal nct to disburse money for nuclear test related compensation from the fund the ncf was to be the fina l and full settlement of all claims past and future arising out of the nuclear testing program the rmi also agreed to espouse and dismiss any and all pr ivate damage claims that had been filed against the us government in the claims court11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs4 12 additional claims are pending for rongelap and utrik the other 2 northwesterly atolls indirectly affected by nuclear testing on enewetak and bikini these damages include personal injury remediation and hardship but not lossofuse since the inhabitants of the two atolls were not evacuated except

written by the new zealand real estate consulting firm of darroch limited for the defender of the fund that repor t used the same methodology as in the nct report but made fewer unrealistic assumptions th hallstrom estimates of past lost use are 60 greater than the darroch report estimates for future lost use the hallstrom report estimates are nearly 200 greater than the darroch report estimates since the nct did not use these estimates but used the estimates of the hallstrom group to award damages instead this second report is not discussed 15 nuclear testing occurred on enewetak

circumstances petition in september 2000 with the u s c ongress requesting 3300 million in additional nuclear testing compensation12 the 3300 million judgment includes unpaid property damages awards for enewetak and bikini totaling 949 million of which 522 million is for the lost use of property 278 000000 for bikini and 244000000 for enewetak from the date of evacuation in the 1940s to the date of return which is projected to be in 2026 for enewetak and 2027 for bikini this is above and beyond amounts already paid fo r lossofuse which through the year 2000 the nct has estimated to be bout 129 million the remaining 427 million 949 million less 522 million is for the rema ining property damages hardships soil remediation nd land restoration the methodology used to estimate th 522 million damages for lossofuse of property which is the same for both the ewetak and bikini cl aims was developed by consulting firm real estate appr aisal firm under cont ract for the nct as well as for counsel for claimants13 alternative methodol ogies were explored or used and the nct provided many of the estimation parameters and assumptions14 the resulting estimates of the dollar value of lossofuse were adjusted and awardedby the nct as damages or reparations to the enewetak and bikini people who are claimants in class action suit against the us government 15 the adjusted estimates are

on resources and the subcommittee on asia and the pacific of the house committee on international relations held joint hearing on the changed circumstances petition the senate committee on energy and natural resources held hearing on july 19 2005 purpose of the report this report examines the nct lossofuse methodology it is more detailed version of the lossofuse discussi on incorporated into crs report rl32811 republic of the marshall islands change d circumstances petition to congress16 it supplements that discussion by 1 comp aring the nct estimates of land rents for enewetak and bikini with land rents in selected areas in the united states eg california oregon montana and new mexico and around the world and 2 developing an economic model of agricultu ral land rents which is then used to generate alternative estimates of land rents which are also compared with the nct estimates the next section describes the ncts methodology in detail including each of the steps that the appraisers took in estimating lossofuse the mathematical formulas used in the calculations which ar crs derivations base d on the appraisers reports appear in technical appendices and b the third section analyzes the methodology and explains why the ncts methodology leads to significantly inflated rents and consequently an overstatement of lossof use estimates the fourth section presents empirical evidence facts comparisons and additional arguments that support the main conclusion that the nct s lossofuse estimates are significantly overstated the fifth section applies st andard neoclassical economic theory to develop model of agricultural rents which is applied to available data from rmis national income and product accounts to gene rate alternative timates of average rentsacre for the total lossofuse rentals for the enewetak and bikini atolls this report discusses only the methodolog as it relates to estimating damages for lossofuse of property the methodolog applied to estimate land reclamation or remediation costs and hardship cost s the other two components of property damages or personal injury damages are not addressed here finally the report is not

prejudgement interest of 278000000 the total awards to both peoples sum to 522000000 as shown in table 1 lossofuse includes not only the period when the united states tested the nuclear bombs roughly the period from 1946 to 1958 but the period during which the islands have been and will continue to be unsafe due to dangerous levels of radiation contamina tion roughly the period from 1958 to 202717 more specifically the estimated lossofuse is the sum of two components past or retrospective lossofuse which is the pr esent value of rents that should have been paid from the time of evacuation of the 312 residents 145 resident s of enewetak and 167 residents of bikini to the date of the nct reports publica tion and future or prospective lossofuse which is the present value of estimated rents from the reports publication dates to that estimated date in the future as described below when the lands are sufficiently decontaminated and usable as to permit the return of rmi citizens in addition as part of th past lossofuse estimates the nct also awarded what it called prejudgment interest which is the interest income earned on the original judgments from the time they were determined to the time they were awarded description of past lossofuse methodology for enewetak past lossofuse consists of the estimated re nts on the entire atoll 19526 acres from the time the entire enewetak population of 145 people was evacuated december 21 1947 to their date of return on october 1 1980 however when the enewetak people were allowed to retu rn on october 1 1980 they were allowed to safely use only 64682 acres of the atoll 130578 acres continued to be off limits due to dangerous levels of radio active contamination thus pa st lossofuse includes the estimated rents on this 130578 acres from october 1 1980 to may 16 1996 which is the date of the hallstrom groups appraisal report for bikini past lossofuse is the estimated rental value of all the atoll 188936 acres from march 7 1946 which is when the entire bikinian population of 167 people was evacuated to november 18 1997 when the bikini ppraisal report is dated the methodology assumes that the lossofuse was continuous and uninterr upted that the islanders never returned to the atoll18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs7 18 continued bikinians in 1985 and 1989 respectively the appraisal reports assume based on

property awards for other property damages remediation costs and hardship and for personal injury bring the total damages to 3300 million more specifically the methodology used in the two appraisal reports for estimating the value of past lost use i nvolves each of the following eight steps step 1 estimate annual rentals per acre the first step was to estimate the imputed annual rentals per acre of land th at the islanders were unable to use this is imputed because it represents what the land would hypothetically have rented for if the residents had been able to lease that land there were actual or explicit rentals or land sales durin g the estimation period the estimate is based on public records of 174 transactions of actual leas primarily from the majuro and kwajalein atolls19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs8 19 continued is 354 miles from enewetak bikini is approximately 440 miles from majuro and 217 miles from kwajalein 20 the public records were documents from the majuro court house nd the rmis attorney generals office 21 regression analysis is statistical technique that links cause and effect between variables that are functionally related as determined by theoretical analysis and whose covariations are related in some significant way either nega tively or positively it is used to test theories about the importance of variables suggested by theories in making predictions as well as in policy analysis in this application the re gression model hypothesizes that rents per acre increase over time are function only of time at an exponential rate with the rate of increase per year determined by the results of the model estimation the available raw rent data are first converted to 5year moving average and the regression of this average is estimated as function of the time variable 22 in the case of enewetak there are some differences in the acreage of lost use assumed in the appraisal report and those that appear in the ncts memorandum of decision and order crs reports only the former as they are the values assumed in the estimation proceduresthe records spanned period of 50 ears from 1944 to 1996 but there was only one lease transaction in 1947 none from 1948 to 1964 and one in 196520 between 1965 and 1996 the number of lease transactions in the majuro and kwajalein atolls increases but there are still missing observations for some years this problem is addressed by first taking fiveyear moving average to fill in the missing years in effect fabricating rents for those missi ng years and estimating two regression models on the resulting data the average of the fitted or predicted values calculated from each of these two regressi on equations was used as the estimated rents on the affected atolls21 the first model model used the fitted or predicted values of the regression throughout th forecast period 19471996 the second model model b used the fitted values from the regression for the period 19471978 and the official rents set by the govern ment for the period 197919 96 the official government rental rates per acre were 2500acre for the years 19791989 and 3000acre for the years 19901997 step 2 determine the quantity of land and the period of denied use having estimated average rents per acre for each of the lossofuse years the next step was to determine how much of their atolls the ownersinhabitants were prevented from using ie the quantity of acreage lost to use and the corresponding period of lost use the latter included both temporary loss temporary because of the return of the inhabitants and their desce ndants and permanent loss due to complete destruction of the some parts of the atolls as discussed the period of lost use has two components past loss and future loss22 the assumed values for these variables are in table 2 note that the vaporized or pulverized portions of the atolls islands 20162 acres in the case of enewetak and 6967 acres in the case of bikini were included in the acreage of denied use which means the estimates assume that the acreage was not vaporized the vaporized portions continue to genera rents for the lossofuse estimates both in the past and into the fu ture even though return to these portionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs9 23 bikinis land area differs in the two appr aisal reports the hallstrom report assumed the total acreage is 188963 the darroch report assumed it is 184834 one survey reported 1438 acres the nct used the highest figures and assumes that there was vaporization see hallstrom group inc and darroch lmt op cit 24 crs was unable to determine ejit islands land area 25 this adjustment is more difficult for bikini because of the relocation to four different atolls rongerik kili kwajalein and ejit for di fferent time periods on per acre basis the stay on rongerik and ejit is valued at 100 of the enewetak rents but this was for slightly more than 2 years from mar 7 1946 to mar 14 1948 for rongerik and from sept 1 1978 to nov 2027is possible23 more appropriate pproach as discussed ter would compensate landowners for the value of the vaporized portions at the time of vaporization plus interest step 3 compute total rental value for each year the total annual rental for all the lost land is the produc t of the estimated average rentsacre for each year from step 1 and the affected acreage for that year from st ep 2 for enewetak this begins in 1947 and runs through the 50year period through 1996 for bikini this begins in 1946 and runs for 52 years thr ough 1997 each of these annual rentals is the

for the lost use of bikini has already been paid through 2000 total of 1289 million has ready been paid for lossofuse according to the nct beginning in 1987 these amounts represent allocations for

estimated annua l rents over this time period more specifically for enewetak future lossofuse is the value of projected foregone rental income on the 110416 acres from the period from may 17 1996 to may 16 2026 which is the date that the 110416 acres of the enewetak atoll are to be sufficiently decontaminated to permit its safe use for bikini future lossofuse is from november 19 1997 to november

estimation procedure the formulas for this computation appear in technical appendix b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs14 30 obviously the whole question of compensation from legal perspective hinges on whether the lost use of the atolls was coerce d or whether it was part of voluntary and legally binding written contract or agreement it is crss understanding that there was only an oral agreement between the us military governor of the marshall islands and the residentproprietors to evacuate for bri ef though unspecified period due to nuclear testing and to provide alternative habitation the military governor gave the impression based on this oral agreement that the reside ntproprietors would be able to return soon after the brief testing period ended as noted in the text however the residentsproprietors of the bikini atoll have been forbidden to return except for brief period due to continued nuclear contamination and the residents of enewetak were allowed to return to only portion 33 of the nd whether the oral agreement constitutes legally binding and enforceable contract is gal issue beyond the scope of this report see guyer ruth levy radioactivity and rights clashes at bikini atoll the american journal of public health sept 2001 vol 91 pp 13711377 31 in this context the economic concept of rent is similar to the popular notion of rent the price one pays for the right to use an asset ch as house or car for specified period of time 32 third type of arrangement common in more sophisticated developed capitalistic economies is the sale leaseback arrangement under this type of exchange the original continuedassessment of the methodology the lossofuse concept the ncts lossofuse methodology is based on sound economic concepts 1 that the uncompensated lossofuse of an asset that has economic value should be compensated and 2 that compensation shoul d be based on the rental value of that asset as established by the marketplace30 individuals receive stream or flow of benefits or income from an asset over time in market economy the value of thos streams of income are measured by the assets rental further since individuals may also purchase rather than simply use or rent an asset the rental value of an asset is at least in theory also equal to the present discounted value of th projected stream of future net rental payments the value of the streams of net income or bene fits earned over the expected life of the asset31 in the case of land or other real estate the marketdetermined price of land would be computed as and in fact would tend to equal the present discounted rental values of that land the fair market va lue of the annual rent s that willing tenant would pay willing landlord in an armslength transaction over the life of the asset in perpetuity in the case of land thus in theory had the enewetak nd bikini economies operated on market based system with private property rights and competitive real estate market with many potential landowners and lessees these competitively determined explicit rents would have been what the us government would have paid and what the islanders would have charged with competitive rental market the people of enewetak and bikini as landlords could have leased th land to tenantopera tors who would have paid rents to the landlord ove r an agreed upon period of time32 if the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs15 32 continued owner of an asset typically nontaxable entity sells the asset to taxable entity who then leases it back to the original owner this ty pe of deal is frequently taxmotivated one it is undertaken to take advantage of tax brea ks that would otherwise be lost to the non taxable entitity 33 in theory there is an equivalency between th rentals either explicit or implicit and the asset value value is equal to the present di scounted value of the future projected stream of returns or rents over the income producing life of the asset 34 with transactions costs the implicit and explicit rents would dive rge explicit rentals would be larger than implicit rentals by the amount of such costs also the assumption of continuedgovernment had permanently taken enewet ak and bikini atolls without adequate compensation any restitution would be base d on the value of those assets at the time of the taking but the assumption is that rather than permanent taking there was only temporary use by the us governme nt and equivalently temporary lossof use to the residentproprietors of the atolls therefore any restitution would be based on the value of this use to the us government or equivalently the value of the lost use to the rightful owners of the two atolls this value would be the fair market average rents per acre times the relevant acreage the lands consisting of the two atolls and including the environmen tal assets or habita t and any residences for the length of time that it was rendered unuseable as result of us government activities note that as long as the market is competitive the us government would not pay more than the fair market rental based on the lands return as agricultural and residential property33 explicit and implicit rentals there has never been competitive real estate market nor even market economy generally in either enewetak or bi kini atoll indeed until recently there has never been any type of real estate market nor market economy in the rmi generally the islanders did not employ concept of market value land was held communally rather than privately and was not exchanged for money as in capitalistic real estate market the enewetak and bikini landowne rs did not lease their land there were tenants paying rent to the landlords but used it themselves thus there are actual real estate transactions competitive or otherwise in either enewetak or bikini from which to obtain explicit rentals for agricultural land with real estate market competitive or otherwise from which to obtain explicit rents the equivale nt implicit accrued rents mu st be estimated before loss ofuse damages may be timated implicit rents would have accrued to the people of enewetak and bikini as property owners and operators of the lands if they had continued to live and produce on their lands even if an explicit real estate market did not exist in other words when the peopl of enewetak and bikini lost the use of their assets they lost the implicit rentals that would have accrued to them regardless of the type of leasing and the tenure system there is at least in theory and assuming competitive market with private property and transactions costs an equivalency between the implicit rentals that would accrue to landlord and any explicit rentals paid by tenants34 these foregone implicit rentals are what the ncthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs16 34 continued private property rights is crucial if private pr operty has value then share of resource that is privately held has more value that pr oportionate share of communally owned resource 35 in yuba natural resources inc v unite d states 904 f2d 1577 1581 fed cir 1990 the federal circuit court argued that the usua l measure of just compensation for temporary taking of property is its fair rental value for the period of the taking based on the minimum amount of rents under lease agreement this is the value for the use of the property during the taking the amount which the owner lost as result of the takingmethodology attempted to determine according to this line of reasoning these rents are the amounts that the us government s hould have paid the owners of the land for their use of it at the time of the use the methodology in general in general the methodology used by the ncts estimators to estimate these implicit accrued rentals is rooted in sound economic and financial theory it is at least when the competitive rent data are available standard methodology used by economists as well as by the courts in solving similar problems35 this is because in general if the assumptions and conditions of the theory were met the real estate market rents obtained from comparable ie agricultural and resi dential properties to the extent they existed would represent the implicit rentals on agricultural and residential proper ties on the islands of enewetak and bikini further the ncts methodology attempted to adjust each years estimated rentals owed the gross rentals for 1 any rentals previously paid by the us government for lossofuse and 2 the valu of alternative land provided as domiciles by the us government the ncts apprai sers adjusted the annual net rentals for interest on unpaid prior rents this is also viewed as appropriate because rents should have been paid at the time of the us governments use and at the time of the consequential lossofuse to the islanders since such rents if any should be paid retroactively they would have to be compounded on yearbyyear basis for the interest income the islanders would have earned had they been paid on time in estimating past lossofuse hundreds of act ual lease transactions from rmi atolls were sampled to estimate av erage rents per acre for each year critical variable upon which both past and future lossofu estimates depend in estimating future lossofuse the methodology ppropriately ttempted to estimate the value of such lossofuse as the present discounted valu of projected rentals up to the date of return although in general the methodology could be appropria the conditions under which it should be applie d to generate reliable estima tes of past implicit rentals for lossofuse were not present in either enewetak and bikini moreover the ncts specific application of the methodology mu ch of the critical data used some of the assumptions and certain statistical procedures applied ie the sampling technique and specifically the exponentia l regression model produced estimated rentals that appear to be overstated particularly in comparison with rents in the united states and elsewhere around the worl d and in comparison to rents calculated based on rmis national income and pr oduct accounts if the

and bikini land average rentsacre is overestimated this leads to overstated past and future lossofuse estimates and excessive total lossofuse damages claimed and awarded by the nct the main shortcoming is with the past lossofuse estimates but since future lossofuse calculations rely on past lossofuse rent estimates these estimates appear to be inflated as well overestimation of past lossofuse this section of the report demonstrates that past lossofuse damages appear to be overstated first the thodology overestimated or infl ated average rents per acre for land on enewetak and bikini second the quantities of land that were denied use were overstated by for example including the use of vaporized portions of islands although these would alternatively be comp ensated as assets at the time of their vaporization as already explained third th value of alternative atolls provided by the us government as domiciles may be understated overestimation of average rents per acre the ncts methodology sample rent data assumptions and statisti cal procedures ie the sampling technique and the use of the exponential regression model overestimate d the peracre rental rate for land on enewetak and bikini the ke variable in the lossofuse calculation the ncts methodology examined all l ease transactions in the rmi from 1944 through november 1997 the va luation date nearly 500 of them in total and used 196 transactions as the basic statisti cal sample from which to estimate average rentsacre for each year from 19461996 the lease transactions were primarily commercial leases from the urbanized and densely populated atolls of majuro the capital of rmi and kwajalein where the us missile test site is located these transactions do not reflect th value of the more isolated rural and agricultural lands of enewetak and bikini36 in the ncts statistical re nt sample 176 of the 196 leases are for land on majuro which is 595 mile s from enewetak and 439 miles from bikini kwajalein is 354 miles from enewetak and 217 miles from bikini there are surveys of leases on any of the affected atolls because property was and is communally owned and little nd or property was bought and sold or rented until the late 1970s when the rmi real market became more developed these problems raise the question of the validity of the sample to determine land rents in the affected islands it is true that there have not been actual lease transactions on either enewetak or bikini even at this writing however because the land on majuro and other southeastern at olls from which sample data are obtained are not representative or comparable to land on enewetak and bikini the nct arguably should have explored us of an alternative methodology httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs18 37 randall alan

bank of hawaii the united states spent about 180 million for land rent on kwajalein over the 15yearperiod fro m 1986 to 2001 12 million per year there are 40512 acres of dry land in kwajalein assuming the entire island was rented by the us government the exact rental per acre is 2962 see republic of the marshall islands economic report bank of hawaii april 2001economic theory suggests and the evidence supports that rents decline the further the land is from the central business district and that the more distant land will be used for agricultural purposes and generally at the lowest rents37 although one would expect to find higher rentals in these two atolls than in either enewetak or bikini the applicability of these rental s to distant more agrarian less populated and less productive atolls is stionable in theory samp rents would be taken as random samp from population of comparable properties sold or rented in competitive real estate market the same market to which rental value is being estimated in the event that such data are unavailable then an attempt would be made to estimate the implicit rentals by an alte rnative method the fifth section of this report develops such an alternative methodology more serious methodological problem is that the rentsacre obtained from the sample data are not competitive freemarket rents they are not the equilibrium result of the interplay of s upply and demand and therefor do not represent the real underlying productivity of land as factor of production there ar essentially three reasons for this first most lease transac tions in the rmi place take place at what is called the official government rate which is established by law by the rmi cabinet which under the parliamentary system of government is appointed by the president who is also the prime minister the rmi cabinet established the official rental at 2500acre on october 1 1979 and increased it to 3000acre on october 1 1989 this rate has been the price at which land and other property is rented throughout the rmi it is also the benchmark for most other lease transactions in the rmi including land leased by the united states government virtually all land transactions since 1979 have been conducted at th is rate for example the united states rents the kwajalein missile test range at the official rate of 3000acre38 this makes the united states which values the rmi lands as strategic asset the single biggest lessee tenant for rmi land not only does the rmi government dete rmine the land and other property rental rate but it is also the source of much of the demand for land at least during the period from 19791997 the lossofuse va luation period the lessors tenants in many of the nearly 500 lease trans actions are either the rmi government government of the trust territory of the p acific islands the ministry of interior outer island affairs or other rmi gove rnment agencies such as the national telecommunications authority according to the hallstrom appraisal report the federal and national governments have been active participants in the market with over 180 transactions or 40 of the data involving them primarily as lessees the national government of the marshall islands continues to lease land for variety of purposes but has actually played an important role in establishinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs19 39 appraisal report of the loss in value in enew etak atoll republic of marshall islands for the nuclear claims tribunal the hallstrom group inc and

businesses and private indivi duals basis of land value marked increase in transactions ensues over 70 percent of the database involves transactions from 1980 to current further discussed below the market has tracked the government rate with each adjustment this is further supported in many cases by leases that adopt the then government rate as standard or basis for ground rent renegotiation since the 1980s most leases have been written with provision for fiveyear review and comparison with the official government rental rate39 finally top rmi government officials we re also effectively landowners of much of the land rented to the rmi government agencies they were source of the supply of land which raises the possibility of conflict of interest under the system of landownership in the rmi th king or paramount chief called the iroijlaplap in the rmis native language effectively owns onethird of all the land which means that he receives one third of the rent or any other income from the land whether inkind or in currency dollars many of the leases in the sample of 500 lease transactions and many of the leases in the sample of 196 lease transactions used in the ncts estimation methodology list the paramount chief or king amata kabua as one of the landowners40 the practical effect of this system of land ownership nd pricing and rent determination is that the rmi government the primary lessee or tenant rents much of the land from itself as the landlord at bove market prices also determined by the rmi government to illustrate on may 11979 the citizens of the marshall islands approved constitution and elected its king amata kabua as its first president on october 1 1979 the rmi cabinet which was appointed by president kabua established by law the official governme nt rental rate the rmi government has leased substantial quantities of land at the official government rate and has influenced the leasing of other nongovern ment land and since by tradition the king owns onethird share of all rents president kabua received onethird of the government established rent rate rents obtained from these types of nonarms length and nonmarket tran sactions do not yield rent estimates that would realistically reflect implicit agricultural and residential rentals ie the real agricultural productivity of the land on either enewetak and bikini finally the ncts methodology also assume d that all of the islands of the two atolls were equally valuable that the land in these islands was potentially rentable at the same average rate as for the rmi as whole based again on lease transactions on kwajalein and majuro atolls however at the time of their relocation on march 7 1946 the bikinians all resided on bikini island three other islands of the atolls original 29 islands could have supported permanent populations enyuhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs20 41 however the ncts methodology for future lossofuse does not use these estimates probably because they are so inflated as to be not plausible rather the appraisers take averages of the predicted rents for 1996 newetak and 1997 bikini from two different models one of which is the exponential mode l and holds the future rentsacre through 2026 enewetak and 2027 bikini constant at these levels 42 note that for both enewetak and bikini the two appraisers use different quantities of land losttouse and different quantities of vaporiz ed acreage for example for bikini the hallstrom report assumes the total acreage is 188963 the darroch report assumes it is 184834 the nct employs the highest of the various acreage estimates namu and eniirikku this may suggest that the other 25 islands had little use value even to the bikinians and to value them equally with the usable islands is questionable the exponential model of rent growth crs research demonstrates that the nct also overestimated average rents per acre on enewetak and bikini due to the use of an exponential regression model to ex trapolate rental rates for years in which observations are not available the model estimated by the nct is rt 28967 0993 t that the trend of average rentals in the rmi grows every year at an exponential rate as determined by this equation applied to overstated nonmarket sample rents this model predicts implausibly high average rentsacre of 5745 for 1997 and 112995acre for the year 2027 which is equivalent to land value of nearly 2000 000acre com pounded at 8 for 30 years the precise figure is 1774024acre41 when this model is fitted to da ta calculated using the more recent observations from inflated governmentcontro lled rental rates it produces very high slope estimates an estimate of implied changes in rentals each year this method further compounds the upward bias in the estimated average rentsacre and overestimates past loss ofuse in theory and accordin g to much empirical evidence real estate rents reflect real estate va lues which when they fluctuate as they invariably do do so depending primar ily on economic cond itions and generally do not increase at exponential rates the quantity of land affected another source of overstated lossofuse estimates is the assumption that more land on enewetak and bikini was lost to use than is actually the case42 for example though some tions of the affected atolls were completely destroye d or pulverized by the nuclear testing 18246 acres of enewetak 934 of the atolls land acreage and 6967 acres of bikini 369 of the land acreage the ncts methodology assu med that they were not the result is that the us government owes rentals fo r lossofuse on land that longer exists and which continues to earn inflated re nts at compound interest through 2026 for enewetak and 2027 for bikini the ncts justification for making this assumption was twofold first it argued that enewetak and bikini are part of the environmental whole and should not be separated into islets however this assumption results in an inconsistency enewetak and bikini atolls are treated as individual land masses fo r purposes of 1 calculating the annual rental values on unvaporized tions of the atolls 2 adjusting for alternative habitation and 3 adjusting for prior lossofuse compensation already paid by the us government but enewetak and bikini atolls are treated ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs21 43 another illustration is the case of runit island of enewetak atoll this island has been indefinitely quarantined because it is used to store nuclear wast and should thus be compensated based on its value at the time it was rendered unusable plus interest 44 this adjustment is more involved for biki because of the relocation to four different atolls rongerik kili ejit and majuro for different time periods on peracre basis the stay on rongerik and ejit is valued at 100 of the enewetak rents but this was for slightly more than 2 years from mar 7 1946 to mar 14 1948 for rongerik for more detail see the memoranda of decisions and order for enewetak and bikini attached to the changed circumstances petitioncollective land masses for the purposes of excluding the vaporized portions of the atolls the second reason given for including the vaporized land portions in the lossof use calculation was that there are problems in determining the value of the vaporized and otherwise unusable portions of enewet ak and bikini but there are more problems in valuing vaporized land as there are problems in valuing unvaporized land given the equivalency between the value of land nd the rentals earned on that land an appropriate methodology would consider the vaporized land areas as being tantamount to permanent taking of prope rty and estimate the capitalized land value based on the projected streams of rentals using the estimated rentals at the time of pulverization in this way past lossofuse estimates would include the rental value of the vaporized portions up to the time of pulverization and th ereafter based on the capitalized value of these portions of the land as assets with interest this is the same as calculating future rents foregone but it does so at the time of the destruction of the land whether from vaporiza tion or any other cause43 finally the nct methodology also made some assumptions regarding the timing of denied use in the case of bikini atoll that raise the lossofuse damage estimates in particular it assumed that th bikinians lossofuse was continuous and there was return on march 7 1946 167 bikini islanders the inhabitant proprietors were evacuated but the bikinians returned to two islands of the atoll bikini and eneu islands from june 1 1969 to july 31 1978 while it is true that they returned to contaminated island the time they spent on the atoll after their return should not be counted as loss ofuse the implication for the lossofuse estimation is that the rentals on these two occupied islands of the atoll would be lower owing to this contamination and that the corresponding value of their stay on alternative atolls should not be deducted from the overall rental the value of alternative habitation the estimating assumption that the rentsacre of alternative homel and provided by the us g overnment is only fraction of the rental value of the original homel and also resulted in overstated lossofuse damages the ncts methodology valued ujelang generally at only 58 of the average rents on enewetak rongerik kili and others were valued at either 75 or 58 of the value per acre of bikini44 the assumption is based on an assertion that the economic value of copra dried coc onut meat production and other agricultural commodities cassava sweet potatoes etc which were produced on the contaminated and vaporized islands before us tes ting and population evacuation was less on these alternative residences than on either enewetak and bikinihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs22 45 memorandum from jonathan m weisgall to philip okney defender of the fund feb 23 1998 46 another possible source of overstatement is in the adjustment for prior lossofuse compensation the george w bush administrati on argues that the extent of such prior compensation used in the methodology is grea ter than is shown in the nct reports crs was unable to independently verify this but if so this also would cont ribute to inflated past lost use valueswhile deducting the value of alterna tive habitation provided by the us government is viewed as fa ir and appropriate the assumption that rentacre on these alternative habitats are lower than on either enewetak and bikini because the value of the economic output on these alternatives is less than on either enewetak and bikini is inconsistent with the rest of the methodology the methodology developed for the nct based on instructions give n to the appraisal firm by claimants counsel and the nct assumed that rent s on enewetak and bikini should not be based on economic value of land in agri cultural production such as production of copra or potential for nuclear storage45 thus for purposes of adjusting for alternative habitation ie calculating variables for term in the formula that is subtracted from gross rentals the nct di d take into account differences in economic value but for purposes of calculating gross rentals on enewetak and bikini differences in average rent sacre due to differences in economic output were not taken into account by the nct the value of the produce from the land its output potential or productivity of the islands in producing copra or fish was not considered the assumption is also inconsistent with the capitalization model that the value of an asset is equal to the present discounted flow of income streams returns reinvestment of rental proceeds finally the nct methodology assumed that all of the rental proceeds earned during the first 20 years of payments the estimated amounts of past lossofuse rental owed by the us government for the period 19461966 would have been inve sted in 30year us treasury bonds this step in the procedure which seem s like double counting effectively assumes that none of the proceeds would have been di stributed to the resi dents of the affected atolls and consumed this is equivalent to assuming that savi ngs rates would have been 100 more appropriate way to ad just for this would be based on the assumption that large portion of the proceeds would have been expended on consumer goods and the remai nder saved in savings account at some interest rate the amount saved should be base d on realistic savings rate46 overestimates of future lossofuse with respect to future lossofuse th present discounted value methodology is generally appropriate but the estimated dollar amounts also appear to be inflated or overstated the primary reason that future lossofuse is overstated is that the procedure carries over into the calculation of projected future rents the inflated estimates of average rents per acre from the past lossofuse thus for enewetak rents for 1997 2026 are projected to be the same as for 1996 4105acre for bikini rents for 19982027 are the same as for 1997 4167acre the assumption that the enewetakians and bikinians could return to use the vaporized islands also contributes to this overestimatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs23 47 see us department of agriculture agricultural land values and cash rents final estimates 19992003 national agricultural statistics service statistical bulletin 993empirical evidence the main conclusion of the discussion so far that lossofuse estimates appear overstated or inflat ed is based on an examin ation and economic analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the ncts methodology this section of the report presents empirical evidence facts comparisons and additional arguments that support this conclusion from 19701978 before the establishment of the rmis official government rental rate of 2500acre on january 1 1979 annual rents on all rmi lease transactions which were primarily commercial leases on business prope rties and residential leases rather than agricultural land averaged 511acre according to the hallstrom report and 597acre accord ing to the darroch report in contrast average rents in 1979 after the official government rental rate was enacted in october 1 1979 averaged 2575acre 404 above the hallstrom averag and 331 above the darroch average the economic conditions for rent increases of this magnitude essentially the mand for land would have had to increase by that same percentage given that the supply is essentially fixed while not inconceivable do not appear to have existed in the rmi generally and the enewetak and bikini atolls particularly estimated average rents per acre in the nct report for enewetak and bikini and the rest of the rmi 4105acre in 1996 and 4167 in 1997 appear high in comparison with agricultural rents in the continental united states hawaii and various other parts of the world47 for example rents for continental us cropland in 1996 ranged from 1750acre in montana 115acre in oregon to 210acre in california which has the highest agricultural rents anywhere in the continental united states primarily because it produces greater quantity of more valuable specialty crops than anywhere else reflecting primar ily the marginal productivity of california agricultural land fo r new mexico cropland rents in 1995 averaged 88acre average rents for continental us crop land in 1998 the first year aver age figures for the us became available were 6650acre the nctestimated rents also appear high when they are converted to farmland or asset prices and compared to average land prices for comparable properties in sel ected areas around the world the ncts estimated 1997 rental of 4167acre discounted at 8 for 30 years is equivalent to nd valued at 46911acre which is nearly 2000 greater than th 2405acre average price for hawaiian land and 5000 mo re than the 926acre average pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs24 48 based on the average asset value price of agricultural land in hawaii the estimated rent per acre would be 21363 as compared with an average estimated rent of 4167 in the nct reports for the value of hawaiian agricultural land see us department of agriculture 2002 census of agriculture state data

continental united states generally48 figure 1 shows average land prices for the continental united states from 19822004 although official rent and land value data from places around the world are unavailable anecdotal evidence also suggests that the ncts estimates of rents are significantly overstated for example in 1997 the us fish and wildlife service purchased 5300 acres of land in the south kona district of the hawaiian islands at total cost of 778 million or 1468acre which tr anslates into an estimated annual rent per acre of 13049 in june 2002 the average price of cropland in brazil was reported at 355acre50 in april 2005 100725 acres of new zealand forest land went on sale for 42acre in new zealand dollars which at the april exchange rate converts to about 30acre in us dollars51 on february 2005 1300 acre new zealand commercial farm with residential structures was on the market for 3846acre52 again when compared to these prices the 46911 price for rmi land estimated by the nct in 1997 seems substantially overstated finally comparison based on national income and product accounts and the relative income shares of various factors of production shares earned by bor capital land and profits also suggests that the ncts thodology significantly overstated rents for example the ncts lossofuse calculations for 1990 resulted in total rent value of 9155949 3837687 for enewetak and 5318262 for bikini which is 13 of rmis aggregate gdp gross domestic product of 6869100053 for 1995httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs25 53 continued or labors income i s the return to

uncertainty would make many of the dete rmining variables in the model random which although it would add realism it would also add an unnecessary level of complication and in any event is beyond the scope of this memorandum the total estimate of 11890496 5039009 for enewetak and 6851487 for bikini is 113 of rmis 1995 gdp54 such implicit rentals for just two atolls whose combined land area comprises 87 of rmis total land area are high in and of themselves but they also do not account for the implicit and explicit rents on rmis other 27 remaining atolls and 5 islands applying the estimated 1995 peracre rental ra tes of 3859acre to the entire area of the rmi would yield total implicit rental of 1705 million 62 more than the 1995 rmis gdp of 1052 million55 alternative methodology this section of the report develops model of agricultural rents which is applied to available data from rmi s national income and product accounts to generate alternative estimates of average rentsacre for the total lossofuse rentals for the enewetak and bikini atolls th model is founded on the same neoclassical microeconomic theory underlying the nct lossofuse methodology however in addition to making the model explicit it avoids shortcomings of the nct methodology by using available data from rmis national income and product accounts that is consistent with the underlyi ng theory the model is deterministic there is uncertainty and assumes th at land values and therefore land rents derive primarily from agricu ltural productivity but also from proximity to the major urban areas majuro56 the value of agricultural nd and equivalently the rental price of that land reflects th value of the crops produced the rmi economy table 4 is brief statistical profile of the rmi

other than copra products from the processi ng of coconut oil pearl farming and fishing in addition to copra some of the islands produce pandanus breadfruit bananas limes taro and arrowroot but in relatively small quantities handicrafts are made for export but this is also ve ry small industry tourism is insignificant primarily due to rmis re moteness from major population areas which makes travel costs high thus the economic potential of the rmi economy in general and the agricultural sector in particular is extremely limited which implies that rents would not be expected to be very high based on the theory that rentals of agricultural land in capitalistic or mixed economies reflect primarily the net earnings capacity of the land the value of the lands marginal pr oductivity the rents for agricultural land values estimated by the nct appear to be overstated58 theoretical framework of rent determination as discussed above land is marketable capital asset productive factor that produces flow of goods and services over time59 the exchange value of land is its fair market price what willing buyer would pay willing seller in an armslength transaction in free competitive marketpl ace the exchange value of the goods and services produced by the land are its rents what willing lessee would be willing to pay willing lessor for the use of th land over an agreedupon period of time in an armslength transaction economic theory suggests that the exchange value of the land itself the price of the land is equal to the present discounted value discounted at the opportunity cost of capital of th streams of annual returns or income generated by employing the asset in its best and highest use and over its economic life plus any salvage value of the sset at the end of its economic life60 in the case of agricultural land that st ream of returns the annual ground rents per acre would reflect th fertility or productivity of that land as productive factor as well as its location topography the value of any natural resources and environmental amenities any speculative potential value and cultural value agricultural land prices would then be closely related to the

th ere would have been less us assistance and rmis level of economic development would have been much less and therefore rents would have been smaller 63 in addition nuclear testing has reduced rent s from what they would otherwise be due to its adverse effects on the productivity of the labor force the l in equation 3 labor productivity would be lower than had there be testing because of radiation exposure to the residents of enewetak bikini and other atolls prim arily rongelop and utrik such exposure results in variety of adverse biolog ical effects and diseases some experts believe that

discussed nuclear testing reduced th total quantity of land vaporizing about 13 of enewetaks and bikinis land area but such testing also reduced soil fertility the quality of the land on enewetak nd bikini as factor of production63 in addition nuclear testing led to the contamination of the remainder of the two atolls for many years according to table 2 the entire atoll land areas 3842 acres are sufficiently contaminated to prevent thei r full use until at least 2026 enewetak and 2027 bikini indeed some part s of the two atolls may neve r be usable at all because they can never be completely sufficiently decontaminated as to be safe for humanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33029crs33 64 there is much disagreement on the extent of contamination of the rest of the rmi some experts contend that 8 additional atolls were c ontaminated in addition to the four mentioned in the texthabitation also two other atolls rongelap and utrik were contaminated by fallout from the tests on enewetak and bikini64 this contamination of the lands of the four atolls reduced the fertility of the soil the marginal productivity of the land and therefore the rents these effects are shown in figure 2 rb k l

assumed not to be affected adversely by nuclear testing during the 1940s and 1950s that figure is then multiplied by the unusable acreage the vaporized and contaminated nd area on enewetak and bikini this figure is then added back in to the total agricultural output of the rmi generally to which equation 3 is applied to determine rents per acre the net result is procedure which brings the demand

overstated more specifically summing up the values fo r the nineyear period 19821990 shows an apparent overstateme nt of rents by factor of 10 that this does not include the cultural or environmental value of the nd to the enewetak and bikini peoples as discussed in the next section the value of environmental amenities the final adjustment in estimated rentsacre is for the value of environmental amenities equation 3 does not fully reflect the value of the services provided by the enewetak and bikini ecosystem as natural capital environmental amenities generate utility and thus have value to the community of the rmi in addition to their value as factors of producti on to landowners environmenta l amenities are part of the ecosystem they are public goods that are not traded in the
