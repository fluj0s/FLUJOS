andor veteran status this report does not examine certain other recommendations such as those in the vdbc report regarding benefits for survivors of deceased servicemembers or regarding evaluation of presumptive disability ie establishing service connection for certain longterm health effects of hazardous exposures3 congress the two commissions and others have determined that certain programs and systems that involve both the department of defense dod and the department of veterans affairs va are particularly problematic in providing continuity and quality of care and services to injured servicemembers in january 2008 congress passed the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 pl 110181 titles xvi and xvii of the act address matters related to the care and treatment of servicemembers and former servicemembers ie veterans who were wounded or who contracted an illness while serving on active duty among the problems addressed in the act are the efficient maintenance and transfer of servicemembers health and benefits records between the departments and the separate evaluations of disability by each department efforts to address these and other transition problems were already under way in both departments partly in response to the recommendations of the pccww the vdbc and several other 1 presidents commission on care for americas returning wounded warriors

are addressed in vdbc recommendations 82 through 83 and 58 through 527 respectively crs2 commissions or task forces these legislative and administrative actions constitute the first wave of responses to the recommendations of these bodies further congressional and administrative actions are anticipated as this report is limited to comparison of the final recommendations of the pccww and the vdbc it will not be updated charges to the commissions the commissions were given different charges the pccww was established by executive order 13426 in march 20074 and was to focus on the needs of specific population namely seriously injured servicemembers returning from combat theaters in support of operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom oefoif the commission was asked to look broadly at services and benefits provided by all relevant cabinet departments principally the departments of defense dod and veterans affairs va as well as the private sector and at broad slate of services and benefits including health care disability traumatic injury education employment and other benefits the pccww was to study individuals experiences as servicemembers and for those who were retired or separated from military service their transition from military to civilian andor veteran status problems in providing services and benefits across that transition and subsequent experiences in civilian life though the pccwws recommendations were to apply narrowly to seriously injured oefoif servicemembers it could prove difficult politically and administratively to implement the recommendations in this fashion doing so could run counter to existing policies such as compensating serviceconnected disabilities equally whether or not they are combat related and prioritizing groups of veterans to receive va health care the vdbc was established in title xv of the national defense authorization act of 2004 pl 108136 to study benefits provided to veterans and their survivors to compensate for serviceconnected disabilities and deaths the vdbc was to consider these benefits regardless of the time or manner in which disability or death occurred and whether it occurred during conflict or during peace time while the vdbc examined certain transition issues for injured oefoif servicemembers who were retired or separated from military service this was not its principal focus the vdbc examined services and benefits for veterans across their lifespans making more comprehensive assessment of the full complement of veterans benefits than did the pccww but less comprehensive assessment of dod services benefits authorities and policies 4 white house executive order establishing commission on care for americas returning wounded warriors and task force on returning global

populations when comparing pccww and vdbc recommendations it must be borne in mind that unless otherwise stated pccww recommendations would apply at least initially only to injured oefoif servicemembers and veterans while vdbc recommendations would apply to all servicemembers or veterans including those from previous conflicts who are otherwise eligible for the service or benefit being
