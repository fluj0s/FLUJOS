international security policy foreign affairs and national defense division1 summary with the nato enlargement process now underway europes former neutral states austria finland sweden switzerla nd and ireland are reevaluating the role they should play in the changing european secu rity setting in austria there is major political debate dividing partners in the governing coalition over whether or not to seek nato membership the key role of nato in european security has created both opportunities and dilemmas for th former neutrals on the one hand their governments recognize that the new global environment has removed the cold war rationale for posture as neutral in the internationa l system on the other hand many people in these countries still value to degree their countrys nonalignment political elites are divided concerning how to advance their count rys interests in the new setting all of the former neutrals except switzerland are members of the european union eu bringing them partway into the transatlan tic security community even though they are not nato members all except ireland have joined natos partnership for peace pfp program involving them directly in many nato activities the position of the former neutrals outside the alliance could appear increasingly anomalous as central and east european states begin joining nat over the next few years members of congress might wish to consider how the enlargement process might affect decisions by the former neutrals about their relati onship to and potential membership in the alliance the meaning of neutrality beyond the cold war during the cold war several european democracies though committed to western political values and economic systems noneth eless positioned themselves as neutrals in the cold war struggle for two of these states switzerland and sweden neutrality had deep historical roots originating well before the onset of the cold warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97249crs2 2this term is

western european union is the main vehi cle for development of european security and defense identity esdi in nato weu countries will have the opportunity under reformed nato structure to assume greate r responsibility for peacekeeping and humanitarian relief missions full weu membership however is only offered to countries that are members of nato former neutrals th erefore cannot seek full weu stat us without also joining natoboth decided that position of foreign policy and defense neutrality would continue to serve their interests in the cold war as it had before two others viewed neutrality as the way to protect or regain their sovereignty af ter the war finland s neutrality was product of its geographic proximity to the soviet union and its vulnerability to soviet military power and political influence austria accepte d neutrality as consequence of its long struggle to regain sovereignty granted only in 1955 by the austrian state treaty following years of soviet resistance irelands neutrality has more to do with its desire to avoid perceived military subordination to great britain than with the cold war this said the rules of the game in europe have changed so substantially that old concepts of neutrality have ceased to be as relevant framework for the interests and policies of these five countries this rea lity now is acknowledged in their policies and political rhetoric most experts and observe rs now refer to their countrys posture as nonaligned rather than neutral those former neutrals that are members of the european union austria sweden finland and ireland already are in many respects participants in the transatlantic security system2 this obviously has advantages but thes nations face the double danger of being accused of freeriding on the defense efforts of others while having to accept decisions that affect their interests w ithout the opportunity to vote on those decisions none of the five former neutrals has become full western european union weu member but flexible participation arrangements give each the opportunity to participate in weu debates on security policies3 natos partnership for peace pfp which all but ireland have joined gives them an opportunity to design program of military cooperation with the allies and to contribute to natos new missions such as that in bosnia natos new euroatlantic partnershi p council eapc in which ll but ireland participate as observers gives them an entree to nato debating forum but not alliance decisionmaking all five countries are members of the or ganization for security and cooperation in europe osce and view it as critical part of the evolving european security system but they recognize that nato is emerging as the core element of that system and that participation in the osce is necessary but not sufficient condition for advancing their security interests the former neutrals th erefore have been weighing the advantages of participation in weu and nat activities against the percei ved costs of abandoning nonaligned status that s till is reassuring for substan tial majorities in their public opinion during the june 1997 eu summit in amsterdam the four nonaligned eu members states joined great britain and denmark in opposing francogerman plan tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97249crs3 merge the eu and the weu the merger woul d have put more pre ssure on them to make decisions about their future security affilia tions because the neutrality of each country has unique roots and rationales each has c hosen its own path toward the future austria following the liberation of austria from ge rman occupation at the end of the second world war the country was divided into f our occupation zones governed by the united states the soviet union britain and france democratic elections produced the first postwar austrian government in november 1945 but full sovereignty was not restored until the austrian state treaty came into effect in july 1955 neutrality was not required by the state treaty but the constitutional law on austrian neutrality committed austria to permanent neutrality and declared that ustria will never in the future accede to any military alliances nor permit the establishment of military bases by foreign states on her territory by the time austria joined the european union on january 1 1995 the rationale for austrian neutrality had already begun to erode becoming an eu member and at the same time weu observer state brought commitment to participate in the shaping of common foreign and security policy cf sp with its eu partners and indirect participation in the western security system austria joined the nato pfp program shortly after entering the eu taking one mo re step toward active involvement in the western security system now the debate in austria is whether or not to seek nato membership the current coalition government between the social democratic party spö and the peoples party övp includes conflicting perspectives on this issue chancellor viktor klimas socialists are reluctant to apply while peoples party officials foreign minister wolfgang schüssel and defense minister werner fasslabend support an early application the government had agreed to formulate policy by the end of march 1998 but negotiations failed to resolve differences between the coalition partners the outcome suggests that the issue will not be resolved until after the next parliamentary election which must be held later than the au tumn of 1999 the main opposition party the rightwing freedom party fpö supports nato membership small leftists opposition parties are opposed public opinion polls in austria reflect continued support for neutrality albeit in diminishing numbers poll in mid1966 revealed that some 60 of austrians would vote against nato memb ership in referendum but 58 believed austria would eventually join in any case if nato enlargement proceeds as desired by the clinton administration austria in few years will be surrounded by nato countri this will likely keep the issue of eventual austrian nato membership high on the political agenda current trends appear to be moving toward more favorable elite and public attitudes toward membership and it may be only matter of time before austria applies to join nato finland finland like austria emerged from the s econd world war as democracy unlike austria its sovereignty remained legally intact but finlands sovereignty was in somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97249crs4 respects qualified by its long border with the soviet union and the close proximity of overwhelming soviet military power these f actors greatly influenced the 1948 finnish soviet treaty of friendshi p cooperation and mutual assistance from finnish perspective the accord helped preserve finni sh independence but some detractors would say it led to finlandization or excessive finnish responsiv eness to soviet interests the end of the cold war and collapse of the soviet union lib erated finland from previous constraints on its foreign policy finland became member of the european union on january 1 1995 and like austria assumed observer status in the weu finland was the first of the former neutrals to request observer status in the north atlantic cooperation council nacc natos forum for consultations with nonmembers subsequently replaced by the eapc and was an early participant in the partnership for peace participation was largely justified in terms of natos emerging peacekeeping role during 1996 finnish politicians and ex perts debated the question of nato membership the result of the debate was general consensus that finlands interests are currently well served by its position of milita ry nonalignment combined with deepening military coopera tion with its nordic neighbors and with nato the debate left open however the question of eventual membership in the alliance as in the case of austria finland has moved long way from traditional neutrality with its membership in the european union and its participation in we u pfp and eapc but finnish president martti ahtisaari observed in july 1996 that he would not support accession to nato because it would not enhance finnish or eur opean security in march 1997 the foreign ministers of finland and sweden issued joint statement on nato enlargement arguing that enlargement should not have an adverse ffect on their security or that of the baltic states one important factor in finnish th inking is the fact that the nowindependent former soviet republics of estonia latvia and lithuania are not likely to be offered nato membership in the next few years some finnish officials believe that move by helsinki to join nato would leave the baltic states feeling even more isolated and abandoned the continuing finnish debate on finlands role in european security suggests that the question of eventual nato membership is far from closed public opinion still supports neutrality but younger finns are not nearly so comm itted to the policy as are older generations moreover poll in th fall of 1996 indicated 43 of finns believe that finland would eventually join nato di scussions with finnish officials and experts suggests that finnish policy is also strong ly influenced by natos relationship with russia and with the baltic states russias special relationship with nato increases pressure on finland to ensure that it can ve voice in nato decisions that might affect its interests major factor still inhibiting finnish application to join is the fact that nato is not yet ready to issue invitations to the baltic states if and when nato is prepared to invite the baltics it seems likely that finland will want to come along as well sweden sweden has not participated in any wa r or joined any military alliance since 1814 during the cold war sweden took serious approach to armed ne utrality and maintained relatively high levels of defense spending and capabilities it was largely anticipated that sweden although not part of th western alliance would play constructive role in any soviet attack on western europe at least by defending its territory and complicating ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97249crs5 soviet assault on norway sweden joined natos pfp in may 1994 acceded to the european union on january 1 1995 and s hortly thereafter became weu observer there has been an active debate in sweden on the question of neutrality in the post cold war world in february 1996 thenprime minister social democrat ingvar carlsson suggested that nato membership was question for the future and that current discussion of the issue was premature carlssons successor goran persson has supported expanded involvement with nato through activ participation in the partnership for peace swedish contributions to the implementation force ifor and now the stabilization force sfor in bosn ia and defense coopera tion with its nordic neighbors and the three baltic states the ce nter party on which the social democratic government relies for support has remained staunchly in fa vor of neutrality this view is shared by green and left parties in sweden among main opposition parties the moderate party led by carl bildt leans toward nato membership and bildt has personally endorsed joining the alliance opinion polls in september 1997 strongly favored bild t over current prime nister persson 51 vs 25 in anticipation of elections schedul ed for 1998 the small liberal party supports swedens active involvement in the transatla ntic defense system in october 1996 the liberals became the first swedish party formally to endorse nato membership public opinion remains broadly attached to swedens military nonalignment but elite opinion appears to accept that sweden w ill eventually find its interests best served by membership poll early in 1997 reveal ed that public resistance to swedish nato membership had decreased substantially for the time being the top swedish priority will be to help provide support fo r the baltic nations by advoca ting baltic membership in the european union and developing wide range of defense cooperation projects proposal by carl bildt for nordic partne rship for peace paralleling natos pfp met cool reaction in sweden and elsewhere in scandinavia critics argued that separate nordic pfp could make the baltic states too dependent on the nordics who want to share that responsibility with other european count ries and the united states the idea was not embraced by the baltic states because they do not want it to be seen as an alternative to nato membership the debate on nato membership appears likely to continue in sweden even if pronato membership carl bildt comes to power in 1998 sweden may still move in rough parallel with finland on the nato membership issue this suggests that both countries may wait to request membership until the nato countries are prepared to open the door to the baltic states as well switzerland switzerlands tradition of neutrality is centuries old but the modern period dates back to the establishment of the alpine c onfederation in 1847 when neutrality was clearly established as the swiss foreign policy or ientation even though it was not mandated by the swiss constitution switzerlands historical experience particularly the fact that switzerland escaped untouched by two wars in this century has had powerful effect on swiss public perceptions of ne utrality as one writer has not ed the swiss people have become so accustomed to thinking of neutra lity as prerequisite of swiss identity andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97249crs6 4manfred roesch switzerlands security po licy in transition nato review december 1993 p 20swiss prosperity that it has become something of myth or dogma4 swiss reluctance to give up their treasured status was reflected in their december 1992 rejection of the referendum on membership in the european ec onomic area seen as precursor to swiss membership in the european union after the vote the swiss government put on hold its application to join the european union in spite of domestic resistance the sw iss government has decided that the confederations interests require more activ participation in the process of european security cooperation as c onsequence swiss foreign secretary flavio cotti signed pfp framework agreement with nato on december 11 1996 explaining that switzerlands partnership arrangement woul d focus on areas not directly related to territorial defense cotti said that switzerland will remain faithful to its armed neutrality and that it does not plan to jo in nato because switzerland has not yet joined the european union it probably remains some years away from facing squarely the decision of whether or not to join nato but the process of involving switzerland in nato cooperation has begun with both commercial links to the alliance through 1996 agreement with natos maintenance and suppl agency and participation in the pfp whether or not it eventually joins nato switzerland seems bound to become more involved in nato activities ireland irish neutrality based largely on the desire not to be caught up in britains wars has been called into question by the recen t changes in europe and particularly by natos evolving role and deve lopments concerning eur opean security and defense identity in march 1996 the labour partys dick spring at that time the irish foreign minister hinted that ireland might consider joining natos partnership for peace public opinion polls in october 1996 showed 69 of the public wanted to maintain irelands policy of neutra lity but 77 nonetheless favor ed joining the pfp and 68 supported irish particip ation in the natoled stabilization force in bosnia in may 1997 ireland sent 49strong military police tingent to bosnia to serve in the nato sfor mission in addition the government decided to post senior army officer to natos supreme allied command in belgium to perform liaison functions related to its participation in sfor in the june 1997 gislative elections fianna fáil which had strongly opposed irish participation in the pfp came to power in minority coalition government with the progressive democrats small party th at supports closer irish ties to nato fianna fáils leadership has argued that pfp participation could lead to irish forces being placed under nato and perhaps even british command the dominant position of fianna fáil in the current government appears to have at least temporarily closed the door to further evolution of ir elands involvement in european security structures among the former european neutrals ir eland probably has the least defensible argument for remaining outside the emerging cooperative defense fra mework in europe having largely enjoyed free ride on security throughout the cold war other europeans as well as us officials question the justif ication for irelands position given the stronghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97249crs7 feelings on the issue however even decision to participate in the pfp would be difficult one for the irish government furthe rmore this issue has been overshadowed by the peace process in northern ireland under these circumstances nato membership likely will remain out of the ques tion for the foreseeable future
