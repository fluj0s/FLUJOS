nicolas sarkozy defeated the socialist candidate ségolène royal in the second round of the french elections to become president of france he will serve fiveyear term his party lost seats but maintained solid majority in subsequent legislative elections since 1981 france has had only two presidents there is sense of malaise in the country in part due to high unemployment and slow economic growth sarkozy represents younger generation of leaders sarkozy casts himself as toughminded former interior minister his campaign built on his reputation as hard on illegal immigration and insistent on greater efforts by the countrys large muslim community to better integrate itself into french life royal pursued campaign meant to place her directly in touch with french voters in doing so she circumvented some of the steps normally necessary to gain the socialist party nomination this campaign strategy put her at odds with some of the party elders she gambled that her campaign of participatory democracy would appeal to range of voters beyond the socialist party in the end she failed to deliver clear message to french voters and to unite her own party foreign policy played secondary role in the elections sarkozy and royal stressed the growing danger of iran both candidates supported french participation in nato and eu security and stabilization missions but there were disagreements with the united states over some elements of natos mission and future both candidates supported the eu but neither brought to eu issues the passion of prev ious postwar french leaders sarkozy presents himself as friend of the united states and an admirer of american culture but added that france under his leadership would assert its usual independence royal was sharply critical of the bush administration and contended that us unilateralism in recent years has damaged bilateral relations and increased instability in the middle east it is possible that sarkozy will pursue practical and nonideological posture towards the united states he is unlikely to alter the usfrench relationship in stark manner cooperation over counterterrorism measures multinational operations in

road and rail systems run through or emanate from paris important domestic and foreign policy issues were at play in the campaign integration of the large muslim minority now nearly 10 of the population and mostly north african in origin has been focal point of discussion for decade but most pointedly since the attacks of september 11 2001 on the united states and riots in the suburbs where most muslims live of several major french cities in 2005 control of immigration was another key electoral issue related issue was high unemployment plaguing the country for years in foreign policy the unstable middle east and the possible rise of nucleararmed iran considerable attention from the key candidates frances role in the european union was so question of importance to the population sarkozys campaign was successful because he presented clear program of reform to the electorate and appealed to national front voters concerned about immigration crime and the economy he also effectively managed his partys militants who helped to bring his message to the population royal lost because she at times seemed uncertain of her message because she sometimes cast herself defensively as the person to prevent sarkozy from gaining power and because her own party was divided over her candidacy 1 relations between the bush administration and france have been difficult since the runup to the us invasion of iraq in march 2003 while the united states and france cooperate closely on some issues such as counterterrorism and instability in lebanon president chirac strongly opposed the invasion of iraq and raised international criticism of administration policy leading to sharp rejoinders from administration officials and some members of congress officials in both countries are hoping that the 2007 french elections will lead to an improved bilateral atmosphere on several issues some of which are discussed in this report france has been an important contributor to range of nato and eu missions and an improved relationship could relieve strain on us strategic resources

gaullist party the of hungarian immigrant sarkozy was helped through the ranks by chirac he is not graduate of the national school of administration ena the elite institution that pr ovides france with many of its most important leaders he broke with chirac in the 1995 presidential elections when he endorsed chirac rival who lost nonetheless his forceful aggressive style generated political following he became head of the union for popular movement ump the umbrella party centered around the gaullists and built reputation for being tough on immigration and crime as frances interior minister he prevailed as the partys choice for the presidency bolstered by the faltering image of his principal rival prime minister dominique villepin politically damaged by an alleged scandal and an effort to loosen law to allow the dismissal of young workers at late moment chirac gave sarkozy tepid endorsement sarkozy is part of new generation of french leaders although supportive of the european union he is less wedded to it than earlier and older postwar french leaders he is also part of generation of leaders who were too young to be formed by the massive national strike of 1968 that shut down the country in call for reform af ter the first round of elections he criticized the heirs of 1968 by saying that they had destroyed the values of hierarchy in france his opponents on the left quickly condemned his remarks as an attack on the french social model which has had strong safety net in place for nearly 40 years 2 sarkozy is wellknown figure in france as an important political lieutenant of president chirac he helped to continue the ump as major force in french politics he has clear persona among the voters who see him as decisive hardworking and emphatic in his views he cast himself as an outsider by calling for rupture with past practices in leading the country at the same time those who have worked closely with him describe him as deal maker implying practicality not always publicly visible 3 g6g152g150g142g156g157g146g140g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 as interior minister in 2005 sarkozy referred to young rioters in the suburbs of several major french cities as scum and said they should be washed away with power hose critics of such language contend that the rioters were largely economically disadvantaged and were often north african muslim youth ostracized by elements of french society 4 in 2006 he promised to deport more illegal immigrants than were deported in 2005 pledge he carried out at the same time he urged muslim youth to become more involved in french society and promised to begin program of positive discrimination to ensure their entry into public institutions and the job market as gateways into broader society the

earnest in late 2006 and at first sought to build more moderate image the ump nominated him in january 2007 in speech before the party faithful he said that he had changed he recounted difficult moments in his personal life and said that because of certain failures he had become milder more inclusive leader in his speeches he ranged across variety of issues for which he developed often detailed positions at the same time his image as tough on illegal immigration and crime shadowed him closely it gathered supporters from the extreme right and reassured those who believe that there are too many foreigners in france 5 in early march 2007 sarkozy unable to put significant distance between himself and his principal rivals for the presidency reverted to harder line if elected he said he would establish ministry of immigration and national identity proposal that appeared to be an effort to pull in more voters from the extreme right the proposal led some to question whether such ministry was meant to intimidate immigrants to accept vague undefined prescriptions of frenchness month earlier he told an audience if you want to become french then you must be proud of france he refused demand from the algerian government as requirement for final agreement to friendship treaty that france apologize for its era of colonization in algeria and for brutal measures taken by some french forces in algerias war for independence he said that most french citizens who went to algeria during the era of colonization were neither monsters nor exploiters but men who believed in good faith that they were serving an ideal of civilization 6 sarkozy has laid out plan to revitalize the french economy but his message has been mixed critics in his own party and on the left have br anded him as too liberal or free market the organization for economic cooperation and development has long held that the french economy should loosen regulations on the hiring and dismissal of workers to build flexible labor marketplace better able to infuse workers with new skills into the economy sarkozy supports more flexible employment contract that would allow employers to fire workers more easily he has criticized the 35hour work week put into law by socialist government as inhibiting employees who wish to work more and earn more he is promising taxfree income for those who work beyond 35 hours 7 his message on the international economy is more restrictive he opposes the acquisition or takeover of french strategic companies by foreign entities he condemned the purchase in 2006 of arcelor french steel company by the dutch company mittal during the campaign sarkozy said that free trade is policy of naïveté in 2004 as finance minister he brokered deal to merge the two french companies aventis and sanofi to ward off takeover by swiss company more recently he said if i am president then france will have real industrial policy after his election he said that the eu must protect national industries he has blamed french unemployment in part on the european central banks tight monetary policy which in his view keeps the euro at an artificially high level compared with the yen and the dollar and thereby harms exports and economic growth 8 5 m sarkozy centre sa campagne sur france et travail monde january 16 2007 p 10 interviews in france februarymarch 2007 6 cited

many european leaders sarkozy refers to hezbollah as terrorists at the same time he proposed in june that conference on lebanons future be held his government invited hezbollah member to the

taken steps such as social assistance to those in need of jobs and health care to aid segments of the population since the late 1950s the most important french leaders have strongly embraced the european union sarkozy like his rival royal lacks this passion for the eu as already noted he places blame for slow french economic growth at the doorstep of the eu and has pledged to use diplomatic offensive to persuade the eu to pursue stronger antidumping policy and the european central bank to lower the value of the euro to boost trade and employment he believes that the eu constitution defeated in referendum in france in 2005 should be put in simplified form before the french parliament for debate and possible passage sarkozy opposes turkish membership in the eu stating simply that turkey is not european country 11 sarkozys government is considering blocking the eu from negotiating chapter on european monetary union with ankara step that might relegate turkey from the status of

is graduate of the national school of administration navigating the internal party structures to leapfrog prominent rivals for the nomination such as laurent fa bius former prime minister and dominique strausskahn wellregarded former finance minister was formidable undertaking royal 53 developed campaign based on direct contact with the voters strategy designed to circumvent to some degree but also to influence the internal party process for the nomination in some ways her campaign was roll of the political dice traditionally socialist candidates wait their turn with the party nomination going to senior figure of long experience royal sought instead to jump the line if she could demonstrate national appeal the party bosses known popularly as elephants might find difficulty in denying her the nomination she reportedly antagonized some of the elephants when she said i am tied to network money source lobby major media large commercial enterprise she omitted any debt to the socialist party structure 15 the elephants manage large national network of party militants primarily local elected officials such as mayors and town council members who are influential in their communities circumventing the elephants risked losing parts of this network royals former partner françois hollande is chairman of the socialist party and one of the elephants he seemed to undercut her early in the campaign when he openly opposed her tax plan which he found too moderate royal never succeeded in bringing her party together central reason for her loss 16 royal sounded generally moderate message concentrating on the home and family and developed an interactive website where she carried on dialogue with voters and featured debates and discussions of policy issues by prominent officials local leaders and others member of the national assembly royal raised issues of interest to the french population on the website and solicited the publics opinion her campaign of participatory democracy was controversial she held meetings across france with public groups where she pledged to listen to the voice of the average french person before coming to settled policy positions practice sharply different from that of previous social ist candidates and sarkozy in country where voters are used to socialist party leaders presenting highly defined and finely tuned positions on policy questions to the public this tactic is unusual her political challenge was to listen carefully but at the same time to demonstrate leadership and creative thinking in guiding the public to resolution of important issues even after she bested her party rivals and won the nomination in november 2006 she continued her listening campaign and in the view of some party observers was slow to articulate formal position on key issues 17 for example when initially asked whether she supported turkish membership in the eu an idea opposed by the majority of the french population she seemed to some to respond disingenuously by saying that she would listen to the french people and submit the matter to referendum vote likely to be negative18 15 ségolène royal je ne dois rien à

standing in the polls in january and february 2007 like sarkozy royal exhibited passion neither for the european union nor for the legacy of 1968 she staked out position described below on the eu constitution likely to have left it in limbo had she been elected although she voiced respect for those leading the social upheaval of 1968 she avoided strong endorsement of its heirs by noting that she was only secondaryschool student at the time of the events 19 g6g152g150g142g156g157g146g140g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 royal also addressed the issue of immigration and integration of muslims into french society in the socialist party tradition she insisted that france remain secular country and that young muslims learn to speak french well and perform well in french schools she opposed system of positive discrimination affirmative action promoted by sarkozy for immigrants at the same time she supported policy initiatives to assist many young people in france she pledged to increase the number of teachers raise the minimum wage by 20 by 2012 and inaugurate system of statefunded first jobs 20 royal had tough message meant to bring greater order and discipline to the public school system she would have sent troublesome students to militarystyle boot camps to educate them about appropriate social conduct this suggestion brought criticism from elements of the socialist party but appealed to parts of the center and right on the political spectrum 21 royal was reportedly raised in strict environment and she is the daughter of military family that lived in former colony royals views on how to reinvigorate the economy were in sharp contrast to those of sarkozy she pledged to scrap the flexible contract which allows shortterm hiring and eases the firing of employees for small businesses she would have extended the 35hour work week to larger part of the workforce22 she would also have renationalized the large utility electricité france and merged it with the stateowned company gaz france to create public sector company such policy would have run counter to eu efforts to persuade member governments to privatize state enterprises she agreed with sarkozy that the european central bank should be persuaded to weaken the euro in order to generate more exports and expand the economy g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 royal has experience in foreign policy and she made several slips that brought criticism however most of her views were conventional within the general french approach to key issues like sarkozy she believed that france should maintain its independent nuclear force and like sarkozy she also believes that france should spend at least 2 of gdp year on defense 19 ségolène royal maintenant excerpts from her political

polls she reportedly called for sovereign quebec view long ago abandoned by most french nationalists the canadian prime minister rebuked her for the comment while visiting lebanon hezbollah member of the lebanese parliament in group meeting with her compared israel to the nazis she criticized some of his remarks but did not refer to this particular comment after she was taken to task by her political opponents in france she said that the interpreter had not translated the remark made in arabic likening israel to nazi germany she condemned the comments by the hezbollah representative several days later 23 royal described herself as committed european but she is clearly not an ardent supporter of the eu she did not support second vote in france on the proposed eu constitution preferring instead debate and then referendum on new protocol capturing the essence of several aspects of the constitution especially matters related to social progress the role of public services and protection of the environment 24 because there is consensus throughout the eu on social issues such protocol has chance of passage in europe she moderated her views on turkey and supported turkeys membership in the eu if it achieves the progress towards full democracy laid out by the eu commission she be lieved that turkey would add an important geostrategic advantage to the eu and strike bl ow against those who accept or support clash of civilizations25 royal was sharply critical of bush administration foreign policy she described as unilateralist the 2003 us invasion of iraq campaign document drafted by an aide on the socialist party website described sarkozy as bush clone whose nourishing milk is american neo conservatism referring to sarkozy the document asks is france ready to vote in 2007 for an american neoconservative with french passport26 after the first round vote royal added that i am not for europe that aligns with the us27 such comments may have been designed to tap into widely held sentiments in france critical of the bush administration and more generally broad antiamericanism that has increased in the past several years28 royal was not specific in her assessment of na tos tasks and its future but she has said that it is doing too much moving into new fields that it should not be pursuing29 such view may be in line with position evident across much of the political spectrum that nato should concentrate on military issues and build collective defense rather than venture into political areas such as statebuilding more in the realm of

because he forcefully laid out clear positions on range of subjects he toughened his already hard line on limiting immigration and cracking down on crime he projected an energy and decisiveness that seemed to many voters lacking in the previous generation of french leaders his wellpublicized rift with president chirac now highly unpopular may in the end have helped him by giving some credibility to his claim to be an outsider in the end he was able to overcome the negative perception that many hold of him as he succeeded in gaining half the voters who supported the centrist françois bayrou in the first round royal introduced new more direct style of politics to france in her campaign of participatory democracy however observers assert she was unable to define herself and some of her ideas clearly it did not seem to many voters that she was offering something starkly different from socialist candidates of the past given the spending programs and implicit tax increases at the center of her economic policies the socialist party has lost the last three presidential elections in 1995 2002 and now 2007 royal has said that she will challenge hollande for leadership of the party move regarded as an effort to modernize the party and move it towards the center many observers believe that the party must accept globalization and modernize its views on state intervention in the economy

relationship between allies is twoway street just as some us officials believe that president chirac has been an impediment to improved relations many observers in france in the wake of the us invasion of iraq and highly politicized criticism of france emanating from parts of the us government and media believe that only the end of the bush administration will lead to moment when the political atmosphere between the two countries can improve sarkozy expresses admiration for the united states but many in the gaullist party and in the general population remain disdainful of the bush administration 33 despite sharp differences with the bush administration the chirac presidency worked closely with the united states on several key issues these efforts relieved pressure on us resources by contributing to sharing of the burden for missions important to us and allied security34 by all accounts usfrench cooperation against terrorism primarily through eu structures but also bilaterally is excellent sarkozy as interior minister was intimately involved in this cooperative effort france like the united states is deeply critical of the syrian government and the two countries have worked together to reduce syrias influence in lebanon and to shore up the lebanese government sarkozy announced after his election that france would once again engage syria in an effort to stabilize lebanon at the same time he had tough words for the syrian government and said that france will support the continuing investigation into possible syrian involvement in the murder of form er lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri on the other hand some french officials believe that the bush administration should have used its influence to restrain israel in its response to attacks by hezbollah in summer 2006 response that badly battered the lebanese economy and politic leadership as noted above france is one of the eu3 countries working with the united states to block irans nuclear ambitions through negotiations and by imposing and maintaining economic sanctions france also contributes to natos international security assistance force isaf in afghanistan where french forces provide security in kabul and train elements of the afghan army sarkozy has said that france will keep its forces in afghanistan but not indefinitely us officials believe that france continues to modernize its armed forces to be more expeditionary or capable of distant missions in an era of global terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction france also plays role in the eu stabilization mission in bosniahercegovina and the nato mission in kosovo sarkozy believes that french forces are overextended largely in peacekeeping missions should he withdraw such forces from current missions there will be more pressure on the united states and other governments to fill in this shortfall with forces of their own 32 interviews with us officials 2007 33 discussions with
