wise men which was accepted in the form of greek and turkish committees of experts who are exchanging views via the president in march 1996 turkey suggested ways to address aegean issues year later greece made decisive overture th at accelerated bilateral diplomacy finally in july 1997 the united states instigated joint greekturkish declaration of principles that is said to equal nonaggression pact the principl have yet to be applied to specific aegean disputes whether or not greece and turkey want to change the nature of their relations and resolve the aegean disputes is uncertain strong motivations to resolve exist greece wants to meet the criteria for joining the european monetary union and must control defense spending to do so it can only cut defense spending if the turkish threat recedes greece also wants to cultivate more positive image in european circles and its relations with turkey are an impediment turkish secularists want to be part of europe and to stop greek use of the veto in the european union as weapon in bilateral disputes the in fluential turkish military may favor rapprochement with athens in both countries however there may be domestic political constraints on policy change in greece the legacy of former prime minister andreas papandreou who asserted that turkey is the greatest threat to greece affects the current governments mane uverability

the united states wants stability in th eastern mediterranean and after the imiakardak crisis sought to become more active in dispute resolution us neutrality in the crisis however was perceived in greece as favoritism toward turkey and prevented the united states from engaging immediately the us desire to be force for positive change persevered and reached fruition with the madrid declaration in july 1997 the united states is determined to stay on course and work with the parties to apply the madrid principles to specific disputes the prospects for aegean resolutions are better now than

aegean issues background and recent developments introduction the united states and nato look to greece and turkey to anchor stability in the eastern mediterranean region bordering the unsettled balkans and middle east often however the two allies are antagonists in bilateral disputes which have troubling incendiary potential since january 1996 crisis over an islet in the aegean sea took the neighbors to the brink of war1 efforts have been made to improve greekturkish relations other di visive issues notably those concerning cyprus2 the ecumenical greek orthodox patriarchate and greek orthodox community in turkey muslim mainly turkis h citizens of greek thrace the kurds and the competition for regional allies sometimes complicate the search for reasonable accommodation aside from cyprus however these other issues are not crisisprone nor the subject of current diplomacy the aegean issues the longest border between greece and turkey is in the aegean sea and has been disputed in the air in the sea in the continental shelf and on islands islets and rocks air since 1931 greece has claimed airspace ex tending to 10 miles over the aegean countrys airspace rights us ually coincide with its territorial sea rights greece claims sixmile sea limit therefore ot her countries including the united states recognize greek airspace as only six miles turkish military aircraft challenge greeces airspace claim by flying to within six miles of greek islands greece immediately accuses turkey of airspace vi olations and scrambles its planes to intercept the turks continuous mock nd potentially dangerous dogfights ensue sometimes resulting in plane crashes air traffic control issues parallel the ai rspace dispute in 1952 the international civil aviation organization icao assigned greece air traffic control for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97799crs2 aegean flight information region fir ie international and greek domestic airspace over the aegean up to turkish nationa l airspace after the cyprus crisis of 1974 turkey required all planes approaching its airspace to report after reaching the aegean median line in order to enable milita ry radar to distinguish innocent flights from aggressors greece said that this impinged on its fir authority and abrogated responsibility for air safety over the aegean international airlines reacted by ceasing direct flights between greece and turkey closure of the aegean detrimentally affected commercial air flights over the sea to other areas the situation was resolved in 1980 when the pre1974 status quo was restored and in ternational flights resumed over the aegean in general turkey claims that fir is technical issue that greece interprets and exploits as matter of sovereignty to restrict turkish aircraft and exercises over the aegean continental shelf the dispute over the definition of th continental shelf involves maritime resources as well as sovereignty turkey claims that the continental shelf under the aegean is an extension of its anatolia n or asia minor nd mass and that the continental shelf border is median line between the two mainland coasts greece claims that islands have continental shelves and that the continental shelf border is median line between the turkish coast nd eastern greek islands which fringe the turkish mainland in support of its position greece cites 1958 united nations convention on the continental shelf and the more recent convention on the law of the sea which recognize that islands generate continental shelves greece is signatory of both conventions but rkey is not and rejects greeces claim as fundamentally in equitable the continental shelf dispute has pr ovoked two crises in november 1973 turkey granted oil exploration rights in what it called international waters in the aegean adjacent to several greek islands in february 1974 greece protested that the area was part of its continental shelf that may the turkish government sent research vessel into the area with an escort of 32 warships at may 1975 summit of the greek and turkish prime ministers turkey appeared to agree to submit the dispute to the international court of justice icj governmental instability in ankara however rendered the apparent accord obsolete and turkey sent in another research vessel accompanied by warshi p greece appealed to the security council to address turkeys violations of its sovereignty and unilaterally petitioned the icj for determination of continental shelf rights the security council passed an ambiguously worded reso lution 395 1976 calling for both direct negotiations and judicial recourse the icj rejected greeces request for interim measures what us courts would call temporary injunction because of greeces failure to show irreparable harm it also declined jurisdiction which depends on the consent of both parties to dispute the second crisis occurred in 1987 when greece granted oil exploration rights in the continental shelf near its island of thasos and turkey granted similar rights in waters near the greek island of samothrace turkish ship went to work with far smaller naval escort than in the 1970s greek prime minister andreas papandreou threatened to take all necessary measures to protect greeces sovereignty the crisishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97799crs3 abated after intense nato and us media tion with each country assuring the other that exploration would only occur in its own undisputed territorial waters greece proposes that both countries join tly petition the icj for determination of continental shelf limits the demarcation of the continental shelf is the only aegean dispute for which greece is willing to petition the court jointly with turkey for resolution and accept an arbitral comp romise on all other aegean issues greece maintains that turkey must initiate petition for legal r ecourse because it is disputing established greek sovereign rights territorial sea in 1936 greece claimed territorial sea of six nautical miles it reserved the right to claim 12nauticalmile limit right later codified in the convention on the law of the sea which th greek parliament ratified in may 1995 as noted above turkey is not signator of the convention in response to the greek parliaments action on june 8 1995 the turkish parliament gave its government authority to take all necessary measures including military ones if greece exercised the right to 12 miles and incr eased its territorial waters greece has never affirmatively exercised the right to 12 miles if greece claims 12 miles then it would claim over twothirds of the aegean sea on june 12 1974 in the context of the continental shelf dispute above turkey had formally declared for the first time that an extension of greek territorial waters to 12 nautical miles would constitute casus belli cause of war turkish officials reiterated this position many times contending that greek territorial sea of 12 nautical miles would strangle turkey and transform the aegean into greek lake turkey believes that greek control of the aegean could threaten its access to international waters over two thirds of turkeys commercial traffic transits the sea greece says that it would ensure other countries righ ts of innocent passage islands there are about 2400 islands in the aeg ean almost all are greek and about 100 are inhabited the 1923 treaty of lausanne mandated the demilitari zation of several islands then given to greece in the easte rn aegean italy ceded the dodecanese islands to greece by the treaty of paris in 1947 which required their demilitarization as well greece began militarizing eastern aegean islands in 1960 and accelerated the program after the cyprus crisis of 1974 greeces militarization of lemnos and samothrace at the entrance to the straits of the dardanelles is of great concern to turkey greece militarized the dodecanes for selfdefense after 1974 turkey contends that greeces actions violate the lausanne and paris treaties greece argues that the relevant provisions of usanne were superseded in 1936 with the montreux convention of 1936 which author ized turkey to militarize and control military traffic through the straits greece also claims that its actions are defensive after the fact in 1975 turkey establishe d its fourth army based in izmir on the aegean coast the fourth army has an amphibious landing force capable in theory of seizing greek islands greece says that the fourth army must be redeployed before it reduces its military presence ar ound turkey the respective greek and turkish positions however may be more political irritation than military threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97799crs4 3see crs report 96140 greece and turkey the rocky islet crisis

military involvement th parties returned to status quo after us intercession subsequently turkish na val officer appeared to question greek sovereignty of the island of gavdos near crete at nato planning session although the turkish foreign ministry sa id that gavdos was technical not political question turkish officials began to refer to grey areas ie islets and rocks not specifically mentioned in trea ties whose sovereignt may be unresolved they later said that there were 130 such islets and rocks greece demanded that turkey deny it had claims to gavdos dispute resolution

1august 15 and said it would use iff during that time as it has done for decades greece rejected use of iff because it carved out special exception to the athens fir which it said applies to all countries turkey called for an exchange of information concerning flights in the aegean which greece also considered an infringement of its fir responsibilities greece refused to di sarm its combat aircraft in its national airspace but said that training flights would not be armed greece reportedly agreed to hotlines between athens and nato and turkey and nato beginning in february 1997 the two sides began test program of sending pictures of aegean activity to nato headquarters in naples european union during its 1997 turn as president of th european union council of ministers the

views as its nonnegotiable sovereignty issues or the involvement of third parties it counterproposed the creation of separate greek and turkish committees of nongovernmental experts who would report

above and the madrid declaration below then turkish foreign minister tansu ciller may have been especially encouraging saying that ankara does not want change in the aegean status quo one greek

commitment to settle disputes by peaceful means based on mutual consent and without use of force or threat of force the final two provisions may have th greatest potential to deter conflict because they address matters that have been most provocative greece is committed to refrain from unilateral acts which may include the exercise of its right to 12 nautical mile territorial sea while turkey promises not to use force eliminating the casus belli the principles do not address or resolve specific aegean disputes and the hard task will be in their application motivations for change both countries have become motivated to improve bilateral relations by external influences that could benefit their inte rnal development the european union appears to be the primary force for change greece in contrast to recent governments in athens the simitis government has distinctly eurocentric outlook and wants to meet the european union criteria for joining the european monetary union emu and to increase its competitiveness with european countries which meet th criteria before greece those criteria include budget deficit of not more than 3 of gross domes tic product gdp and government debt of not more than 60 of gdp for 1997 greeces budget deficit is expected to be 62 of gdp and its g overnment debt is forecast at 108 of gdp12 among eu member states greece spends the highest proportion of its gdp on defense13 and this expenditure manifestly contri butes to deficits and debt to get them under control greece must cut milita ry spending greek government however can make such cuts without also diminishing the turkish threat which propels the expenditures in the wake of the imiakardak crisis in june 1996 even the simitis government otherwise fisca lly conservative announced new multi billion dollar arms program nonethele ss largely because of their european orientation prime minister simitis and foreign minister pangalos are likely to persist in their outreach to turkey

contributing to the developmen t and stabilization of those countries14 after complaints from its european partners greece lifted its veto of meda in may 1996 it has however continued to veto the cu stoms union funds pangalos has said that the veto will continue until turkish aggressiveness ends as greece seeks to be less of an outsider within an enlarging eu it may be rethinking its policy tools and approaches toward turkey it may be considering options other than using its eu veto for dealing with turkey this likely would require change in greek perceptions of turkish aggressiveness alternate foreign minister george papandreou has elaborated the need for policy change arguing that greece must present more positive image of itself to europe so that it would longer be considered obstructionist papandreou called on greece to shape future greekturkish relations constr uctively and not rely on vetoes he urged turkey and greece to seek pragmatic criteria for rapprochement15 finally samuel huntingtons clash of civilizations thesis has had an exaggerated impact in both greece and turkey although it is not us policy statement16 huntington forecast that culture will produce redivision of the world and new conflicts he drew cultural fault line across europe between western christianity on the one hand and orthodox christianity and islam on the other17 this theoretical divisi on places greece outside of and in potential opposition to western europe and has outraged greek academics and politicia ns in march 1997 when europes christian democratic party leaders appeared to follow huntington by declaring the turkey could not be part of europe because it is muslim some greeks feared that they would be beyond the pale as well thus pangalos was defending greeces position in europe when he said that turkey must be part of europe if huntington had somehow linked the aeg ean neighbors greece would use the bondhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97799crs10 18it should be

to be in positi on to pull turkey into europe thus defined greece must improve its bilateral relations with turkey18 turkey the turkish secular elites have just experienced what they consider to have been close call with islamism year from july 1996 through june 1997 in which the islamist refah party headed the national government19 the secularists seek to reinforce turkeys modern european identity through ties with and especially membership in the european union some in turkey also are very preoccupied with the huntington thesis noted above and w ould like to disprove it by showing that turkey is in fact european turkeys tortured relations with greece have been one of the main barriers to improved turkish re lations with europe europe therefore provides an incentive for some turks to seek to resolve bilateral disputes with greece unlikely as it may seem the influential turkish military may be force for better relations with greece the turkish general staff generally takes moderate position on aegean issues and greekturkish relations perhaps excepting cyprus and wants to improve them in 1980 af ter years in which turkish civilian governments had blocked the move military junta in ankara delinked the issue of greeces reintegration with nato from turkish complaints about the fir more recently chief of the general staff ismail hakki karadayi made the first

twice prime minister21 may impede the simitis governments maneuverability in its policy toward turkey the charismatic papandreou had asserted that turkey greeces nato ally was the greatest threat to greece papandreous dogma is still influential in greece and in pasok now led by cost as simitis pasok has majority of 162 out of 300 seats in the greek parliament and must stay cohesive in order to carry out its program when 32 pasok deputies questioned greeces acceptance of the committee of experts they signalled the potential political risks of policy innovation some 22 pasok deputies later charged th at with the madrid declaration greece was gradually slipping into choices that result in recognition of turkish claims legalization of ankaras ex pansionist status and an expiation of its policies22 some smaller opposition parties were more alarmist democr atic social movement leader dimitrios tsovalas who considers himself an heir to the papandreist mantle accused the government of opening the road to ceding national rights calling the agreement harmful for greece for our territorial integrity and for our national interests23 within the government defense mini ster tsokhatzopoulos and education minister yerasimos arsenis are known fo r their hardline views toward turkey tsokhatzopoulos was close pa pandreou associate and the security requirements of his defense portfolio may reinforce his antiturkism simitis defeated both tsokhatzopoulos and arsenis in the intern pasok contest to succeed papandreou as prime minister in january 1996 and ts okhatzopoulos in june 1996 vote for party leader although they have publicly suppor ted the policy steps toward turkey that simitis and pangalos have ta ken so far tsokhatzopoulos and arsenis may be waiting for simitis to stumble in order take internal party and general domestic political advantage of failure prime minister simitis and foreign mini ster pangalos cannot get out too far ahead of their party rivals parliamentaria ns and rank and file thus after party dissent was voiced pangalos offered restrictive definition of the committees of experts mandate he and others still resort to antiturkish rhetoric playing to dissidents and rivals rhetorically however may constrain simitis and pangalos effort to lead and to shape public opinion in support of their policy toward turkey and it is heard in turkey where it breeds skepticism about greeces sincerity and acts as disincentive for improving ties simitis and pangalos may be able to overcome domestic political constraints the 32 dissenters decreased rapidly to 22 nd may not be solid bloc threatening foreign policy innovation tsokhatzopoulos nd arsenis may be perceived in the party as losers and lack following to pos real challenge tsokhatzopoulos is ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97799crs12 much pasok loyalist as he was papandreou loyalist and may defer to his party leaders will moreover new democr acy the main opposition party has reacted reservedly to the turkish outreach and theref ore may be inclined to support it the support of the internationalist coalition of the left for the policy is given finally important elements in the greek press have made common cause with simitis and their influence should not be underestimated nevertheless the papa ndreou legacy of antipathy toward turkey produces other greek actions which harm attempts to improve bilateral ties and resolve aegean disputes greece seeks and has signed milita ry agreements with turkeys neighbors which have problematic relations with rkey notably syria and armenia adding to turkeys perception of encirclement greeces conduct on the kurdish issue particularly sours re lations turks view the 13y ear kurdish workers party pkk insurgency as threat to their territorial integrity in april 1997 110 out of 300 members of the parliament of greece pr oposed to invite pkk leader abdullah ocalan to athens the government quickly said that it did not intend to invite him greek mps have visited pkk camps and turkey accuses greece of arming the pkk which athens denies turkey has record of human rights abuses toward kurds but greece sometimes appears highly sel ective in its human rights advocacy focusing on the kurds and not other issues such as the treatment of turks and other muslims in europe moreover greek championship of kurdish human rights in the eu helps deny ankara dearly sought cl oser ties with europe and feeds antigreek sentiment in turkey finally there is strong cyprus lobby in athens opposed to any initiatives that would produce greekturkish reconciliati on before cyprus settlement which traditionally has been greek preconditi on for rapprochement the has resumed the cyprus negotiations but the outlook for solution is uncertain or gloomy cyprus thus could stymie aegean peacemaking turkey ankara now has its third g overnment since an inconc lusive national election in december 1995 and an early election may be held in 1998 this governmental instability may affect relations with greece as politicians exploit foreign policy for domestic consumption and leave their weak coalition little room for compromise the islamistled government that was in office through june 1997 was directed toward the east and selected muslim countri it paid almost attention to greece because its rank and file had little if an

cyprus issue has been traditional greek precondition for improved ties with turk ey athens and the greek media in particular reacted strongly to ecevits return to power and his cyprus policy ecevit may contribute to disruption of the re newed effort to obtain cyprus settlement24 and thereby set back turkishgr eek relations on other fronts greek officials may not be able to persist in their outreach to turkey if ecevits impact is not mitigated ecevit may have another more indir ect impact on greekturkish relations with him in the government better ties with europe may not be as strong an incentive for improving relations with gr eece although prime minister yilmaz has said that speeding up efforts toward full membership in the eu is priority foreign policy aim of the government25 many turks perceive europe as repeatedly rejecting turkey and some want to reject europe in response ecevit and others call for the customs union accord to be reviewed because europe has failed to live up to its aid commitments and b ecause the customs union has aggravated turkeys trade imbalance with europe and harmed turkis h businesses turks know that greeces veto is the impediment to aid on the ot

not be disposed to look benevolently on improving ties to greece finally turkey looms larger in greek th inking than vice versa the particular aegean initiatives have not produced reac tion in turkey

between its two nato allies greece and turkey yet neutrality s not always been appreciated greeks maintain that an equidistant us stance benefits turkey and ignores what they believe is the right greek position on aegean issues greeces view of the regional power balance with turkey as the more powerful player necessitates that it seekdemand third party or international intervention to level the scales or to weigh them in greeces favor us neutrality fails to fulfill that need on the other hand turkey as the larger power assumes it can obtain more favorable outcome from negotiations solely between the two gove rnments and usually calls for dialogue turks believe that they are the more important regional ally of the united states adjacent to the middle east and the caucas us they do not criticize us neutrality and generally appreciate and expect us services in mediating controversies with greece and in moderating their effect on turkeys relations with europe because the united states supports turkeys entry into the european union neutrality evidently interfered with usgreek relations after the imiakardak crisis when then assistant secretary of state for european affairs richard holbrooke had planned to travel to greece and turkey to help them achieve more permanent end to tensions in the aegean he did not make the trip holbrooke had brokered resolution to the crisis that appeared to restore the prior balance in the aegean but many in greece perceived it differently they saw the crisis as one of turkey questioning longestablished territo rial rights and the status quo in the aegean holbrooke had failed to address the crisis in these terms and instead concentrated on eliminating the immediate threat of war greeks did not view his achievement on imiakardak favorably the newly tablished government in athens that had accepted the us resolution was weakened temporarily it did not have sufficient political capital to expend at the time on meeting with holbrooke and diplomatically found hi s trip schedule inconvenien t ankara stood ready to welcome holbrooke and regretted that the visit was canceled although us initiative on aegean issues was undert aken in 1996

that foundered on the shoals of domestic politics nonetheless the overall prospects for imp roved greekturkish relations and for resolution of some bilateral aegean issues may be better today than they have been in decade and may justify some cautious optimism the major contributing factor to such an assessment is the strong dom estic position and motivation of the athens government which has made sweeping unprecedented policy statements on greek turkish issues for example pangalos said that greece accepts that turkey has vital interests in aegean29 the simitis government also may be willing to lift the cyprus precondition to better relations with turkey foreign minister pangalos distinguished cyprus as an international issue from the aegean as national issue and prime minister simitis asserted outright that greekturkish relations and the cyprus question are not connected30 further as noted above p 7 greek fficials had laid out three conditions for improved bilateral relations turkey met two of them with the madrid declaration the only remaining condition concerns c ourt jurisdiction over the islet dispute pangalos has eased the way for compliance by saying that all turkey has to do is say that it is willing to go to the world court for their part the turks had wanted direct negotiations to precede recourse to the c ourt prime minist er yilmaz implied that requirement may be met by meeting of committees of experts when he observed that the committees can lead turkey to the court31 if turkey agrees to go to the court thereby recognizing greeces need for an international forum greece would have justification for not lifting lift its veto on european union customs union aid to turkey in possibly upbeat scenario lifting of the veto would do much to assuage hard feelings toward greece in turkey the outlook for the resolution of the different aegean issues varies the islet dispute may be open to resolution because its onset was largely unintended greece and turkey blundered into the imiakardak crisis which some consider media creation that got out of hand turkey subsequently could not find facesaving way to back down from the notion of grey areas and may have made it worse the tw sides acceptance of the status quo in madrid underscores that their lack of interest in perpetuating the unsettling byproducts of the islet cont roversy the separate issue of militarized islands however is unlikely to be resolved b ecause turkey will not move or change its 4th army at least until given l ongterm evidence of greeces friendship of the older aegean disputes the continental shelf may be ripe for settlement greece maintains that it is legal question to be resolved by the internationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97799crs17 court of justice turkey contends that it is also an economic political and strategic dispute requiring political settlement yet turkey has not categorically rejected an appeal to the court again after bilateral negotiations in the past decade expectations of oil or other mineral discoveries in the continental shelf appear to have lowered perhaps diminishing the value of the dispute as result the issue may be more soluble with both parties taking it to the court after some preliminary talks that would not be called dial ogue word connoting unacceptable compromise and therefore anathema to some greeks with regard to the territorial sea madrid appeared to signal that it may be allowed to be less of an issue th modus vivendi involves greece retaining the right to 12nauticalmiles of sea but continuing not to exercise the right as long as it does not exercise the right unilateral move turkey will control its rhetoric and stop threatening war the airspace controversy is likely to lin ger as long as greece claims air space rights disconnected from territorial sea rights and interprets fir in sovereign manner the prospects for solution for all or any of the aegean issues depend on the governments in athens and ankara the simitis government is stable oneparty administration that probably will serve out its full four years it is strongly motivated and may persist in its outreach to ankara for some time weathering ups and downs unless turkish actions shut it out greeces motivations mostly are externally driven and it needs to work on creating solid domestic consensus for foreign policy shift toward turkey the yilmaz coaliti on government was founded in part on promise to hold early elections it has multiple political components and must reach compromises among them it may prove tempting for some politicians to exploit foreign policy issues for domestic advantage or as in the case of ecevit for principles unleavened by pragmatism moreover whether the government and its anticipated successors will work with the foreign policy establishment on consistent creative and res ponsive approach to different greece is yet to be seen this context renders positive outcome from present opportunities
