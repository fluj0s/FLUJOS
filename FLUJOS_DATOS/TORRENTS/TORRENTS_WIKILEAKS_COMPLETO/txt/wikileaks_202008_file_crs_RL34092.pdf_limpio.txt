in 2010 and the planned in itial availa bility of orion and ares i in 2015 retaining nasas skilled workforce during the transition period will be major challenge especially if developmen t of the new

factor in the 2003 columbia disaster some also are uncomfortable with the fact that russian spacecraft will be the only way to launch us astronauts to the space station during the gap period the house
