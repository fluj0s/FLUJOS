facilities funded by this program include airfields naval bases signal and telecom installations pipelines and war headquarters as well as early warning radar and missile installations the us contributes approximately 25 of the total annual nsip asse ssment with the rest coming from the other members of the north atlantic alliance 3 virtually all costs associat ed with the latest complete

housing operations and construction the b ill also provides funding for the base realignment and closure brac account wh ich finances most base realignment and closure costs including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions and environmen tal cleanup at closing sites3 the military construction appropriations bill is but one piece of annual legislation that provides funding for the c ountrys national secu rity other national security appropriation legislation includes the national defense appropriations bill which provides funds for ll nonconstruction military ac tivities of the department of defense and constitutes more than 90 of national securityrelated spending and the energy and water devel opment appropriations bill which provides funding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy and for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers two other appropriations bills vahudindependent agencies and commerce justicestate also include small amounts for national defense4 supplemental appropriations bills may be passed to provide additional depa rtment of defense funding as needed funds may be expended by any agency of the federal government before they are appropriated5 in addition for nearly half century congress has forbidden the department of defense to obligate funds for any project or program until specific authorization is granted6 this explains why for defense funds both authorization and appropriations bills are require d the annual military construction appropriations act is dedicated to milita ry construction and the annual national defense appropriations act c overs all other partment of defe nse appropriations7 normally only one national defense authorization act is passed each year to authorize both of these appropriations8 therefore major deba tes over defense policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32310crs3 8 continued subcommittee on readiness and management support in the senate armed services committee draft legislation to authoriz military construction appropriations 9 the homeowners assistance fund defense was established by the demonstration cities and metropolitan development act of 1966 42 usc 3374 it authorizes the secretary of defense to acquire the title to or to reimburse for certain losses upon the sale of one and twofamily homes owned by federal

funds are sustained by direct appropr iation fund transfers made by th secretary of defense or the secretary of the navy from other accounts pr oceeds from certain title conveyances or the lease of federal military family housing property or other financial activity associated with either military family or unaccompanied housing these funds may be used for the planning construction or improvement of military housing as provided for under this particular subchapter of title 10and funding issues including military cons truction can be associated with any of these bills because issues in the defe nse authorization nd appropriations bills intertwine this report includes salient parts of the authorization bill in its discussion of the military construction appropriation process the separate military construction appropriations bill dates back to the late 1950s traditionally military construction was funded through annual defense or supplemental appropriations bills however the korean war prompted surge of military construction followed by st eady increase in military construction appropriations the strong nd enduring security threat posed by the soviet union drove relatively high and continuous vel of spending on military infrastructure the congressional appropriations committees established military construction subcommittees and created separate military construction bill the first standalone military construction bill was written for fy1959 pl 85852 it should be pointed out that first military construction ppropriations are not the sole source of funds available to defe nse agencies for fac ility investment the national defense appr opriations bill funds socalled minor cons truction and property maintenance within its ope rations and maintenance accounts construction and maintenance of morale welfare and recr eationrelated facilities are partially funded through proceeds of commissaries recreati on user fees and ot her nonappropriated income second several special acc ounts are included within the military construction appropr iation among these are the homeowners assistance fund defense9 and the department of defense family housing improvement fund10 both of which perform functions ancillary to the direct building of militaryinfrastructure most congressional appr opriations must be obligated in the fiscal year for which they are appropriated milita ry construction ppropriations though are an exceptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32310crs4 because of the longterm na ture of construction project s these

enacted for fy2004 caution should be exercised in inte rpreting these figures however because the military services are responsible for satisfying their own family housing needs and the department of defense and military services are engaged in an extensive program of privatizing ie removing from direct s upport by military construction appropriations significant portion of military housing in addition the services are completing nineyear effort to substa ntially increase the military pay supplement the basic allowance for housing or b ah that is funded in the personnel account in the

created the commi ssion on review of overseas military facility structure of the united states last year to determine for itself whether the eventual department of defe nse plan for altering overs eas basing requirements and stationing of troops will be ade quate to national security needs15 the commission is tasked with conducting thorough study of matters relating to the military facility

for congress is the absen ce of formal department of defense plan for the future of its overseas basi ng for this specific reason congress did not fund some of the construction projects requested by the department at overseas locations for fy2004 in its report to th senate on the fy2005 appropriations bill the senate committee on appropriations noted that the department of defense is now more than two years overdue in forwar ding its master overseas basing plan to the committee and again recommended agains t funding several requested overseas construction projects17 in its report on the fy2005 appropria tions bill the senate committee on appropriations noted that the creation of the commission had met with significant department of defense opposition nevertheless the committee went on to state because of delays in the appointment of commissioners the establishment of suitable commission facilities and the submission to the congress of the departments global basing and presence plan the deadline for the commissions final report is extended to august 15 2005 this will make the commissions life coterminal with its f unding which under current law expires september 30 2005 and

presidential announcement on august 16 2004 president george w bush included the following remarks in his address to the nationa l convention of the veterans of foreign wars vfw in cincinnati ohio im announcing today over the next 10 years we will bring home about 60000 to 70000 uniformed personnel and about 100000 family members and civilian employees19 the redeployment in context analysts expect that the majority of the forces redeployed to the united states will be drawn from those countries that currently host the largest overseas us ga rrisons these are the federal republic of germany the republic of korea and japan it may be helpful to place this redeployment in historic context by comparing the numbers of troops in garrison in th three countries in 1986 with those in garrison in 2003 the figures for 1986 reflect us overseas force posture during the closing years of the cold war20 in addition the united states then maintained sizable garrisons in both the republic of the philippines and th republic of panama that would be redeployed to the unite d states its possessions or other overseas locations during the late 1980s and 1990s therefore these troops have been

departments fiscal year 2006 budget justification material sec 2832 this section specifies the final criteria that are to be used by the secretary of defense in calculating the military value of installations considered for closure or realignment and other criteria that the secretary shall consider in making his recommendations previous w established several criteria for the evaluation of military value and special considerations that are to be included at minimum in the writing of the secretarys recommendations the acts language appears to remove some flexibility in th ability of the secretary to choose those factors he deems re levant to the calculation prev ious law specified that military value is the primary consideration in creating the recommended brac action list the acts language requires the secretary to give priority to military value the section goes on to state that the final selection criteria specified in this section shall be the only criteria to be used along with the forcestructure plan and infrastructure inventory in making recommendations fo r the closure or realignment of military installations inside the united states under this part in 2005 sec 2833 existing law authorizes the s ecretary of defens to pl ace military installation in an inactive status as an alternative to closure or realignment the acts language repeals this authority sec 2834 previous law required the co mmission to give the secretary of defense 15day warning before adding an installation to his list of recommendations for closure or realignmen t and demanded that seven of the nine commissioners then vote for the addition the acts language made the same requirement applicable to commission consideration for adding an installation to the secretarys list of recommendations and requires that at least two members of the base realignment and closure commission visit any installation for which the commission intends to add closure or realignment recomme

budget in given fiscal year therefore if the cost of an action in this cas the use of an alternative authority in the creation of housing publicprivate partnership is estimated 1 million and is scored at 10 then 100000 of the agencys budget authority for that year must be used to cover the assessment score of 100 would mean that all 1 million would have to be covered by the agencys budget authority in the designated year this scoring is calculated based on the governments degree of exposure or the statistical probability that default on the project by the private contractor will have fi nancial impact on the federal deficit each of the authorities created for the mhpi has an ssociated budget score that was calculated by the office of management and budget 28 the department and the military services have focused their attention on family not unaccompanied housing so it is the 850 million family housing authority that is being exhausted 29 the section leaves unchanged the 150 million budget authority cap on military continuedconstruction maintenance and operation of housing for military pers onnel on or adjacent to military installations to date the military services have negotiated contracts for 32 separate projects that will create or refurbish more than 61000 military family housing units26 this military housing privatization in itiative leverages but does not replace the use of appropriated funds to provi military housing the budget authority needed to support the initiative is calcula ted or scored by the department of defense according to guidelines established by the office of management and budget27 10 usc 2883g imposes limitations on the total value in budget authority of all contracts and investments undertaken using the alternative authorities restricting the departme nt of defense to 850 million for the acquisition or construction of military family housing and 150 million for the acquisition or construction of military unaccompanied housing barracks or dormitories contract negotiations for the creati on of almost 74000 privatized military family housing units are ongoing and the partment of defense is planning to privatize an additional 34000 units during the next few years the department of defense estimates that it will exhaust the budget authority granted to it under the program before the end of the current fis cal year the department therefore has requested that this budget authority limitation be raised28 efforts to raise the budget authority cap section 2806 of hr 4200 the national defense author ization act for fiscal year 2005 engrossed as agreed to or passed by house would repeal the limitation on budget authority applied to military family housing29 the senate version of the bill s

projects on provisions continuedhr 4200 as an amendment in the nature of substitute does not contain similar language and the difference between th two remains to be worked out in conference in the

the same goal was in troduced and passed by the house on july 21 2004 see military construction appropriations in the legislation section below for more information on legislative action it was

the milita ry construction appropriations act for fiscal year 2005 s 2674 when it was laid before the sena on september 15 this amendment would require the department of defense to ssess the impact of the exhaustion of new budget authority on the military family housing program the amendment was accepted into the bill which was then inco rporated into the house version of the military construction appropr iations act hr 4837 becau the language raising the budget authority cap was struck from the house bill on point of order the principal effect of this amendment is to allow the issue to be raised in conference the senate passed the ame nded bill on september 20 2004 section 2805 of the ronald reagan na tional defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 hr 4200 repealed both the budget authority cap and the termination date for the use of the alternative authorities which had been set for december 31 2012 the budget scoring issue di fferences between omb and cbo the congressional budget office has taken i ssue with the office of management and budget interpretation of federal accounting standards in its scoring of the departments alternative authorities the omb calculated its scoring according to the financial liability each authority places on the government thereby recording costs incrementally over time the cbo on the other hand argues that the department is engaging in government activity by supplying family housing in whatever form either government or privately owned to military pers onnel30 the cbo contends that the depar tment of defense exercises significant control over the operation of these housing projects and that the government is the dominant or only source of project income rendering the partnered privatesector corporation effectively an instrument of the government31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32310crs16 31 continued that are written into most partnering contract s these can permit the department of defense to direct or influence business operations control occupancy and access to housing physical and contractual and influence construction and management of the housing development the cbo argues that the department of defe nse is the dominant source of project income because the housing is intended to be occupied by military families throughout its economic life and has the authority to contribute to th partnership itself by contributing land and housing units providing cash contributions and direct loans requiring rent payment by military tenants through pay allotment or by providing single projectwide lumpsum payment per month or by reserving units for military familiesthe leveraging in the privatization initiative occurs when appropriated funds are used either in the form of loan guarantee direct loan or equity stake to assist the privatesector corporation in securing the additional commercial financing necessary to capitalize the project because the cbo regards privatization projects as inherently governmental it considers ll such investments as borrowing authority form of budget authority that should be recorded up front rather than scored over time for its part the departme nt of defense maintains that privatized housing is controlled by private corpora tion not the government that litary members are free to use their housing allowance wherever they wish and that the budget authority recorded is properly limited to the amount of financial liability incurred by the department as calculated by the omb scoring rules in awarding its 32 family housing projects the department of defense has used ombs accounting methodology to record obligations of approximately 580 million the cbo using the rationale explai ned above contends that the full amount of the departments commitments to date approximates 6 billion the office of management and budget devoted significant portion of its statement of administration policy on s 2674 the senate version of the military construction appropriations act for fiscal year 2005 issued on september 20 2004 to an explanation of its position on th issue of the housing privatization cap stating the presidents budget included request that would increase the military housing privatization cap from 850 million to 185 billion this increase will help improve the quality of life of our m ilitary families by eliminating inadequate housing and allowing them the option to rent highquality homes at prices covered by housing allowances furthermor without this increase the current limit would be reached by november 2004 omb would not score any additional cost to this provision because it does not increase the amount of budget authority available to the department of defense dod moreover dod does not need additional budget authority to cover the construction cost of these private projects these projects receive private sector funding and are controlled and managed by private owners and dod does not require service members to live in the units and does not guarantee their occupancy any immediate costs to dod associated with these contracts such as credit subsidies or cash investments are paid for out of funds appropriated to the

urges the senate to either eliminate the cap or raise the cap to the requested 185 billion which is essential to meet the fy2007 dod goal of eliminating inadequate housing units32 significant funding trends between fy1985 and fy1998 funding voted to military construction declined steadily as dod and congress struggled with changing strategic environment shrinking military force and the uncertainties associated with several rounds of base realignments and closures appropriations began to rise with fy1998 as congress sought to replace outdated f acilities and improve th quality of

risen for fy2001 nd fy2002 the request for fy2005 rises above the level requested for fy2004 but fa lls short of projec tions made several years ago in fy2001 dod anticipated that its annual construc

committees according to 10 usc 2805 the secretary of defense is permitted to initiate construction projects that have not been either authorized or specifically appropriated for using funds in what is referred to as the unspecified minor construction appropriation account this authority is intended for use only under circumstances where the need for construction coul d not have been foreseen in time to request an appr opriation through the normal pr ocess and in the case where such construction would correct deficiency that threatens life health or safety authority is limited to projects that will cost 3 million or less34 the committee observed that in the period since sept ember 11 2001 this authority has been frequently used to justify projects such as gates inspection facilities and even firing range that are primarily intended as antiterrorismforce protection measures all of which should by now be readily id entifiable sufficiently far in advance to appear in the normal
