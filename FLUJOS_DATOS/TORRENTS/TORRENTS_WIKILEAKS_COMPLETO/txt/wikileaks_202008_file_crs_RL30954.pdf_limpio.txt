sporting ev ents s 718 mccain et and hr 1110 graham et seek to accomplish th is by implementing national gambling impact study commission recommendation that gambling on college and high school sporting events be completely banned existing federal law outlaws gambling on all professional and amateur sporting events but exempts sports gambling in those states where it had been legalized prior to the federal prohibition s 718 and h r 1110 effectively repeal the exemption with respect to amateur sports gambling nevada is now the only state where such gambling is lawful in addition to implementing th commissions recommendation proponents claim the bills protect the integrity of amateur sports and help reduce gambling among the young particularly on college campuses critics contend that it will needlessly impose an economic hardship on the state of nevada and is incompatible with the principles of federalism s 338 ensign et hr 641 gibbons et takes different tack it seeks to reduce illegal sports gambling among th young through series of research prosecutorial and administrative initiatives to eliminate gambling on college campuses and reduce illegal sports gambling it creates sports gambling task force increases the maximum fede ral criminal pe nalties for sports gambling calls for studies on sports gambling by juveniles and enforcement of existing gambling laws and urges educational and governmental entities to develop and execute youth gambling education and prevention programs the principal criticism of this ensigngi bbons proposal to date is that while

prohibitions introduction the national gambling impact study commission reported widespread sports gambling on college campuses and although closely divided recommended that gambling on collegiate and amateur athletic events be completely outlawed as in the 106th congress the sports gambling measures introduced thus far in this congress fall into two categories those that impose complete ban on amateur sports gambling s 718 mccain et h r 1110 graham et and those that seek to reduce campus gambling and illegal sports gambling s 338 ensign et hr 641 gibbons et background there are more than few federal gambling laws most but not all are designed to reenforce state gambling laws several refer to sports gambling and others have sufficient breadth to encompass it for example the wire act 18 usc1804 which proscribes the intersta transmission of bets or gambling information speaks of gambling on sporting events and contests specifically the travel act 18 usc 1952 which criminalizes interstate travel to conduct the affairs of various unlawful activities and the federal prohibition on illegal gambling business 18 usc 1955 on the other hand do not mention sports gambling as such but reach illegal gambling generally not all federal gambling laws impose criminal penalties the professional and amateur sports protection act paspa 28 usc 37013704 for instance merely entitles the attorney general and various sports organizations to federal court order enjoining governmental entities and their contractors from sponsoring licensing or engaging in sports gambling and lthough the lottery broadcast ban 18 usc 1305 carries criminal penalties it is enfo rced primarily through the regulatory authority of the federal communications commission since federal gambling laws have often been crafted to mirror state gambling policies when gambling policies in the states became more ambivalent so too did federal law1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30954crs2 form of economic benefits despite

state legislati on that authorizes host of public and private gambling activities that congress has generally exempted staterun lotteries and casinos from federal gambling legislation reflects decision to defer to and even promote differing gambling policies in different states indeed in edge we identified the federal interest furthered by 1304s partial broadcast ban as the congressional policy of balancing the interests of lottery and nonlotte ry states whatever its character in 1934 when 1304 was adopted the federal policy of discouraging gambling in general and casino gambling in

wish to apply this new prohibition retroactively to oregon or delaware which instituted sports lotteries prior to the introduction of our legislation neither has the committee any desire to threaten the economy of nevada which over many decades has come to depend on legalized private gambling including sports gambling as an essential industry or to prohibit lawful s ports gambling schemes in other states that were in operation when the legislation was introduce d therefore it provides an exemption for those sports gambling operations which alread are permitted under state law furthermore it specifically excludes dog and horse racing and jaialai from the bills prohibitions the house report in the last congress noted that the grandfathered states were delaware montana oregon and nevada

conyers berman scott watt jacksonlee delahunt and weinerwe are further concerned that hr 3575 the predecessor to hr 1110 may run afoul of the constitutional requirement under the commerce clause which limits congressional au thority to the regulation of interstate commerce and under the 10th amendment which reserves all of the unenumerated powers to the states this is particular concern in light of the recent supreme court decisions such as united states v morrison lopez v united states new york v united states and printz v united states srept 10716 at 18 2001 minority views of sens ensign breaux and boxer 14 id the fifth amendments takings clau prohibits the government from taking private property for the public use without ju st compensation the us supreme court in ruckelshaus v monsanto co 467 us 986 1003 1984 held that the takings clause protects both tangible and intangible property rights such as gambling infrastructure and gambling licenses respectively indeed cong ress has previously recognized that federal gambling legislation can have the effect of in juring private property interests senate report 102248 1991 s 718s prohibiti on on state regulated college sports wagering without compensation violates the takings clause 15 first we have upheld wide variety of congressional acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate commerce examples include the regulation of in trastate coal mining intrastate extortionate credit transactions ie loansharking restaurants utilizin g substantial interstate supplies inns and hotels catering to interstate gues ts and production and consumption of homegrownmitigate the threat that gambling poses to the integrity of amateur athletics and reduce the extent of illegal sports gambling11 opponents respond that the proposals ve substantial and unfair economic impact on the state of nevada and one of its principal employers whose regulated gambling activities do not imperil the integrity such as it is of amateur athletics and that there are effective ways to reduce the extent of illegal sports gambling an objective the proposals do not achieve12 they also argue that the proposals are constitutionally suspect as an impermissible intrusion on state prerogatives13 and governmental taking without just compensation14 critics constitutional contentions appear to have something of an uphill climb as lopez explained and morrison confirms congress commerce clause powers extend to activities that have substantial affect on interstate commerce and to economic enterprises which even if intrastate have an impact on commerce sports gambling particularly when conducted within casino in nevada appears to fit comfortably among the examples of economic activity which the supreme court finds within congress power under the commerce clause15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30954crs6 wheat united states v lopez 514 us 549 55960 1995 cited in with approval in united states v morrison 529 us 598 610 2000 16 we held in new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 that congress cannot compel the states to enact or enforce fede ral regulatory program today we hold that congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the states officers directly prinz v united states 521 us 899 935 1997 in new york congress sought to require the states to regulate the disposal of radioac tive waste found within their borders by insisting that they either assume ownership of the wa ste or to accept liability for damages caused by the waste the statute in prinz instructed state officials to conduct background checks on potential handgun buyers 17 reno v condon 528 us 141 15051 2000internal quot ations and citations generally omittedwe agree with south carolinas assertion that the dppas provisions will require time and effort on the part of state employees but reject the states argument that the dppa violates the principles laid down in either new york or printz we think instead that this cases is governed by our decision in south carolina v baker 485 us 505 1988 in baker we upheld statute that prohibited stat from issuing unregistered bonds because the law regulated state activities rather than seeking to control or influence the manner in which states regulate private parties 18 the judicial power of th united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state usconst amend xialthough matter lies within congress authority under the commerce clause efforts to exercise that authority may fail if inconsistent with the principles of federalism reflected in the tenth amendm ent thus congress in the name of commerce may not compel state to enact federal regulatory scheme nor compel the state or its officers to enforce such scheme16 congress may regulate state activities within its powers under the commer ce clause however as long as it does not compel the states to exercise regulatory authority over others for instance the drivers privacy protection act 18 us c 27212725 bans the state departments of motor vehicles from releasing certain motor vehicle registration information information which some ve traditionally sold excep t for federally approved purposes the act survived federalism cha llenge based on new york and printz because it was deemed to constitute the regu lation of state activity not the control of state regulation of the activities of others17 the prohibitions against state sponsorsh ip or operation of sports gambling activities are clearly an example like condon and baker of federal regulation of state activity whether the licensing prohibition merely constitutes ban on state activity or crosses the line as federal command that the state regulate its citizenry per federal instruction is much closer question of course the eleventh amendment comes to mind whenever statute enacted under claim of commerce clause powers pur ports to vest federa l court jurisdiction for private suit against state or its officials18 the eleventh amendment proscription however is subject to limita tion which permits so injunctive reliefhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30954crs7 19 the difference between the type of relief barred by the eleventh amendment and that permitted under ex parte young will not in many instances be that between day and night an allegation of an ongoing violat ion federal law where the requested relief in prospective eg injunctive is ordinarily sufficient to invoke the young idaho v coeur dalene tribe 521 us 261 281 1997 see also board of trustees v garrett 121 us 955 968 n9 2001our holding here that congress did not validly abrogate the states sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals for money damages under title i does not mean that persons with disabilities have federal recourse against discrimination title i of the ada still prescribes standards applicable to the states those standards can be enforced by the united states in actions for money damages as well as by private individuals in actions for injunctive relief under ex parte young 20 to say nothing of the fact that nevada sport gambling entrepreneurs may have to overcome contentions 1 that their reasonabl expectations were always clouded by the general possibility that either the state of nevada or the congress would eliminate their governmentally created monopoly 2 that they should have expected that congress might conclude that the nevada exception undermined the effectiveness of the otherwise nation wide amateur sports gambling ban and 3 that its federally created monopoly status accounts for much the value to be lost if the nevada exemption were extinguished even assuming compensationentitling taking the appropriate remedy may be recourse to the tucker act for compensation rather than holding the statute unconstitutionalagainst state officials for vi olations of federal law ex parte young 209 us 123 190819 this seems to be precisely what the propos als contemplate critics face less formidable obstacles in any effort to establish takings clause claim as threshold matter party challenging governmental action as an unconstitutional taking bears substantial burden for not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be taking in the constitutional sense eastern enterprises v apfel 524 us 498 523 1998 in the absence of physically intrusive taking where regulation places limitations on property that fall short of eliminating all ec onomically beneficial use taking nonetheless may have occurre d depending on complex of factors including the regulations economic effect on the property owner the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable i nvestmentbacked expectations and the character of the government action palazzolo v rhode island 533 us 606 617 2001 when the challenged governmental action occurs within field of highly regulated activity like gambling the task of establishing taking may be even more daunting eastern enterprises 524 us at 52820 proponents might well point out that the proposals introduce new constitutional questions they merely follow the legislative path established by the professional and amateur spor ts protection act they might argue that passage of act suggests that congress saw constitutional impediment to enactment of the original statute moreover they may c ontend that the provision in s 718 for prompt judicial review of the proposals constitutionality precludes objection on constitutional groundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30954crs8 21
