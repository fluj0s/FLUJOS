standard is set of tec hnical specifications that provides common design for product or proce ss relating to products ranging from typewriter keyboards to high technology comput er protocols standards are pervasive in the modern economy standards sometime s arise through government action or through the operation of the marketplace however private industry groups called standards bodies have long been ac tive in promulgating standards standards bodies and their members have encountered growing number of claims that privately held intellectual property right such as copyright or patent covers an industry standard mos t of these asserti ons have i nvolved patents if the patent is valid and enforceab it is possible that the standard cannot be employed without infringing that patent striking balance between open industr standards on one hand and exclusive intellectual property rights on the other is an important component of contemporary industrial policy industry s tandards potentially bring economic benefits ranging from broad range of interoperable produc ts to more robust competitive markets in turn intellectual property rights m ay promote innovation the disclosure of new inventions and technology transfer c onflicts between industry standards and intellectual property rights require caref ul weighing of these competing interests aware of potential conflicts between industrystandards and intellectual property rights many standards bodies have enacted intellectual property polices although these policies vary they generally requi re that members of the standards body 1 disclose intellectual property that is per tinent to proposed standard and 2 license the intellectual property to other s often on reasonable and nondiscr iminatory terms past litigation and governmental ag ency actions have involved cases where member of standards body allegedly did not abide by these obligations various legal doctrines including contract law fraud equitable estoppel and antitrust law have been employed to compel the obs ervance of disclosure and licensing commitments however some uncertain ty surrounds the enforceability of the intellectual property polices of standards bodies particularly against individuals and firms that were not members of the gr oup that promulgated the standard should congress have an interest in this area several options present themselves action need be taken if the current relationship between industry standards and intellectual property is deemed satisfactory partic ularly as standards bodies become increasinglyaware of intell ectual propertyand as the growing number of judicial precedents may make the legal situation clearer congress might also encourage the development of model intell ectual property disclosure and licensing obligations for use by standards bodies assist standards bodies in identifying intellectual property that pertains to pr oposed standard and as possible more far reaching legal reform encourage proprietors to disclose intellectual properties that bear upon proposed industry standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31951contents fundamentals of standards and standards bodies 3 t h ei m p c

and industry standards virtually every participant in the m odern economy is familiar with the concept of an industry standard set of technical specifications that provides common design for product or process1for example electrical plugs and outlets ordinarily conform to standard voltage impedance and plug shape in the absence of such specifications consumers might face significant difficulties in obtaining safe and functional products the contemporary m arketplace provides countless other examples of standardized products ranging from typewriter keyboards to automobile transmissions to internet connection proto cols commentator james surowiecki has concluded that standards are so significan t that without standardization there wouldnt be modern economy2 standards come into existence throug h number of mechanisms including the operation of the marketplace and government regulation3another principal vehicle for standard formation is the activity f standards body standards body sometimes termed standards setting organization or standards developing organization4 is private industry group that sets standards for its members5as the us economy becomes more oriente d towards networked information technologies the number of standard s bodies has increased in recent years6many large high technology firms are members of dozens of standards bodies7 standards bodies and their

patent owner later informs members of the telecommunications industry that the ir phones use proprietary technology potential conflict arises if an intellectual property right is valid and enforceable its owner may possess the ability to prevent others from employing the standard altogether9on the other hand because license fees are often paid to owners of intellectual property that is incorporat ed into standard standards may provide significant incentives for firms to innovate and to permit the use of patented invention within standard10 the intersection of industry standards and intellectual property is of particular significance to entrepreneurs and small firms on one hand these entities may be especially reliant upon intell ectual property rights in order to capture the benefits of their innovations11on the other industry standards m ay particularly advantage individuals and small companies sta ndards can ensure that new products are compatible with establishe d ones allowing small entities to access larger user base than they might otherwise enjoy12more generally the interaction between industry standards and intellectual property is n important consideration in the modern economy determining whether members f the public are free to use the standard or not whether products can be built to the standa rd when multiple intellectual property rights apply and whether climate fa vorable to innovation is preserved13 this report considers the impact of industr standards and intellectual property law upon innovation this report first in troduces the

pennsylvania law review 2002 761fundamentals of standards and standards bodies the impact of standardization standards are ubiquitous in the modern us economy14for example products ranging from soda cans to light bulbs to batte ries come in standard sizes consumers routinely fax documents to each other using fax machines from different manufacturers and typists easily switch from one qwerty keyboard to another standards are so prevalent in the current us marketplace that the absence of standardization sometimes surprises cons umers computer users who transfer files between word and word perfect for example may unexpectedly discover the lack of interoperability between data storage protocols of these competing word processing software packages many benefits may result from the us of standards standards may convey information about the product regulate quality ensure compatibility and enhance competition15for example foods labeled low sodium communicate the fact that their sodium content is below certain standards set by the federal government other sorts of standards such as professional licensing requirements or safety codes can improve public health and safety one example is building codes which guard against construction companies from fabricating dangerous housing16a standard that allows interoperability also facilitates the manufacturin g and sale of new products by increasing both the likelihood of sufficient volume of business for manufacturers and of sufficient range of interoperable p roducts for consumers standards can also lead to robust competitive market for re placement parts or product maintenance17 the benefit of standards is most noticeable in markets that exhibit network effects18in such markets the value of pr oduct is function of how many other consumers use compatible product19a classic example is the telephone system where the worth of the system may be measured by the total number of subscribers20 suppose for example that two mutually

examples of markets that eventually tipped in favor of single dominant entrant22 in markets driven by network effects the availability of standards can support competition policy without standard single firm would likely be the sole provider of dominant network technology standards instead allow multiple firms to supply services and equipment whic h may lower prices and lead to greater consumer choices23 standards may also lead to negative economic consequences however standardization can reduce competition by diminishing the ability of competitors to differentiate their products24the specifications of particular standard may make it harder for one firm to make product better or cheaper for example some standards may also increase circumstances of consumer lockin25lockin occurs when consumer faces significant costs in switching from one technologyto another it is easy enough for consumer to switch from ford to chevrolet automobile for example but changing computers from macintosh to windowsbased machine may entail certain costs the purchas of different computer may require consumer to purchase new software buy new printer and other hardware peripheral devices convert text and other files an d in general become familiar with the new machine26standardized products may lead to such significant lockin effects that consumers may be strongly discouraged from changing products even where the new product is superior similarly standardizatio n may also retard innovation27once particular market achieves standardization one firm may find that

to increme ntal rather than pioneering innovation28 the formation of industry standards product standardization can occur through three principal mechanisms the operation of the marketplace government intervention and private standards bodies29 first consumers may gravitate toward one product and reject its competitors resulting in facto standard30as noted previously facto standardization is most common in markets that exhibit strong network effects where there are large benefits from using the same p roduct that everyone else does31given the dominant market share of the windows operating syste m for example consumers that opt for this system both gain access to an extensive array of compatible hardware and software and find it easy to share information with others second the government sometime s sets obligatory standards32for example the federal communications commission dictates various standards for the electronic equipment used in the teleco mmunications and broadcasting industry as result of these standards it is possible to receive signals broadcast by multiple television stations with the same tel evision equipment across the country33 the third possibility is that members of industry agree on standard through the auspices of standards body34a large number of standards bodies are active in the united states featuring diverse organiza tion structures some are standing entities while others are formed on an ad hoc basis f or the purpose of promulgating single standard membership in some standards bodi is restricted while other standards bodies are open to any interested party although standards bodies employ varying procedures in broad outline most standard bodies employ the following process first proponent of standard develops technical specification that d etails the key points of technology and preliminarily defines the scope of the intended standard this specification is subject to commentary from members of the standa

secrecy guards against the improper appropriation of valuable commercially useful information that is the subject of reasonable measures to preserve its secrecy49taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society50also while the patent law obliges inventors to disclose their inventions to the public51trade secret protection requires firms to hold their protections in secret t he disclosure obligations of the patent system may better serve the goals of encouraging the diffusion of advanced technological knowledge the patent system has long been subject to criticism however some observers believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets52others believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer t acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity53still other commentators suggest that the patent system often converts pioneering i nventors into technological suppressors who use their patents to block subsequent improvements and thereby impede technical progress54 when analyzing these contending views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analytical methods available for analyzing the effect of the patent law upon the us economy as whole the relations hip between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood concerned observers simply do not know what market impacts would result from changing patent term from its current twentyyear period for example55consequently current economic an d policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in

standards and intellectual property conflicts potentially arise between industr standards and intellectual property rights70when one firm has manufactured produc ts or performed processes that comply with an industry standard sometime s another entity has asserted that those products or processes infringe an intell ectual property right the possibility of license fees and royalties may provide s ignificant incentive for firms to innovate and to permit the incorporation of propr ietary technology into standard71on the other hand the intellectual property hol der may possibly prevent others from using the standard altogether for set period of time72past disputes in this area have generally involved patent rights rev iew of three wellpublicized examples illustrates the potential tension

royaltyfree basis to other members102this arrangement apparently contemplates that the patent could be enforced against firms that are not members of the standards body other standards bodies instead require that the patent be licensed on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms standa rd commonly known as rand licensing103 some policies do not specify whether this obligation applies to members and nonmembers alike104according to mr lemley although the rand standard is commonly employed it is not often further fined in terms of specific royalty rate and other clauses105 some standards bodies mandate that in circumstances where patent covers proposed standard it is more difficult to dopt that standard for example at least one standards body requires threequarter s majority to adopt standard covered by patent106other standards bodies make it eas ier to revoke pre viously adopted standard if it is later revealed that patent covers that standard107 in sum the intellectual property policie s of standards bodies vary considerably one implication of this diversity of rules is that intellectual property owners may face difficulty in knowing the particular rules t hat will govern

keeping with standards body policies as well firm that is not member of the standards body may assert patent against competitor t hat sells products co mpliant with the standard in such circumstances the standards body or its members may wish to continue to employ its standard free of the in tellectual property right past disputes of this kind have largely been based upon c ontract law the doctrines of fraud and equitable estoppel as well as the antitrust law111this report reviews these doctrines in turn the intellectual property policy of standards body amounts to an agreement between members to comply with certain rules regarding their intellectual properties112the failure of one member of the standards body to comply with these rules could be considered breach of binding contract the contract law would therefore appear to be principal mechanism for enforcing one members promises regarding intellectual property several difficulties attend the use of contract law in this context however first the intellectual property policy of st andards body can only bind members of that group113nonmembers are not parties to the contract and cannot be held to have agreed to it second the intellectual propertypolic ies of standards bodies sometimes employ vague language for example some standa rds bodies require only that intellectual property rights be licensed on reas onable and

reasonable based upon the treatment of patents of similar scope in related industries116 in addition contracts without specifi ed term may ordinarily be terminated at will by any contracting party so long as appropriate notice is given to the other party117an example of this general rule is the familiar employeeatwill doctrine where employees may resign from their position or be fired at any time provided that reasonable notice is given118this principle leaves open the possibility that member of standards body may simply w ithdraw from the group after standard has been formed in such cases that firm may longer be subject to the groups intellectual property policy contract law does provide one appro ach for ameliorating this difficulty standards bodies bylaws could provide that members must disclose or license patents that cover any standard adopted or under c onsideration while the member was member of the standards body this promise should be enforceable even after member has resigned from the standards body119the number of standards bodies that have actually adopted this po licy is uncertain however the doctrine of fraud provides another m echanism for policing behavior during the standardssetting process the legal system generally defines fraud to include the following elements 1 false represen tation or omission in the face of duty to disclose 2 of material fact 3 made intentionally and knowingly 4 with the intent to mislead 5 with reasonable reliance by the misled party and 6 resulting in damages to the misled party120if member of standards body knowingly failed to disclose the existence of an intellectual property right then an accused infringer may be able to assert the existence of all six elements of fraud121 an assertion of fraud presents some difficulties when used to enforce standards bodies rules however notably the proponent of fraud defense may find it difficult to prove that the intellectual property wner possessed specific intent to defraud other members of the standards body122additionally the doctrine of fraud is premised upon the existence of duty of hone sty between the intellectual propertyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31951crs18

to be successfully employed by entities that were not members of the standards body includi ng other market actors and consumers124 an additional legal mechanism for ensuring compliance with intellectual property polices is termed equitable est oppel equitable estoppel applies when patentee through misleading conduct leads t he alleged infringer to reasonably infer that the patentee does not intend to enforce its patent against the alleged infringer conduct may include specific statements ac tion inaction or silence where there was an obligation to speak125equitable estoppel serves as defense to charge of patent infringement the accused infringer must show that it relied upon the misleading conduct and that it will be materially prejudiced if the patent is enforced126 courts have applied the quitable estoppel doctrine in cases where member of standards body fails to disclose its intellect ual property rights during the standard setting process127in one case stambler v diebold inc 128an individual was estopped from enforcing his patent eve n though the standards body did not have an intellectual property policy at all in that case stambler invented new card validation system for use with automatic teller machines he later sat on an ansi standards committee that ultima tely developed an industr standard that stambler believed infringed his patent stambl er subsequently left the committee without informing it of his patent later stambler brought suit against an automatic teller machine manufacturer that employed the i ndustry standard the us district court for the eastern district of new york held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied concluding plaintiff had duty to speak out and his silence was affirmatively misleading plaintiff could not remain silent while an entire industry implemented the proposed standard and then when the standards were adopted assert that his patent covered what manufacturers believed to be an open and available standard furthermore plaintiffs sile nce could reasonably be interpreted as an indication that plaintiff had abandoned its patent claims129 the estoppel doctrine provides one mech anism for enforcing implied or express promises to disclose intellectual pr operty that bears upon proposed industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31951crs19 130david m schneck setting the standard problems presented

however estoppel does not appear to operate against i ntellectual property owners that were not members of the standards body estoppel als does not appear to relate well to other obligations imposed by standards policies such as the duty to license intellectual property on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms132 another cause of action that has been employed in this context is based upon the antitrust law133antitrust law aims to protect the integrity of market competition against attempts to raise prices or reduce output either by single firm that dominates the market and excludes competition or by group of firms that act collectively to coordinate their price and output decisions134in the context of standards an antitrust plaintiff could contend that firm attempted to obtain market dominance by abusing the standardsetting process perhaps by failing to disclose pertinent intellectual property or by fa iling to license it under the terms established by standards bodys intell ectual property policy to date most antitrust causes of ac tion involving standards have involved claims of attempted monopolization135to prove claim of attempted monopolization the proponent must show 1 specific intent to monopolize 2 anticompetitive conduct in furtherance of th at intent and 3 dangerous probability of successful monopolization136as applied to standards bodies the proponent of this claim must prove that the intellectual property owners misrepresentations manipulated the standardsetting process in such way that the intellectual property owner gained market power137 unlike fraud and equitable estoppel whic h are defenses raised against charge of intellectual property infringemen t attempted monopoliz ation constitutes an affirmative cause of action that may be asserted by any interested party138however claim of attempted monopo lization may be difficult to prove at least in the context of standards bodies courts have ge nerally imposed high standards of proofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31951crs20 139lemley supra note 1 140ibid 141ibid 142mueller supra note 5on attempted monopolization claims139as result antitrust claims will likely be limited to cases where an intellectual property owners actions lead to significant anticompetitive consequences140 in sum standards bodies and their memb ers have relied upon number of legal theories in order to enforce disclosure and licensing obligations each with their own advantages and shortcomings mr lemley c oncludes that taken together these legal rules do fair job of ensuring that i ntellectual property owners do what they promised to do141however there appear to be mechanisms in place that will enforce an industry standard against indivi duals and firms that were not themselves members of the group that promulgated the standard legislative issues and approaches given the wide recognition that intellect ual property and industry standards are of growing importance to the modern economy the relationship between these fields is the subject of increasing attention142should congress have an interest in this area variety of approaches are available if the current interface between intellectual property rights and industry standards is c onsidered satisfactory then action need be taken indeed growing awareness that int ellectual propertya nd industrystandards can sometimes conflict may lead to more sophisticated treatment of intellectual property by standards bodies as well as tinued refinement of the governing law in the courts another approach is to encourage the t echnology community to develop model intellectual property disclosure and licen sing obligations for members of standards bodies standards bodies would then be in position to follow these guidelines when developing their own intellectual prope rty policies this proposal might potentially lead to more uniform treatment of intellect ual properties by standards bodies given the present diversity of intellectual pr operty polices among standards bodies development of best practices for intell ectual property may be welcome it should be noted however that these voluntary gui delines would not necessarily bind all patent owners firms might still be subject to suit by patentees that have not joined the relevant standards body for example the government could also assist standa rds bodies in identifying intellectual properties that might bear upon propos ed industry standard for example the united states patent and trademark offi ce could upon request by standard body conduct search of pending patent appli cations and issued patents in order to determine whether these patents might bear upon proposed standard this capability would allow standards bodies to become more fully informed of intellectual property rights during the st andardsetting process it should be notedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31951crs21 143steve d beyer searching the art behind an opinion 667 practising law

required to identify intellect ual properties that are pertin ent to the standard within set period of time failure to so identify applicable intellectual property to the standards body might result in some limitation upon infringement remedies against firms that practice the standard one possibility is to grant compulsory license in favor of use of the industry standard per haps limited to set period of time so that the industry might develop standard not subj ect to an intellectual property another is that the patentee be unable to enforce the i ntellectual property against individuals practicing that industry standard for pe riod of time or perhaps altogether144 any possible legal reform would be welladvised to recognize that the us high technology industry is increasingly char acterized both by rapid innovation and high degree of interconnectedness the desire to capture the benefits of research and development leads innovators to procure pat ents yet firms also desire to create compatible products and secure greater aggreg ate sales resulting in the development of nonproprietary uniform standards th two trends have sometimes led to conflicts between exclusive intellect ual property rights and open industry standards145striking balance between promoting innovation on one hand and maintaining the integrity of the standardsetting process on the other forms an
