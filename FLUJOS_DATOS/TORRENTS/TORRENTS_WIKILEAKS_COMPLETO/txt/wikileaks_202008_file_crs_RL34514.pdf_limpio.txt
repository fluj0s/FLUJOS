operations investigator and investigative research specialists and 1765 other positions17 the administration budget request includes increases for specific purposes by decision unit the southwest border enforcement increase mentioned above is the only requested atf budget enhancement for fy2009 although congress does t appropriate monies for the atf or any other doj agency by decision unit the appropriators often address whether such increases are to be provided in report language and more rarely in the bill language for the salaries and expenses account itself as consequence the requested amounts for decision units are binding in the sense that the appropriators are aware of the increases that were provided for and how they would affect the decision unit totals in addition if funding is shifted from one decision unit to another statutory budget reprogramming requirements are usually triggered under which the doj and its agencies are required to notify and seek the approval of the appropriations committees tf budget decision units or budget programs are described in greater detail below

an estimated level of resources that an agency would need to provide the anticipated level of services for the current fiscal year in the next fiscal year in the past base budgets did not include adjustments to the number of permanent pos itions and the number of aut horized permanent positions was generally static unless changed by congress by increasing or decreasing funding associated with
