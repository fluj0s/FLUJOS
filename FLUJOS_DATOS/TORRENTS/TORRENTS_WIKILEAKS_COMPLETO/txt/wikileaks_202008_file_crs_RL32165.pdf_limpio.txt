competitive challenges posed by chinese imports have led several members to call for more aggressive us stance agains t certain chinese trade policies they deem to be unfair among these is the value of the chinas currency the renminbi or yuan relative to the dollar from 1994 to july 2005 china pegged its currency to the us dollar on july 21 2005 china announced it would let its currency immediately appreciate by 21 and link its cu rrency to basket of currencies rather than just to the dollar although th yuan has appreciated 16 since 2005 many members complain that china continues to manipulate its currency in order to gain an unfair trade advantage resulting in u s job loss numer ous bills have been introduced to induce china to adopt more flexible currency policy if the yuan is undervalued against the dolla r as many analysts believe there are likely to be both benefits and costs to the us economy it would mean that imported chinese goods are cheaper than th ey would be if the yuan were market determined this lowers prices for us consumers and dampens inflationary pressures it also lowers prices for us firms that use importe d inputs such as parts in their production making such firms more competitive when the us runs trade deficit with the chinese this requires capital inflow from china to the united states such as chinese purchases of us treasury securities this in turn lowers us interest rates and increases us i nvestment spending on the negative side lower priced goods from china may hurt u s industries that compete with those products reducing their produc tion and employment in addition an undervalued yuan makes us exports to china more expensive thus reducing the level of us exports to china and job opportunities for u s workers in those sectors however in the long run trade can affect only th composition of employment not its overall level thus inducing china to appreciate its currency would likel benefit some us economic sectors but would harm others us data indicate that in 2008 imports from china have slowed significantly and that import prices have risen sharply some economists are now concerned that the overall fall in the dollar which stronger yuan would exacerbate coul d become economically destabilizing critics of chinas currency policy contend that the large and growing us trade deficit with china 256 billion in 2007 is evidence that the yuan is undervalued and harmful to the us economy however the relationship is more complex first an increasing level of chinese exports are from foreigninvested companies in china second the deficit masks the fact that chin has become one of the fastest growing and is now the third largest market for us exports finally the trade deficit with china accounted for 29 of the sum of tota l us bilateral trade deficits in 2007 indicating that the overall us trade deficit is not caused by the exchange rate policy of one country but rather th shortfall between us sa ving and investment that being said there are number of reasons why more flexible currency policy could benefit both countries for brief summa ry of this report see crs report rs21625 chinas currency summary

convertible on current account basis such as for trade transactions but not on capital account basis for various types of financial flows such as portfolio investment in addition holdings of foreign exchange by chinese firms and individuals are regulated by the government chinas currency economic issues and options for us trade policy introduction from 1994 until july 21 2005 chin maintained policy of pegging its currency to the us dollar at an exchange rate of roughly 828 yuan to the dollar1 the chinese central bank maintained this peg by buying or selling as many dollar denominated assets in exchange for newly printed yuan as needed to eliminate excess demand supply for the yuan as result the exchange rate between the yuan and the dollar basically stayed the same desp ite changing economic factors which could have otherwise caused the yuan to either appreciate or depreciate relative to the dollar under floating exchange rate system the relative demand for the two countries goods and assets w ould determine the exchange rate of the yuan to the dollar many economists contend that for the first several years of the peg the fixed value was likely close to the market value but in the last few years of the peg economic conditions changed such that the yuan would likely have appreciated if it had been floating the chinese government modified its currency policy on july 21 2005 it announced that the yuans exchange rate would become adjustable based on market supply and demand with reference to exchan ge rate movements of currencies in basket it was ter announced that the composition of the basket includes the dollar the yen the euro and few other currencies and that the exchange rate of the us dollar against the yuan would be immediately adjusted from 828 to 811 an appreciation of about 21 unlike true floating exchange rate the yuan would according to the chinese government be allowed to fluctuate by 03 later increased to 05 on daily basis against the basket it remained not fully convertible in internationa l markets and china conti nued tight restrictions and controls over capital transactions2 the current situation mig ht be best described as managed float market forces are determining the general direction of the yuans movement but the government is re tarding its rate of appreciation through market intervention since july 2005 china has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily but slowly it has continued to accumulate foreign reserves at rapid pace which suggests thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs2 3 brief summary of this report can be found in crs report rs21625 chinas currency summary of the economic issues by wayne morrison and marc labonteif the yuan were allowed to freely float it would appreciate more rapidly chinas foreign exchange reserves grew from 403 billion at the end of 2003 to 17 trillion at the end of march 2008 and chinas rge trade surplus totaled 262 billion in 2007 since the 2005 reforms there has b een significant shift in the economic environment in china and the united states the yuan has risen 16 against the dollar far more than the japanese yen during the same period for example the overall value of the dollar has fallen significantly to the point where some economists and policymakers fear that further fall could be destabilizing to the us economy by definition any rise in the yuan is equivalent to fall in the dollar partly as result of the falling dollar total us exports are the fastest growing sector of the economy and the growth rate of imports from china appears to have slowed recently nevertheless the increase in the value of the yuan to date has done little to ease concerns raised in the united states but china with concerns about its own economy has been reluctant to make sign ificant changes to their currency this paper reviews the various economic issues raised by chinas present currency policy3 major topics surveyed include the economic concerns raised by the united states over chinas currency policy and chinas concer ns over changing that policy how chinas fixed exchange rate regime works and the various economic studies that have attempted to determine chinas real or market exchange rate trends and factors in the uschina trade imbalance what is causing it is chinas currency policy to blame economic consequences of china s currency policy for both china and the united states chinas massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and purchases of us fede ral debt instruments policy options on how the united states might induce china to reform its present currency policy including current legislation introduced in congress us concerns over chinas currency policy and recent action many us policymakers business pe ople and labor representatives have charged that chinas currency is signifi cantly undervalued visàvis the us dollarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs3 4 see prepared remarks of dr c fred bergsten president institute for international economics before the house small business committee june 25 2003 5 besides the currency issue several us interest groups have complained about other chinese economic policies deemed unfair incl uding chinese government subsidies selling goods below cost dumping poor environmen tal practices abusive labor practices and piracy of us intellectual property rights these issues are discussed in crs report rl33536 chinaus trade issues by wayne m morrison 6 supporters of this legislation cited estimates of the yuans undervaluation ranging from 15 to 40 they derived the 275 tariff figure in their bill from the average of the low high estimates by as much as 40 making chinese exports to the united states cheaper and us exports to china more expensive than they would be if exchange rates were determined by market forces they furt her argue that the undervalued currency has contributed to the burgeoning us trade ficit with china which has risen from 30 billion in 1994 to 256 billion in 2007 and s hurt us production and employment in several us manufacturing sectors such as textiles and apparel and furniture that are forced to compete domestically and internationally against artificially lowcost goods from china furthermore many anal ysts contend that chinas currency policy induces other east asian countries to inte rvene in currency markets in order to keep their currencies weak against the dollar to remain competitive with chinese goods4 several groups are pressing the bush admin istration to pressu re china either to revalue its currency or to allow it to float freely in international markets5 these issues are addressed in more detail later in the report president bush and administration officials have criticized chinas currency policy on number of occasions stating th at exchange rates should be determined by market forces initially the bush administration rejected calls from several members of congress to apply direct pre ssure on china to force it to abandon its currency peg instead the administration s ought to encourage china to reform its financial system under the auspices of joint technical cooperation program agreed to on october 14 2003 for example and take other measures that would pave the way toward adopting mo re flexible currency policy the administrations position on chinas currency peg appears to have toughened beginning around april 2005 when thenus treasury secretary john snow asserted at g7 meeting on apr il 16 2005 that china is ready now to adopt more flexible exchange rate th is was likely driven in part by growing complaints from members over chinas currency policy and the introduction of numerous currency bills for example during the 109th congressional session the senate on april 6 2005 failed by vote of 33 to 67 to reject an amendment samdt 309 attached by senator sc humer to s 600 foreign relations authorization bill which would have imposed 275 tariff on chinese goods if china failed to substantially appreciate its currency to market levels6 in response to the outcome of the vote the senate republican leadership negotiated an agreement with the supporters of the bill to allo w vote on s 295 which was sponsored by senator schumer and which s same language as samdt 309 at later date as long as the sponsors of the amendment ag reed not to offer similar amendments to other bills for the duration of the 109th congress supporters of s 295 threatened tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs4 7 bls press release available at http wwwblsgovnewsrel

billion in morgan stanley on august 13 2007 chinas xinhua news agency reported that china had plans to sell off its dollar assets the statement appeared to be in response to an article that appeared in the daily telegraph august 10 2007 in which high level chinese government officials reportedly cl aimed that china would sell off its dollar assets if the united states imposed sanctions against

exchange rate policies on semiannual basis focused main ly on major us trading partners china was cited under this re port for manipulating its cu rrency five times from may 1992 to july 1994 largely because of its use of dual exchange rate system which it unified in early 1994 and restrictions that were imposed on access to foreign exchange by domestic firms neither china nor any other country has been designated as currenc manipulator since 199410 however over the past few years the treasury department reports have increased their focus on china and have stepped up criticism of chinas currency polic and the pace of its reforms since china reformed its currency in july 2005 treasury has made the following observations the november 28 2005 report prai sed chinas july 2005 currency reforms but stated that it had failed to fully implement its commitment to make its new exchange rate mechanism more flexible and to increase the role of market forces to determine the yuans value the report further stated that chinas new managed float exchange rate regime which chinese officials described as based on market supply and demand with reference to basket of currencies did not appear to play significant role in determining the daily closing level of the yua n and that trading behavior since the reforms strongly suggested that the new mechanism remains

2practice tightly managed currency peg against the dollar11 however treasury stated that it decided not to cite china as currency manipulator under us trad law because of assurances it had received from chinese officials that china was committed to enhanced marketdetermined currency flexibility and that it would put greater emphasis on promoting domestic sources of growth including financial reform12 the treasury departments june 2007 report stated that although chinas central bank continued to heavily intervene in currency markets and that chinas currenc was significantly undervalued it did not meet the technical requi rements under us law regarding currency manipulation however th report stated that treasury forcefully raises the chinese exch ange rate regime with chinese officials at every available opport unity and will continue to do so13 the treasury departments decembe r 2007 report stated that china should significantly accelerate th appreciation of the rmbs effective exchange rate in order to minimize the risks that are being created for china itself as well as the world economy many members have been critical of treasurys decision since 1994 not to cite china as currency manipulator despite its large scale currency interventions to control the exchange rate with the dolla r its large global current account surpluses and large and growing trade surpluses with the united states many members have called for enactment of legislation to revise the criteria treasury uses to make its currency manipulation determination or to require it to estimate the level of the yuans misalignment against the dollar see the legislation in the 110th congress section below chinas concerns over changing its currency policy chinese officials argue that its currency policy is not meant to promote exports or discourage imports they claim that ch ina adopted its currency peg to the dollar policy that is practiced by variety of developing countries in order to foster economic stability and investor confidence chinese officials have expressed concern that abandoning the current curre ncy policy could spar k an economic crisishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs7 14 china has reportedly eliminated over 60 milli on jobs in the state sector since 1997 layoffs over the past few years have averaged two million annually see morgan stanley global economic forum the coming rebalancing of the chinese economy march 27 2006 15 many analysts counter that chinas cu rrency policy may actually be undermining the financial stability of the banking system beca use in order to purchase foreign currency to maintain target exchange rate the govern ment must boost the money supply while some of this money may be sterilized by governmentissued bonds some of it may enter the economy analysts contend that this has made the banks more prone to extend loans to risky ventures and thus may increase the level of bankheld nonperforming loans 16 chinese officials contend that during the asia n crisis when several other nations sharply devalued their currencies china held the lin by not devaluing its currency which might have prompted new round of destructive valuations across asia this policy was highly praised by us official s including president clinton in china and would especially be damagi ng to its export industries at time when painful economic reforms such as closing down inefficient stateowned enterprises and laying off millions of workers are being implemented14 in addition chinese officials also appear to be worried about the rising level of unrest in the rural areas where incomes have failed to keep up with those in urban areas and public anger has spread over government land seizures and corruption ch inese officials contend that appreciating the currency could reduce dom estic food prices because of increased imports and agricultural exports by raising prices in overseas markets thus lowering the income of farmers and furthe r raising tensions they further contend that the chinese banking system is too underdeveloped and burdened with heavy debt to be able to deal effectively with possible speculative pressures that could occur with fully convertible currency which typica lly accompanies floating exchange rate15 the combination of convertible currenc and poorly regulated financial system is seen to be one of the causes of the 19971998 asian financial crisis16 prior to the crisis chinese officials were reportedly considering moving towards reforming their currency policy but the severe negative economic impact among several east asian countries that had floating currency appears to have convinced officials that chinas currency peg was one of the main reas ons why chinas economy was relatively immune from crisis and that gradually implementing reforms to make the currency more flexible was the best way to maintain stable economic growth us officials counter that they are not asking china to immediately adopt floating currency system but to move more qui ckly to reform the financial sector and to make the currency more flexible incl uding allowing faster appreciation of the yuan widening the band and decreasing the level of interventi on in international currency markets the economics of fixed exchange rates fixed exchange rates have long hist ory of use including the bretton woods system linking the major currencies of th world from the 1940s to the 1960s and the international gold standard before then to understa nd how chinas currency policy works it is easiest to start with an explanation of how fixed exchange rate workshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs8 17 prior 1994 china maintained dual exchange ra system an official exchange rate of about 58 yuan to the dollar and market swap rate used mainly for trade transactions of about 87 yuan to the dollar at the end of 1993 the reforms in 1994 unified the two rates since hong kong also fixes its exchange rate to the dollar china in effect also maintains fixed exchange rate with hong kongwhich china operated until july 2005 under the fixed exchange rate the chinese central bank bought or sold as much currenc as was needed to keep the yuandollar exchange rate constant at level formerly about 828 yuan per dollar17 the primary alternative to this arrangement would be floating exchange rate as the united states maintains with economies like the euro area in which supply and demand in the marketplace causes the eurodollar exchange rate to continually fluctuate under floating exchange rate system the rela tive demand for the two countries goods and assets determines the exchange rate of the euro to the dollar if the demand for euro area goods or assets increased more eu ro would be demanded to purchase those goods and assets and the euro would rise in value if the central bank kept the supply of euro constant to restore equilibrium when fixed exchange rate is equal in value to the rate that would prevail in the market if it were floating the central bank does not need to take any action to maintain the peg howe ver over time economic circ umstances change and with them change the relative demand for c ountrys currency if the chinese had maintained floating exchange rate appr eciation would likely have occurred in the past few years for numbe r of reasons for instance productivity and quality improvements in china may have increas ed the relative demand for chinese goods and foreign direct investment in china for the exchange rate peg to be maintained when economic circumstances have changed requires the central bank to supply or remove as much currency as is needed to bring supply back in line with market demand which it does by increasing or decr easing foreign exchange reserves this is shown in the following accounting identity used to record countrys international balance of payments current account balance capital account balance exportsimports net investment income net unilateral transfers private capital outflowinflow change in foreign exchange reserves net investment income and net unilateral transfers between the united states and china are relatively small so the current acc ount balance is close to the trade balance exports less imports thus anytime net ex ports exports less imports or net private capital inflows private capital inflows less outflows increase foreign exchange reserves must increase by an equivalent amount to maintain the exchange rate peg for the past several years there has b een excess demand for yuan equivalently excess supply of dollars at the prevailing exchange rate peg the central bank maintained the peg through 2005 by increasin g its foreign reserves by buying dollars from the public in exchange for newly printed yuan rather than hold us dollars which earn interest the chinese centr bank mostly holds us financial securities primar ily us treasury securities but also us agency securities eghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs9 18 in march 2007 the chinese finance minister announced that it would shift small portion of the foreign reserves into higher yielding assets presumably these reserves would remain invested in foreign assets otherwise the tfolio shift would alter the currencys value see jim yardley and david barboza china to open fund to invest currency reserves new york times march 9 2007 19 if the demand for yuan relative to dollars were to decline the central bank would face the opposite situation it would need to buy yuan from the public in exchange for us dollars to maintain the peg this strategy could onl be continued until the central banks dollar reserves were exhausted at which point the peg would have to be abandonedthe obligations of fannie mae and

china fixed its exchange rate to currency basket in july 2005 which is similar to fixing the yuan to one currency exce pt the yuan is now theoretically fixed against the weighted average value of the currencies in its basket primarily the dollar euro yen and korean won the exact weights of the currencies in the basket has not been announced obstfeld has noted that it unclear how the yuan could be fixed to basket when the yuan has been much more stable against the dollar than the euro or yen theoretically this means that the yuan would longer be fixed to the dollar since every time the other exchange rates in the basket appreciate or depreciate agai nst the dollar so will the yuan but to lesser extent thus fixing the yuan to basket of currencies does not rule out the possibility that the yuan could appreciate against the dollar anytime the other currencies in the basket appreciate against the dollar there is sta ndard definition of whether an exchange rate is fixed or floating for

the dollar after an initial revaluation of 2 in july 2005 the yuan has appreciated steadily by the end of april 2008 it had appreciated by bout 16 to 7 yuan per dollar see figure 2 the current situation might be best described as managed float market forces are determining the general direction of the yuans movement but the government is retarding its rate of appreciation through market

to time to keep its currency low against the dollar such as japan from 1998200422 the continued rapid accumulation of foreign reserves suggests that if the yuan were allowed to freely fl oat it would

that the extent of yuan undervaluation can be estimated from inflation differentials in ot her words although the nominal exchange rate has been constant adjusting for inflation can determine how much the real rate has depreciated and proves that the yuan is unde rvalued the problem with this approach is that the estimate will be highly sensitive to the selection of the base year for example if the base year was 1996 the yuan would have been undervalued by 14 in 2002 but if the base year was 1994 the yuan would have been overvalued by 5 in 2002 the current account balance was close to zero one definition of equilibrium in both yearspreventing the yuan from appreciating against the dollar is not the only reason the chinese government could be accumulating foreign exchange reserves foreign exchange reserves are necessary to fina nce international trade in the presence of capital controls and to fend off speculation against ones currency country would be expected to increase its foreign rese rves for these purposes as its economy and trade grew however table 1 illustrates that the increase in foreign exchange reserves in china has significantly outpaced the growth of gdp or imports in the last few years when china accumulates foreign reserves that are nonus assets it does not influence the yuans value against the dollar little public information is available on the nature of chinas foreign reserves so it is not known what share of chinas reserves are held in us assets it is also not known what share of the annual increase in reserves is due to new accumulations as opposed to valuation changes exchange rate effects or the reinvestment of earnings economic activity including the level of imports and exports is not determined by the nominal exchange rate but by the real inflationadjusted exchange rate because the united states and china had roughly similar increases in the overall price levels from 1994 to 2003 39 in china vs 31 in the united states the difference between the real and nominal rate was small however china had much higher inflation than the united states from 1994 to 1997 so the real and nominal exchange rates diverged considerably during that time the real exchange rate appreciated from chinas perspective making their exports more expensive and us imports cheaper from then until 2003 th real and nominal exchange rates converged because chinas inflation rate wa s lower than us inflation this can be seen in figure 3 in 2003 the chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms from the chinese persp ective making their exports progressively less expensive since 1997 since then the va lue of the yuan has risen appreciation in the nominal exchange rate has brought the yuan almost back to its 1998 level in real terms23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs13 24 the chinese can try to offset the upward pressure on prices by selling chinese government securities to take the additional yuan out of circulation called sterilized intervention but this will push interest rates back up attracting more foreign capital to china causing the central banks dollar reserves and the supply of yuan to expand again it is difficult to tell whether the chinese ve sterilized their foreign reserve accumulation continuedsource crs calculations based on imf data note real exchange adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index charted is inverted for illustrative purposes in the long run real inflationadjusted exchange rates return to their market value whether they are nominally fixed or floating imagine that the demand for chinese goods and services were to increas if the yuan were floating it would appreciate as more yuan were acquire d to purchase chinese goods it would continue to appreciate until the excess demand for chinese g oods was exhausted since they are now more expensive in term s of foreign currency at which point the trade balance would return to its equilibrium level with fixed exchange rate the real exchange rate returns to its market value through price adjustment instead which takes time if the exchange rate were fixed below the level that would prevail in the market chinese exports would be relativel inexpensive and us imports would be relatively expensive as long as this situation prevailed the trade surplus with the united states would persist the trade surplus plus net remittances is equal to the capital flowing from china to the united states part of this capital consists of the purchase of us assets by private chinese citizens the other portion consists of the accumulation of dollar reserves by the chin central bank by increasing its dollar reserves the central bank is also increasing the supply of yuan this causes the inflation rate in china to rise

low through 2003 but rose to 39 in 2004 however inflation and money growth could have been affected by factors other than reserve accumulati on in recent years it has been argued that sterilization is an unfair practice to use with peg since it is meant to prevent the price adjustment that brings trade between th two countries back into equilibriumbecome more costly abroad and imports less costly at that point the trade surplus will return to its equilibrium value lthough the nominal exchange rate never changed because of the rise in prices the real exchange rate would now equal the market rate that would prevail if the ex change rate had been floating thus undervaluing fixed exchange rate doe s not confer any permanent competitive advantage for countrys exporters and importcompeting industries however because price adjustment takes time floating exchange rates return to the equilibrium value much more quickly than fixed exchange rates thus when country uses its monetary policy to influence the value of it currency it can longer use its monetary and fiscal policy to counteract changes in the business cycle the us loses policy flexibility from chinas peg for example peg would prevent country from lowering its interest rates to offset an economic downturn if it did capital would fl ow out of the country to assets with higher interest rates in the rest of the world and the country would find its currency peg under pressure since inve stors would sell the countrys currency and buy foreign currency to transfer their capital abroad until it raised its interest rates this loss of monetary autonomy is re latively unimportant for small countries that fix their exchange rate to large ne ighbors that share the same business cycle since the large neighbor would also likely be affected by the downturn and lower its interest rates but the loss in autonomy is costly when country is tied to partner to whom it is not closely linked and does not experience similar business cycles as is arguably the case between the united states and china however china loses less monetary aut onomy than most countries with fixed exchange rate through its use of capital controls legal barriers restricting access to foreign currency the currency is convertib on current account basis such as for trade transactions but not on capital acc ount basis for various types of financial flows such as portfolio investment in addition nearly all chinese enterprises are required to turn over their foreign cu rrency holdings to chinas state bank in exchange for yuan and purchases of fore ign exchange by individuals and firms in china are closely regulated because capita l cannot easily leave china when interest rates are lowered china retains some flexibility over its monetary and fiscal policy despite the fixed exchange rate critique of various estimates of the yuans undervaluation although it is certain that the yuan woul d appreciate if the central bank were not increasing its

criticisms of all studies below there some specific criticisms of the preeg estimate first preegs conversion of the rule of thumb from dollar terms to continued1994 there is direct way to determine how much it would appreciate even if there was consensus about what china s current account balance should be there are observations until june 2005 to estima how sensitive its imports and exports would be to changes in the exchange rate estimates of the extent of the yuans undervaluation have been cited in many articles and interv iews this report attempts to evaluate only those estimates in which the author explains how the estimate was derived it should be noted that many of the estimates were made some time ago when the value of the yuan and chinas trade surplus were lower so the yuan may be more or less undervalued at this point the estimates are grouped below into two broad methodological categories the f undamental equilibrium exchange rate method and the purchasin g power parity method estimates based on fundamental equilibrium exchange rates one method for estimating misalignments in exchange rates is referred to as the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate f eer method it is based on the belief that current account balances at the present are temporarily out of line with their fundamental value either because of unsustainable forces in the economy or government intervention once an estimate has been made of what the fundamental current account balance should be one can calculate how much the exchange rate must change in value to achieve that current account adjustment as will be discussed below this is not an uncont roversial method ma ny economists would reject the notion that curre nt account balances worldwide are misaligned or that economists can predictably determine how much they must be adjusted to come back into alignment thus the following estimates are only valid if one accepts the assumptions underlying them ernest preeg senior fellow at the manuf acturers alliance estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40 in 200325 while this claim is not based on any formal analysis he uses several ruleofthumb estima tes to reach this conclusion his first observation is that the increase in chines foreign exchange reserves equaled 100 of the chinese trade surplus less net foreign direct investment fdi flows in the first six months of 2002 he concludes that the entire trade surplus less net foreign direct investment would be zero in the absence of the increase in foreign exchange reserves his second observation is ruleofthumb timate that 1 decline in the dollar leads to 10 billion decline in the trade deficit in the united states he then observes that the dollar would need to decline by 40 according to that rule of thumb to eliminate the trade deficit since the u s trade deficit qualed about 400 billion in 2002 since the chinese trade surplus plus net fdi flows equaled 100 of the increase in foreign exchange reserves he concludes that if the central bank longer increased its foreign exchange reserves by letting the yuan float the surplus less fdi would be zero and the yuan would appr eciate by 40 based on the us ratio26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs16 26 continued percentage of the total trade deficit is without justification his conversion implies that if the us trade deficit were 1 40 decline in the dollar would lower the deficit by 1 by that logic if the trade deficit were 1 trillion 40 decline in the dollar would lower the deficit by 1 trillion clearly 40 decline in the dollar ca nnot have such different effects on the trade deficit simply because the dollar value of the trade deficit has changed second preeg applies his estimate based on us data to the chinese trade surplus without any supporting evidence since the united st ates and china have different economies trading patterns trade balances and exchange rate regimes there is reason to think the estimate would be the same for both countries he also uses overall and bilateral trade balances interchangeably there is reason to think that 40 decline in the dollar would have the same effect on 400 billion us overall trade deficit from which he does not subtract fdi as 40 decline in the yuan would have on 60 billion bilateral chinese trade surplus less fdi 27 according to the data cited elsewhere in this report

estimates that the yuan was 15 25 undervalued in 2003 it argues that the underlying current account surplus was 253 of gdp in 2003 larger than the actual surplus 15 it does not explain why27 it then argues that the surplus should be reduced by 50 billion or 4 of gdp to return to equilibrium which would leave china with deficit of 1 15 of gdp in equilibrium it believes that the revaluation requi red to achieve this reduction in the current account surplus is unusually large because of the extensive use of imports in the production of chinese exports iie fellow morris goldstein testified that these estimates of yuan misalignment can be obtained either by solving trade model for the appreciation of the rmb that would produce equilibrium in chinas overall balance of payments or by gauging the appreciation of the rmb that make fair contribution to the reduction in global payment imbalances especially the reduction of the us curre ntaccount deficit to more sustainable level28 goldman sachs economic research gr oup has estimated that the yuan was 9515 undervalued in 200329 they argue that the current account less fdi should be zero in equilibrium which m eans that china would have current account deficit equal to fdi wh ich could be accomplished with 9515 revaluation this is based on their elasticity ie the degree to which demand changes due to price changes estimates that

the larger number is an estimate of the largest current account deficit that would stabilize chinas debttogdp ratio they estimate that the yuan was 44 54 undervalued against the dollar in 200330 all of these estimates are based on similar logic so few general observations can be made about all of them first none of the estimates are the product of theoretically grounded econometrically timated economic mode ls rather they are back of the envelope estimates based on few simple rule of thumb assumptions rules of thumb such as the preeg 101 billion estimate or the goldman sachs import and export elasticitie s may not be accurate over time or over large changes in the exchange rate the main source of contention in all of the estimates of the yuans undervaluation is the definition of an equ ilibrium current account balance all of the estimates are based on the appreciation that would be required for china to attain equilibrium in the current account balan ce but there is consensus based on theory or evidence to determine what equilibrium would be rather the authors base equilibrium on their own personal opinion with some using arbitrary assumptions and others more sophisticated ones31 yet this assumption is crucial dunaway et demonstrate that changing the assume d equilibrium current account balance by 2 percentage points of gdp changes the timated undervaluation by as much as 25 percentage points32 some economists argue that the current account balance would always be close to zero in equilibrium but this neglects the fact that countries with different saving and investment rates may willingly lend to and borrow from one another for long periods of time in fact the preeg iie and goldman sachs estimates use an assumption of equilibrium less favorable to china than the current account bala nce these studies actually call for balance only in official and portfolio borrowing they still allow for foreign direct investment fdi inflows which means their estimate of chinas overall equilibrium current account position is actually deficit if they had chosen balance the traditional equilibrium measure with fixed exchange rate instead of deficit as their equilibrium benchmark their estimates of the yuans undervaluation would have been smaller even if portf olio flows are essentially limited by capital controls at present it is not clear why requiring the chinese to borrow from the rest of the world is any less unsustainable than the current arrangement where china is lending to the rest of the world with capital controls and net fdi inflows increasing foreign reserves is the only way that china can keep its net foreign indebtedness from increasin g and all measures rule out anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs18 33 barry bosworth valuing

monetary fund occasional paper 232 2004 ch 4accumulation of foreign official reserves for reasons other than to influence the exchange rate it is particularly difficu lt to determine the equilibri um current account balance in china because of the presence of capital controls if china were to maintain capital controls after currency reform if for example they revalued the peg rather than let the yuan float current account balance may be reasonable assumption but if capital controls were eliminated as is typically the case with floating exchange rate the economic situation would change entirely equilibrium could now involve persistent borrowing from or lendi ng to the rest of the world by private chinese citizens which would result in corresponding persistent trade deficit or surplus respectively if private citizens lent as much to the united states in equilibrium as the chinese central bank is currently lending and us lending to china remained unchanged then the equilibrium market exchange rate would be equal to the current fixed rate and the trade deficit would remain unchanged if private capital outflows exceeded the current increase in foreign reserves the yuan would depreciate since chin is country with both hi gh national saving rate and high investment rate it is not clear whether china would be net borrower in which case it would run current account defi cit or lender cu rrent account surplus if their currency floated and capital controls were abolished this issue is particularly relevant when the equilibrium exchange rate is defined as market determined since capital controls currently prevent portfolio investment flows from being market determined bosworth argues that chinas high internal saving rate is more than sufficient to finance its investment so it makes sense for china to offset fdi inflows with official outflows in the form of foreign reserve accumulation rather than run current account deficit therefore he argues foreign reserve accumulation should not be considered pr oof of undervaluation33 wang argues that based on estimates derived from other developing economie s chinas equilibrium current account surplus may be even larger than the actual surplus so the yuan is overvalued34 the feer approach is also based on belief that the overall us trade deficit is unsustainable and revaluing the yuan would reduce it this goes beyond an argument that china has fixed the yuan at an artificially low level and argues that the dollar which is market determined against most of its trading partners is incorrectly valued for example the coudert and couharde estimate that the yuan is 54 undervalued is based on corresponding estimate that the dollar was 35 overvalued the yen 37 underv alued and the euro 27 undervalued in 2003 if trade and financial markets are rational over the medium run then the value of the dollar and the size of the trade deficit are never unsustainable if they were investors would be unwilling to hold us assets and would sell the dollar and the trade deficit would decline there is widely accepted theoretical approach to determining trade deficit sustainability and prima facie evidence does not suggest the us trade deficit is unsustainable over the next few years it has lasted severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs19 35 sensible rules of thumb for longterm stainability such as estimating the current account deficit that would keep us assets c onstant share of foreign investment portfolios need not hold in the short run for instance after change in fundamentals current account deficits may persist for several years as the united states transitions to new steady state 36 on the other hand some analysts note that chinas current account surplus both totals and as percent of gdp has risen sh arply over the past few years years it did not prevent the us economy from achieving record growth and low unemployment in the late 1990s us inves tment income paid to foreigners is not large and there have not been any unusually large or sudden declines in the dollar since the trade deficit emerged35 further if the chinese central bank stopped buying us assets and hence reduced its bilateral trade deficit with the united states it is unlikely that the overall us trade deficit would fall by corres ponding amount other foreigners would still be free to lend to the united states which could cause its other bilateral trade deficits to widen thus it is not clear that fair share of reduction in the us trade deficit can be apportioned to china and even if chinas overall trade surplus were eliminated it might still run bilateral trade surplus with the united states even countries with overall trade ficits including the united states have some trading partners with whom they run surpluses and some with whom they run deficits does international experience suggest wh at the chinese current account balance would be in equilibrium the closest comparison is probably to other east asian countries which also grew rapidly and ma intained high saving rates in recent decades the experience of thes countries is mixed from 1 980 to 1997 south korea malaysia philippines indonesia and thailand typically ran current account deficits while hong kong singapore taiwan and japan which had already industrialized typically ran current account surpluses since the asian financial crisis in 1997 all of these countries have run large current account surpluses this may suggest that the current economic nvironment is not conducive to developing world borrowing as seen in table 2 the same combination of large foreign exchange reserves and large current account surplus can be seen in several other countries in the region even though these countries range in their exchange rate regimes

undervalued by 56 in february 200737 the economist portrays the big mac index as light hearted guide to exchange rates and there are important drawbacks to relying too heavily on it the big mac index compares the pri ce of mcdonalds big mac in china and the united states since big mac in ch ina was 56 cheaper than in the united states the index concludes that the yu an is undervalued by that much

associated with the hamburger38 these include the wages of employees serving the big mac and the rent of the restaurant in which it is eaten both of whic h are determined by local factors since the hamburger itself is the only tradeable portion of the big mac only small fraction of the big macs value should be determined by purch asing power parity as result big mac in new york city is more expensive th an big mac purchased in the us rural south taken literally the big mac index would imply that dollar in the rural south is undervalued compared to dollar in new york city while ppp is simple idea that is powerful in theory it has been proven to be unreliable in reality prices are consistently lower in developing countries than industrialized countries some economists have tried to estimate what the yuans value would be by attempting to control for predictable divergences from ppp still these estimates should be considered w ith caution even when sophisticated modifications have

exchange rates to significantly diverge from ppp for several years second the regression does not control for other factors and only explains 57 of the variation in the data third he argues that any adjustment in the exchange rate should be gradual so as not to be economica lly disruptive he also warns that it is not even true that an appreciation of th renminbi against the dollar would have an

trade however bilateral trade balances reflect structural causes as well as exchange rate effects there are number of other factors at work that are also important to consider when analyzing the

indicating that china had small 6 billion trade surplus in its trade with the world excluding the united states see table 3 49 if the yuan is undervalued against the dollar it should also be

if the curre ncy were freely traded providing boost to chinas export industries which employ millions of workers and are major source of chinas productivity gains an unde rvalued currency also increases the attractiveness of china as destination for foreign investment in exportoriented production facilities much of which comes from us firms foreign investment is an important source of technology tr ansfers which contribute to economic development however an undervalued currency makes imports more expensive hurting chinese consumers and chinese firms that import parts machinery and raw materials such policy in effect benefits chinese exporting firms many of which are owned by foreign multinational corpor ations at the expense of nonexporting chinese firms especially those that rely on imported goods this may impede the most efficient allocation of resources in the chinese economy in the long run in the short run revaluation of the yuan could reduce aggregate spending in china by raising imports and reducing expor ts whether this would be desirable depends on the current state of the chinese economy some observers argue that the chinese economy is currently overheating and revaluation would help place it on more sustainable path and prevent inflati on from rising others argue that there is large pool of underemployed labor in ru ral china that the undervalued yuan is helping to absorb in this view reva luation could be econo mically and socially disruptive many economists note that chinas currency policy essentially denies the government the ability to use monetary policy such as interest rates to promote stable economic growth g fighting inflation51 secondly they contend that the currency policy has skewed the economy in to becoming overly dependent on fixed investment and net exports for economic growth which in the long run can not be sustained thirdly they maintain that chinas currency policy may actually be undermining the financial viability of the ba nking system by expanding the level of easy credit which has made the banks more prone to extend loans to risky andor speculative ventures and thus may increas the level of bank held nonperforming loans in addition the policy has contributed to an inflow of hot money into short term speculative ventures such as real tate and the stock market by investors hoping to cash in on future appreciation of the currency banks are restricted from using interest rate policies to better regulate investment decisions because raising interest rates beyond certain level could increase flows of foreign capital into the country keeping interest rates low in booming economy may prevent the most efficient allocation of capita l and could lead to overp roduction in some sectors52 the accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves by china may make it easier for chinese officials to move more quickly toward adopting fully

economists maintain that trade is winwin situation for the economy as whole but produ ces losers within the economy this view derives from the principle of comparative ad vantage which states that trade shifts production to the goods country is relatively talented at producing from goods it is relatively less talented at producing as trade expands production of goods with comparative disadvantage will decline in the ited states to the detriment of workers and investors in those sectors offset by higher employment and profits in sectors with comparative advantage economists genera lly argue that free trade should be pursued because the gains from trade are large enough th at the losers from trade can be compensated by the winners and the winners will still be be tter off

implications for the us economy effect on exporters nd importcompetitors when foreign reserve accumulation causes the yuan to be less expensive than it would be if it were determined by market forces it causes chinese exports to the united states to be relatively inexpensive and us exports to china to be relatively expensive as result us exports and the production of u s goods and services that compete with chinese imports fall in the short run54 many of the affected firms are in the manufacturing sector as will be discussed below55 this causes the us trade deficit to rise and reduces aggregate demand in the short run all else equal china has become the united statess second largest supplier of imports 2006 data large share of chinas exports to the united states are laborintensive

total foreign holdings of such securities as of july 2007 furniture and tool and die that are expressing concern over the growing competitive challenge posed by china56 an undervalued chinese cu

use significant level of imported computer parts in their pr oduction and china was the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the united states in 2007 an undervalued yuan lowers the price of these us products increasing their output and competitiveness in world markets and many imports from china are produced by usinvested enterprises as discussed bove which benefit from an undervalued exchange rate effect on us borrowers an undervalued yuan also has an effect on us borrowers when the united states runs current account deficit with china an equivalent amount of capital flows from chin to the united states as can be seen in the us balance of payments accounts this occurs because the chinese central bank or private chinese citizens are investing in us assets which allows more us capital investment in plant and equipment to take place than would otherwise occur capital investment increases because the greater demand for us assets puts downward pressure on us interest rates and firms are now willing to make investments that were previ ously unprofitable this increases aggregate spending in the short run all else equal and also increases the size of the economy in the long run by increasing the capital stock private firms are not the only beneficiaries of the lower interest rates caused by the capital inflow trade defi cit from china interest sensitive household spending on goods such as consumer durables and housin g is also higher than it would be if capital from china did not flow into the ited states in addition large proportion of the us assets bought by the chinese particularly by the central bank are us treasury securities which fund us federa l budget deficits according to the us treasury department china held 397 billion in us treasury securities as of september 2007 making it the second largest foreign holder of such securities after japan57 if the us trade deficit with china were eliminated chinese capital would longer flow into this country

recent years there is clear link between job sses and imports from china first only some manufacturers export to china or compete with chinese imports second manufacturing output has reached an all time high manufacturin g employment has fallen over this time because of productivity growth not decline in output third the growing trade deficit has not been limited to china the overall trade deficit is still increasing finally there is longrun trend that is moving us employment away from manufacturing and toward the service sector60 us employment in manufacturing as share of total nonagricultural em ployment has falle n from 318 in 1960 to 224 in 1980 to 107 in 2005 to 105 in 2006 to 102 in 200761 this trend is much larger than the chinese currency i ssue and is caused by changing technology which requires fewer workers to produce the same number of goods and comparative advantage with increas ing globalization comparative advantage predicts the united states will produce knowledge and technologyintensive goods that it is best at producing for trade with countries such as china who are better at producing laborintensive goods since the production of some

the chinese renminbi relative to the dollar would significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the united states63 net effect on the us economy in the medium run an undervalued yuan neither increases nor decreases aggregate demand in the united states rather it leads to compositional shift in us production away from us exporters and importcompeting firms toward the firms that benefit from the lower interest rates caused by chinese capital inflows in particular capitalintensive firms and firms that produce consumer durables would be expected to benefit from lower interest rates thus it is expected to have medium or longrun effect on aggregate us employment or unemployment as evidence one can consider that while the trade deficit with china and ove rall has widened the overa ll unemployment rate has fallen from 63 in 2003 to around 5 in 2008 however the gains and losses in employment and production caused by the tr ade deficit will not be dispersed evenly across regions and sectors of the economy on balance some areas will gain while others will lose although the compositional shift in output has negative effect on aggregate us output and employment in the l ongrun there may be adverse shortrun consequences if output in the trade sector falls more quickly than the output of us recipients of chinese capital rises aggregate spending and employment could temporarily fall if this occurs then there is likely to be decline in the inflation rate as well which could be benefi cial or harmful depending if inflation is high or low at the time fall in aggregate spending is more likely to be concern if the economy is already sluggish than if it is at full employment otherwise it is likely that government macroeconomic policy adjustment and market forces can quickly compensate for any decline of output in the trade sector by expanding other elements of aggregate demand by shifting the composition of us output to higher capital base the size of

the united states can borrow from the rest of the world is by importing more than it exports running trade deficit 66 the rate of us saving is among the lowest by industrialized nations china on the other hand has one of the worlds highest saving rates chinas extraordinarily high saving rate is largely the result of chinas undeveloped he alth care system pension system and social safety net for

states the trade deficit is the result65 the returns to foreignowned capital will flow to foreigners instead of americans but the returns to us labor utilizing foreignowned capital will flow to us labor chinas situation is very different as table 8 shows based on 2006 data chinas gross national saving as per cent of gdp 513 is nearly five times greater than the us level 13566 conversely the

the united states 428 versus 200 finally chinas gross national saving as percent of its gross national investment is equal to 118 versus 68 in the united states thus the unite d states must borrow

consumer spending the treasury departments november 2005 report on international economic and exchange rate policies stated that key factor in treasurys decision not to designate china as country that mani pulates its currency was chinas commitment to put greater emphasis on sustainable dom estic sources of growth including by modernizing the financial sect or however others cont end that it will take several years for china to switch its reliance on exports and domestic investment to consumption for much of its gdp growth and government polic can at best only indirectly alter long run consumption patterns67 economists generally are more concerned with the overall trade deficit than bilateral trade balances because of comparative advantage it is natural that country will have some trading partne rs from which it imports more and some trading partners to which it exports more for example the united states has trade deficit with austria and trade surplu s with the netherlands even though both countries use the euro which floats against the dollar of concern to the united states from an economic perspective is that its low saving rate makes it so reliant on foreigners to finance its investment opportun ities and not the fact that much of the capital comes from china68 if the united states did not borrow heavily from china it would still have to borrow from other

exchange rates has been larger gradually declining dollar would not be expected to disrupt economic activity since it would stimulate us exports and reduce the demand for foreign imports but some economists fear that there is possibility that the dollar could suddenly plummet in value and that this would cause severe dislocations for the u s economy the scenario through which they envision this occurring is based on the size of the trade deficit the trade deficit is unsustainably large in the sense that if it were to persist at current levels the net debt owed to foreigners would grow w ithout bounds therefore it must eventually shrink presumably through further dollar depreciation some economists worry that this adjustment could happen suddenly nd rapidly if investors suddenly came to realize that significant dollar depreciation was inevitable and fled dollar assets in an attempt to avoid these losses if this occurred there could be significant dislocations in us financial markets that could interfere with efficient financial intermediation this scenario is seen by most economists to be highly unlikely since the scenario would be so costly to the economy it may be worth guarding against in spite of its improbability however70 the primary reason that the dollar has not depreciated more rapidly since 2002 has been because central banks in chin and many other developing countries mainly asian and oil producing countries have accumulated foreign reserves at times to retard the appreciation of their currency against the dollar71 by definition any rise in the value of the yuan is matched by fall in the dollar other asian countries may feel compelled to continue this policy as long as china does since they view their exports as competing directly with china the commitment by china and other developing countries to support the value of the dollar may be one reason that private investors have felt secure investing in us assets despite its large trade deficit were china and these other c ountries to cease intervening in currency markets it is possible that the dollar would fall significantly in short time sudden decline in the dollar could trigger the currency crisis scenario described above policy options for dealing with chinas currency policy the united states could utilize number of options to try to put more pressure on china to make further

major world economy china since 2004 has been invited to attend g7 group of seven largest economies finance meetings74 chinas currency policy has been major topic in these discussions and the united states has sought to use the forum to bring pressure on china to quicken steps to make the cu rrency more flexible febr uary 10 2007 joint statement of g7 finance ministers nd central bank governors stated that in emerging economies with large and growin g current account surpluses especially china it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur75 the united states could attempt to build greater consensus within the g7 to put more pressure on china to reform its currency policy including by linking chinas possible future membership in the g7 to such reforms76 alternatively the united states could attempt to persuade china to participate in talks with other east asian economies that are viewed as intervening in currency markets in order to reach consensus on exchange rate policy77 proponents of this approach argue that because of chinas si ze other east asian countries are afraid that their exports would be uncompetitive if they made any unilateral change in their currencys value that was not matched by similar change by china finally the united states could press the internationa l monetary fund to become more active in working with china to help it understa nd the longterm economic risks of over relying on exports and domestic investment for much of its growth and promote the development of policy tools that lead to more balanced economic growth such as more domestic consumption78 key factor in any negotiations would be to convince china that liberalization of its ex change rate system would serve chinas long term economic interests and not lead to economic instabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs37 79 in addition any imposed us trade restri ctions of chinese goods would likely reduce overall us economic welfare because the re duction in the welfare of us consumers as import prices rise would likely exceed th increase in welfare of us producers 80 note opic is already barred from operating in china due to existing us sanctions 81 for example some analysts contend that chinas currency policy violates 1 article xv of the general agreement on tariffs and trad gatt agreement dealing with exchange arrangements 2 the wto agreements on subsidies and countervailing measures andor 3 gatt article xxiii dealing with nu llification or impairment of the benefits of trade agreement 82 dispute resolution in the wto is carried out under the dispute re solution understanding dsu see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization by jeanne j grimmett 83 many trade analysts argue that countries are more likely to comply with rulings by multilateral organizations to which they are parties and whose rules they have agreed to comply with than accede to the wishes of nother country under the threat of unilateral sanctions raise tariffs or ot her trade sanctions the us government could attempt to pressure china by threatening to impose unilateral trade sanctions if it did not change its currency regime some members support legislation such as hr 1002 that would impose additional tariffs of 275 on imports from china unless it appreciates its currency to fair market levels proponents of such legislation contend that congressional threats to shar ply increase tariffs on chinese goods were instrumental in moving china to reform and appreciate its currency policy in july 2005 and hence should be further utilized to press china for greater action to reform and appreciate its currency opponents of such legislation contend that imposing sanctions against china would violate wto ru and that threat s of sanctions may backfire because chinese officials would be less likely to reform its currency if they felt that such moves were seen as resulting from us political pressure79 some proposals seek to impose sanctions on curre ncy policy that would avoid violating wto rules for example s 1607 would deny certain designated countries with misaligned policies access to us government procurement direct us officials to vote against any new multilateral bank loans for such countries and cut off any new financing by the us overseas priv ate investment co rporation opic80 utilize the dispute resoluti on mechanism in the wto some critics have charged that chinas curre ncy policy violates wto rules81 the united states could file case before the wtos dispute settlement body dsb against chinas currency peg82 if the dsb ruled in favor of th united states it would direct china to modify its currency policy so that it complies with wto rules if china refused to comply the dsb would likely authorize the united states to impose trade sanctions against china the advantage of using the wto to resolve the issue is that it involves multilateral rath er than unilateral appr oach although there is guarantee that the wto would rule in favor of the united states83 for example it could threaten to initiate section 301 case provision in us trade law that gives the us trade repr esentative authority to respond to foreign trade barriers including violations of us rights under trade agreement andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs38 84 section 301 to 309 of the

pursue section 301 case with the wto if the ited states failed to use the wto dispute resolution procedures and instead imposed unilateral trade sa nctions under section 301 china might file wto case against the united states in 2004 the bush administration reject ed two section 301 petitions on chinas exchange rate policy one by the ch ina currency coalition group of us industrial service agricultural and labor organizations and one filed by 30 members of congress both petitions sought to have the united states bring case before the wto against china in the hope that the wto would rule that chinas currency peg violated wto rules on may 17 2007 42 house members filed section 301 petition with the ustrs offi ce over chinas currency practices and requested that trade dispute case be br ought to the wto however the ustr declined the petition in june the bush administration has expr essed doubts that the united states could win such case in the wto and contends that such an approach would be more damaging than helpful at this time85 hr 321 hr 782 hr 2942 s 796 s 1607 and s 1677 contain provisions that would require us officials under certain circ umstances to bring case ag ainst china over its currency policy and hr 321 also calls on the united states to work within the wto to modify and clarify rules regarding curre ncy manipulation for trade advantage to reflect modern day monetary policy not envisioned at the time current rules were adopted in 1947 apply us countervailing trade laws to nonmarket economies us countervailing laws allo w us parties to seek relief in the form of higher duties from imported products that have been subsidized by foreign governments for many years the commerce department contended that count ervailing laws could not be applied to nonmarket economies such as china because it would be nearly impossible to identify government subs idy in an economy that was not market based however in november 2006 the commerce department decided to pursue countervailing case against certain im ported chinese coated free sheet paper products on march 30 2007 the commerce partment issued preliminary ruling to impose countervailing duties ranging from 11 to 20 against the products in question commerce contends that while china is still nonmarket economy for the purposes of us trade laws economic reforms in china have made several sectors of the economy relatively market base d and therefore it is possible to identify the level of government s ubsidies given to the chinese paper firms in question some members contend that chinas currency policy constitutes form of export subsidy that should be actionable under us countervailing laws hr 782 hr 2942 s 364 and s 796 would apply us countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and would also specify that currency misalignment or manipulation be actionable under those laws several members c ontend that such legislation wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs39 86 see crs report rs20570 trade remedies and the usch ina bilateral wto accession agreement by william h cooper 87 the us international trade commission is in charge of making market disruption determinations under the safeguard provisions for most products with the exception of textiles and apparel which are handled by the committee for the implementation of the textile agreements an interagency comm ittee chaired by the us commerce department import relief is subject to presidential approval be consistent with wto rules which llows countries to utilize countervailing duty procedures however critics contend that it would be difficult to determine the subsidy level conveyed by chinas curre ncy and possible us countervailing measures applied against china over its cu rrency could be challenged in the wto apply estimates of currency unde rvaluation to us antidumping measures us antidumping laws allow us parties to seek relief in the form of increased duties from imports that are sold at less than fair value and injure us industries many critics of chinas currency policy c ontend that undervaluing the yuan is major factor affecting the price of chinese exports to the united states and that this has harmed many us industr ies for example hr 2942 and s 1607 would require the government to factor in the impact of certain fundamentally misaligned currencies on export prices when determining the level of antidumping duties that should be applied critics of this approach c ontend that it would be very difficult to come up with precise figu re on how much countrys currency is undervalued and it is not clear whether ch method would be compatible with wto rules on trade remedies utilize special safeguard measures another option might be to utilize us trade remedy laws relating to special provisions that were part of chinas accession to the wto for example th united states could invoke safeguard provisions under sections 421423 of the 1974 trade act as amended to impose restrictions on imported chin products that have increased in such quantities that they have caused or threaten to cau market disruption to us domestic producers86 this option could be used to pr ovide temporary relief for us domestic firms that have been negatively affected by surge in chinese exports to the united states regardless of its cause87 the sharp increase in textile and apparel imports from china over the past few years led the bush administration on number of occasions to invoke the special china xtile and apparel sa feguard to restrict imports eventually the administrati on sought and obtained in november 2005 an agreement with china to limit the level of certain textile and apparel exports to the united states through the end of 2008 ho wever the bush administration on six different occasions has chos not to extend relief to various industries under the chinaspecific safeguard hr 782 and s796 would require that exchange rate misalignment by china be considered factor in making determinations of market disruption under the chinaspecific safeguard other bilateral commercial considerations number of policy analysts have argued against pushing china too hard on its currency policy either because it would not serve us economic interests or becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs40 88 it is also possible that if china made change s to its exchange rate policy such as allowing the yuan to appreciate more rapidly in or der to ease political pressure from the united states it would expect something in return ch as us pressure on china to ease on other trade issues 89 the united states has pending wto dis pute resolution cases against china on ipr protection and market access trade subsid ies and discriminatory import tariffs 90 see article at httpwwwtelegraphcouk 91 see text of letter at httpgrassleysenategovpublicus pressure would likely be ineffective as long as the chinese government believed changing the peg would damage chinas economy88 such analysts argue that us policymakers should address chinas currency policy as part of more comprehensive us trade strategy to persuade china to accelerate economic and trade reforms and to address wide rang of us complaints over chinas trade practices this appears to be the adminis trations policy in the sed talks us officials have urged china to boost domestic consumption while making its currency policy more flexible as part of longterm solution to global trade imbalances some policymakers contend that the more immediate focus of us trade policy should be on pressing china to comply with its wto commitments major wto related issues of concern to the united states include market access inadequate protection of us intellectua l property rights ipr indus trial policies that promote domestic content over imports and indirect subsidization of chinese stateowned enterprises by chinas banking system because chinas wto commitments are clear and binding and there is legal process within the wto to seek compliance with trade agreements the united states is in stronger position to get china to liberalize its economy and open its markets than it would be if it tried to push china to reform its currency regime where multilateral rules and options on the issue are less clear finally supporters of this policy argue that chinas leaders are more likely to respond to pressure s to adhere to internati onal rules of conduct than to perceived direct us pressure89 chinas holdings of us federal debt instruments m n u s policymakers have expressed concern over chinas large holdings of us federal debt claiming that china could use it as political tool against the united states recent article in the telegraph china threatens nuclear option of dollar sales cited interviews with officials from two leading chinese government think tanks who reportedly stated that china had the power to make the dollar collapse if it chose to do so by liquidating large portions of its us treasuries holdings if the united states imposed trade sanctions to force yuan revaluation and that the threat to do so could be used as bargaining chip90 the article prompted concern among many us policymakers including senator ch arles grassley who in an august 9 2007 letter to the chinese ambassador to the united states asked the chinese government to confirm that the comments do not refl ect the official position of the chinese government91 in response the chinese amba ssador to the united states wrote to senator grassley on august 13 that china does not have plan to drastically adjust the structure of its foreign reserves in addition in an article in the xinhua news agency on august 13 an unnamed official at the peoples bank of china was quotedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs41 as saying that dollardenominated assets including us government securities are an important component in chinas foreig n exchange reserve investment portfolio and that china was re sponsible investor although move by china to liquidate large portion of its dollardenominated assets would likely have significant impact on the value of the dollar in international currency markets it is unlikely china would make such move doing so would likely cause sharp appreciation of the yuan against the dollar which would result in capital loss for china on the sale of treasuries lower the value of its remaining us assets and increase the cost of its exports to the united states secondly such move could reduce economic growth in the united states especially if other foreign i nvestors sold their us asse t holdings and the us was forced to raise interest rates in res ponse which would diminish us demand for imports including those from china on september 29 2007 the chinese govern ment officially launched the china investment corporation cic in an effort to better manage its foreign exchange reserves it reportedly w ill initially manage over 200 b illion making it one of the worlds largest stateowned funds some contend china might try to diversify away from dollar denominated assets such as treasury securities since 2007 chinas holding of treasury securities have increased very little it is not clear to what degree such diversification should it occu r might affect us interest rates changes to the curre nt currency policy and potential outcomes if the chinese were to allow their currency to be determined by private actors in the market based on the supply and dema nd for chinese goods and assets relative to us goods and assets if the yuan ppreciated as result this would boost us exports and the output of us producers w ho compete with the chinese the us bilateral trade deficit would likely decline but not necessarily disappear at the same time the chinese central bank would longer purchase us assets to maintain the peg us borrowers in cluding the federal government would now need to find new lenders to finance their borrowing and interest rates in the united states would rise this would reduce spending on interestsensitive purchases such as capital investment housing residential investment nd consumer durables the reduction in investment spe nding would reduce the longrun size of the us capital stock and thereby the us economy in the present context of the fa lling dollar some analysts fear that sudden decline in chinese demand for us assets if china was longer purchasing assets to influence the exchange rate could lead to drop in the value of the dollar that coul d potentially destabilize the us economy another concern is that with inflation rising in the united states rise in the value of the yuan could cause import prices to rise and add to infl ationary pressureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs42 92 some economists argue that shortterm movements in floating exchange rates cannot always be explained by economic f undamentals if this were the case then the floating exchange rate could become inexplicably overvalued undervalued at times reducing increasing the output of us exporters and us firms that compete with chinese imports these economists often favor fixed or managed exchange rates to prevent these unexplainable fluctuations which they argue are detrimental to us economic wellbeing other economists argue that movements in floating exchange rates are rational and therefore lead to economically efficient outco mes they doubt that governments are better equipped to identify currency imbalances than market professionals 93 this argument is made in morris goldstein and nicholas lardy modest proposal for chinas renminbi financial times august 26 2003 alternatively if chinese citizens proved unconcerned about keeping their wealth in chinese assets the removal of capital controls could lead to greater inflow of foreign capital since foreigners would be less concerned about being unable to access their ch inese investments this would cause the exchange rate to appreciateif the relative demand for chinese goods and assets were to fall at some point in the future the floating exchange rate would depreciate and the effects would be reversed floating exchange rates fluctu ate in value frequently and significantly92 move to floating exchange rate is typically accompanied by the elimination of capital controls that limit countrys private citizens from freely purchasing and selling foreign currency capital controls exist in china today and arguably one of the major reasons china opposes floating exch ange rate is because it fears that the removal of capital controls would lead to large private capital outflow from china this might occur because chinese citizens fear that their deposits in the potentially insolvent state banking system are unsafe if the capital outflow were large enough it could cause the floating exchange rate to depreciate rather than appreciate93 if this occurred the output of us exporters nd importcompeting firms would be reduced below the prevailing level and the us bila teral trade deficit w ould expand in other words the united states would still borrow heavily from china but it would now be private citizens buying us assets instead of the chinese central bank china could attempt to float its exchange rate while maintaining its capital controls at least temporarily this solution would eliminate the possibility that the currency would depreciate because of private capital out flow while this would be unusual it might be possible it would likely make it more difficult to impose effective capital controls however since the fluctuating cu rrency would offer much greater profit incentive for evasion another option is to maintain the status quo although the nominal exchange rate may continue to rise only slowly in this case over time the real rate would adjust as inflation rates in the two countries dive rged as the central bank exchanged newly printed yuan for us assets prices in ch ina would rise along with the money supply until the real exchange rate was brought b ack into line with the market rate this would cause the us bilateral trade defic it to decline and expand the output of us exporters and importcompeting firms this real exchange rate adjustment would only occur over time however and pressures on the us trade sector would persist in the meantimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs43 94 even in cases where jobs have shifted from the united states to china there are still questions as to the net impact to the united states if the united states is longer internationally competitive in certain industrie s it may be more economically efficient to allow market forces to direct resources away from those industries and toward economic activities where the united states has greater comparative advantage the challenge for policymakers is how to help displaced workers get the training they need to find wellpaying jobs that are comparable to or better than the jobs they lostnone of the solutions guarantee that the bilateral trade deficit will be eliminated china is country with high saving rate and the united states is country with low saving rate it is not surprising that their overall trade balances would be in surplus and deficit respectively at the bilateral level it is not unusual for two countries to run persistently imbalanced tr ade even with floating exchange rate if china can continue its combination of lowcost labor and ra pid productivity gains which have been reducing export prices in yuan terms its exports to the united states are likely to continue to grow regardless of the exchange rate regime as evidence consider that the significant ppreciation of the yuan since 2005 has not led to any reduction in the trade deficit conclusion the current debate among us policym akers over chinas currency policy has been strongly linked to concerns over the growing us trade deficit with china the sharp decline in us manufacturing employme nt over the past few years and the rise of china as major economic power since 2005 chinas exchange rate has appreciated slowly but the cumulative change since then has been significant most economists agree that chinas currency would likely appreciate against the dollar initially if allowed to float barring any disruption in chinas financial sector although market forces could drive it up or down in the long run as conditions change but the failure of the bilateral trade deficit to fall in response to the appreciation that has occurred thus far suggests that it is caused by more than just the value of the yuan if the yuan were to appreciate there is considerable debate over the net effects this policy would have on the us econom since it may benef it some us economic sectors and harm other sectors as well as consumers the trade deficit with china has not prevented the united states from r eaching full employment in addition us trade with china is only one of num ber of factors affecting manufacturing employment including increased productivity growth employment shifts to the service sector and the overall trade deficit it is also not clear to what extent production in certain industria l sectors has shifted to china from the united states as opposed to shifting to china from other lowwage countries such as mexico thailand and indonesia94 the extensive involveme nt of foreign multilateral corporations in chinas manufactured exports further complicates the issue of who really benefits from chinas trade as well as the implications of rising us trade deficit with china since large share of us imports are coming from foreign firms including us firms that have shifted production from one country to china the effects of an appreciating yuan can also be considered in the broader context ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32165crs44 concerns about the potentially destabilizing effects of the falling dollar by definition increases in the value of the yuan are equivalent to decreases in the value of the dollar so chinas accumulation of us assets retards the rate at which the dollar falls thus there is considerable debate over what policy options would promote us economic interests since chan ges to the current system would produce both winners and losers in the unite d states as well as in china chinese officials have stated they plan to make the currency more flexible in the near term and to eventually adopt floatin g currency in the long run but they insist that reforms should be gradual in order to avoid disruptions to the economy for example they claim they need to first implement further reforms to the banking system and to reduce the level of nonperfo rming loans yet the present currency policy may be undermining these efforts by expanding the money supply as result of the accumulation of foreign reserves rising money supply promotes easy credit policies by the banks whic h could result in more nonperforming loans efforts to limit bank loans in booming sectors of th economy have mainly been the result of government administrative directives rather than market forces which may undermine the ability to establish market based financial system where monetary policy is used to halt inflation and bank loan s are extended to ventures that offer the highest rate of return in addition chin as currency policy constitutes facto subsidy which while benef itting some export industries undermines other sectors and prevents the most efficient dist ribution of resources in the economy while us officials acknowledge chinas concerns over exchange rate reforms they contend that chinas exchange rate reforms are overly cautious they further contend that chinas currency policy is preventing adjustments in global trade imbalances especially in the united states and that this could eventually undermine world economic growth this would hur t chinas economy gi ven its dependence on exports both us and chinese officials publicly agree that china needs to undertake major economic reforms to boos t domestic consumption and to obtain more even growth and that the united states must do more to boost its level of domestic saving china officials have stated their intention to boost economic development in the hinterland and expand sp ending on social security health care and
