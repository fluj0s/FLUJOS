difficult and of ten controversial actors in the us political system eg members of congress the president citizens interest groups often disagree about the appropriate uses of pub lic funds missions goals and objectives for public programs and criteria for evaluating success one persons key program may be another pers ons key example of waste and abuse and different people have di fferent conceptions of what good performance means even when consensus is reached on programs appropriate goals and evaluation criteria it is often difficult and sometimes almost impossible to separate the discrete influence that federal program had on key outcomes from the influence of other actors eg state and local governments trends eg globalization demographic changes and events g natural disasters federal agencies and programs often have multiple purposes and sometimes these purposes may conflict or be in tension with one another finding and assessing balance among priorities can be controversial and difficult the outcomes of some agencies and programs are viewed by many observers as inherently difficult to measure foreign policy and research and development programs have been cited as examples there is frequently time lag between an agencys or programs actions and eventual results or lack thereof in the absence of this eventual outcome data it is ofte n difficult to know

for the part the definition of program will most often be determined by budgetary perspective that is the program that omb assesses with the part will most often be what omb calls program activity or aggregation of program activities as listed in the presidents budget proposal one feature of the part process is flexibility for omb and agencies to determine the unit of analysis program for part review the structure that is readily available for this purpose is the formal budget structure of accounts and activities supporting budget development for the executive branch and the congress and in particular congressional appropriations committees although the budget structure is not perfect for program review in every instance for example program activities in the budget are not always the activities that are managed as program in practice the budget structure is the most readily available and comprehensive system for conveying part results transparently to interest ed parties throughout the executive and legislative branches as well as to the public at large19 the term program activity is essentially defined by ombs circular a11 as the activities and projects financed by

between 75 and 500 million programs but not for large programs45 part and performance budgeting observers have generally considered the part to be form of performance budgeting term that does not have standard definition46 in general however most definitions of performance budgeting involve the use of performan ce information and program evaluations during governments budget process sc holars have generally supported the use of performance information in the budget pro cess but have also noted lack of consensus on how the information should be used and that performance budgeting has not been panacea in state governments for example practitioners frequently acknowledge that the process of developing measures can be useful from management and decisionmaking perspective budget officers were asked to indicate how effective the development and use of performance measures has been in effec ting certain changes in their state across range of items from resource allocation issues to programmatic changes to cultural factors such as changing communication patterns among key players many respondents were willing to describe performance measurement as somewhat effective but few were more enthusiastic most markedly few were willing to attach performance asures to changes in appropriation levels legislative budget officers ranked the use of performance measures especially low in effecting cost savings and reducing duplicative services slightly more than half the respondents strongly agreed or agreed when asked whether the implementation of performance measures had improved

stimulated agency interest in budget and perform ance integration52 however gao noted th at only 18 percent of the fy2004 part recommendations had direct link to funding matters53 gao also concluded the more important role of the part was not in making resource decisions but in its support for recommendations to improve program design assessment and management54 more fundamentally gao c ontended that the part is not well integrated with gpra the current statutory framewo rk for strategic planning and reporting specifically gao said omb has stated its intention to modify gpra goals and

process omb created the results not demonstrated category when agencies and omb could not agree on longterm and annual performance measures or if performance information for program was judged inadequate by omb 62 gao noted for example that ombs aggregation and disaggregation of separate programs into part program sometimes 1 made it difficult to select measures for part programs that had multiple missions or 2 ignored the context in which programs operateomb made sustained efforts to sure consistency in how programs were assessed for the part but omb staff nevertheless needed to

be and believe that your recommendations will help us to that as you know omb is already taking ac tions to address many of them64 in addition gao suggested that while congress has seve ral opportunities to provide its perspective on performance i ssues and performance goals eg when establishing or reauthorizing prog ram appropriating funds or exercising oversight more systematic approach could allow congress to better articulate performance goals and outcomes for key programs of major concern and facilitate ombs understanding of cong ressional priorities and c oncerns and as result increase the usefulness of the part in budget deliberations specifically gao suggested that congress consider the need for st rategy that could include 1 establishing vehicle for communicating performance goals and measures for key congressional priorities and concerns 2 veloping more structured oversight agenda to permit more coordinated congressional perspective on crosscutting programs and policies and 3 using such an agenda to inform its authorization oversight and appropriations processes65 potential criteria for evaluating the part or other program evaluations concepts for evaluati ng program evaluation previous sections of this report discu ssed how the part is structured how it has been used and how various actors have assessed its design and implementation this section discusses potential criteria fo r evaluating the part or other program evaluations which might be considered by congress during the budget process in oversight of federal agencies and programs and regarding legislation that relates to program evaluation66 should congress focus on the stion of criteria the program evaluation and social science literature suggests that three standards or criteria may be helpful the concepts of validity reliability and objectivity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32663crs19 67 see edward g carmines and james woods validity in michael s lewisbeck alan bryman and tim futing liao eds the sage encyclopedia of social science research methods vol 3 thousand oaks ca sage publications 2004 p 1171 the authors elaborate thus thus the measuring instrument itself is not validated but the measuring instrument is validated in relation to the purpose for which it is being used 68 for another example test may be given to student that is to assess his or her knowledge of chemistry at certain level however if the test does not assess that knowledge accurately for that level eg it tests only narrow aspect of what was supposed to be taught or turns out to effectively test something else the test would not necessarily be valid one 69 for example if test on average accurately assesses the knowledge of student the test still may be judged not reliable viewed either on its own or compared to another test suppose students true knowledge is equiva lent to 75 score out of 100 two different styles of tests if they were applied many times to the same student might both find on average 75 score but if one test results in scores that range in uniform distribution between 73 and 77 while the other test results in scores that result in uniform distribution between 51 and 100 one could argue that the first test is more reliable as measure of the students knowledge because it exhibits less fluctuation if only the second test were realistically available to be used and if that were the most reliable alternative available the second test could be judged reliable or unrelia ble depending on an observers viewpoint and the purpose the test is intended to address see peter chen and autumn d krauss reliability in michael s lewisbeck alan bryman and tim futing liao eds the sage encyclopedia of social science research methods vol 3 p 952 and michael scriven evaluation thesaurus 4th ed newbury park ca s age publications 1991 p 309 70 for more information and criticisms of the concept see martyn hammersley objectivity in michael s lewisbeck alan bryman and tim futing liao eds the sage encyclopedia of social science research methods vol 2 pp 750751validity has been defined as the ex tent to which any measuring instrument measures what it is intended to measure67 for example because the part is supposed to measure the effectiveness of federal programs its validity turns on the extent to which part scores reflect the actual effectiveness of those programs68 reliability has been described as t he relative amount of random inconsistency or unsyste matic fluctuation of individual responses on measure that is the extent to which several attempts at measuring something are consistent eg by several human judges or several uses of the same instrument69 therefore the degree to which the part is reliable can be illustrated by the extent to which separate applications of the instrument to the same program yield the same or very similar assessments objectivity has been defined as whether an inquiry is pursued in way that maximizes the chances that the conclusions reached will be true70 definitions of the word also frequently suggest concepts of fairness and absence of bi as the opposite concept is subjectivity suggesting in turn concepts of bias prejudice or unfairness therefore making judgment about the objectivity of the part orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32663crs20 71 ibid p 750 thus analysts often ask whether given instrument can be improved ie whether the instruments chances of reac hing valid and reliable findings have been maximized an implication of these terms is that it is possible for an instrument to be objective but not valid measure of what it is intended to measure 72 see us general accounting office performance budgeting ob servations on the use of ombs program assessment rating t ool for the fiscal year 2004 budget p 25 its implementation involves judgin g course of inquiry or an inquirer against some rational standard of how an inquiry ought to have been pursued in order to maximize the chances of producing true findings emphasis in original71 although these three criteria can each be c onsidered individually in application they may prove to be highly interrelated for example measurement tool that is subjectively applied may yield results that if repeated are not consistent or do not seem reliable conversely lack of reliable results ma suggest that the instrument being used may not be valid or that it is not being applied in an objective manner in these situations further analysis is typically necessary to determine whether problems exist and what their nature may be evaluating the part with regard to the part the administration has made numerous assessments regarding program effectiven ess but how should one validly reliably and objectively determine program is effective should congress wish to explore these issues regarding the part or other eval uations congress might assess the extent to which the assessments have been or will be completed validly reliably and objectively different observers will likely have diffe rent views about th validity reliability and objectivity of ombs part instru ment usage and determinations nonetheless some previous assessments of the part suggest areas of particular concern for example in its study of the part gao reported that one of the two reasons why programs were designated by the administration as results not demonstrated nearly 50 of the 234 prog rams assessed for fy2004 was that omb and agencies disagreed on how to assess agency program performance as represented by longterm and annual performance measures72 different officials in the executive branch appeared to have differe nt conceptions of what the appropriate goals of programs and measures to asse ss programs should be raising questions about the validity of the instrument it is reasona ble to conclude that actors outside the executive branch including members of congress citizens and interest groups may have different perspec tives and judgments on appr opriate program goals and measures under gpra stake holder views such as these are required to be solicited by statute under the part however the role and process for stakeholder participation appears less certain other issues that gao identified could be interpreted as relating to the part instruments validity in assessing progra m effectiveness eg omb definitions of specific programs inconsistent with ag ency organization and planning its reliabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32663crs21 73 for ombs fy2005 part questions and guidan ce see us office of management and budget

in design and usage to illustrate with some potential examples of objectivity issues subjectivity could arguably be resident in number of pa rt questions including among others when omb conducted its assessment for fy200573 whether program is excessi vely or unnecessarily redundant or duplicative of any other federal state local or private effort question 13 p 2274 whether programs design is free of major flaws question 14 p 2375 whether programs performance measures meaningfully reflect the programs purpose question 21 p 2576 and whether program has demons trated adequate progress in achieving longterm performance goals question 41 p 47 use of such terms that in the absence of clear definitions are subject to variety of interpretations can raise questions about the objectivity of the instrument and its ratings in one of its earliest publications on the part omb said that while subjectivity can be minimized it can never be completely eliminated regardless of the method or tool77 omb went on to say though that the part makes public and transparent the questions omb asks in dvance of making judgments and opens up any subjectivity in that process for discussi on and debate that said the part and its implementation to date nevertheless ppear to place much of the process for debating and determining program goals and measures squarely within the executive branch
