division september 10 2007 abstract crime is ordinarily proscribed tried and punished according to the laws on the place where it occurs american criminal law applies beyond the geographical conﬁnes of the united states however under some limited circumstances the federal exceptions to the general rule usually involve crimes like drug traﬃcking terrorism or crimes committed aboard ship or airplane state prosecution for overseas misconduct is limited almost exclusively to multijurisdictional crimes ie crimes where some elements of the oﬀense are committed within the state and others are committed abroad the constitution congress and state law deﬁne the circumstances under which american criminal law may be used against crimes occurring in whole or in part outside the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94166g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

law of the place where it occurs nevertheless surprising number of american criminal laws appl outside of the united states application is generally question of legislative intent expressed or implied in either case it most often involves crimes committed aboard ship or airplane crimes condemned by international treaty crimes committed against government employees or property or crimes that have an impact in this country even if planned or committed in part elsewhere although the crimes over which the united states has extraterritorial jurisdiction may be many so are the obstacles to their enforcement for both practical and diplomatic reasons criminal investigations within another country require the acquiescence consent or preferably the assistance of the authorities of the host country the united states has mutual legal assistance treaties with several countries designed to formalize such cooperative law enforcement assistance searches and interrogations carried out on our behalf by foreign officials certainly if they involve americans must be conducted within the confines of the fourth and fifth amendments and the sixth amendment imposes limits upon the use in american criminal trials of depositions taken abroad our recently negotiated extradition treaties address some of the features of our earlier agreements which complicate extradition for extraterritorial offenses ie dual criminality requirements reluctance to recognize extraterritorial jurisdiction and exemptions on the basis of nationality or political offenses to further facilitate the prosecution

constitution does not forbid either congressional or state enactment of laws which apply outside the united states nor does it prohibit either the federal government or the states from enforcing american law abroad several passages suggest that the constitution contemplates the application of american law beyond the geographical confines of the united states it speaks for example of felonies on the high seas offences against the law of nations commerce with foreign nations and of the impact of treaties more specifically it grants congress the power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offences against the law of nations 2 although logic might point to international law or some other embodiment of the law of nations as source of the dimensions of congresss authority to define nd punish crimes against the law of nations in reality the courts have done little to identify such boundaries and until recently congress seems to have relied exclusively on the law of nations clause only upon rare occasions in instances when the law of nations might have been thought to suffice congress has instead often relied upon high seas component which when coupled with its authority to define the admiralty and maritime jurisdictions of the federal courts permits the application of federal criminal law even to an american vessel at anchor well within the territory of another nation3 1 the general and almost universal rule is that the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the law of the country where the act is done american banana co v united fruit co 213 us 347 3561909 2 us const arti 8 cl 10 see generally the offences clause after sosa v alvarezmachain 118 h arvard law rev 2378 2005 stephens federalism

power to regulate commerce with foreign nations4 the same prerogative supports legislation regulating activities in the air when they involve commerce with foreign nations the commerce power includes the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes it is power of exceptional breadth domestically5 its reach may be even more extraordinary in an international context6 although there is certainly support for contrary view7 in one of few recent cases to address the issue directly the court opted for middle ground it found that congress did indeed have the legislative power to proscribe illicit overseas commercial sexual activity by an american who had traveled from the united states to the scene for the crime8 confronted with vigorous dissent the panels majority expressly chose to avoid the issue of whether it would have reached the same result if the defendant had not agreed to pay for his sexual misconduct 9 4 us const art i 8 cl3 5 see eg perez v united states 402 us 146 1971 heart of atlanta motel v united states 379 us 241 1964 6 california bankers assn v shultz 416 us 21 46 1974the

arguments based on the commerce clause are unpersuasive certainly congress has plenary power to regulate the flow of commerce within the boundaries of ited states territory but it is not empowered to regulate foreign commerce which has connection to the united states unlike the states foreign nations have never submitted to the sovereignty of the united states government nor ceded their regulatory powers to the united states see also colangelo constitutional limits on extraterritorial jurisd iction terrorism and the intersection of national and international law 48 h arvard international law journal 121 14950 2007emphasis in the originalfurthermore as matter of original intent the idea that the foreign commerce clause might license congress with the broad ability to extend us laws extraterr itorially into the jurisdictions of other nations would have been anathema to the founders given their driving belief in the sovereign equality of states and its accompanying rigid concept of territoriality which to borrow yet again from ch ild justice marshall held that state can rightfully impose rule on another each legislates for itself but its legislation can operate on itself alone recall the reason why congress was allowed to legislate extraterritorially over piracy absent us connection even though the act technically occurred within another states terr itory the conduct was prohibited as matter of the law of nations not of us law and thus the united states was not imposing its own rule on other nations but merely enforcing on their behalf universal norm when it prosecuted pirates such analysis applies to extraterritorial projections of congress foreign commerce clause power 8 united states v clark 435 f3d 1100 1103 9th cir 2006instead of slavishly marching down the path of grafting the interstate commerce framework onto foreign commerce we step back and take global commonsense approach to the circumstances presented here the illicit sexual conduct r eached by the state expressly includes commercial sex acts performed by us citizen on foreign soil this conduct might be immoral and criminal but it is also commercial where as in this appeal the defendant travels in foreign commerce to foreign country and offers to pay child to engage in sex acts his conduct falls under the broad umbrella of foreign commerce and consequently within congressional authority under the foreign commerce clause 9 id at 1109110 at the outset we highlight that 2423c contemplates two types of illicit sexual conduct non commercial and commercial clarks conduct falls squarely under the second prong of the definition which criminalizes any commercial sex act with person under 18 years of age 2423f2 in view of this factual posture we abide by the rule that courts have strong duty to avoid constitutional issues that need not be resolved in order to determine the rights of the parties to the case under consideration and limit our holding to 2423cs regulation of commercial sex acts

enacted in the exercise of congress power to regulate commerce with foreign nations is intended to have extraterritorial scope some do10 others do not11 congress has resorted on countless occasions to its authority to enact extraterritorial legislation to reliance on various of its own enumerated powers or the powers vested in one of the other branches or powers its shares with one of the other branches12 it has for instance regularly called upon the authority deposited with the president and the congress in the fields of foreign affairs and military activities13 powers which the courts have

fifth and fourteenth amendments some limitations are product of the need to harmonize potentially conflicting grants of authority for example although the constitution reserves to the states the residue of governmental powers it does not vest elsewhere the primacy it affords the federal government in the area of foreign affairs limits the authority of the states in the field principally to those areas where they are acting with federal authority or acquiescence16 in the area of extraterritorial jurisdiction the most often cited limitation resides in the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments while the enumerated powers may carry specific limits which govern the extent to which the power may be exercised overseas the general restrictions of the due process clauses particularly the fifth amendment due process clause have traditionally been mentioned as the most likely to define the outer reaches of the power to enact and enforce legislation with extraterritorial application 17 unfortunately most of the cases do little more than note that due process restrictions mark the frontier of the authority to enact and enforce american law abroad18 even the value of this scant illumination is dimmed by the realization that the circumstances most likely to warrant such due process analysis are the very ones for which the least process is due although american courts that try aliens for overseas violations of americ an law must operate within the confines of due process19 the supreme court has observed that the constitutions due process commands do not protect aliens who lack any significant vol untary connections with the united states20 moreover the courts more recent decisions often begin with the assumption that the issues of extraterritorial jurisdiction come without constitutional implications21 continued offenses committed overseas consider lowenfeld us law enforcement abroad the constitution and international law 83 merican journal of international law 880 89192 1989 asserting that the creation of subject matter and personal jurisdiction over an alien defe ndant for an offense committed overseas and not otherwise connected to the united states by forcibly bringing him in to the united states is not clearly within any constitution grant of power to congress and in particular does not as written come within the power to define and punish offenses against the law of nations 16 cf skiriotes v florida 313 us 69 1941 stepansky v state 707 so2d 877 flaapp 1998 17 person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due

take one of two tracks some describe due process requirement that demands some nexus between the united states and the circumstances of the offense22 in some instances they look to international law principles to provide useful measure to determine whether the nexus requirement has been met23 in others they consider principles at work in the minimum contacts test for personal jurisdiction24 at the heart of these cases is the notion that due process expects that defendants conduct must have some past present or anticipated locus or impact within the united states before he can fairly be held criminal liable for it in an american court the commentators have greeted this analysis with hesitancy at best 25 and other courts have simply rejected it26 continued exercised that authority in this case is matter of statutory construction 22 united states v medjuck 156 f3d 916 918 9th cir 1998to satisfy the strictures of due process the government must demonstrate that there exists sufficient nexus between the conduct condemned and the united states such that the application of the statute to the overseas conduct of an alien defendant would not be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair to the defendant citing united states v davis 905 f2d at 24849 see also united states v perlaza 439 f3d 1149 1160161 9 th cir 2006 united states v morenomorillo 334 f3d 819 828 9th cir 2003 united states v

united states v davis 905 f2d 245 249 n2 9th cir 1990 international law principles may be useful as rough guide of whether sufficient nexus exists between the defendant and the united states so that

at issue as one of notice it is akin to the proscriptions against secret laws and vague statutes the exception to the maxim that ignorance of the law is defense27 under this view indicia of knowledge of reason to know of an obligation to know or of reasonable ignorance of the laws requirements some of which are reflected in international standards seem to be the most relevant factors citizens for instance might be expected to know the laws of their own nation seafarers to know the law of the sea and consequently the laws of the nation under which they sail everyone should be aware of the laws of the land in which they find themselves and of the wrongs condemned by the laws of all nations28 on the other hand the application of american criminal statute to an alien in foreign country under whose laws the conduct is lawful would seem to evidence lack of notice sufficient to raise due process concerns29 conceding this outer boundary however the courts fairly uniformly have held that questions of extraterritoriality are almost exclusively within the discretion of congress determination to continued punishment of person apprehended with narcotics on the high seas perezoviedos state of facts presents an even stronger case for concluding that due process violation occurred the panamanian government expressly consented to the application of the mdlea such consent from the flag nation eliminates concern that the application of the mdlea may be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair united states v cardales 168 f3d 548 553 1 st cir 1999due process does not require the government to prove nexus between defendants criminal conduct and the united states in prosecution under the mdlea when the flag nation has consented to the application of united states law to the defendants 27 the rule that ignorance of the law will not excuse is deep in our law as is the principle that of all the powers of local government the police power is one of the least limitable on the other hand due process places some limits on its exercise ingrained in our concept of due process is the requirement of notice as holmes wrote in the common law law which punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too severe for that community to bear it severity lies in the absence of an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend any prosecution brought under it where as here person did not know of the duty to register and where there was proof of the probability of such knowledge he may not be convicted consistently with due process were it otherwise the evil woul d be as great as it is when the law is written in print too fine to read or in language foreign to the community lambert v california 355 us 225

2000odeh argues that application of sections 844f h and n 924c 930c and 2155 to the extraterritorial conduct he is alleged to have engaged in would violate his due process right to fair warning the government responds that while odeh may not have known that breadth of the statutory framework that would serve as the basis for the charges against him there is room for him to suggest that he has suddenly learned that mass murder was illegal in the united states or anywhere else the government also argues that odeh cannot be surprised to learn that his conduct was criminal under the laws of every civilized nation and thus he has right to complain about the particular forum in which he is brought to trial we likewise find this argument persuasive 29 consider eg united states v henriquez 731 f2d 131 134 n5 2d cir 1984 it is also argued that 21 usc 955aa as applied possession of marijuana with intent to distribute by colombian nationals aboard nonamerican vessel in international waters violates the notice requireme nt of the due process clause of the fifth amendment see lambert v california the argument is based not only on the claim that the statute is unprecedented in international law and the proposition that marijuana trafficking itself is not universally condemned but also on the alleged vagueness of the definition of vessel without nationality in 21 usc 955bd upon which federal jurisdiction was based on this point however we agree with the eleventh circuit that the term vessel without nationality clearly encompasses vessels not operating under the authority of any sovereign nation united states v alvarezmena 765 f2d 1259 1267 n11 5 th cir 1985 nevertheless we observe that we are not faced with situation where the interests of the united states

of the extent to which particular statute applies outside the united states has generally been considered matter of statutory rather than constitutional construction30 general rules of statutory construction have emerged which can explain if not presage the result in given case the first of these holds that statute will be construed to have only territorial application unless there is clear indication of some broader intent31 second rule of construction states that the nature and purpose of statute may provide an indication of whether congress intended stat ute to apply beyond the confines of the united states although hints of it can be found earlier32 the rule was first clearly announced in united states v bowman 260 us 94 9798 102 192233 30 eeoc v arabian american oil co 499

proposition congress has the authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial boundaries of the united states united states v gatlin 216 f3d 207 211 2d cir 2000 31 it is longstanding principle of

enforcement of foreign tax laws pasquantino v united states 544 us 349 36061 2005 the rule however does not preclude enforcement of federal criminal statute which proscribes defrauding foreign country of its tax revenues id at 35455 the commonlaw revenue rule rather than barring any recognition of foreign revenue law simply allows courts to refuse to enforce the tax judgments of foreign nations and therefore does not preclude the government from prosecuting 32 see eg american banana co v united fruit co 213 us at 35556 it is obvious that however stated the plaintiffs case depends on several rather startling propositions in the first place the acts causing the damage were done so far as appears outside the jurisdiction of the united states and within that of other states it is surprising to hear it argued that they were governed by the act of congress doubt in regions subject to sovereign like the high seas or to law that civilized countries would recognize as adequate such countries may treat some relations between their citizens as governed by their own law and keep to some extent the old notion of personal sovereignty alive they go further at times and declare that they will punish any one subject or not who shall do certain things if they can catch him as in the case of pirates on the high seas in cases immediately affecting national interests they may go further still and may make and if they get the chance execute similar threat as to acts done within another recognized jurisdiction an illustration from our statutes is found with regard to criminal correspondence with foreign governments 33 we have in this case question of statutory construction the necessary locus when not specifically defined depends upon the purpose of congress as evinced by the description and nature of the crime and upon the territorial limitations upon the power and jurisdiction of government to punish crime under the law of nations crimes against private individuals or their property like assaults murder burglary larceny robbery arson emb ezzlement and frauds of all kinds which affect the peace and good order of the community must of course be committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the government where it may properly exercise it if punishment of them is to be extended to include those committed outside the strict territorial jurisdicti on it is natural for congress to say so in the statute and failure to do so will negate the purpose of congress in this regard we have an example of this in the attempted application of the prohibitions of the antitrust law to acts done by citizens of the united states against other such citizens in foreign country american banana co v united fruit co 213 us 347 that was civil case but as the continued

impact within the united states34 the supreme court has painted the external force principle with broad brush man who outside of country willfully puts in motion force to take effect in it is answerable at the place where the evil is done ford v united states 273 us 593 623 1927 the principle has been found to accommodate cases of overseas attempts as well as foreign conspirators and accomplices35 the final rule declares that unless contrary intent is clear congress is assumed to have acted so as not to invite action inconsistent with international law36 at one time the cases seemed to imply the existence of fifth principle that is that unless congress declared that it intended statute to apply overseas to both aliens and american nationals it would be presumed to apply only to americans37 in the eyes of the community of nations jurisdictional claim over continued statute is criminal as well as civil it presents an analogy but the same rule of interpretation should not be applied to criminal statutes which are as class not logically dependent on their locality for the governments jurisdiction but are enacted because of the right of the government to defend itself against obstruction or fraud wherever perpetrated especially if committed by its own citizens officers or agents some such offenses can only be committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the government because of the local acts required to constitute them others are such that to limit their locus to the strictly territorial jurisdiction would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute and leave open large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries as at home in such cases congress has not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the high seas and foreign countries but allows it to be inferred from the nature of the offense clearly it is offens to the dignity or right of sovereignty of brazil where the fraud of which the united states government was the target occurred to hold these american defendants for this crime against the government to which

of any particular state or district shall be in the district where the offender is found or into which he is first brought the three defendants who were found in new york were citizens of the united

congress nor the courts are bound to the dictates of international law when enacting or interpreting statutes with extraterritorial application 39 yet congress looks to international law when it evaluates the policy considerations associated with legislation that may have international c onsequences for this reason the courts interpret legislation with the presumption that congress or the state legislature unless it indicates otherwise intends its laws to be applied within the bounds of international law to what extent does international law permit nation to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction the question is essentially one of national interests what national interest is served by extraterritorial application and what interests of other nations suffer by an extraterritorial application the most common classification of these interests dates to 1935 harvard law school study which divided them into five categories involving 1 the regulation of activities occurring within the territory of country 2 the regulation of the conduct of its nationals 3 the protection of its nationals 4 the regulation of activities outside country which have an impact within it and 5 the regulation of activities which are universally condemned 40 legislation may reflect more than one interest or principle and there is little consensus of the precise boundaries of the principles41

relations law of the united states contains perhaps the most comprehensive contemporary statement of international law in the area it indicates that the latitude international law affords country to enact try and punish violations of its law extraterritorially is matter of reasonableness and its assessment of reasonableness mirrors balancing of the interests represented in the principles42 continued reference to the nationality or national character of the person committing the offence third the protective principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the nationa l interest injured by the offence fourth the universality principle determining jurisdiction by referen ce to the custody of the person committing the offence and fifth the passive personality principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the natio nality or national character of the person injured by the offence of these five principles the first is everywhere regarded as of primary importance and of fundamental character the second is universally ccepted though there are striking differences in the extent to which it is used in different national systems the third is claimed by most states regarded with misgivings in few and generally ranked as the basis for an auxiliary competence the fourth is widely though by means universally accepted as the basis of an auxiliary competence except for the offence of piracy with respect to which it is the generally recognized principle of jurisdiction the fifth asserted in some form by considerable number of states and contested by others is admittedly auxiliary in character and is probably not essential for any state if the ends served are adequately provided for on other principles harvard research in international law jurisdiction with

activity is unreasonable is determined by evaluating all relevant factors including where appropriate the link of the activity to the territory of the regulated state ie the extent to which the activity takes place within the territory or has substantial direct and foreseeable effect upon or in the territory b the connections such as nationality residence or economic activity between the regulating state and the person principally responsible for the activity to be regulated or between that state and those whom the regulation is designed to protect c the character of the activity to be regulated the impor tance of regulation to the regulating state the extent to which other states regulate such activities and the degree to which the desirability of such regulation is generally accepted d the existence of justified expectations that might be protected or hurt by the regulation the importance of the regulation to the international political legal or economic system f the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the traditions of the international system g the extent to which another state may have an interest in regulating the activity and h the likelihood of conflict with regulation by another state 3 when it would not be unreasonable for each of two states to exercise jurisdiction over person or activity but the prescriptions by the two states are in conflict each state has an obligation to evaluate its own as well as the other states interest in exercising jurisdiction in light of all the rele vant factors subsection 2 state should defer to the

that substantial number of other federal crimes operate overseas by virtue of the implicit intent of congress in fact the lower federal courts have read bowman and ford to suggest that american extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction includes wide range of statutes designed to protect federal officers employees and property to prevent smuggling and to deter the obstruction or corruption of the overseas activities of federal departments and agencies 62 they have held for instance that the statute outlawing the assassination of members of congress may be applied against an american for murder committed in foreign country 63 and that statutes prohibiting the murder or kidnaping of federal law enforcement officials apply in other countries even if the offenders are not americans64 and even if the offenders incorrectly believed the victims were federal law enforcement officers65 they have also discovered extraterritorial jurisdiction appropriate to 1 cases where aliens have attempted to defraud the united states in order to gain admission into the united states66 2 to false statements made by americans overseas67 3 to the theft of federal property by americans abroad68

fact bound determinations may be involved that does not automatically mean that the 46 uscapp 1903 jurisdictional issue has to be decided by the jury consequently even if questions under the 46 uscapp 1903 jurisdictional requirement may have factual component that component does not have to be resolved by the jury given that as we have explained the jurisdictional requirement goes only to the courts subject matter jurisdiction and does not have to be treated as an element of mdlea substantive offense we also note that our rejection of the appellants argument concerning the factbound nature of 46 uscapp 1903 jurisdictional determinations appears to put us in conflict with one of our sister circuits in united states v smith the ninth circuit concluded that the district court erred by taking the issue of whether the 1903 jurisdictional requirement had been met completely away from the jury 81 the comparable question under state law is the extent to wh ich states criminal law

logical consequence of purely territorial application the constitution seems to have preordained this result when it vested responsibility for protecting american interests and fulfilling american responsibilities overseas in the federal government82 the primacy of the federal government in foreign affairs might suggest that the constitution precludes the application of state law in other countries but the commentators recognize limited power of the states to enact law governing conduct outside the united states obviously congress may by preemptive action extinguish the legislative authority of state in any area over which congress has plenary powers and th supremacy clause also renders treaties to which the united states is party binding upon the states and therefore beyond their legislative reach 83 beyond the constitutional limitations however the question is one of whether the state actually intended to legislate extraterritorially not whether it has the power to do so84 the states have chosen to make their laws applicable beyond their boundaries in only limited set of circumstances and ordinarily only in cases where there is some clear nexus to the state85 perhaps the most common state statutory provisi on claiming state extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction is one which asserts jurisdiction in cases where some of the elements of the offense are committed within the state or others are committed outside it86 another common claim is 82 see eg us const artii 2 cl2 the president shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the senate

extraterritorial scope and great many more have apparent extraterritorial range prosecutions are few investigators and prosecutors face legal practical and often dipl omatic obstacles that can be daunting some of these are depicted in the description that follows of some of procedural aspects of the american investigation and prosecution of crime committed abroad with respect to diplomatic concerns the restatement observes it is universally recognized as corollary of state sovereignty that officials of one state may not exercise their functions in the territory of another state without the latters consent thus while state may take certain measures of nonjudicial enforcement against person in another state its law enforcement officers cannot arrest him in another state and can engage in criminal investigation in that state only with that states consent r estatement third of foreign relations law 432 cmt b 1986 failure to comply can result in strong diplomatic protests liability for reparations and other remedial repercussions to say nothing of the possible criminal prosecution of offending foreign investigators92 consequently investigations within another country of extraterritorial federal crimes without the consent or at least acquiescence of the host country are extremely rare

except under two circumstances the first exception covered foreign conduct which shocked the conscience of the court110 the second reached foreign searches or seizures in which american law enforcement officials were so deeply involved as to constitute joint ventures or some equivalent level of participation111 the cases seldom explained whether these exceptions operated under all circumstances or only when searches or seizures involved the person or property of americans in the days when mla ts were scarce however the courts rarely if ever encountered circumstances sufficient to activate either exception verdugourquidez may suggest more narrow application of the fourth amendment than was previously contemplated it holds that the f ourth amendment does not apply to the search and seizure by united states agents of property that is owned by nonresident alien and located in foreign country 494 us at 261 the majority opinion is grounded not in the principles previously announced by the lower courts but in its reading of the history of the amendment and of the courts earlier treatment of the constitutions application overseas and to aliens 112 earlier lower court jurisprudence is neither mentioned nor cited moreover one of the justices in the five member majority and sixth justice authored concurrences in which they indicated that fourth amendment reasonableness abroad may be very different from the amendments demands domestically113 one commentator argues that the concurrences shou ld be read as confining rather than expanding the impact of

and the place searched was located in mexico under these circumstances the fourth amendment has application 494 us 27475 113 494 us at 278 kennedy j concurringthe absence of local judges or magistrates available to issue warrants the differing and perhaps unascertainable conceptions of reasonableness and privacy that prevail abroad and the need to cooperate with foreign officials all indicate that the fourth amendments warrant requirement should not apply in mexico as it does in this country id at 279 stevens j concurring in the judgmenti do agree however with the governments submission that the search conducted by the united states agents with the approval and cooperation of the mexican authorities was not unreasonable as that term is used in the first clause of the amendment i do not believe the warrant clause has any application to searches of noncitizens homes in foreign jurisdictions b ecause american magistrates have power to authorize such searches

the issue discussed herein when if ever united states connection with search in foreign country is substantial enough to make the fourth amendment and its exclusionary rule applicable is of relevance whenever that search is directed at an alien not then in the united states but an examination of the positions of the two concurring and three dissenting justices suggests otherwise the dissenters are of the view that if the foreign search is properly characterized as united states activity then the fourth amendment applies if the defendant is being subjected to us criminal prosecution thus the most that can be definitely concluded from verdugourquidez is that the fourth amendments warrant clause is inapplicable to search conducted under the circumstances present in that case beyond that much depends upon the exact positions of the two cryptic concurring justices 1 lafave s earch and seizure treatise on the fourth amendment 32526 4th ed 2004emphasis in the original subsequent case law in the lower federal courts acknowledges verdugourquidez and molds the principles of the opinion for the court into the body of preexisting law although limited it indicates that the fourth amendment does not apply to search conducted overseas of the property of foreign national with voluntary connection to the united states114 as for overseas searches of the property of americans or aliens permanently resident in the united states the fourth amendment is said not to apply to search by foreign officials unless conducted as joint venture with american authorities or unless the conduct of the foreign officials shocks the conscience of the court115 nevertheless the fourth amendments reasonableness standard applies to united states officials conducting search affecting united states citizen in foreign country 116 on the other hand even under such circumstances foreign search is reasonable if it conforms to the requirements of foreign law and such search will be upheld under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule when united states officials reasonably rely on foreign officials representations of foreign law117

offense occurs137 or require extradition where the extraterritorial laws of the two nations are compatible138 more recent extradition treaties address other traditional features of our earlier agreements that complicate extradition most notable the nationality exception the political offense exception and the practice of limiting extradition to list of specifically designated offenses federal crimes committed within other countries are more likely to be the work of foreign nationals than is otherwise the case unfortunately the most common type of treaty provision provides that neither of the contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects139 most treaties negotiated of late however contain either an article declaring that extradition may not be denied on the basis of nationality140 or one declaring that if extradition is denied on the basis of nationality the case must be referred to local authorities for prosecution141 the political offense exception is now standard clause in almost all extradition treaties of the world142 originally designed to protect unsuccessful insurgents in flight143 it is often construed to include both the purely political offense such as treason and sedition and the relatively political offense such as an act of violence committed during the course of and in furtherance of political upheaval144 the exception is somewhat at odds with contemporary desires to prevent prosecute and punish acts of terrorism consequently treaties forged over the last several years frequently include some form of limitation on the exception often accompanied by 136 eg extradition treaty usjordan art24 streaty doc 1043 an offense described in this article shall be an extraditable offense regardless of where the act or acts

united states law and practice 595 4th ed 2002 143 quinn v robinson 783 f2d 776 79293 9th cir 1986the political offense exception is premised on number of justifications first its historical development suggests that it is grounded on the belief that individuals have right to resort to political activism to foster political change this justification is c onsistent with the modern consensus that political crimes have greater legitimacy than common crimes second the exception reflects concern that individuals particularly unsuccessful rebels should not be returned to countries where they may be subjected to unfair trials and punishments because of their political opinions third the exception comports with the notion that governments and certainly their nonpolitical branches should not intervene in the internal political struggles of other nations 144 bassiouni i nternational extradition united states law and practice 594673 4th ed 2002

deposition be captured on videotape174 but they have permitted depositions to be admitted into evidence at subsequent criminal trials in this country notwithstanding the fact that one or more of these optimal conditions are not present175 in some of those nations whose laws might not otherwise require or even permit depositions under conditions considered preferable under our law treaty provision addresses the issue176 the federal rules of evidence govern the admissibil ity of evidence in federal criminal trials deposition taken overseas that has survived rule 15 and confrontation clause scrutiny is likely to be found admissible the hearsay rule rule 802 which reflects the laws preference for evidence that is exposed to the adversarial process poses the most obvious obstacle177 the rules continued confront and crossexamine the swiss witness which he waived when he and his attorney decided not to attend the taking of the depositions 173 united states v sines 761 f2d 1434 1441 9th cir 1985the supreme court has identified the major purposes of the confrontation clause as 1 ensuring that witnesses well testify under oath 2 forcing witnesses to undergo crossexamination and 3 permitting the jury to observe the demeanor of witnesses all three of these purposes were fulfilled when stenemans videotaped deposition was ta ken in thailand with sines attorney present 174 united states v medjuck 156 f3d 916 920 9th cir 1998when the government is unable to secure witnesss presence at trial rule 15 is not violated by admission of videotaped testimony so long as the government makes diligent efforts to secure the defendants physical presence at the deposition and failing th is employs procedures that are adequate to allow the defendant to take an active role in the deposition proceedings the government was unable to secure medjucks presence at the canadian depositions because there was mechanism in place to allow united states officials to transfer medjuck to canadian authorities and secure his return to the united states in timely fashion after the depositions finally the government set up an elaborate system to allow medjuck to witness the depositions live by video feed and to participate with his attorneys by private telephone connection during the depositions taken in canada an exception to the confrontation requirements has been recognized for admission of deposition testimony where witness is unavailable to tes tify at trial first the deposition testimony must fall within an established exception to the hearsay rule second the deposition must be taken in compliance with law finally the defendant must have had an opportunity to crossexamine the deposed witness united states v kelly 892 f2d 255 26062 3d cir 1980 united states v walker 1

believe that so long as the pr osecution makes diligent efforts to attempt to secure the defendants presence preferably in person but if necessary via some form of live broadcast the refusal of the host government to permit the defendant to be present should not preclude the district court from ordering that the witness testimony be preserved anyway however the district court should satisfy itself that defense counsel will be given an opportunity to crossexamine the witness in order to fulfill the mandate of rule 15b to ensure likelihood that the deposition will not violate the confrontation clause 175 united states v sturman 951 f2d 1466 14804816th cir 1992swiss law forbids verbatim transcription so the summary method of establishing the reocrd was the most effective legal method all defense questions with just one exception were submitted to the witnesses so that objections and determinations on admissibility could be litigated later although the witnesses were not given an oath defense conceded that each witness was told the penalties for giving false testimony depositions taken in foreign countries cannot at all times completely emulate the united states methods of obtaining testimony here all steps were taken to ensure the defendants rights while respecting the legal rules established in different country 176 eg treaty on mutual legal assistance on

one that has been applied to depositions taken overseas under the authority of rule 15179 yet the question of admissibility of overseas depositions rests ultimately upon whether the confrontation clause demands can be satisfied the cases thus far have relied upon the supreme courts decisions either in roberts v ohio180 or in maryland v craig 181 faced with the question of whether trial witnesses might testify remotely via twoway video conference craig held that the confrontation clauses requirement of physica l facetoface confrontation between witness and defendant at trial can be excused under limited circumstances in light of considerations of public policy and necessities of the case182 roberts dealt with the question of whether the admission of hearsay evidence violated the confrontation clause and declared that as long as the hearsay evidence came within firmly rooted hearsay exception its admission into evidence in criminal trial constituted breach of the clause 183 more recent decisions might be thought to call into question any continued reliance on roberts and craig at minimum the supreme courts crawford v washington opinion repudiates the suggestion that roberts permits anything less than actual confrontation in the case of testimonial hearsay184 and at least one appellate panel has concluded that the prosecutions need for critical evidence does not alone supply the kind of public policy considerations necessary to qualify for craig exception185 on the other hand since the pre crawford cases required good faith effort to assure the defendants attendance at overseas depositions it might be argued that crawford requires adjustment in the areas jurisprudence moreover the eleventh circuit banc craig analysis implied that it thought the use of overseas depositions at trial more compatible with the confrontation clause than the use of video trial testimony186 continued pursuant to statutory authority or by act of congress frevid rule 802

admission of foreign business records in federal courts 18 usc 3505187 the section covers foreign records of regularly conducted activity in virtually any form ie any memorandum report record or data compilation in any form of acts events conditions opinions or diagnoses maintained in foreign country 18 usc 3505c1 it exempts qualified business records from the operation of the hearsay rule in federal criminal proceedings188 and permits their authentication upon foreign certification189 finally it establishes procedure under which the reliability of the documents can be challenged in conjunction with other pretrial motions190 while the prosecutions failure to provide timely notice of its intent to rely upon section 3505 does not necessarily bar admission191 its failure to supply foreign certification of authenticity precludes admission under the section192 early appellate decisions upheld section 3505 in the face of confrontation clause challenges as in the case of depositions drawing support from roberts v ohio 193 as noted above crawford cast doubt upon the continued vitality of the roberts rule hearsay poses confrontation problems as long as it falls within firmly rooted hearsay exception when it held that only actual confrontation will suffice in the case of testimonial hearsay194 although it left for another day continued under the circumstances of this case which include the availability of rule 15 deposition the prosecutors need for the video conference testimony to make case and to expeditiously resolve it are not the type of public policies that are important enough to outweigh the defendants ri ghts to confront their accusers facetoface 187 under 3505 foreign certification serves to authenticate the foreign records and thus dispenses

business activity made such record as regular practice and d if such record is not the original such record is duplicate of the original unless the source of information or the method or circumstances
