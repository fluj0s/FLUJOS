sanctuary endangered speciessection 2 iwitnessp6 after tigers its the turn of river dolphins to become endangered the plummeting numbers have been blamed on poaching pollution and the fishing nets in which they get entangled says siba mohanty whos killing our dolphins gangas mount who are they dolphins are marine mammals that are closely related to whales and porpoises there are almost forty species varying in size from 12 metres and 40 kg up to 95 m and 10 tonnes they evolved about 10 million years ago they are considered to be amongst the most intelli gent of animals and their friendly appearance and playful attitude have made them popular in human culture the name dolphin derives from the ancient greek word delphis related to delphys meaning womb so the name can be interpreted as fish with womb mating happens belly to belly and though many species engage in lengthy fore play the actual act is usually only brief but may be repeated several times within short times pan dolphins are known to have sex for reasons other than reproduction sometimes also engag ing in acts of homosexual nature occasionally they will also show sexual behaviour towards other animals including humans

dolphins have belly buttonsdolphins are bald their skin contains hair folliclessebaceous or sweat glandswhen the last tiger count showed there was drastic fall in the number of the big cats it sparked fears of the animal being wiped out from its habi tats now the same fears are being raised about the ganges river dolphins as according to recent survey their number has come down drastically over the last couple of years considered one of the most intelligent crea tures and top predators of the riverine ecosystems the ganges river dolphins are the onlyfreshwater species available in india other thanthe facultative irrawady ones once found in abundance along the gangesbrahmaputra beltthese creatures are now in danger of becoming extinct with poaching pollution dams mining and deforestation ironically the ganges river dolphins pla tanista gangetica enjoy high levels of protection both in india and abroad the international union for conservation of nature iucn hasplaced it on its red list under the endangeredcategory while it is schedulei animal underthe wildlife protection act 1972 however the firstever survey of the river dol phins in india which covered 5244 km of theganges and the brahmaputra across assam bihar uttar pradesh madhya pradesh jharkhandrajasthan and west bengal found less than 1800 of these mammals in the entire belt the survey conducted by the world wildlife fund wwf during 200105 also found them confined to 34 stretches of the two rivers and their 16 tributaries while some of habitats of the dolphins offer hope others give cause for concern along thestretch of the ganges between allahabad andballiachapra in bihar about 300 of these sususas they are popularly known because of the peculiar noise they make were sighted betweenpatna and farakka their population was estimated at 224 while in ghagra river between the kailashpuri barrage and deurighat in uttar pradesh their numbers stood at 295 the muna also showed decent population of 104 inthe stretch between chambal region and alla habad the chambal river in madhya pradeshhas about 90 dolphins sandeep k behera coordinator freshwater species wwfindia who is also known as thedolphin man warns that river dolphins are fastdepleting in assam mainly in the brahmaputraand kulsi while there is similar trend in theson kosi and ganges rivers in bihar there are only 190 dolphins in six stretches of the brahmaputra in assam and these face the threat of poaching the survey team also could not find even one dolphin between the madhyaganga barrage at bijnour and the bimgoda barrage near haridwar this is 100km loss in themammals distribution range the situation inthe yamuna above the confluence of the chambal river where dolphins were historicallysighted around the year is similar binn migrant fishing community of bihar is also responsible for the largescale hunting ofdolphins whose oil is used as bait for catchingfish and to cure rheumatism burns and asthma the decline in dolphin populations is also at tributed to pollution particularly in the ganges because of shortsighted and nonrelenting velopment policies the basin of this river ishome to about 450 million people at an averageof 550 persons per sq km in the deltaic zone thenumber virtually doubles to 900 per sq km justimagine the kind of pressure this puts on theriver says behera there are about 30 cities 70 towns and sever thousand villages along the banks of theganges over 13 billion litres of sewage generated by these human habitations goes into theriver along with thousands of animal carcass add another 260 million litres of industrial wastewater and 9000 tonnes of pesticides everyyear six million tonnes of chemical fertilisersare also released into the river says behera as if the population load were not bad enough the fragmentation of dolphin habitats has addedto the threat the ganges river system is interrupted in many places by numerous water development projects this not only restricts dolphins mobility but also fragments their habitatsand thus results in their population getting ge netically isolated adds behera the iucn has cautioned that if the ambitious gangabrahmaputra interlinking canal and the subsequent dam projects are complete by 2016 the impact would be disastrous in that casethe population of river dolphins may reduce by50 per cent says an iucn official the high rate of siltation low flow of water and effluent discharge have only worsened thequality of habitats the chambal river in madhya pradesh and rajasthan faces the brunt ofexcessive sand excavation and stone and limequarrying leading to heavy siltation the irrawaddy dolphins orcaella bervi rostris which are little smaller than the gangesriver ones are also facing such situation theyhave bulging forehead and shorter beak and are found only in south and southeast asian countries in india they are found only in orissas chilika lagoon which boasts of the worlds single
