damage other parts of the body it is spread when an infected person coughs sneezes sings or talks and anothe r person breathes in the bacteria2 the risk of becoming infected depends on various factor s including the extent of the disease in the person with tb the duration of the ex posure and ventilation for example when an infected individual travels on an airplane the risk to other passengers is increased by proximity to the infected person and the time spent on board3 the world health organization who has stated that one in three people in the world is infected with dormant tb bacteria4

power in that the federal statute authorizing quarantine authority does not directly address persons l eaving the country the law is clear in its application to persons coming into the united states from foreign country or us possession and for persons m oving from state to state but the law does not address preventing the movement of persons with communicable diseases out of the country historically quarantin has been used to keep people out of an area andor to contain them if they may be contagious but as the case of mr speaker illustrates in this age of global travel pub lic health authorities ma have to deal with the possibility of detaining person to prevent the exportation of an infectious disease28 the cdc on november 22 2005 announced proposed changes to its quarantine regulations29 if adopted these changes would constitute the first significant revision of the regulations in parts 70 and 71 in 25 years the proposed changes are an outgrowth of the cdcs experience during the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 when the agency experienced difficulties locating and contacting air line passengers who might have been exposed to sars during

us constitution and federal civil rights laws provide for individual due process and equal protection rights as well as right to privacy but these rights are balanced against the needs of the community with the advance of medical treatments in recent years especially the use of antibiotics the civil rights of the individual with contagious disease have been emphasized however classic public health measures such as quarantine isolati on and contact tracing are nevertheless available in appropriate situa tions and as new or resurgen t diseases have become less treatable some of these classic public hea lth measures have been increasingly used therefore the issue of how to balance these various interests in modern culture which is sensitive to issues of individual rights has

them to evade authorities by ensuring that continuedamendments prohibit governments at all vels from depriving individuals of any constitutionally protected liberty interest without due pro cess of law what process may be due under certain circumstances is generally determined by balancing the individuals interest at stake against th governmental interest served by the restraints determining whether the measures are reasonably calculated to achieve the governments aims46 and deciding whether the least restrictive means have been employed to further that interest in oconnor v donaldson47 the supreme court examined the civil commitment of an individual to mental hospital nd held that state cannot constitutionally confine without more nondangerous indivi dual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and respons ible family members or friends48 clearly an individual who is highly contagious with serious illness may be considered dangerous and thus subject to involunt ary confinement if there is less restrictive alternative the lesson of donaldson is that such confinements must be carefully examined in order to comport with the constitutional right to due process donaldson also raises the issue of whether less restrictive programs are required prior to the imposition of the more restrictive application of isolation or quarantine it could be argued that the least restrictive alternative must first be applied or more restrictive alternatives will run afoul of constitutional requirements49httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34144crs12 49 continued coercion is used only when less restrictive alternatives will not work and with due regard for the rights of those detained the law can

york citys use of isolation orders for tuberculosis in the 1990s show that more th an 90 of the people detained were nonwhite and more than 60 were homeless although these figures may reflect the democracy of noncompliant patients with tuberculosis in new york city at that tim the fact that the most potent public health tool was used pr imarily against marginalized nonwhite persons underscores

discrimination issues in the context of tuberculosis and section 504 in school board of nassau county v arline57 the court found that in most cases an indivi dualized inquiry is necessary in order to protect individuals with disabilities from deprivation based on prejudice stereotypes or unfounded fear while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of grantees as avoiding exposin g others to significant health and safety risks58 the court adopted the st enunciated by the amer ican medical association ama amicus brief and held that the f actors which must be considered include
