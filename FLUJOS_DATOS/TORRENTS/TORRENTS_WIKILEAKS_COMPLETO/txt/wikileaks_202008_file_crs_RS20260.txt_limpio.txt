neale analyst in american national government government and finance division summary in the original document article ii section 1 clause 6 of the constitution provided that in the event of the presidents inability to discharge the powers and duties of his office the same shall devolve on the vice president this language was superseded by the 25th amendment to the constitution ratified in 1967 although there were several instances of severe presidential disability between 1789 and 1967 vice president sought to assume the chief executives powers and duties during this period sections 3 and 4 of the 25th amendment currently govern cases of presidential disability under section 3 if the president declares in written declaration to the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate that he is disabled for any reason the vice president assumes his powers and duties as acting president section 4 provides for cases in which the president may not be able to transmit disability declaration in these circumstances the vice president and the cabinet or such other body as congress may by law provide disability review body can by majority vote declare the president to be disabled it also empowers the president to declare his disability ended again by written declaration and resume his powers and duties if however the vice president and majority of either the cabinet or disability review body rule otherwise then congress decides the issue vote of twothirds of both houses within 21 days is required to determine the president to be disabled and continue the disability otherwise he resumes his powers and duties neither section 3 nor section 4 has been invoked since the amendment was ratified this report will be updated if events warrant for information on sections 1 and 2 of the 25th amendment which provide for presidential succession consult presidential and vice presidential succession crs report 98731 gov constitutional provisions 17891967 the constitutions original provisions governing presidential disability or inability were inserted in the document late in the proceedings of the philadelphia convention of 1787 where the delegates approved the formula that appears in article ii section 1 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and vice president declaring what officer shall then act as president and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or president shall be elected emphases added constitutional historians note that the clause does not define disability or differentiate between it and inability although contemporary dictionaries characterized the former as complete lack of power and the latter as lack of ability to do certain thing1 further while specifying who acts as president in the event of presidential disability the vice president the clause provides guidance on how it would be invoked by whom or for what length of time or on how disability could be terminated or rescinded2 the ambiguities inherent in the disability section may have contributed to its dormancy over the long period that elapsed between adoption of the constitution and ratification of the 25th amendment during these 178 years eight presidents died in office and were succeeded by their vice presidents without serious incident notwithstanding controversy as to whether the vice president acted as president or became the president under such circumstances3 in that same period however number of presidents suffered from disabling illnesses for varying periods but vice president ever became acting president during any one of these episodes for instance president george washington was disabled for month in 1790 by nearfatal case of pneumonia james garfield lingered for 79 days after being shot by an assassin in 1881 before garfields death various plans were suggested for vice president chester arthur to assume the powers and duties of the presidency but none progressed beyond the talking stage in 1893 grover cleveland secretly underwent two cancer surgeries performed on yacht cruising long island sound and subsequently spent two months recuperating in massachusetts presidential disabilities of the 20th century are perhaps better known on october 2 1919 president woodrow wilson suffered stroke from which he never fully recovered during the remainder of his term the gravity of his illness was concealed from the press and public and access to the president was strictly controlled vice president thomas marshall was excluded from political or executive duties throughout the period and secretary of state james lansing was forced to resign when wilson learned that he had convened the cabinet informally to deal with pressing questions4 although wilsons health improved several measures were introduced in the 66th congress providing

constitutionality of such measures deterred any concrete action however5 some historians assert that president franklin d roosevelt was increasingly incapacitated by cardiovascular disease in the last years of his presidency but as with wilson this knowledge was suppressed due to wartime conditions6 finally president dwight eisenhower was incapacitated to some degree on three occasions he was hospitalized for seven weeks in 1955 following heart attack in 1956 he underwent surgery to remove benign intestinal obstruction and finally in 1957 he suffered mild stroke but returned to work in less than week7 to deal with these instances eisenhower reached an informal agreement with vice president nixon under which the latter conducted most cabinet meetings and routine executive business during the chief executives illness but deferred to eisenhower on substantive policy questions8 the 25th amendment conception passage and ratification following the death of president roosevelt in 1945 the question of presidential succession was revisited leading to the presidential succession act of 1947 61 stat 380 which inserted the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate into the line of succession after the vice president but ahead of the cabinet president eisenhowers illnesses stimulated further interest in the disability question but it was the shocking assassination of president john f kennedy in 1963 that provided the catalyst for congressional action following the presidents death the nation was confronted with lengthy vacancy in the vice presidency and concerns over the health of the new chief executive and his potential successors9 in this context senator birch bayh chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional amendments of the senate judiciary committee sought to remedy both the succession and the disability questions with constitutional amendment sj res 1 introduced in the 89th congress on january 6 1965 the measure which enjoyed bipartisan support was reported favorably by the senate subcommittee on constitutional amendments on february 1 1965 and by the full judiciary committee on february 10 the primary objection in senate floor debate concerned its detailed procedures for resolving presidential disability disputes some senators questioned the wisdom of including such level of detail within the amendment preferring statutes that would be authorized by the amendment supporters of the bayh 5 silva presidential succession pp 6466 6 kenneth r crispell and carlos f gomez hidden illness in the white house

010 the house of representatives began consideration of its version hj res 1 with hearings before the full judiciary committee in early 1965 here again debate centered on procedures by which president could be declared disabled and on subsequent disputes that might arise as to whetherand whenthe period of disability was over the committee reported its version of the amendment incorporating changes indicated by these concerns on march 24 the house passed its own amended version of the proposal on april 13 voting to substitute it for the senate form conferees required two months to resolve differences between the competing amendments before the house approved the conference report by voice vote on june 30 and the senate concurred on july 6 by vote of 68 to 511 the proposed amendment was circulated to the states on july 7 1965 although it enjoyed widespread support state legislatures were not able to move rapidly since many had adjourned for the year by the time the proposal was transmitted ratification by the necessary 38 states threefourths as provided by the constitution required 19 months and was completed on february 10 1967 at which time the 25th amendment became an operative part of the constitution sections 3 and 4 procedures and discussion sections 3 and 4 of the 25th amendment establish procedures concerning disability of the president12 section 3 is activated when the president transmits written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office to the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives thus providing for voluntary implementation of disability procedures the vice president then assumes these powers and duties as acting president and continues to serve until the president transmits another declaration to the same congressional officers stating that he is longer disabled although nothing prohibits the president from stating time certain for recovery of his powers and duties the language of the amendment appears to require revocation message to end the disability the most obvious use of section 3 would be in the event president was being treated for serious illness or undergoing any sort of medical procedure that required anesthesia in these circumstances the vice president as acting president would temporarily exercise all the chief executives powers he would however lose his position as president of the senate as provided in the constitution13 opinions differ as to whether section 3 has ever been implemented on july 13 1985 10 constitutional amendment on presidency congressional quarterly almanac 89th congress st 1 session 1965 vol 21 washington congressional quarterly service 1966 p 578 11 ibid pp 580581 12 section 1 of the amendment provides that the vice president becomes president when the chief executive is removed from office dies or resigns section 2 provides that when the vice presidency is vacant the president nominates replacement subject to confirmation by majority vote of both houses of congress 13 the senate shall chuse president pro tempore in the absence of the vice president or when he shall exercise the office of president of the united states constitution article 1 section 3 crs5 president ronald reagan informally transferred presidential powers to vice president george bush for several hours while he was undergoing cancer surgery although his actions generally followed procedures established in section 3 he specifically refrained from invoking the 25th amendment declining to set precedent that might bind future presidents14 some experts however insist that president reagan did in fact trigger section 3 by his actions notwithstanding his own assertions15 another unresolved question concerning this section is whether it could be appropriately used to cover political disability on the part of president succession and disability scholar john d feerick notes that president richard nixon was urged to step aside under section 3 in 1973 and 1974 in order to devote his full attention to defending himself against the watergaterelated charges that eventually led to his resignation16 section 4 is activated when either the vice president and majority of the cabinet or the vice president and majority of such other body as congress by law may provide sometimes referred to as disability review body declare that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office this constitutes contingent implementation of disability procedures process that could be initiated if the president were unable or unwilling to declare himself disabled section 4 further provides that the president resumes office when he transmits to the president pro tempore and the speaker declaration that disability exists if however the vice president and majority of the cabinet or the vice president and majority of the disability review body if one has been established by law declare to the contrary within four days of the presidents declaration congress must decide the issue if it is not in session it must reassemble within 48 hours to consider the question and it must render decision within 21 calendar days only if twothirds majority of both houses of congress votes to certify that the president is disabled does the vice president continue as acting president otherwise the president resumes his powers and duties section 4 is intended as one source puts it to provide for sick president who refuses or is unable to confront his disability put another way this section was basically framed to apply to president who is disabled but unwilling to step aside17 another study suggests it is the type of provision which theoretically might have been used in the last months of the wilson and the franklin d roosevelt presidencies18 several of its fine print provisions deserve comment first it should be noted that the vice president is the indispensable actor in section 4 it cannot be invoked without his agreement 14 letter to the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house on the discharge of the presidents powers and duties during his

departments or such other body as congress may by law provide refers in the former case to the cabinet but only to those members who are the heads of departments thus excluding such cabinet rank officials as the us trade representative and the ambassador to the united nations according to feerick the legislative history is unclear as to whether acting department heads were intended to participate in disability decision19 third the use of the construction eitheror when referring to the cabinet and the other body strongly indicates that if congress were to establish such body it would supplant the cabinet for the purposes of invoking section 4 finally the language of the amendment clearly requires the approval of both the vice president and majority of the cabinet or alternatively the vice president and the other body to declare section 4 presidential disability other points concern the disability review body itself the form it would take feerick suggests that congress could designate itself expand or restrict membership of the cabinet or combine the cabinet with other officials20 the legislative vehicle used to create one either joint resolution or bill both requiring presidential approval since the body must be created by law and whether it would be appropriate for congress to establish one in advance of an anticipated disability section 4s complexity and its potential for an involuntary finding of presidential disability has troubled some observers during consideration of the 25th amendment congress considered number of possible horror story scenarios21 it can be argued that the section provides opportunities for political mischief by disloyal vice president and cabinet or congressional usurpation of executive prerogatives it can be further suggested that section 4 like the impeachment process is so powerful and so fraught with constitutional and political implications that it would never be used except in the most compelling circumstances since its invocation might well precipitate ipso facto constitutional crisis on the other hand senator bayh and other crafters of the amendment included powerful checks to deter abuse the presidents ability to challenge section 4 declaration of disability the requirement of timely decision by congress and ultimately the need for two thirds vote in both houses to sustain section 4 finding of disability by the vice president and the cabinet or disability review body as one study concluded because the amendment deals with unpredictable human frailties it is not perfect solution but few exist in constitutional history the task is to make the most of what the amendment encompasses success depends on the good judgment and good sense of our leaders and the citizenry22 19 feerick
