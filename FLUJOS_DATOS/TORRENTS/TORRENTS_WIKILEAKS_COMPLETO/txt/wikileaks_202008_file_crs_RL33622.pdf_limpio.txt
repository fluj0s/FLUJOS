hardline communi st state under fidel castro for more than 47 years but fidels july 31 2006 announcement that he was ceding political power to his brother raúl for several week s in order to recover from surgery could be the beginning of political transition over the past few years there has been increased speculation about cubas future without fidel who turned 80 on august 13 2006 while previous predictions about fidels immin ent demise proved premature his recent surgery and advanced age make the date of his permanent departure from the political scene all the clos er before his recent surgery observers discerned several potential scenarios for cubas future after fidel these fit into three broad categories the continuation of communist government military government or democratic transition or fully democratic government according to most observers the most likely scenario at least in the short term is successor communist government led by raúl castr this the most likely scenario for variety of reasons but especially because of raúls official designation as successor and his position as leader of the cuban military for number of years the us governme nt has begun to plan for cuba without fidel at the helm this has included ex amining transition issues and appointing state department cuba tran sition coordinator assistance has been provided primarily through the us agency for international development usaid but also through the department of state to f und projects aimed at pr omoting democratic transition in cuba the bush administration established an interagency commission for assistance to free cuba to help plan for cubas transition to democracy and to help cubans hasten the transition to democracy some observers however have questioned the adequacy of the transition planning in part because it does not recognize the likelihood of successor communist government headed by fidels brother raúl in the new context of fidels transfer of power there are two broad policy approaches to contend with political change in cuba staythecourse or statusquo approach that would maintain the us dualtrack policy of isolating the cuban government while providing support to the cuban people and an approach aimed at influencing the cuban govern ment and cuban society thr ough increased contact and engagement some members support the ad ministrations stay thecourse policy approach through assistance to strengthen cuban civil society while maintaining us economic sanctions other mbers advocate change in us policy toward cuba in the direction of engagement easing sa nctions or providing the president with flexibility to respond to change in cuba this report will not be update d it was written in the af termath of fidel castros july 2006

revolution which ousted the corr upt government of fulgencio batista soon after taking power castro laid the foundations for an authoritarian regime by consolidating power and forcing moderate s out of the government in april 1961 castro stated that the cuban revoluti on was socialist and in december 1961 he proclaimed himself to be marxistleninist from 1959 until 1976 castro ruled by decree the castro government adopted c onstitution in 1976 later amended in 1992 and 2002 which set forth the communist party as the leading for ce in the state and society the 2002 amendments stated that socialism nd the revolutionary political and social system in the constitution ar irrevocable and cuba will never again return to capitalism2 castro has dominated the communist party through his

highest executive br anch authority and as president of the council of state which ma kes legislative decisions on behalf of the national assembly of peoples power when it is not in session as president of the council of state castro has continued as both head of state and government since the promulgation of the 1976 constitution3 for number of years fidels brother raúl as first vice president of the council of state has been the officially designated successor pursuant to article 94 of the constitution and slated to become head of state and head of government with fidels departure raúl also has served as first vice president of the council of ministers as minister of the revolutio nary armed forces far and as second secretary of the communist party his position in the party was confirmed at the last congress held in october 1997 during whic h fidel publicly endorsed raúl as his political successor although many observers believe that th eventual demise of cubas communist system of government is inevitable there is considerable disagreement over when or how this may occur some point to fidel castros age and increasing fragility in recent years and predict that the regime w ill collapse when castro is not at the helm other observers stress that fidel is still not out of the picture and that the cuban government has plan for the permanent succession of his brother raúl they point to cubas strong security apparatus and the extraordinary system of controls that prevents dissidents from gaining popular support httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33622crs3 4 there

institute for cuban and cubanamerican studies university of miami staff report issue 64 may 31 2005before fidels recent surgery observers discerned several potential scenarios for cubas future when fidel either dies in office or departs the political scene because of age or declining health4 these fit into three broad categories the continuation of communist government military government or democratic transition or fully demo cratic government successor communist government according to most observers the most likely scenario at least in the short term is successor communist government led by raúl castro this is the case for variety of reasons but especially because of raúls designation by fidel as successor in the party and his position as leader of the far which since 1989 has been in control of the governments security apparatus police intelligence and security services within the ministry of the inte rior minint for many observers raúls strong support from the far which has played an increasing role in cubas economy since the 1990s through ownership of numerous business enterprises is the most significant factor ensuring that he will succeed his brother some see the likely prospect of cuba under raúl followi ng chinese model with increases in economic freedom albeit with continued political authoritarianism even before fidels recent surgery some observers c ontended that the transition had already begun with raúl assuming increasing res ponsibility in policy decisions and dayto day government management5 military government the scenario of militaryled government is viewed by some observers as possibility only if successor communist g overnment fails becau of divisiveness or political instability in this scenario the military would step in to restore order and control absent political instability it is unlikely that the military would step in to control the government directly since th far has had tradition of deference to civilian control under cubas communist gove rnment moreover with raúl castro heading communist government active and retired military officers would likely play significant roles in various ministries and institutions

regime and continuedgovernment is unlikely some observers contend that the far as cubas most powerful institution and with large role in the economy will play an instrumental role in any transition scenario democratic government for many observers the least likely s cenario upon fidels death or departure is democratic or democratic transition government with strong totalitarian security apparatus the castro government has successfully impeded the development of independent civil society with only small and tightly regulated private sector independent labor move ment and unified political opposition although cubas dissident and human rights moveme nt has grown in recent years with such movements as the varela project and the assembly to promote civil society receiving international attention these gr oups are not widely known in cuba the extent of these groups influence in c uba after fidel castro departs the po litical scene will depend on how much political space they are allowed in the long run the work of the dissident and human rights community may play an important role in shaping future democratic government but in the short to mediumterm it appears that communist successor government woul d be far more likely unlike eastern europes former communist governments the castro government sprang from an indigenous revolution not one imposed by an outside power although the current extent of the cuban populations support for the revolution is unknown how raúl castro might govern there are variety of views of how raúl castro would govern if fidel permanently left the political scene the cuban military under raúl became increasingly involved in running successful economic enterprises in the 1990s and raúl was an advocate of opening up the fa rmers markets when cuba was facing food crisis as result as noted above some observers see the likely prospect of cuba under raúl following chinese mode l with increases in economic freedom but with the communist party maintaining firm control of the political system analysts caution however that at this juncture successor communist government might be less inclined to undertake econo mic reforms because of the significant amounts of financial support that it recei ves from venezuela including some 90000 barrels of oil day on preferential basis some maintain that raúls role as head of the far demonstrates his management and leadership skills and that he is much more inclusive and pragmatic in his decisionmaking compared to fidel some maintain that governance under raúl would be more collective in part because of his decisionmaking style but also because one currently would be able to match the historical stature and prominence of fidel some even see raúl as more inclined to favor better relations with the united states which they maintain would be politically smart move that could increase his popularity among the cuban people6 in an interview published in the cuban

always been disposed to normalize relations on an equal plane but he also expressed strong opposition to current us policy toward cuba wh ich he described as arrogant and interventionist7 some analysts view raúls comments as an indication that he wants dialogue with the united states while others maintain that his message was more of the same and aimed at ttacking us policy toward cuba8 other observers see raúl as continui ng his brothers record of political repression some assert th at he was personally involved in the execution of opponents in the aftermath of the 1959 cuban revolution9 observers also point to his role as head of the far which since 1989 has dominated the governments repressive internal security apparatus raúl was also responsible for an ideological crackdown in 1996 against those wanting to reform cubas system still others question whether raúl has the charisma and force of personality that have sustained his brother in power for so long they ma intain that divisions within the communist party could be exacerbated when fidel is longer in power although the cuban government has been dominated by fidel castro analysts have discerned three factions or political tendencies that help explain political dynamics in cuba hardliners centrists and reformists10 at the helm fidel and his strong supporters many from the early da ys of the revolution but also including younger cubans such as foreign mini ster felipe pérez roque are considered hardliners or duros those opposed to f undamental political or economic change centrists are those who support some ma rketbased solutions to the countrys economic problems but do not espouse whol esale westernstyle capitalism most significantly centrists do not challenge the supremacy of the communist party and do not advocate political reform observers have placed raúl castro and the far in this category because of the significant ma rketoriented policies utilized by the army in its administration of military and civilian businesses finally reformists who have been scarce in recent years prefer more aggressive move toward market oriented economy and political liberaliza tion that might allow loyal opposition to operate although within the context of the communist regime maintaining political power over the years several prominen t reformists have been ousted from their positions such as former foreign minist er roberto robaina and former communist party secretary carlos aldana promin ent reformer who has remained in power is carlos lage who was responsible for cubas

demonstrated by cubas strong crackdown on dissident s in 2003 and by the backtracking on some of the limited economic reforms enacted in the 1990s but some observers maintain that the various divisions within the party will reemerge once fidel is longer on the scene moreover they contend that the prospects of democratic transition in the longterm could depend on whether the reformers will predominate after fidel is gone11 many observers maintain that raúls dvanced age he turned 75 in june 2006 will make him transitional figure and contribute to increased competition for power as result many be lieve that it will be importa nt to look at other political figures that could be eventual successors among the key figures they identify are carlos lage cited above who was inst rumental in impleme nting cubas limited economic reforms in the 1990s ri cardo alarcon president of the national assembly and close adviser to fidel on us relati ons who has been described as centrist potentially open to economic reforms but intransigent on political reform and foreign minister felipe perez roque most often described as an orthodox hardliner who at 41 is the youngest minister and the youngest member of the politburo12 another important political figure and hardliner is gen abelardo colomé closefriend of raúl castro and the head of minint who some obser vers believe could become defense minister if raúl permanently succeeded fidel 13 some analysts maintain that other cuban military leaders could be potential challengers to raúls power14 raúls appointment of former nint head and hardliner ramiro valdés as minister of information science and communications in late august is viewed by some as an attempt to keep potential rival close at hand15 us policy us policy tied to fulfillment of democratic conditions since the early 1960s us policy toward c uba has consisted rgely of isolating the communist government of fidel castro through comprehensive economic sanctions including an embargo on trade nd financial transac tions and prohibitions on us assistance to the cuban government an exception to this policy has been that us agricultural exports to cuba ve been

with the enactment of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 pl 104114 whic h sets forth number of conditions for the suspension and ultimate termination of the embargo for the suspension of the embargo these conditions require that transition government does not include fidel or raúl castro has legalized all political activity has released all political prisoners has dissolved several coercive elements of state security has made commitments to free and fair elections for new government in 18 months has ceased interference with radio and tv marti broadcasts is making demonstrable progress in establishing an independent judiciary respecting internationally recognized human rights and basic free doms and allowing the establishment of independent trade unions and social econo mic and political asso ciations and has given assurances that it will allow the speedy and efficient distribution of assistance to the cuban people the actual terminati on of the embargo would require additional conditions including most significantly that an elected civilian government is in power the dilemma for us policy is that the current legislative conditions just described could tie the hands of policymakers if political change does not unfold swiftly toward democratic transition u nder the more likely scenario of future communist government the us sanctionsbased policy would remain in place until these conditions were fulfilled or until legislation was enacted superceding the language of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act critics maintain that these conditions could prevent the united states from responding quickly to political change in cuba or influencing future communist regime with reformist tendencies some argue however that it is important for congress to keep these conditions in place so that the president does not back away from support for democracy in cuba us preparat ion for cubas political transition for

authorities in the foreign assistance act21 the final chapter of the report outlines series of preparatory steps that the us government can take now before cubas transition begins so that it will be well prepared in the event that assistance is requested by the new cuban government these include steps in the areas of gove rnment organization ectoral preparation and anticipating humanitarian and social needs at the same time that it issued its report the commission issued twopage compact with the people of cuba pledging to support cubas transition government with assistance as it moves from communism to democracy22 the compact maintained that the united stat would supply such support provided that the transition government is committed to dismantling all instruments of state repression and to implementing internationally respected human rights and fundamental freedoms these rights and fr eedom include guaranteeing the rights of free speech press and worship legalizing all peaceful political activity releasing all political prisoners establishing an independent judiciary allowing the creation of independent trade unions and independent social economic and political associations ensuring the right to priv ate property and organizing free and fair elections for democratically elected new cuban government within 18 months these conditions include many but not all of the

use its close relationship with the chávez government in venezuela as means to ensure continuity of its communist regime as noted above however the most likely s cenario for postfidel cuba at least in

during times of economic and political crisis some observers also have questioned the administrations planning because they believe it attempts to micromanage the transition by providing the minutiae of what the united states would like to see in new postfidel cuba for some this feeds the cuban governments rhetoric that the united stat wants to take ove r cuba and runs the risk of stirring cuban nationalism and lienating the cuban population for example the detailed transition plans in the 2004 report elicited negative response from several prominent dissidents such as waldo payá and eliz ardo sánchez who maintained that the future transition s hould be coordinated and run by cubans the july 2006 commission report received mixed response from cubas dissident community although some di ssidents like former political prisoner vladimiro roca maintained that they would welcome any us assistance that helps support the cuba dissident movement othe rs expressed concerns about the report

sanctions on cuba some ve advocated policy of k eeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enact ed while continuing efforts to support the cuban people others argue for an

the us sanctionsbased policy toward cuba will only be triggered by substantial movement toward democracy on the island in the new context of fide ls provisional transfer of power to his brother raúl observers have advocated two general po licy approaches to contend with cubas transition process 1 staythecourse or statusquo approach that would maintain the us dualtrack policy of isolating th cuban government while providing support to the cuban people and 2 an approach aimed at influencing the cuban government and cuban society through incr eased contact and engagement stay the course staythecourse approach essentially emphasizes the current us policy of isolating the cuban government with comprehensive econo mic sanctions while providing support to the cuban people ch an approach also includes in the context of july 2006 report of the commission for assistance to free cuba increased funding to support c uban civil society education programs and exchanges and efforts to break the cuban government s information blocka continuation of the sanctionsbased approach also is c onsistent with conditions set forth in the cuban liberty and democratic ac t for lifting of the embargo advocates of this status quo approach ar gue that only sustained pressure on the cuban government at this critical time will ensure that political change will lead to an actual transition to democracy rather than succession that only would prolong communist rule supporters also contend th at it is important for the united states to react cautiously as political change occurs in cuba in order not to stoke political instability that could lead to migration crisis observers have also augured that cautious staythecourse approach without evated rhetoric helps emphasize to the cuban people that cubans on the island hold the key to determining their future and denies the cuban government fuel for perpetuating the myth that the united states wants to invade cuba34 potential ramification of this approach is that the united states could end up watching political events unfold in cuba without any opportunity to exert influence if cubas political transition moves swiftly toward democracy then us support for transition government woul d be assured but if cubas political transition involves communist successor government as most observers now predict then the united states could be sidelined in terms of influence variant of the staythecourse polic approach emphasizes tougher rhetoric with the intent of sparking political chan ge soon after fidel ceded power to

to take advantage of the opportunity to return freedom to the people of cuba35 the president of the foundation jorge mas santos said that such action could take the form of military or civilian uprising that will put cuba on the path toward democracy36 at this juncture the bush administration has adopted more cautious approach by urging the cuban people to work for peaceful democratic change and emphasizing that the united states would provide support to cuba in its democr atic transition to some analysts the administrations toned down rhetoric stems from its c oncern about contributing to instability in cuba and potential migration crisis engagement an alternative policy approach advocated by some observers is one that seeks to advance us engagement with cuba with the goal of being able to influence cuba in the aftermath of fidel castros departure from the political scene such policy approach could entail the administration taking action to engage the cuban government on such issues as migrati on drug trafficking cooperation terrorism issues efforts to combat human traffickin g and environmental cooperation it could also entail the administration relaxing some economic sancti ons on cuba such as restrictions on travel and remittances nd consulting with c ongress about relaxing other sanctions or providing the president w ith the ability to lift sanctions in response to political or economic changes in cuba as noted above pursuant to the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act the suspension and ultimate termination of the cuba embargo is tied to the fulfillment of certain democra tic conditions in the country including that raúl castro is not part of the government advocates of this type of approach ar gue that the united states should not miss the opportunity to reassess and reshape its cuba policy to be ab to respond swiftly and meaningfully to events in cuba they argue that almost half century of strong us sanctions have not brought about political change in cuba and that the departure of fidel castro from the political scene allows the united states an opportunity to forge new policy aimed at supporting cuban civil society with increased contact and establishing diplom atic contacts with th cuban government along these lines some us military officials maintain that contacts between the us and cuban militaries should be estab lished in order to allow for reliable communication in case of emergencies some supporters of engagement maintain that the united states needs to be prepared to reduce economic sanctions in calibrated

point out that the united states maintains full diplomatic and trad relations with many government around the world with poor human rights records ch as china vietnam and saudi arabia normalized relations it is argued would increase chances to influence cuba in implementing economic and political reforms the major concern that critics have with an engagement approach is they believe it could prolong cubas communist govern ment by providing it with an economic lifeline making it unnecessary for the government to implement reforms according to this view us retrenchment from policy of sustained pressure on the regime would send the message that the united states is abandon ing its support for democracy in cuba in favor of stability longerterm policy issues beyond the current isolationversusengagement policy debate on cuba moving toward normalization of us relations with cuba will raise number of important longerterm policy issues for the united states these include the

two interests sections in havana and washington essen tially operate as embassies although not in name and without accredited ambassadors and occupy the former embassy buildings of each country full
