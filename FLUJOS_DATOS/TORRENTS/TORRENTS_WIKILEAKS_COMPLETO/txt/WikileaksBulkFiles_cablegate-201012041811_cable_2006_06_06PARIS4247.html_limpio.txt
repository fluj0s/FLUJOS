us neither blair nor chirac ref paris 3725 classified by ambassador craig stapleton for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c socialist party ps first secretary francois hollande and ps national secretary for international affairs pierre moscovici briefed the ambassador june 8 on the turbulent race for the presidential nomination within the ps and the hurdles facing the party as it looks to next years presidential and legislative elections hollande underlined that notwithstanding poitoucharentes region president segolene royals commanding lead today in polls both among the public at large and among ps members ps members convictions as to which ps leader is best placed to beat sarkozy could well change between now and the pss presidential primary in november hollande nonetheless believed the primary would produce clear cut result probably in just one round asked what might be expected from french foreign policy under socialist government hollande used the phrase neither blair and chirac to characterize an overall stance towards the us that would not be uncritically supportive but also not be gratuitously obstructionist on europe moscovici stressed that socialist president and government would be much more proeurope than president chirac and the government of prime minister dominique villepin end summary atmospherics 2 c over breakfast with the ambassador at the residence on june 8 socialist party ps first secretary francois hollande and ps national secretary for international affairs pierre moscovici were confident optimistic and dismissive of the drumbeat of media reports that insist that frictions and divisions within the ps will make it difficult for the party to close ranks behind single candidate for the 2007 presidential race even after the party primary next november upcoming elections will be hard fought 3 c hollande and moscovici predicted that the 2007 presidential and legislative elections would be particularly hard fought because neither of the two major parties can count on more than 30 percent of the electorate note the centerleft ps and the centerright union for popular movement ump are the preponderant parties in political spectrum that includes the small centrist union for french democracy udf party along with range of micro parties indeed if the pattern of past presidential elections holds in 2007 there will be over dozen candidates competing in the first round of the election end note hollande suggested that since neither of the major parties can aspire to majority status the udf might well find itself with leverage beyond its size particularly if in the legislative elections that follow the presidential election neither the ps nor the ump win near majority of seats hollande added that in both the presidential and legislative elections the communist party pc and other farleft parties would vote against the right but not join in any socialist government in the event of psled legislature 4 c hollande expressed his firm conviction that the ps was wellpositioned to win both the presidential and legislative contests but that both elections will be extremely close interior minister nicolas sarkozy barring an unexpected reverse would be the centerrights candidate and according to hollande will benefit from the active support of president chirac if sarkozy is nice to him that is according to hollande if sarkozy agrees to look after chirac loyalists and by implication chirac himself note chirac will lose his immunity from prosecution upon leaving office corruption charges for political financing activities dating from before he became president remain pending against him end note hollande said that he did not believe that chirac would prefer to see the ps candidate take the presidency rather than see sarkozy become his successor even so hollande also spoke of the bitterly personal fratricidal rivalries on the centerright comparing them to the less personal more ideological rivalries in his centerleft ps the challenge of reform without mandate 5 c hollande said that whoever wins the presidency in 2007 the electoral system and divisions in the electorate are such that the victor will not have mandate for reform and certainly not mandate in the majority rulewinnertakesall american sense of the term this meant that reforms would come slowly if at all however hollande also ruled out the possibility of president from one party and parliamentary majority from another saying that he believed the backtoback presidential and legislative elections would both reflect the voters decision for change this would help hollande said to bring about some significant reforms albeit slowly upbeat about the state of the ps 6 c hollande was bullish and buoyant about the state of the ps he pointed to the partys recent consensus on its project for 2007 platform statement that all the partys presidential hopefuls agreed to with little argument as evidence of the partys stability and unity even as he allowed that it would not be binding on the various candidates hollande and moscovici agreed that recent meetings to hammer out the platform were by ps standards rather noneventful and the press coverage of rejection of proposals by royal and others highly exaggerated 7 c hollande proudly underlined the policy statements call for enhanced social programs while admitting when pressed that implementing everything it calls for might prove little expensive comment indeed differences over the likely cost of the pss electoral program hollande cites the figure of 30 billion euros whereas strausskahn has said the price tag is closer to 50 billion are sure to fuel controversy over the proposal and ps candidates commitment to implementing it if elected end comment hollande added that the electoral programs social dimension could help the ps attract centerright gaullist voters disaffected with the umps freemarket liberalism predicts oneround primary 8 c hollande confidently predicted that the ps would unify behind whoever wins the primary in the interest of victory though he conceded that primaries can sometimes weaken rather than strengthen candidate he defended the november date for partys choosing of candidate saying that had the candidate been chosen now heshe would have been subjected to potentially crippling drumbeat of criticism from the right hollande also confidently predicted that the pss november primary would produce clear cut winner probably in just one round hollande said that above all party members want winner and will therefore support the candidate most likely to beat sarkozy in putative second round runoff royal 9 c hollande strongly implied that that candidate could easily be royal saying that if the primary were held today she will win and be the candidate barring sharp downturn in her popularity in the pitiless triage of an intensifying presidential campaign hollande noted that royal is not part of the traditional party establishment and commented that the attacks against her have only served to make her all the more popular referring to her opponents among the socialists hollande said that those who resented her sudden success and took cheap shots at her were as practical matter acting as her allies hollande wondered out loud if her popularity would last accurately identifying that as the key question about her candidacy several times he mentioned the unpredictability of politics making clear that he believed much could happen between now and next mays first round of the presidential election that could turn upside down the givens of today in particular hollande evoked how major international crisis he gave iran as an example might completely change the dynamics of the upcoming elections careful not to rule out his own candidacy 10 c hollande was careful to make clear that he too was prepared to run as unifying candidate but only if it seemed to him he would be likely to win the party primary hands down in the first round he was categorical in ruling out that that he would notnot run out of pride or to get 10 percent of the vote comment clearly the only circumstances under which hollande would be likely to win big in the primary is if royal for some reason drops out end comment fabius 11 c hollande contrasted his team player attitude with what he dismissively called former prime minister laurent fabius accountant mentality saying just because 20 percent of the party supports him he thinks that entitles him to 20 percent of whatever the party does almost as an afterthought hollande added matter what fabius will run europe 12 c moscovici said that ps administration would be much more proeurope than president chirac and prime minister villepin see also reftel both hollande and moscovici saw need to use europe to consolidate defense industries and reduce defense expenditures through economies of scale hollande noted sardonically that france was unable to sell its fighters and tanks to anyone moscovici saw need for an increased parliamentary role in policymaking related to europe complaining that there was currently too much power concentrated in the presidency hollande described the absurd situation where the prime minister who does not participate in european council meetings represents the government during the questionandanswer sessions in the national assembly to defend policies set by the president hollande did not disagree with timeline set by chirac and german chancellor merkel for getting europe back on its feet in 20072008 noting the importance of the francogerman tandem and saying that if the effort failed it would take another 45 years to come up with something new 13 c both hollande and moscovici made clear they that they believed chirac had credibility for proposing anything now to advance the european project and both dismissed the idea that the rejected constitution could be subjected to second referendum or worse in their view passed through parliament holland and moscovici agreed something new would be required to get europe moving again but they had nothing specific to suggest in the interim moscovici suggested it might be possible to use croatian accession to introduce few institutional reforms that could be approved by the parliaments of member states hollande dismissed sarkozys ideas for having the six largest eu members states play leading role in setting policy saying they were based on outmoded ideas of great powers setting policy for little powers france us relations 14 c hollande gave slightly different version of the argument we usually hear that while the french at large disagree with the us intervention in iraq chirac and villepin should nonetheless not have confronted the us so openly hollande argued that chirac erred by not making it clear from the beginning how far he was prepared to go to oppose the us if chirac had communicated more clearly how strongly he felt about the matter it would not have led to the false impression that france might come along in the end moscovici repeated his calls for dialogue aimed at attempting to find agreement when the us and france should differ adding that differences should be the exception and not the rule hollande said he wanted french foreign policy more firmly rooted in universal values such as support for democracy rather than the highly personalized approach which characterized the chirac years comment 15 c the are those among the pss heavyweights strausskahn fabius and their supporters who believe that hollande is subtly successfully shaping developments so that the ps candidate will wind up being either royal or himself commentators and party insiders refer to this pair of possible outcomes as the popularity and institutional options in the case of the first royal successfully uses her popularity with the public to impose herself on the party as its candidate if however royal and her popularity should for some reason falter revealing deeply splintered party with attractive candidates the situation before her emergence as the clear frontrunner then the institutional option turning to the party leader to lead the party in the election could become viable one please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
