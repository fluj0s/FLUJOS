armed services qualify for and receive food stamps there have been calls for policy response to reduce or eliminate member eligibility the desirability of such response has been questioned however on several grounds including cost and its potential affects on department of defense dod personnel policy this report examines the possible extent of servicemember participation in the food stamp program and provides background information on several aspects of the policy debate quantitative estimates of military participation and eligibility in the food stamp program vary because of limited available data different methodologies and specific assumptions about the calculation of income recent estimates have varied from few thousand to over twenty thousand although the true difference in estimates between eligibility and participation is unknown assuming an excess of eligibles over participants would be somewhat consistent with the situation in the us population as whole where only about twothirds of eligibles actually receive stamps legislative proposals to reduce military food stamp eligibility in the united states were considered for those stationed in the united states but voted down in the first session of the 106th congress in the second session sen mccain introduced s 2322 which would provide subsistence allowance for food stamp eligibles major concerns include whether or not participation in the program is primarily result of inadequate pay or other factors such as household size concerns also exist that policy intervention could have unintended social and personnel affects on the military available policy options range from including the value of inkind benefits most notably housing in the incomeeligibility calculation to mandating pay raises in every grade the first approach would arguably equalize conditions for members on and off base by eliminating the relative advantage onbase members have in meeting eligibility criteria which considers income in cash but not inkind benefits similarly situated members living offbase receive housing allowances as part of their compensation packages which may increase their income sufficiently to make them ineligible for food stamps pay raises by contrast would more directly ameliorate financial pressure on many or all familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529contents introduction 1 the food stamp program 2 military

introduction for number of years it has been reported1 that certain military personnel are eligible for and receiving food stamps or assistance under the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic2 the stated need for such assistance is often linked with claims regarding the inadequacy of military pay the true nature of the situation is more complex the unique and complicated structure of the military compensation system is source of confusion in determining eligibility andor need for food stamps efforts to remedy the situation often raise larger issues of personal responsibility family policies personnel policies and military readiness legislative proposals to reduce food stamp eligibility for those stationed in the us were rejected in the first session of the 106th congress however additional benefits were afforded to those in need who are stationed overseas where food stamps are unavailable3 this report examines the issues of food stamp

own higher income guidelines additionally the rules on income and assets described below relevant for food stamp eligibility differ for those who are elderly or disabled 6 income eligibility for the food stamp program for service members and civilians alike is tied to the federal poverty guidelines set by the department of health and human services dhhs the dhhs poverty guidelines are simplified version of us bureau of the census poverty thresholds used for statistical estimates of the numbers and characteristics of the poor in the us 7 limited variants of the program operate in puerto rico the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and american samoa but benefits under them are unlikely to be offered to military personnel as the income cutoffs for these programs are substantially lower than those for the program in the continental us described above 8 percentages based on comparison of us department of agriculture individual eligibility and participation data for september 1997 with census bureau population estimate for the month see united states department of agriculture food and nutrition service trends in food stamp program participation rates focus on september

available on the internet see the web site at httpwwwcensusgovpopulationestimatesnatione90se9797rmptxt january 31 2000estimates this report also considers recent legislative efforts to address the issue finally some broader policy considerations are examined the food stamp program the food stamp program provides monthly benefits that increase lowincome recipients food purchasing power4 eligibility for food stamps is based on several criteria one of which is gross income pretax cash income the primary criterion most people5 face for food stamps eligibility is gross income not exceeding 130 percent of federal poverty guidelines6 additional financial tests set limits on household assets and net income the nonfinancial tests for the food stamp program include among others the stipulation that the applicant meet variety of worktraining requirements the program is not available to us citizens living abroad in the case of military members it is necessary that they be stationed in the continental united states alaska hawaii the virgin islands or guam to be eligible7 eligibility does not equal participation of the eligible population military or civilian only fraction actually participates in the program in the us population as whole about 12 percent of individuals were eligible in september 1997 for example against this the proportion of those actually participating was roughly 76 percent of the entire population8 thus only 631 percent of eligibles actually received stamps in september 1997httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529crs3 9 other variation include commissions tips and bonuses10 rounding to the nearest dollar 2000 uniformed services almanac 42nd ed 14 30military compensation the unique nature of the military compensation system can lead to erroneous or misleading conclusions about the relationship between military pay and food stamp eligibility there are two dangers in particular underestimating servicemember income by focusing on too few components of military pay and overestimating the actual need for food stamps among members by overlooking the inkind benefits they receive which play role in determining foodstamp eligibility in order to provide better understanding of how the military compensation system works it is useful to contrast it to the usual means of compensation experienced by civilians in the civilian labor market compensation is usually paid on wage or salary basis under this system compensation is provided based on the number of hours worked and the rate per hour or on total salary basis9 paychecks are usually provided every two weeks or monthly from the total amount earned or gross pay certain amounts are removed or deducted these amounts include taxes social security possible retirement contributions and health care premiums to name few the remaining amount represents net pay from net pay civilian workers pay rentmortgage food costs utilities and other routine expenses thus for civilians gross pay is primary means of determining income military compensation on the other hand is based on number of forms of compensation which may or may not be available depending upon the service members individual situation at given place and time all service members receive military basic pay which is based on grade and years of service this monthly amount ranges from 100560 for enlisted recruits in pay grade e1 to 1131840 for 4star general or flag officer with over 26 years of service in pay grade o1010 from this basic pay are deducted federal income taxes social security withholdings etc in addition the military provides numerous other benefits in the form of direct compensation or compensation inkind for example housing is provided for service members onbase or aboard ship when such housing is unavailable service members are eligible to receive basic allowance for housing bah the amount available depends on the location and presence of dependents for example single marine sergeant e5 living offbase in charleston sc would receive 589 per month in bah alternatively the same sergeant living with dependents in angeles ca would receive 1123 per month should this sergeant receive onbase housing bah would be available thus the receipt of bah could have substantial effect on the determination of income and ultimately on the qualification for food stamps but not provide reliable indication of the individuals standard of living furthermore many military personn are fed on base or aboard ship conversely some members may be eligible to receive basic allowing for subsistence bas this ranges from 85 per day when receiving partial rations in kind tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529crs4 11 2000 uniformed services almanac 42nd ed 33 12 onbase housing the value of which plays role in determining food stamp eligibility has in fact been shown to be key factor facilitating eligibility for many service members dod data that appear below and in table 3 suggest that many members would lose their food stamp benefits were the imputed value of housing used in the calculation one reason for its continued exclusion has been the applicability of rules that also apply to lowincome civilians living in governmentsubsidized housing see maze rick pentagon welfare estimate way off army times october 31 1994 211132 per day when under emergency conditions and mess facilities are available11 both bah and bas are nontaxable service members and their dependents also receive other benefits which are frequently difficult if not impossible to frame in cash terms these include access to commissaries where prices are on average approximately 25 percent lower than those found in civilian supermarkets members become eligible for noncontributory retirement after 20 years of creditable service members are entitled to nocost health care while on active duty and low cost care for their dependents members are also eligible to receive generous life insurance and survivor benefit protection in addition service members may also receive special payments for unique or arduous duties these include hazardous duty pay hostile fire pay career sea pay hardship pay aviation career incentive pay and submarine duty incentive pay enlisted members receive their initial uniform s free of charge and are also furnished with uniform allowances officers receive onetime payment after commissioning to buy clothing finally service members with special skills and qualifications may be eligible to receive bonuses often those looking at the food stamp eligibility of service members consider only basic pay and in so doing overestima the number eligible as noted above such members may actually be receiving other forms of compensation that would make them ineligible to receive food stamps conversely some members may be eligible for food stamps but arguably not in need because they are being fed and housed12 on base or aboard ship estimates of the needeligibility for food stamps eligibles and recipients how many over the years widely varying estimates of the needeligibility for food stamps among military personnel have been reported an examination of these reports shows how variations in methodology andor in assumptions about military member income lead to differing estimates of food stamp eligibility and participation among other things studies have differed with regard to 1 whether they have used income data for the family or the household as whole 2 whether they have relied on direct or indirect information about members incomes andor status visavis the food stamp program and 3 whether or not they have estimated eligibility or actual participation comparison of the full range of publicly available numbers is also confusing because media

gao testimony before the subcommittee on military personnel committee on armed services house of representatives march 8 2000 18 these estimates are based on survey data rather than comparison of program and personnel records as are the dod studies the sample size for the 1997 estimate was about 50000 united states department of agriculture food and nutrition service characteristics of food stamp households fiscal year 1997 submitted by mathematica policy research inc february 1999methodology13 the following provides an examination of number of reports regarding food stamps and military personnel in certain instances estimates of eligibility are provided other reports estimate food stamp usage ie actual food redemption at commissaries still others purport to estimate actual food stamp participation rates each of these is different and depend upon differing methods and time frames these factors help to explain the great variation in the reported numbers in the early 1980s estimates of potential servicemember food stamp eligibility ranged from 19700 to as high as 275000 in 1980 one estimate suggested between 100000 to 275000 were eligible14 while the general accounting office gao reported that only about 19700 were eligible at the start of the 1980 fiscal year15 in 1982 gao estimated that the number of eligibles was 23800 or about 13 percent of enlisted activeduty personnel16 more recent information on the use of the food stamp program among military members is available from gao testimony provided in march 2000 by gao before the house armed services committee suggested some 13500 activeduty members had received food stamps at some point during the twelvemonth period ending around september 199917 this number represented about 12 percent of the force estimates on military servicemember participation in the food stamp program have also been produced yearly by the united states department of agriculture usda the most recent usda estimate that is available for 1997 suggested only 3000 households with military employee received food stamps18 the small size of this number compared to the gao figure may have been due to differences in methodology while gao drew on survey data from military members only the usda relied on sample of the entire food stamp population military and civilian where military members may have been underrepresented in the past decade the department of defense dod has produced three studies on food stamp eligibility and redemption among service members and one study onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529crs6 19 in 1997

in each of the states was determined by comparing the social security numbers of recipients recorded by the usda with the personnel records of the department of defense this type of comparison was necessary because the department itself does not monitor service member participation in the program 21 us department of defense directorate of compensation food stamp program and the military 1996 in

shows the number of participants to have dropped to 630022 eligibility appears to have been higher than participation but how much higher is unclear due to number of factors the 1992 and 1996 studies indicated that the numbers of possible eligibles may have been as much as about two to three times as large23 but dod observed that actual eligibility was probably less primarily because of the likely existence of additional income earned outside of military service not included in the studies extra income could have disqualified many potential eligibles important sources of outside income were

usage in commissaries drops navy times may 11 1998 sources could have been interest income or rent collected on property owned by members household in addition dods use of data on the size of families rather than households may have worked in the opposite direction increasing actual eligibility26 and finally the existence of gap between eligibility and participation would have been consistent with data on the population as whole27 nonparticipation of eligibles could have been due to lack of information about the food stamp program or to an aversion to accepting the stamps references have been made to the value of food stamps used at military commissaries as means of determining food stamp usage but this method also has its shortcomings since commissary access is not limited to active duty personnel military reservists including members of the national guard and military retirees have commissary privileges such individuals may be eligible for and use their food stamps at these facilities28 there is current effort to identify the users of food stamps at commissa ries furthermore service members can and do shop in stores other than commissaries therefore it is not possible to determine reliably the level of food stamp usage by active duty personnel by this method data on commissary redemption appear in table 1 in sum the various estimates presented in the this section reflect the complexity inconsistency and the limitations of calculating food stamp eligibility participation and usage single estimate is based on complete information about all members in addition each relies on differing methodologies to estimate this population therefore wide variation exists in estimates of servicemember eligibility participation and usage of food stamps

information from the defense commissary agency deca august 13 1999 eligibles and recipients characteristics the service members who qualify for food stamps are typically in the junior enlisted pay grades see table 2 many eligible or participating members live on base or aboard ship suggesting that the omission of housing value from the gross income calculation helps facilitate eligibility it has been pointed out that onbase housing benefits are not considered as income thereby affecting food stamp eligibility conversely those living offbase have higher cash income thereby making many of these families ineligible for food stamps see table 3 1992 dod study showed that of those military personnel participating in the food stamp program 40 percent lived on base the percentage of military food stamp program participants living on base was 58 percent in 199629 about 93 percent of recipients were in or below pay grade e5 the average family size of the participating military members was 37 individuals in 199530 the concentration of affected members in the junior enlisted grades suggests that poverty andor federal program eligibility need not be considered persistent conditions for military families rather dod notes the few affected members are likely to be promoted out of their temporary condition given the pace of promotions in the junior grades see table

again for the corresponding grade at the withdependent rate crs note baq and vha have since been combined into the basic allowance for housing or bah and the basic allowance for subsistence for that grade members who live on base receive housing in lieu of housing allowances and consequently their cash pay will be correspondingly lower members living in higher housing cost areas would receive

but they are not legislation in the 106th congress legislative proposals on food stamps for military personnel were introduced in the 106th congress the first would provide additional compensation for individuals who were eligible to receive food stamp assistance the senate inserted its proposal in the fy 2000 national defense authorization act that contained provision sec 603 that would authorize special subsistence allowance of 180 per month payable to enlisted personnel in grades e5 and below who can demonstrate eligibility for food stamps this provision was dropped in the final conference32 arguments for dropping the senate provision included the belief that providing the additional 180 per month would not be an adequate and efficient means of removing

suggests that 9984 would be eligible conversely according to earlier dod data it was believed that of approximately 23000 eligibles only 11900 were actually participating or 517 percent on the basis of this ratio it is estimated that given 6300 participants slightly more than 12000 may have been eligiblepersonnel from the food stamp rolls policymakers also decided that increasing other forms of military compensation including basic pay and bah would better serve all service members including those facing financial challenges in its review of this language as contained in another bill the congressional budget office stated special subsistence allowance section 103 would create new allowance through 2004 for military personnel who qualify for food stamps eligibility for the allowance would terminate if the member longer qualified for food stamps due to promotions pay increases or transfer to different duty station in addition member would not be eligible for the allowance after receiving it for 12 consecutive months although they would be able to reapply cbo estimates that the allowance would increase personnel costs by roughly 13 million in 2000 and 26 million through 2004 based on information from dod on the number of military personnel who currently receive food stamps cbo estimates that most of the 11000 personnel in grades e5 or below will remain on food stamps and apply for the special subsistence allowance however the additional 180 of monthly income would reduce the average households monthly food stamp benefit by 54 resulting in savings of about 7 million each year in the food stamp program over the 20012004 period the special subsistence allowance might also serve as an incentive for eligible but nonparticipating military personnel to apply for food stamps cbo estimated that 1500 additional service members would participate in the food stamp program in an average month at an annual cost of 2 million thus this provision is estimated to result in net savings to the food stamp program of 3 million in 2000 and 5 million each year over the 20012004 period33 on march 29 2000 senator john mccain introduced s 2322 this legislation again proposes to provide 180 to certain food stampeligible military personnel in grades e5 and below the potential costs of this proposal can be roughly estimated using two sets of numbers from the department of defense first in 1996 dod estimated that up to 23000 may have been eligible to receive food stamps providing 180 to this population each month for an entire year would cost approximately 497 million if the more recent estimate of 6300 participants is adjusted to determine possible eligibles it can be estimated that between approximately 10000 and 12000 personnel would be eligible34 from these data the costs of providing all eligibles with 180 for 12 months would range from 216 million to 259 million lastly if 180 is provided for 12 months only to the 6300 who are estimated to be

supplemental appropriations bill it proposes the president and congress take action to provide military income high enough so that one in the military qualifies for federal assistance35 the amendment was passed by voice vote other proposals in dod authorizing legislation were aimed at concerns that military families overseas were denied access to state administered programs such as food stamps and wic36 responding to these concerns the conference report included the following language the senate bill contained provision sec 698 that would mandate that the secretary of defense implement the special supplemental nutrition program overseas and allocate department of defense funds to carry out this program the house amendment contained provision sec 673 that would mandate the secretary of defense to implement that program and allocate department of defense funds to carry out the program and would require the secretary of agriculture to provide technical assistance to the secretary of defense the senate recedes with clarifying amendment37 the act was signed into law on october 5 199938 on april 6 2000 an amendment recommending an increase in defense funding concerning personnel and

the senate amendment assumption regarding enlisted military personnel on food stamps40 in addition to the above legislation hr 105541 was offered in the house during the first session of the 106th congress that would provide 500 refundable credit to certain lowincome members of the uniformed services although this bill would assist many in uniform by providing tax relief at filing time it would unlikely address the daily nutrition needs of those who are struggling financially in addition such tax relief would not be considered by food stamp administrators in determining income eligibility because income eligibility depends on pretax income such income would in fact be considered as an asset and would be unlikely therefore to remove many from the definition of food stamp eligible only those who would exceed the liquid asset limitations of the food stamp program upon receipt of the credit would become ineligible and their ineligibility would last only as long as their assets were not spent down back below the limit social and policy implications of food stamp eligibility proposals to reduce or eliminate service member eligibility for the food stamp program remain controversial the disagreement raises questions as to the purpose of military pay the effects of the present situation on morale and the financial costs of policy response among other things the existence of members who qualify for food stamps has led to claims that military pay is inadequate whether or not military employmen t helps or hurts individuals who choose to enter the armed services is disputed on the one hand reports concerning food stamp eligibility among us military personnel often portray the military compensation system as one that is insufficient and thereby puts individuals on welfare on the other hand some view the military as serving to lift individuals out of poverty by providing pay training housing health care and retirement benefits superior to those available to similarly situated young people in other occupations or professions42 some have suggested that the perceived military compensation problem is limited to some recruits and young personnel with relatively large families see table 4 and the appendix43httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529crs14 43 continued see table a2 appendix this is significant because the majority of activeduty members in grades e1 through e4 do

for details on the methodology the total of 9574 represents maximum estimate of the number of offbase food stamp eligibles multiplied by factor of 242 this estimate yields the highend estimate of 23181 potential eligibles for the activeduty forces that appears in the text of this report the number 242 represents the multiple necessary to convert the offbase estimate to an allmember one for those on and off base alike the calculation 100 413 9574 23181 flows from the assumption that 413 percent of eligibles live off base reflecting the finding that 413 percent of recipients live off base b families in the departments sample had size of 13 this debate raises the question as to purpose of military compensation should military pay reflect the skills and service experience of the member or should it reflect the financial requirements such member may generate to certain extent the current system does both as noted above military basic pay is determined on the grade and years of service conversely bah is determined on the grade of the member but also on the location and number of dependents of the member health care benefits are available regardless of the number of dependents proposals to reduce activeduty foodstamp eligibility would create distinction between the treatment of military members and civilians arguably nutritional assistance programs were created to meet income and nutrition problems facing both military and civilian eligibles since food stamps fulfill that need it could be questioned why separate or new benefit should be created solely for militaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529crs15 44 this kind of change in the determination of eligibility would equalize conditions for members on and off base by eliminating the relative advantage onbase members have in meeting eligibility criteria currently some families ineligible while living off base may become eligible on base solely because they lose the cash housing allowance bah that off base members receive even though they gain housing in kind on base see table 3 for related point 45 see us department of defense secretary of defense attachment to letter to honorable strom thurmond august 18 1998 6 46 the message went out the morning of aug 11 to all marines too many firstterm enlisteds were rushing into marriage and the corps has to do something about it firstterm marriages face long odds on survival the message read the corps should be taking long view by preaching the benefits of delaying marriage until couples are older more mature and financially for secure the message was not intended as surprise but it may have been the shot heard continuedpersonnel the creation of unique benefit provided to those overseas however can be justified without necessarily confronting this issue such an initiative could be made on the basis of the unavailability of food stamps at their location third point concerns the potential impact of taking special action to reduce food stamp eligibility on military personnel policy several approaches to reducing military food stamp eligibility have been proposed and dod has highlighted possible adverse effects related to number of them one option counting the value of inkind housing in the income and eligibility calculation would simply disqualify members without providing additional real income44 the advantages here would arguably be greater fairness and more closeness between need and eligibility other proposals would aim to augment the incomes of food stamp recipients incomeboosting scenarios include some kind of general raise targeted raises for food stamp participants equaldollar raises for all members and differential pay raises which favor junior members in an effort to reduce the cost of such actions it has also been suggested that the number of beneficiaries could be limited by targeting married members only objections to these options by dod center on their disruption of the military pay incentive structure the consequences of the several options could include various degrees of pay compression decreases in career force retention and reduced productivity the department has said45 fourth focus of discussion has been the relationship between food stamps on the one hand and morale and retention on the other proponents of providing additional benefits for military members point to the stigma of food stamp eligibility and suggest that if the military is to attract high quality personnel it should offer living wage some advocates additionally suggest the participation of some members in the program undermines morale conversely critics argue that providing such benefits can reinforce what some view as imprudent behavior such policy it is argued would not attract high quality people suggestions by the us marine corps leadership in the early 1990s that recruitment of young people with dependents should be limited in part to address the strain put on young families by the military as well as recognizing the strain put on the service by young families was met with substantial criticism and quickly withdrawn46httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529crs16 continued around the world by midday the new policy was caught up in whirlwind of political turmoil it had caught the attention of congress the president and the defense secretary by sundown it was nullified fuentes gidget for better or worse marines and marriage navy times august 23 1993 3 47 in general the reason the numbers differ by such large margin has to do with the departments assumptions about how raises for the food stamp population would affect those members who do not receive food stamps the lowend figure for example assumes that only the members receiving food stamps would gain additional income sufficient to disqualify them from program benefits the highend figure on the other hand assumes that all members in each grade would receive raise equal to the amount necessary to disqualify the member with the largest family in that grade details are available in us department of defense directorate of compensation food stamp program and the military 1996 the department has also created estimates of the cost of eliminating poverty among service members based on threshold of poverty reflecting the value of inkind housing as well as cash pay this estimate ranges from 16 million to 15 billion see us department of defense secretary of defense attachment to letter to honorable strom thurmond august 18 1998the continued acceptance of recruits with families means that the services will need to continue to provide substantial resources for safety net and family qualityoflife benefits as matter of personnel policy such reality is consistent with popular military saying we recruit individuals we retain families finally potential policy action has opened debate about the budgetary cost of reducing food stamp eligibility andor participation obviously cost is tied to the specifics of proposal other considerations aside it appears safe to say that decisive action to eliminate entirely the need for food stamps in the military would carry substantial financial costs using 1995 data dod has estimated costs of scenarios doing away with the need for food stamps at congressional request working with two possible approaches the department estimated the highend cost to be over 20 billion versus lowend estimate of 73 million47 all else equal these amounts represent yearly expenditures the large difference between the figures has to do with whether or not supplemental cash benefits are limited to the few service members on food stamps the low estimate reflects the cost of providing aid to members who were receiving food stamps only the highend figure is an estimate of the cost of providing supplemental income to all members to those who were on food stamps as well as the many more who were not partly for reasons of fairness on one hand the high estimate is so extreme that some might say it is entirely an unrealistic option but on the other hand some suggest that the more costly approach by applying changes across the board would preserve to greater the degree the current structure of incentives within the military compensation systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30529crs17 appendix table a1 members with children by grade march 1999 members in grade with
