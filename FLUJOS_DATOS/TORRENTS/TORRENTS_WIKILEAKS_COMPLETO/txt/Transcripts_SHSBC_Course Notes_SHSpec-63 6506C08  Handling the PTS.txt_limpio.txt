6506c08 shspec63 handling the pts lrh is working on the final plots of r6 gpms some corrections have been needed he has found three gpms run out of the middle of the bank by mistake which turned on bursitis he has the first six gpms of the track run out absolutely correctly doubt and wonder about ethics is appearing in some places all we are doing is developing systems to handle the public students and staff are colliding with ethics which has the benefit of giving them familiarity with it if you dont have system of law and order you will never have law and order you will just have cruelty duress suddenness revenge sudden acts of surprising retribution etc without uniform justice you would get chaos especially with ots in operation clausewitz said that war is means of bringing about more amenable frame of mind on the part of the enemy in his ignorance of this principle fdr kept world war ii going after germany and japan were ready to surrender by demanding unconditional surrender this was costly and stupid thing to do if you fail to halt war when more amenable frame of mind has been reached you are fool war should not go beyond that point this principle should be kept in mind by scientologists and orgs when under attack there are elements of the society that are at war with scientology because they are stuck in past incidents of fighting enemies you should take action against someone who is trying to keep you from doing your job but how much action just enough to being about more amenable frame of mind all you want to enforce on the entheta artist in the environment is certain degree of politeness dont get fixated on the entheta we want to bring service to the 80 who are doing well and contentedly since fixating on the 20 who are snarling and fuming takes attention from the 80 we should simply cut comm with the 20 once there is set procedure for handling sps once the executive can enforce little more politeness on his environment the exec can then reach because he has method of doing so now there is something he can do about it you want the auditor and the executive in frame of mind to service the 80 not the 20 execs tend to wind up with the entheta comm because they are supposed to handle it one tends to get fixated on the maybe cases the ones that arent running perfectly smoothly there are only two sources of difficulty with cases 1 the auditing comm cycle 2 pts you can make mistakes everywhere else and still get by of course there is also the gae as source of difficulty you can check out both the auditor to review to have his comm cycle checked out and the pc to ethics to see if he is pts the d of p doesnt get chance to talk in detail to the auditor and the pc this can be done in qual you dont just let the poor comm cycle continue hoping that it will get better if the auditor is uncooperative he goes to ethics until he has more amenable frame of mind in an exec cannot handle the isolated goofers he will get savage towards everybody if you cannot handle the criminal you pass suppressive laws that penalize everybody inspection before the fact governments police everybody because of the goofs of few most arbitrary rulings by any authority result from failures to handle the guy who goofed with subsequent desperation and savagery cf earlier statement by lrh that an organization is only necessary when there is failure to handle an individual see p 328 above pc who just wont run on average processing is pts or an sp inevitably and invariably lrh found that we couldnt handle the pts individual with auditing especially with processing below the level of power processing ptss are likely to come to you for help so you had better know that they need ethics or power processing anything else will make the pts individual rollercoaster because someone is arc breaking him faster than you can fix him up when you say that person has been suppressed by the environment faster than you could process him out of it what you mean is that there is an sp in the environment who wrecks his gains the pts pc often doesnt spot the sp you must get the pts individual to ethics and find the sp suppressive persons commonly speak in total generalities they broaden and generalize entheta so their identity broadens and generalizes people commonly cant spot the sp because of the generality around him check the pts individual for who he is connected to that doesnt like scientology do this check on meter and watch it fall off the pin have the pt individual handle or disconnect if you get the wrong person the pc wont handle or disconnect if you are right he will the pts gives enough trouble so that you may not care to help him forther but when you do attempt to find the sp you should hunt and punch around enough to get good result if you find the right person as the sp the pcs face will light up the ta will blow down and the pc will then handle or disconnect with vgis ta case gain pts or sp trying to process pts will 1 raise his tone 2 thereby double the sps attacks on him 3 therefore cave him in worse than he was to begin with you can tell pts by looking for rollercoaster periodic gains and collapse gain ever or ta less than ten divs sp that is all you need to look for youve got to have ethics to handle this with this data you can make releases handle students cases free scientology center cases etc you dont have to slam the door in anybodys face the pts gets told to handle or disconnect before he gets more auditing the sp gets told that he has very rough case which can only be handled at st hill in couple of years well have auditors here who can handle you here you could say in the meantime stay away because its very restimulative to you this is true too it is an unkindness not to label someone suppressive who actually is an sp one way to handle someone who sends in entheta comm is simply to deadfile him you have to bring about more amenable frame of mind on his part before you audit him or comm with him dont let auditors go on flubbing send them to ethics so that they realize the importance of applying the tech right know also that we will have an impact on this society that organizations will fold up under the onslaught of the technology matter how nice and theetieweetie we are weve got to hold the line and give service while we expand we would like to have organizations smoothly reorganize to run power processing we need all the backup of the organizations ethics d of p and full admin there is one nastier than someone who has been dished by power processes by the way it would be disaster to have someone trying to run power in the field it isnt the d of ping or the auditing that is hard to do it is the fact that it needs to become an assembly line which requires high degree of perfection of organization even on lowerlevel processes it is best to have team to handle ptss sps and admin psychoanalysis had certain degree of workability it got across the idea that psychosomatic illness stems from the mind the mind monitors and dominates structure if the mind is left alone in large number of cases the endocrine treatment as in the time when lrh psychoanalyzed half of group of people who were taking male hormones and found that those he talked with responded better to the hormones than the others will not monitor structure but when you remove few psychic blocks all of sudden it bites and monitors structure you could change diet exercise operating environment anything and it would make difference lrh just used freudian analysis on that project what we would call today straightwire but as subject psychoanalysis has failed because the individual practitioner had way to ride herd on or handle the ptss and sps in his practice furthermore he had free time or attention to do research he might have discovered power processing if he had the subject never grew because it never developed an organization that would carry forward the research our danger is only that as we move forward the technology will get shattered by alteris that must be guarded against then the technology must be applied now it collides with society psychiatry doctors etc you say all i want to do is go free ok you go into condition of power now the most serious thing you can do is to disconnect its the quickest way to bring about collapse you have been woven into the race and the universe too long to just suddenly pack it up you pack it up itll pack you up we have double route to enlightenment by study and by processing we havent begun to explore what can be done by study alone one area you cant go through with study and thought alone is the r6 bank mere study wont help person beyond release hed finish up at level v grade v there is tiger between release and clear you arent going to go through the h6 bank by just changing your mind that has to be gotten rid of utterly release might or might not occur just from the cognitions you would get from increased understanding the gradation chart actually goes as many as seventy levels below 34 the interpretation of the scale is tricky because it is what the person is aware of not what he manifests that person is always numb does not place him at 10 on the scale numbness what is important is is this person aware of the fact that he is always numb if guy could only be aware of false causes without knowing that they were false then he would be at false cause on the scale if he knew that false cause was false he would be above that level as when he is willing to accept your statement that babies come from under cabbage leaves because it is false cause lets say the guy says hey what do you know i just realized that im always after changes well there he is at 4 need of change you might say that the pcs level on the awareness scale is his cognition level the guy who never cogs is just not being trained or processed at the level where he could cognite he is over his head cogs come on gradient too power processing takes anyone matter where he is and yanks them up with thud to level iv the pc recovers terrific ability to know to be aware without necessarily attaining any more knowledge than he knew before probably this will just be redoubled at clear and ot here also he can create things which he couldnt do before he will not know more about how to do that by having been clear or an ot but his present level of beingness is such that his ability to grasp and act upon the potential of situation to assimilate and accomplish at that particular line whatever line he is in is just lightningfast he only knows what he knew before as well as he knew it before matter how clear you clear him he only knows what he knew before you dont increase his knowledge you increase his awareness of his present environment an individual will never make it without being trained in something the first thing hes going to be aware of as he moves out of comatose wog state into higher level of action is scientology its the first thing there to be aware of to study and it leads to higher ability level the cruelest thing you could do to somebody would be to audit him all the way to clear with auditor training he has this terrific potential to know and you havent made it possible for him to assimilate the technology which has brought him to this state it puts him in dreadful confusion he has understanding he wonders how did i get here wheres here it would be better to audit him up to release then train him up as far as hes been audited level iv then give him tools to go on up to clear then give him an organization to use those benefits in he needs to know how others function let him know then you have given him familiarity with the existence around him he has increased his span of knowledge of what is in scientology he has increased his organizational scope he has come up to an understanding of the usefulness of the various tools of scientology and he has also found out that these new states are moving up into type of civilization that can also exist this will raise his responsibility with all this you are not going to have lot of catastrophe you are going to have happy people this is taking totality of responsibility you must take responsibility for powerful knowledge look what happened to the atom bomb the nut who invented that took responsibility for it we have powerful technology for the first time we have total grip on knowledge of the universe and can bring people up with an express elevator we take as much responsibility as possible you have to take responsibility for knowledge to the degree that it is powerful we had better measure up to our power in all ways
