classified by charge christopher dell for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary assistant secretary for south and central asian affairs richard bouchers august 27 meetings with president karzai foreign minister spanta lower house speaker qanooni and national security advisor rassoul spanned range of key topics boucher karzai and rassoul agreed to focus on themes of economic cooperation intelligence sharing refugees controlling illicit border traffic and engaging the tribes during the upcoming trilateral meeting between deputy secretary of state negroponte rassoul and pakistani national security advisor aziz karzais vision of special envoy to afghanistan largely mirrors us thoughts on the issue discussion of counternarcotics and governance led karzai to make pitch for the international community to give the afghan government room to do governance the afghan way boucher pressed spanta and qanooni to ensure that irans role in afghanistan is limited to constructive one end summary jirgas 2 c karzai seemed pleased when boucher shared that the recent afghanistanpakistan jirga had been portrayed favorably in the us media karzai commented that six months would be an ideal time frame after which to host the next jirga in pakistan both agreed that the afghan jirga was an important confidencebuilding measure but boucher expressed his hope that the next jirga in pakistan might produce more concrete agreements he raised the upcoming visit of deputy secretary of state negroponte as an opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of the jirga and ensure continued progress towards the next one boucher raised the idea of having the afghan and pakistani national security advisors meet together with negroponte during his visit to jalalabad near the afghanpakistani border and proposed that the three work together to identify specific issues where the greatest cooperation is needed such as economic cooperation intelligencesharing and controlling illicit border traffic boucher also pushed for discussion of how to engage the tribes along the border whose buyin is essential to the staying power of any future jirga agreements karzai spanta and rassoul were each on board with this 3 c karzai shared that there was recent gathering of pakistani tribal chiefs in peshawar during which the chiefs expressed desire for the same rights and freedoms as ordinary pakistani citizens however karzai noted that these same tribes had recently refused to celebrate pakistani independence day karzai said the pakistani government needed to pull tribal leaders into system of formal representation while boucher noted that pakistani interior minister sherpao did not think political party system within the tribal areas would be feasible in the near term 4 c in separate discussion with boucher national security advisor rassoul said karzai had initiated the process of finalizing the list of participants in the commission that will implement the agreements from the first jirga boucher seconded sherpaos desire to see commission comprised of those who can get things done in an encouraging sign rassoul acknowledged that sherpao had been very helpful partner in the leadup to execution of and followup to the first jirga rassoul stated that the first task would be to work on the continuation of dialogue with the opposition including taliban boucher pushed specifically for the jirga commission to identify who the opposition is and relayed sherpaos interest in bringing those who are not part kabul 00002998 002 of 006 of the taliban but sympathetic to them into the jirga process both agreed that afghanistans official reconciliation process commonly referred to as pts is not appropriate for highlevel leaders and large groups so the jirga commission could play role in defining more appropriate process for people in this category 5 c boucher shared his opinion that pakistan is making real effort now by going after the hardest targets including pakistani and arab insurgents which has already yielded results rassoul noted that his government is considering using the provincial communications center model currently used to coordinate information among the afghan national security forces at the provincial level to set up nexus for intelligencesharing between the afghan and pakistani governments pakistan is concerned about baluch rebels who are operating in and supported from afghanistan and boucher stressed the importance of the afghan government doing all it can to crack down on this 6 c during the meeting with spanta the foreign minister indicated that while he had been skeptical about the jirga himself he had considered it major success in the end he said that the afghan ministry of foreign affairs was sending five newly appointed diplomats to pakistan for training significant goodwill gesture following the jirga as afghanistan has refused educational assistance from pakistan in the past spanta said musharrafs appearance at the end of the jirga was real high point boucher emphasized that it was karzais urging that changed musharrafs mind boucher clarified that musharrafs initial decision not to attend was not snub to the jirga itself but cautionary move by musharraf who feared the pakistani supreme court would rule to allow former prime minister nawaz sharif to return to pakistan spanta conceded that we know sharif is bad news he is the author of islamic radicalism in our region boucher agreed that sharif could return to lead movement that is proislam antimusharraf and anti us special envoy 7 c when boucher asked karzai his thoughts on the best role for special envoy to afghanistan karzai stated if it would be envoy that would bring better coordination among the international community at capitals and also cause better coordination in afghanistan and within the alliance on afghanistan then good but if it is someone who would set up parallel government of internationals then at one point karzai stated i do not want stronger then clarified that i want the to be stronger coordinator of the international community yes but not parallel government in afghanistan note the british have indicated their vision of special envoy who would be based in and work primarily in afghanistan whereas the us and afghan sides envision an envoy who would spend great deal of time fundraising and coordinating donor strategies in donor country capitals end note 8 c during his meeting with rassoul boucher commented that the french government had been considering running provincial reconstruction team and that the french ministers of defense and foreign affairs plan to visit afghanistan soon boucher rassoul and the ambassador discussed future prospects for other donor country involvement in afghanistan noting that the canadians were iffy and that the dutch may leave after 2009 the british french australians and us will likely stay kabul 00002998 003 of 006 for longer periods rassoul asserted the importance of afghanizing the war in kandahar both in order to reduce canadian casualties which might encourage the canadians to stay longer and to prepare the afghan national army and police for canadas likely withdrawal boucher noted that after withdrawal of maneuver troops the canadians may still be willing to run provincial reconstruction team focused on development as well as the training and equipping of afghan national security forces boucher noted that as 2009 is an election year it would be good to encourage donor countries to stay throughout 2009 2010 he also expressed hope that efforts to engage pakistan now would increase security significantly in the next year or two perhaps encouraging other countries to stay present in afghanistan looking ahead on eradication efforts 9 c boucher noted that the office of drugs and crime had released its latest assessment of drug production in afghanistan he highlighted the reports findings that while the number of poppyfree provinces had increased from six to thirteen overall production in afghanistan had increased by 34 per cent particularly in helmand karzai reiterated his position against an aerial eradication campaign when boucher asked karzai for his thinking on groundbased spray karzai replied we have not said but were not saying yes either we would have to inform the population and do it in way that does not create enmity the ambassador noted the difficulties in relying on manual eradication and pointed out that 16 of the 135 eradicators had been killed last year boucher assured karzai that the aerial spray decision was one for another year another few years karzai interjected boucher planted the idea of eventually doing aerial spray in taliban controlled areas and manual eradication in those parts still loyal to the central government karzai gave immediate reaction karzai on doing governance the afghan way 10 c the discussion on increased drug cultivation in helmand sparked karzais thoughts on establishing and maintaining central government authority in the provinces according to karzai the question is why do we have taliban controlling these areas now when two years ago i had control of helmand when sher mohammad was governor there we had girls in schools and only 160 foreign troops the international community pushed to remove him and now look where we are referring to sher mohammad karzai retorted my question for you is do you want bad guy on your side or working for the taliban where afghans are in charge drugs are less but where the international community is in charge drugs are up the ambassador countered that the scenario is more accurately read as the international community has invested its resources and manpower in the tougher provinces where not coincidentally the taliban have stepped up their counterinsurgency and drug cultivation efforts to discredit both the afghan government and international community karzai conceded but added that the afghan people do not see it that way from the ground 11 c pressing the issue more firmly boucher asked karzai whether it is possible to have the afghan government in control using good guys rather than the likes of sher mohammad as its agents yes but that is gradual process said karzai maintaining that kabul 00002998 004 of 006 the most important thing is bringing the tribes to our side he explained that the problem with the international communitys approach to date is that you are trying to pick and choose tribal chiefs who will expand the presence of the central government into rural areas but that is not how the tribal system works tribal chiefdom is jealously guarded it cannot be taken by force and it cannot be imposed from the outside when we distort tribal structures the vacuum is filled by the taliban and that is exactly what has happened in helmand and uruzgan he noted that kandahar is an exception because of his outreach to all the tribal chiefs there according to karzai the people in helmand and uruzgan are uneducated so you have to fight the taliban with local ingredients unlike in more developed kandahar he added we cannot bring tribal chiefs on board with governors because we say to them that we want you to support the governor but we single out particular chiefs and say we dont want them involved in the process whether we like it or not we have to work with these people karzai and rassoul both indicated that karzai is currently focused on an outreach campaign to win backing from tribal leaders in helmand role of iran local opposition must be constructive 12 c boucher informed karzai that he would meet with lower house speaker qanooni later that day boucher told karzai that his message to qanooni would be political opposition is okay but it has to be constructive karzais advice was to remind qanooni that he would not hold his position without us backing as the conversation turned to political parties karzai commented i will not be political party man but i will support parties presumably referring to his rumored alliance with the newly formed republican party 13 c during the meeting with qanooni boucher emphasized that iran and russia should not be given inroads for influence in way that would disrupt the system boucher clarified that while irans investment in cultural and educational institutions was acceptable its role in smuggling weapons into afghanistan was not qanooni responded by assuring boucher and the ambassador that afghanistan continues to see the us as its longterm partner stressing that we are not asking afghans to choose sides boucher expressed us understanding for afghanistans need to cultivate cooperative economic business cultural and normal political relationships with iran but reiterated that the line should be drawn at any activities that are disruptive to the establishment of strong central government in afghanistan qanooni indicated that aside from iran and russia people allied with the hizbiislami gulbuddin party continue to seek more positions of influence within the afghan government administration 14 c pointing out that the security problems in southern afghanistan are spreading to the north qanooni added that while others think the security situation will remain in control i and other members of parliament have some concerns he pointed to recent taliban activity in kapisa nuristan and baghlan as evidence of this only panjshir is protected he stated when boucher asked how taliban are able to operate in the north where pashtuns are minority qanooni insisted that the taliban have located and begun to infiltrate the predominantly pashtun districts which are scattered around the north 15 c qanooni mentioned the formation of special committee from the lower house that will be kabul 00002998 005 of 006 investigating why decisions made by parliament are not implemented by the executive branch note he was referring primarily to the decision of parliament to impeach foreign minister spanta and minister of refugees akbar karzai mentioned that the palace has also established committee of six ministers to settle the issue with parliament end note 16 c the topic of iran also surfaced during bouchers meeting with spanta who acknowledged we agree with the us and uk that iran is engaged in lot of interference but our interest in dealing with iran is to be careful not to open second front along the iranian border with afghanistan spanta noted the afghan governments recent decision to reject memorandum of understanding on military cooperation proposed by iran spanta also shared that karzai had raised the issue of irans involvement in smuggling weapons into afghanistan with iranian president ahmedinejad who spanta said denied it of course but the point was made spanta noted that iran was primarily invested in supporting political parties mobilizing shia mullahs influencing the afghan media and providing material support to the taliban he added that iran is funding the completion of railway that will go from iran into afghanistan and end outside herat city spanta expressed his uncertainty about the complicity of the iranian foreign minister in providing material support to the taliban stating that he promised he is not involved but said that he is involved in supporting political parties in afghanistan 17 c spanta commented that his biggest problem is that iran continues to send back afghan refugees both those who are registered and those who are not and added that iran does not coordinate with the afghan government on the forced returns regional economic cooperation 18 c spanta explained that afghanistan continues to work with pakistan on transit trade and updating their formal treaty from the 1960s they would also like to address this in the framework of south asian association for regional cooperation afghan commerce minister farhang will travel to pakistan shortly in hopes of making some progress spanta moved next to request for us financial assistance for the upcoming conference of the economic cooperation organization eco october 1620 2007 in herat which is focused on regional economic cooperation between afghanistan azerbaijan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan turkey turkmenistan iran tajikistan uzbekistan and pakistan boucher promised to pass on the request but cautioned spanta that the prospects were not good given how soon the conference would take place and the lack of us membership in the organization 19 c boucher stressed to karzai and spanta the need to followup on the success of the tajik afghanistan bridge opening with trucking and transit agreement that allows afghan and tajik vendors and distributors to transport their goods across the border the ambassador pitched the idea of truck leasing consortium project that would allow small scale distributors who could not afford to own trucks to rent them when transporting their products both karzai and spanta welcomed the idea spanta noted that afghan commerce minister farhang will soon travel to pakistan to discuss similar issues 20 c spanta also noted that the chinese are increasingly interested in becoming regional economic partner as well as knowing more about what the larger international community is doing to invest in afghanistan kabul 00002998 006 of 006 21 c note renewed focus on regional economic cooperation will be part of the agenda for the upcoming afghanistan ministerial meeting on september 23 cochaired by president karzai and secretary general ban kimoon that will precede the general assembly the october 3 meeting of the joint coordination and monitoring board will also focus on regional economic cooperation this will be an important followup to the success of the tajik afghanistan bridge opening and an opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of the jirga with economic cooperation presenting clear winwin for all parties involved end note 22 sbu the office of the assistant secretary for south and central asian affairs has cleared this cable dell
