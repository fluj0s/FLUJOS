election and 2 those that seek to repair perceived defects of the existing system direct popular election the direct election alte rnative would abolish the electoral college substituting single nationwide count of popular votes the candidates winning plurality of votes would be elected president and vice president most direct election proposal s would constitutionally mandate the joint tickets of presidentialvice presidential candidates alr eady adopted in state law1 and set the minimum number of votes necessary to win election at 40 of those cast in the event presidentialvice presidential ticket were to attain the 40 threshold most direct election measures would require the two tickets that received the most votes to compete in subse quent runoff election some versions would provide for congress meeting in joint session to elect the president and vice president if ticket received 40 of the vote electoral college reform reform measures that would retain the electoral college have included range of different proposals the most popular of which are listed below 2 most versions of these plans would eliminate the office of elector and award electoral votes directly to the candida tes and would retain the requirement that majority of electoral votes is necessary to win the presidency in common with direct election most would also require jo int tickets of presid

winning candidates who obtained the most voteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs2 statewide in almost all versions plurality would be sufficient this alternative would constitutionally mandate the general ticket or winnertakeall system currently used to award electoral votes in 48 states and the district of columbia the district plan this reform proposal woul d award one electoral vote to the winning candidates in each congressional di strict of each state and an additional two electoral votes reflecting the two constant or senatorial electoral votes assigned to each state regardless of its population to the statewide winners this alternative would constitutionally mandate the system currently used to award electoral votes in maine and nebraska the proportional plan this reform proposal would award electoral votes in each state in proportion to the percentage of the popular vote gained by each ticket some versions of the proportional plan would award electoral votes in proportions as small as thousandths of one vote that is to the third decimal point strict proporti onal plans while others would use various methods of rounding to award only whole numbers of ectoral votes to compe ting candidates rounded proportional plans voters in colorado rejected proposed state constitutional amendment at the november 2 2004 general election that would have established rounded proportional system in that state for further information on this proposal please consult crs report rl32611 the electoral college how it works in contemporary presidential elections by thomas h neale pro and in brief as noted previously proposals for elector college reform fall into two basic categories those that would eliminate th electoral college and substitute direct popular election of the president and vice pres ident and those that would retain the existing system in some form and correct perceived defects direct popular election proponents of direct popular election cite number of factors in support of their proposal at the core of their arguments they assert that their process would be simple national and democratic they assert that direct popular ection would provide for single democratic choice in which all the nations voters would directly elect the two highestranking officials in the united states government the president and vice president further the candidates who won the most popular votes would always win the election and in the event one r eceived at least 40 of the vote runoff election between the two leading tickets would decide the choice some direct election proposals would substitute election by joint session of congress for runoff in the event ticket received at least 40 of the vote every vote would carry the same weight in the election matter where in the nation it was casthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs3 4 in contingent election the president is elect ed in the house of representatives with each state casting single vote regardless of its popul ation and the election results in that state the senate elects the vice president in such cases with each senator casting single vote 5 for more detailed information on the contingent election process please consult crs report rs20300 election of the president and vice president by congress contingent election by thomas h neale 6 faithless electors are those who cast their vo tes for candidates other than those to whom they are pledged notwithstanding political pa rty rules and state laws most constitutional scholars believe that electors remain free agents guided but not bound to vote for the candidates they were elected to support for further information please consult crs report rl30804 the electoral college an verview and proposals for change by l paige whitaker and thomas h neale pp 910all the various and complex mechanisms of the existing system such as the contingent election process would be supplanted by these simple requirements4 proponents assert that in c ontrast the electoral colle ge system is cumbersome and potentially antidemocratic the electoral college some assert is the antithesis of their simple and democratic proposal it is they contend philosophically obsolete indirect election of the president is an 18th century anachronism that dates from time when communications were poor the literacy rate was much lower and the nation had yet to develop the durable sophisticated and inclusive political system it now enjoys moreover they find the 12th amendment provisions that govern cases in which candidate attains an electoral college majority contingent election to be even less democratic than the primary provisions of article ii section 15 see footnote 3 by providing fixed number of ectoral votes per state that is adjusted only after each census they maintain the electoral college does not accurately reflect state population changes in intervening elections the two constant or senatorial electors assigned to each state regardless of populati on give some of the nations least populous jurisdictions disproportiona advantage over more populous states from this viewpoint the office of presidential elector itself and the resultant faithless elector phenomenon6 provide opportunities for political mischief and deliberate distortion of the voters choice they argue that by awarding all electoral votes in each state to the candidates who win the most popular votes in that state thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs4 7 for additional information on the voting power theory please consult crs report rl30804 the electoral college an overview and analysis of proposals for change by l paige whitaker and thomas h neale p 7winnertakeall or general ticket system effectively disenfranchises everyone who voted for other candidates moreover this same arrangement is the centerpiece of one category of electoral college reform proposals the automatic plan finally the electoral college system has the potential to elect presidential and vice presidential candidates who obtain an electoral vote majority but fewer popular votes than their opponents as happened in 2000 the electoral college and electoral college reform defenders of the electoral college either as presently struct ured or reformed ffer various arguments in its defense they reject the suggestion that it is undemocratic electors are chosen by the voters in free elections and have been in nearly all instances since the first half of the 19th century the electoral college system prescribes federal election of the president by which votes are tallied in each state the founders intended that choosing the presiden t would be the action of citizens of federal republic in which they participate both as citizens of the united states and as members of their state communities while electoral vote allocation doe s provide the constant two or senatorial electors for each st ate regardless of population defenders believe this is anothe r federal element and is less justifiable than equal representation for all states in the senate moreover the same formula also assigns additional electors equal in number to each states delegation in the house of representatives which more than compensates for any minor distortion further defenders reject the sugge stion that less populous states like alaska delaware montana nort h dakota south dakota vermont and wyoming as well as the district of columbia each of which casts only three electoral votes are somehow advantaged when compared with california currently 55 electoral votes these 55 votes alone constitute more than 20 of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency thus conf erring on california voters and those of other populous states voting power advantage that far outweighs the minimal arithmetical edge conferred on the smaller states7 the electoral college system promotes political stability they argue parties and candidate s must conduct ideolo gically broadbasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs5 8 proposed constitutional amendments are customarily introduced as house or senate joint resolutions 9 for list of cosponsors see under hjres 28 available at httpwwwcongressgovcgilis bdqueryzd108hjres 28 visited sept 16 2004 click on cosponsorscampaigns throughout the nation in hopes of assembling majority of electoral votes the consequent need to forge national coalitions having wide appeal has been contributing factor in the moderation and stability of the twoparty system they find the faithless elect or phenomenon to be specious argument only nine such electoral votes have been cast against instructions since 1820 and none s ever influenced the outcome of an election moreover nearly all electoral college reform plans would remove even this slim possibility for mischief by eliminating the office of elector electoral college defenders also point to what they assert are flaws in direct election direct election proponents claim thei r plan is more democratic and provides for majority rule ye t most direct election proposals require that victorious candidates gain as little as 40 of the vote in order to be elected how ask its critics could such plurality presidents be reconciled with the concept of strict majority rule enshrined by direct elections proponents further they assert that direct election will foster acrimonious and protracted postelection struggles for instance as the presidential election of 2000 demonstrated close results in single state in close election are likely to be bitterly contested under direct election those favoring an elector college claim every close contest could resemble the post election contests in 2000 not only in one state but also on nationwid basis as both parties sought to gain every vote such rancor ous disputes could have profound negative effects on political comity in the nation and possibly even the stability of the federal government reform proposals in the 108th congress hjres 28 representative jesse jackson jr and others hjres 28 proposed constitutional amendm ent was introduced by representative jesse jackson jr on march 3 20038 and was subsequently cosponsored by 39 other representatives9 the resolution included several provisions designed to guarantee the right to vote in public elections in cluding the authorization of nationwide election performance standards establishe d by congress and election day voter registration section 4 applie d particularly to the elector college requiring states to establish and abide by rules for appoi nting electors conduct these elections in effect presidential elections on day sel ected by congress and most pertinentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs6 10 hjres 28 108th congress section 4 11 many direct popular electi on proposals would require the winning candidates to receive at least 40 of the votes in order to be ected they usually also provide for runoff between the two tickets gaining the most vo tes if that threshold is not attainedensure that each elector votes for the ca ndidate for president and vice president who received majority of the popular vote in the state or district10 section 4 would have affected the electoral college system in two ways first it would have eliminated the faithless ector phenomenon by requiring electors to vote for the candidates who won the most votes while the resolution would not have eliminated the office of elector as would ma ny other reform proposals it would have had similar effect by constitutionally binding electors to vote for the candidates who won the most votes in their state or district the second impact was that the resolution would have had the eff ect of incorporating either the winnertake all general ticket system or the dist rict system into the constitution which is currently silent on methods of allocating electoral votes section 4 thus implicitly authorized the states to opt for either plan hjres 28 was received the customary referral to the judiciary committee and was later referred to the subcommittee on the constitution further action was been taken during the 108th congress hjres 103 representative gene green and others this proposed constitutional amendment intr oduced on september 14 2004 by representative gene green was cosponsored by representatives brian baird and w illiam delahunt it proposed to eliminate the electoral colle ge and provide for direct popular election of the president and vice president the amendment would have provided for popular election of the president and vice president with voters casting single vote for joint ticket of candidates for these two offices the latter requirement would ensure that the chief executive and the vice president be nominees of the same party further the resolution sought to guarantee nationwide uniformity on the ticket by requiring that the candidates must consent to having their names joined on the ballot with only one other person the ticket winning the most votes would be ected the winners would not need to gain minimum percentage of votes nor is th ere provision for runoff if the minimum percentage is not attained11 other sections of hj res 103 dealt with issues in voter eligibility and election administration section 2 proposed to change the formula for voting eligibility in presidential elections from that provided in article i section 1 of the constitution each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct to the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of senators and representatives this would establish uniform voter qualifications for all federal elections this section would however have permitted the state legislatures to provide less restrictive qu alifications with re spect to residence it also would have empowered congress to establish uniform residence and age qualifications this was considerable expansion of federal authority over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs7 12 these requirements are currently established by state law voting age is universally set at 18 years while most states require 30 days re sidence in their jurisdiction before allowing person to register to voteelection process because it would permit congress to rais or lower both voting age and residence requireme nts by legislation12 finally it would have eliminated the state legislatures power to choose some ot her method of selecting electors it may be recalled that in the early years of the republic many state legislatures chose electors themselves without any participa tion by the voting public this practice declined throughout the first half of the 19th century so that by 1868 electors were chosen by the voters in all states during the controversy following the 2000 presidential election there was some discussion as to whether the florida legislature could reclaim its constitutional right to choose electors in order to resolve disputes over the statewide winner this provision would have eliminated such considerations in the future section 5 empowered congress to provide by law for the case of tie vote and for the death of any candidate who died be fore election day the latter process is currently administered by the major parties through their internal rules hjres 103 was referred to the hous committee on the judiciary and to the subcommittee on the constituti on further action was taken during the 108th congress hj res 109 representative jesse jackson jr and others this proposed cons titutional amendment introduced on october 8 2004 by representative jesse jackson jr was cos ponsored by representatives john conyers jr elijah cummings dennis kucinich and je rrold nadler it proposed to eliminate the electoral college and provi for direct popular electi on of the president and vice president notable feature of the amendment was that section 1 of the amendment would mandate election by direct vote of the citizens of the united states without regard to whether the citizens are residents of state emphasis added although the intent of this language was not clearly st ated the inference may be drawn that the amendment would extend the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens who reside in us territories and the commonwealth of puerto rico all native born or naturalized residents of these jurisdictions are us citizens but at present they cannot vote for president and vice presid ent unless they are residents of and registered voters in one of the 50 st ates or the district of columbia the same language in section 1 might also have had implications for the conduct of election administration in the ited states as noted above section 1 states that the president and vice president shall be elected jointly by the direct vote of the citizens of the united states without regard to whether the citizens are residents of state emphasis added this langua ge could arguably be interpreted as conferring on the federal government the authority to establish and maintain nationwide system of voter registration and election administration

constitution 12th amendmentvice president anywhere in the nation th is would supersede the current practices of registration voting and c ounting and verifying the pres idential vote state by state functions that have been traditionally performed by state and local election authorities it would not however have affected current practices for senate and house elections because it referred specifically only to the presidential contest section 2 of the amendment provided for ma jority election that is in order to win joint ticket for president and vice president would require an absolute majority of votes cast it would not how ever have provided for runoff election or election in congress in the event majority were not attained features found in some direct election proposals it is therefore unclear what mechanism would be available in cases where candidates received the requisite majority these have occurred frequently in recent years candidate s received popular vote majority in the presidential elections of 1992 1996 and 200013 section 3 did however authorize congress to enforce this article through appr opriate legislation it is thus arguable that this section would have granted imp licit authority to congress to provide for elections in which candida tes received the requisite majority of popular votes hjres 109 was referred to the house committee on the judiciary and subsequently to the subcommittee on the constitution but further action was taken during the 108th congress hjres 112 rep resentative zoe lofgren this proposed constitutional amendment introduced on november 18 2004 by representative zoe lofgren proposed to eliminate the electoral college and provide for direct election of the president and vice president voting qualifications in section 2 closely resembled existing qualifications in that the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most populous branch of the legislat ure of the state although congress may establish uniform age qualifications th latter clause of this sentence would however have apparently empowered congress to adjust the voting age for president either upward or downward by law under section 3 of this proposal each vot er would cast single vote for joint ticket of presidential and vice presidential candidates thus establishing existing state requirements as part of the constitution this section also specifically permitted candidates on the same ticket to be from the same state eliminating the current requirement that when electoral college electors vote at least one of the candidates shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves14 section 4 provided for election by plurality in that the candidates having the greatest number of votes woul d be elected there would thus be need for eitherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs9 15 the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the gislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of chusing senators 16 this procedure applies to both individual elector votes as well as electoral vote returns for entire statesa second round if certain threshold of popul ar support were not ttained or for any form of contingent election as required in some direct election proposals section 6 however empowered congress to provide by law for tied elections or for cases in which any candidate either died or wa s otherwise disqualifie d before the election this language would appear to have given congress broad authority in these situations extending to such options as rescheduling elections in case of candidate vacancies that occurred close to electi on day or providing for second round election in the event of tie it is less clear whether the amendment would make an implicit grant of authority to congress to intervene in the process of replacing party candidates under such circumstances pro cess which the partie s historically have addressed through in ternal procedures finally section 5 empowered congress to provide by law for the times places and manner of holding such elections this language pa rallels that found in article i section 4 of the constitution15 but the section went on to include entitlement to inclusion on the ballot shall be determined by congress this language would have provide d substantial new power to the legislative branch in that congress could supersede existing state laws on ballot access legislating nationwide standards or perhaps making ad hoc determinations as to ballot access in any particular presidential election cycle hj res 112 was referred to th house committee on the judiciary on november 18 2004 but further action was taken during the 108th congress hr 4867 representative peter deutsch and others this bill introduced on july 20 2004 by representa tive peter deutsch and cosponsored by representatives alcee hastings and corinne brown would have affected the electoral college indirectly it proposed to change the procedures under which congress counts and certifies ectoral votes as set out in title 3 section 15 of the us code currently in order for congressional objections to the validity or legality of electoral votes to be in order16 such objections must be filed in writing and be signed by one senator and one representative hr 4867 would have amended that requirement making it possible for valid objection to be filed and signed by at least one senator or member of the house of representatives the bill was referred to the committee on house administration and also to the committee on rules for period to be determined subsequently by the speaker in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned further action was taken during the 108th congress this bill arguably arose from the contex t of the 2001 electoral vote count joint session of congress during which severa l representatives sought to introduce objections to the electoral vot returns from florida none of these objections had been signed by senator so they could not be not entertained by the vice presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs10 17 for further discussion of the hurdles faced by electoral college reform proposals see crs

help america vote act and issues for congress by eric fischer and kevin j coleman 19 article v of the constitution also provides for amendment by convention which would assemble on the application of the legislatures of twothirds of the states any amendments proposed by such convention would also require approval of threefourths of the states this alternative method however has never been used 20 these conditions have been met in some cases only after long period of national debate for example the 19th amendment which extended the right to vote to women was the culmination of decades of discussion and popular agitation in other instances amendments have been proposed and ratified in the wake of sudden galvanizing event or series of events an example of this may be found in the 25th amendment providing for presidential succession and disability which received tremendous impetus following the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedywho presided over the session for additi onal information on the electoral vote count session and its procedures members of congress and th eir staff should consult crs report rl32717 counting electoral votes an overvi ew of procedures at the joint session including objections by members of congress by jack maskell available to members of congress and cong ressional staff from the author concluding observations some observers assumed th at action of the electoral college in 2000 in which george w bush was elected with majo rity of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than gore jr would lead to rious consideration of proposals to reform or eliminate the electoral college notwithstanding these circumstances however none of the proposals introduced in either the 107th or the 108th congress received more than routine committee referral17 in the 107th congress attention focused on proposals for election administration refo rm resulting in passage of the help america vote act p l 107 252 by the 107th congress in 2002 this legislation has substantially extended the role of the federal government in the area of voting systems and election technology through th establishment of national standards in these areas and the provision of aid to the states to improve their registration and voting procedures and systems18 other factors may also contribute to the endurance of the electoral college system perhaps foremost is the fact that the us constitution is not easily amended stringent requirements for proposed amendm ents including passage by twothirds vote in each chamber of congress and approval by threefourths of the states generally within seveny ear time frame have meant that successful amendments are usually the products of br oad national consensus sens that certain reform is urgently required or active suppor t by congressional leadership19 in many cases all the aforementioned factors contributed to the success of an amendment20 further while the electoral college has always d critics it has cons istently produced president and vice president in all but two of the 55 presidential elections held underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32612crs11 21 the exceptions were 1800 and 1824 in which contingent
