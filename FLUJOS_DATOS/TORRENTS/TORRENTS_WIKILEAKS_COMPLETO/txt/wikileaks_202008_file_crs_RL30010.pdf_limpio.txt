of businessth will be to deal with the impeachment of the president of the united states the 1998 congressional campaigns and elections suggested that the agenda of the 106 congress also will be largely domestic in its focus social security healthth care and education were the order of the day in campaigns across america and n postelection news programs indeed of the issues discussed in this report onl increased defense spending to address military readiness and retention of traine d military personnel has been reported on recently as the president announced ove r new years weekend his proposal to ask for substantial increase in the fy200 0 budget for military pay and hardware development most immediately the 106 congress is expected to consider supplementa lth appropriations bill to support the wye river memorandum including increase d assistance to israel jordan and the palestinians congress likely will quickly consider new assistance and trade benefits to central american countries hit hardest b hurrican mitch development aid to countries severely affected by the globa l financial crisis and more humanitarian assistance to kosovo are another two issues that might find their way into supplemental appropriations bill in the first fe w months of the new congress the united states also stands in arrears with the united nations and the world bank bu t neither matter is expected to receive appropriators attention in the supplemental there are few routine foreign affa irs and defense issues to be addressed by the 106 congress albeit with less urgency than the supplemental appropriations theth president will issue international narcotics control certifications before march 1 asst required by law for any country found to be trafficking or producing narcotics certification could jeopardize its receipt of us foreign assistance congress might respond with legislation supporting or neg ating specific countries certification status new authorizations and appropriations bills will be considered for departments and agencies authorization for some fo reign assistance programs expires before the end of the first session and reauthorizations are likely to be taken up the president s authority to waive proliferation sanctions imposed on india and pakistan last ma must be ren ewed this year or be allowed to expire which would require th reimposition of sanctions that many members of congress find counterproductive several laws remain in the united states co that were shaped during the cold war the 106 congress could turn its attention to these previous severa lth congresses have made some effort to amend repeal or replace the foreig n assistance act of 1961 and export administration act of 1979 consensus on new provisions however has not been reached congress has not enacted foreign ai d authorization bill since 1985 each year waiving the requirement to do so and relying on the annual appropriations measure to express its foreign

almost ten years ago two presidents an d members of four gresses have sought to adapt us foreign and defense policies to dramatically ne w international environment without the unifying imperative of clear and imminent threat to us national security both branches of governmen t have found it more difficult to produce consistent consensual approaches to plethora of international challenges in the us system of constitutionallyshared responsibility for foreign an d defense policy the president plays key leadership r ole the congress however has precise and important responsibilities including authorization and appropriation f funds for the united s tates international role the requirement for senate advice and consent to us participation in international treatie s the responsibility of both houses to oversee the administrations condu ct of policy and declaration of war should that be necessary during the 106 congress as in the previous two congresses thes eth responsibilities will be assumed in circumstance of divided government with th democratic party holding the presidency and the republican party controlling both houses of congress in such political setting the goal of developing consensua l approaches to foreign policy will be pursued in the context of philosophical institutional and partisan differences between the two branches some of the broad questions that the congress and the president will be called on to address include how should the united states play its role as the only tru global power what roles should us military forces play in defending us interests how can an effective balance be struck between unilateral us actions and those taken in cert with allies or the international community in an increasingly interdependent world is the united states effectively combining the political economic and military aspects of its international involvement to maximize benefits for us interests these issues were raised prominently when in december 1998 the united states and the united kingdom once again used force against iraq to try to bring saddam husseins regime into compliance with international prohibitions against th possession and ma nufacture of weapons of mass destruction other members of the security council questioned the desirability and effectiveness of the militar strikes and some countries accused the united states of acting like hegemoni c power and undermining the united nations the episode has revived fundamenta l questions about under what circumstances the united states should use force httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30010crs2 particularly in the absence of an internat ional consensus or congressional mandate for the action in recent years such questions have come down to more specific issues in the congress with regard to the use of force the united states has played key role with other nato countries in restorin g an uneasy peace to bosnia and herzegovina and in the recent kosovo crisis the congress never explicitly supported th presidents decision to send us forces to bosnia but h as also continued to fund their presence the question of supporting continued us involvement the balkans will come before the 106 congress as well th with regard to us diplomacy the congress and the clinton administratio n have jointly reorganized the us foreign policy establishment eliminating thre foreign policy agencies and merging their functions within the department of state implementation of the reorganization will likely receive oversight from the 106th congress other foreign policy matters raised by preceding sessions of congres s remain unresolved there are continuing differen ces about how to deal with the issue of back dues the united states owes to the united nations for example and us foreign assistance authorizing legislation has for several years now been blocked by differences over highly charged political issues the administration and congres s have also differed over the imposition and managemen t of export controls and the use of sanctions in us foreign policy us foreign policy increasingly is influen ced by economic conditions around the world the wellbein g of the us economy is affected by weaknesses in other parts of the world as recently demonstrated by the asian and russian financial crises in an increasingly globalized world for example issues like

for managing foreign and defense policy althoug h the president through his powers as commander in chief maintains formidable authority to manage and direct us foreign and defense policy congress possesses broad range of tools to oversee influence and in some cases revers executive policies the most direct means for lawmakers is through the enactment of defense state department and foreign aid authorization and appropriations bills usually considered annually control over funding key white house defense an d foreign policy initiatives such as the costs of deploying american forces to bosnia paying u s obligations at the united nations and the international monetary fund procuring military weapons systems and suppo rting middle east peace efforts offers congress perhaps its most powerful instrumenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30010crs3 legislativeexecutive controversies have blocked passage of state department authorization bills for four years and foreign aid authorizing measures for over decade as result appropriations bills have grown increasingly important as means of influencing foreign po licy placing conditions on how or when defense and foreign affairs funds can be used such as the current conditions and restrictions on paying for heavy fuel oil for north korea offers lawmakers the means t maintain close ove rsight of executive policy or block initiatives that require financial commitments out of favor with congress the senate also can exert influence through its powers to approve or reject treaties ambassador and highlevel administratio n personnel appointments congress also enacts nonbinding resolutions that do t require presidential signature holds open hearings where executive officials can b vigorously questioned or issues statements on personal views to expres s congressional sentiment and educate the public in ways that may influence th conduct of american foreign and defense policy whether by condu cting oversight or by enacting legislation the 106 congressth can have significant role in determining the direction of us foreign policy an d might be particularly active in areas pertaining to the use of military force th allocation of foreign assistance the imposition strengthening or easing of foreig n policy sanctions controlling exportation of sensitive goods and technology us participation in the united nations and the administration of the newly reorganized department of state its agencies and embassies each of these issues is discussed in some detail below use of military force in the years since the collapse of the soviet bloc policymakers have struggled to redefine the role of military power in an environment of numerous and diffus threats as the united sta tes deployed troops to bosnia southwest asia haiti and elsewhere some farreaching issues have been raised including 1 determining the circums tances in which force should be used us defense strategy calls for military forces to help shape the international security environment respond to challenges across the entire spectrum of conflict and prepare for future threats to shape the environment and respond to crises requires among othe r things extensive us military engagement abroad and willingness to employ force in response to wide range of challenges to security former defense secretar william perry argued that the use of force may be appropriate not only when vita l interests are threatened but also when important interests are at stake and even under strictly limited conditions for humanitarian reasons the issue he said is whethe r costs and risks are properly calibrated to us interests many legislators remai n skeptical about us involvement where less than vital us interests are at stake 2 peacekeeping as the cold w ar was ending some policymakers hoped that the use of multilateral forces operatin g under auspices in situations short of war peacekeeping would help contain and resolve local conflicts enhancing world stability with minimal commitment of us forces former presidents reagan and bush both endorsed this concept deployments during the bush and clinto n administrations however generated great deal of debate about unsponsore d peacekeeping operations p articularly where high levels of force were and are used in may 1994 the clinton administration announced presidential decision directivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30010crs4 pdd 25 s et of guidelines to help determine when and how the united state s would support peace keeping and by implication when it might act either in an ad hoc coalition or unilaterally skeptics of this approach maintain that man peacekeeping operations whether under the united nations or other auspices cost too much and burden us armed forces while d oing little to promote us interests 3 congresss role the constitution gives congress the responsibility t declare war to raise and regulate the armed forc and to provide funds for activities of the us government including military action how congress should exercis these responsibilities and how vigorously it should assert its role is matter of perennial debate since the votes n the persian gulf war in 1991 congress has not asserted direct role in deciding between war and peace efforts to use the power of the purse to li mit military operations either before or after the fact have also had limited success though congress has vigorously debated the us of force in somalia haiti bosnia and elsewhere it has in the end imposed few direct constraints n presidential action the main issue in congress has been and continues to be how to pay for military operations in particular whether funds should be provided as emergency supplemental appr opriations overandabove the regular defense budget or should they be offset by cuts in other defense programs crs reports the use of force key statements by weinberger shultz aspin bush powell albright and perry by stephen daggett and nina m

concentrated on child survival activities an d appropri ations to clear us arrears at the world bank and regional internationa l financial institutions it is likely that the administration will send to congress foreign aid budget request for fy2000 at or above the 138 billion enacted fo r fy1999 congress will face fore ign aid legislation almost immediately in the new session in the form of 2

israel to cover the costs of relocating israeli military forces from west bank territory and 200 million for jordan in security assistance the administration is also expected to seek 120 million or more for hurricanere lated reconstruction in central america the united states has already committed 300 million for emergency assistance t the region mostly for the most seriously damaged nations of

likely to designate the entire supplemental as n emergency requiring equivalent reducti ons in existing spending some members may recommend offsets to make the supplemental appropriations budget neutral funding for the wye river accord could prove contentious because it would exceed congressi onally imposed fy1999 cap of 54 billion total us assistance to th middle east while congress will consider many foreign aid issues in suppleme ntal and foreign operations appropria tions measures the balance of the foreign aid legislative agenda is less certain without enactment since 1985 of fore ign assistance authorization bills the main statute foreign assistance act of 1961 is seriously out of date an d reflects fe w of the postcold war changes in foreign aid policy priorities congress could attempt to revise the 1961 act or address individual and perhaps s controversial issues in more narrowly focused authorization bills authority fo r continuance of the overseas private investment

targeting specific countries most recently cuba iran iraq libya china burm myanmar serbia russia or north korea while the congressional debate over the use of sanctions has its recent roots in cold war legislation of the 1960s antiapartheid legislation of the 1980s and us reaction to iraqs aggression toward kuwait i n 1990 the debate changed dramatically in the aft ermath of indias and pakistans testing of nuclear detonation devices in the spring of 1998 the president was required by law to impose sanctions against the two nations sanctions that in pa rt prohibited american wheat growers from selling their harvest to pakistan primary market at about the same time news reports were circulating stating that sanctions against iraq were having serious impact on the civilian population in iraq congress looked anew at the practice of restrictin g another countrys access to american food and medical exports for foreign polic reasons the sanctions against india and pakistan were eventually modified b congress to allow for agricultural commodity sales and the president was authorized to ease or ad just those sanctions over the course of one year multilateral sanctions against iraq

members of congress sent letter to the president asking him to authorize onetime agricultural commoditie s sale to iran country otherwise prohibited from such transactions by us unilateral sanctions and to generally reconsider the use of food as foreign policy weapon the 105 congress on the other hand enac ted the freedom from religiousth persecution act which authorizes the president to impose

primary purpose of blocking exports that could help the military buildup of communist bloc countries was cold war law that some contend is longe r relevant to us interests threats to us national security and foreign policy goals now stem f rom less powerful countries and subnational groups that seek to expand their influence or intimidate their neighbors many by acquiring weapons of mas s destruction and related delivery systems and many by employing or supportin g international terrorists although export controls might still restrict the militar capabilities f these potential

developments multilateral regime cocom once controlled the exports of participating countries to communist countries cocom dissolved in 1994 however and was eventually replaced by the wassenaar arrangement under which export control efforts are largely voluntary few countries such as north korea china and russia continue to def international norms by exporting dangerous goods and technology to unstable regions and aggressive nations many members of congress have expressed concer n that the administration has liberalized export controls to such an extent that us national security interests are not sufficiently protected others are concerned that some export controls ar arbitrary and harmful to the us economy exports of nuclear technology satellites highperformance computers
