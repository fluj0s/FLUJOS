trade division june 10 2008 abstract usyemeni relations have generally been good though marred occasionally by diﬀerences over iraq and the arabisraeli conﬂict us oﬃcials have welcomed yemens support for the war on terrorism since september 11 2001 however because the yemeni populace is ambivalent about any western military presence the yemeni government tends to downplay usyemeni military and intelligence ties the us government has modestly increased aid for yemen which had virtually ended in the late 1990s in 2003 the us agency for international development usaid reopened its mission in yemen after hiatus of seven years over the past several ﬁscal years yemen has received on average between 20 and 25 million in total us foreign aid in fy2009 the administration has requested 282

this report summarizes yemens domestic situation foreign relations and ties with the united states it will be updated as significant developments occur with limited natural resources crippling illiteracy rate and high population growth yemen faces an array of daunting development challenges that some observers believe make it at risk for becoming failed state in the next few decades between

population lives below the poverty line and per capita gdp is estimated to be between 650 and 800 yemen is largely dependent on external aid from persian gulf countries western donors and international financial institutions though its per capita share of assistance is below the global average as the countrys population rapidly rises resources dwindle and terrorist groups take root in the outlying provinces the obama administration and the 111 th congress are left to grapple with the consequences of yemeni instability traditionally usyemeni relations have been tepid as the lack of strong militarytomilitary ties commercial relations and cross cultural exchange has hindered the development of strong bilateral ties during the early years of the bush administration relations

the merger of the formerly separate states of north yemen and south yemen in 1990 in 1994 government forces loyal to president ali abdullah saleh put down an attempt by southernbased dissidents to secede from the newly unified state but some southerners still resent what they perceive as continued northern political economic and cultural domination of daily life in addition to northsouth cleavages based on religious sectarian differences political rivalries and disputes over sharing of oil revenue yemen faces complex regional issues that have created additional divisions within the population and further complicate efforts by the government to build unified modern state president saleh former military officer has governed yemen since the unified state came into being in 1990 prior to this he had headed the former state of north yemen from 1978 to 1990 in yemens first popular presidential election held in 1999 president saleh won 963 of the vote amidst cries of ballot tampering in 2006 saleh stood for reelection and received 77 of the vote his main opponent faisal bin shamlan 72yearold former oil executive and government minister ran an effective campaign but was outspent by saleh and the ruling party 1 bin shamlan was supported by an opposition coalition com posed of islamists communists and powerful tribes

throughout his decades of rule president saleh has balanced various political forcestribes political parties military officials and radical islamiststo create stable ruling coalition that has kept his regime intact however in recent years series of events including increased qaeda attacks an insurgency in the north and civi l unrest in the south have led some experts to conclude that yemen may be on the verge of collapse particularly given its already precarious economic condition as the countrys population rapidly rises resources dwindle and terrorist groups take root in the outlying provinces the obama administration and the 111 th congress are left to grapple with the consequences of yemeni instability some experts suggest that the united states should focus more attention on yemen because of the risks that state failure would pose to us national security some advocates also note that instability in yemen would affect more than just us interests it would affect global energy security due to yemens location astride the bab mandab strait between the red sea and indian ocean others assert that while increased lawlessness in yemen most likely will lead to more terrorist activity us involvement in yemen should stem from basic humanitarian concerns for povertystricken population desperately in need of development assistance still other analysts suggest that yemen is not of major significance to us interests and is far more important to the gulf arab states notably saudi arabia usyemeni trade is marginal russia and china are its major arms suppliers and many of its conservative tribal leaders are suspicious of us policy in the region with so many other more pressing issues in the region to address iraq iran israelipalestinian conflict yemen is often overlooked by us policymakers nevertheless the above debate over 1 shamlans campaign slogan was president for yemen not yemen for president

yemen is an undeveloped country where outside of the capital of sanaa tribal leaders often exert more control than central and local government authorities it has long been the scene of random violence and kidnaping it is rumored that there are an estimated 60 million firearms among population of less than 20 million kidnapings of yemeni officials and foreign tourists have been carried out mainly by dissatisfied tribal groups pressing the government for financial largesse or for infrastructure projects in their districts the prevailing climate of lawlessness in much of yemen has provided opportunities for terrorist groups to maintain presence in outlying areas of the country many experts believe that since the 1980s yemeni president ali abdullah saleh has tolerated the presence of radical islamists in the country and has used their presence to bolster his credibility among islamist hardliners 2 as the ancestral home of qaeda leader osama bin laden yemen provided and then welcomed home thousands of socalled arab afghan volunteers who fought alongside the mujahidin islamic fighters against the soviet occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s during the 1994 civil war president saleh dispatched several brigades of arab afghans to fight against southern late secessionists in the mid to 1990s yemeni and many foreign militants many with ties to qaeda began striking targets inside the country one group known as the adenabyan islamic army which was formed by former bin laden associate was responsible for the december 1998 kidnaping of 16 foreign tourists 4 of whom

the yemeni port of aden killing 17 us servicemen and wounding 39 others nearly 8 years after the attack many details on the attack remain mystery in 2000 agents from the federal bureau of investigation fbi uncovered some of the perpetrators of the terrorist bombing one suspect abd rahim nashiri saudi national of yemeni descent who served as qaedas operations chief in the arabian peninsula was captured in the united arab emirates in november 2002 and handed over to the central intelligence agency according to the washington post nashiri had spent several months before his capture under highlevel protection from the yemeni government3 another qaeda member walid bin attash also referred to as tawfiq bin attash has been named by the us department of justice as an unindicted coconspirator in the cole attack both nashiri and attash have appeared before military tribunals in guantanamo bay cuba where they have been held for several years under us military custody third organizer of the cole bombing jamal badawi has been to the frustration of us officials held under yemeni custody despite two previous successful escapes april 2003 and 2006 from his captors after his second escape in 2006 along with 22 other qaeda convicts in what many believe was an officially sanctioned prison break badawi turned himself in year later pledged his allegiance to

released badawi from house arrest despite vocal protestations from the bush administration yemen has refused to extradite badawi to the united states article 44 of the constitution states that yemeni national may not be extradited to foreign authority where he has been indicted in the us district court in new york on murder charges4 according to one former fbi official badawi was the guy w ho recruited the bombers he was the local mastermind5 at this time it is unclear if badawi is still incarcerated according to us state department spokesman sean mccormack this was someone who was implicated in the cole bombing and someone who cant be running free yemeni officials claim however that badawi is now cooperating with the government in attempts to capture new generation of more lethal jihadists according to rashad muhammad alimi yemens interior minister the strategy is fighting terrorism but we need space to use our own tactics and our friends must understand us

officials complained that yemeni authorities were not cooperative in the investigation after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the yemeni government became more forthcoming in its cooperation with the us campaign to suppress qaeda president saleh reportedly has allowed small groups of us special forces troops and cia agents to assist in identifying and rooting out qaeda cadres hiding in yemen despite sympathy for qa eda among many yemenis according to press articles quoting us and yemeni officials the yemeni government allowed us personnel to launch missile strike from an unmanned aircraft against an automobile in eastern yemen in november 2002 killing six alleged terrorists including qaid salim sinan harithi the leader of qaeda in yemen and key planner of the attack on the uss

strait where the red sea meets the gulf of aden and the indian ocean7 finally the united states has provided technical assistance equipment and training to the anti terrorism unit of the yemeni central security forces and other yemeni interior ministry departments despite recent usyemeni security cooperation many us officials view yemens counterterrorism policies as inadequate according to

director robert mueller traveled to yemen in order to discuss counter terrorism issues with president saleh including an update on the status of jamal badawi and other known qaeda operatives according to newsweek report the meeting between mueller and yemeni president ali abdullah saleh did not go well according to two sources who were briefed on the session but asked not to be identified discussing it saleh gave clear answers about the suspect jamal badawi leaving mueller angry and very frustrated said one source who added that hes rarely seen the normally taciturn fbi director so

states was able to severely disrupt qaedainspired terrorist activity in yemen however in recent years analysts observe that new generation of militants has emerged many of these islamist militants either fought coalition forces in iraq or were radicalized in the yemeni prison system moreover unlike their predecessors this new generation of qaedainspired extremists may be more inclined to target the yemeni government itself in addition to foreign and western interests in yemen according to one analyst the older generation while passionate about global jihad was more concerned with local matters and more willing to play by the timehonored yemeni rules of bargaining and negotiating in order to keep saleh from destroying their safe haven not so with the new generationthey willingly criticize saleh harshly and seem immune to the lure of the negotiation room 10 overall islamist terrorist groups are not strong enough to topple president salehs regime but most analysts consider them capable of successfully striking high value target such as an oil installation or foreign government compound one group calling itself qaeda in yemen aka the qaeda organization in the southern arabian peninsula has issued several statements demanding that president saleh among other things release militants from prison end his cooperation with the united states renounce democracy and fully implement islamic law and permit yemeni militants to travel to iraq to carry out jihad the groups leaders were part of the infamous 2006 jailbreak in which 23 convicted terrorists escaped from prison

explosives two months after the attack qaeda in yemen claimed responsibility for the attack in its message the group noted that the attack did not take place in muslim markets or other gathering places but rather in the den of cunning and deception the security quarters of the global crusade terrorism experts and some us officials have warned of the growing sophistication and lethality of islamist terrorist groups in yemen in speech to the atlantic council of the united states cia director michael hayden stated that yemen is another country of concern place where qaeda is strengthening weve seen an unprecedented number of attacks this year plots are increasing not only in number but in sophistication and the range of targets is broadening other observers note that despite such brazen attack yemeni militants failed to breach the us embassys outer layer of security and killed almost exclusively all yemeni civilians rather than embassy personnel nevertheless simply gaining

analysts dispute iranian involvement in northern yemen asserting that the yemeni authorities are using the specter of iranian interference to ju stify largescale military operations against the insurgents and calls for assistance from neighboring gulf states after five rounds of fighting the war between government forces and houthi rebels has quieted though experts caution that violence could reignite at any time the fundamental grievances that started the conflict in the first place have not been resolved sada remains one of the poorest areas of yemen and experts believe the houthi family seized upon the desperation of many of the provinces inhabitants to build religiouslyinspired insurgent movement capable of fighting guerrilla warfare in the regions mountainous areas the conflict much of which has taken place in civilian areas has witnessed atrocities on both sides though some human rights groups have accused security forces of using disproportionate force to quell the rebellion thereby further enflaming their opponents according to recent human rights watch report even though the latest round of fighting ended in july 2008 nearly 130000 civilians remain displaced and aid agencies are hindered from servicing them according to the report many agencies must ask separate interior ministry permission for each and every trip an almost impossible operational requirement by the end of september 2008 the government allowed aid agencies access to limited number of towns in sada governorate but well into october this expanded access was insufficient to reach many of those who have long gone without assistance and who remain at risk 18 although the war against the houthi rebels remains localized conflict most yemen experts believe that the longer it festers the politically weaker it makes president saleh appear particularly to the military establishment before he unilaterally ended the recent round of fighting in july 2008

related to yemeni stability they pale in comparison to the long term structural resource and economic challenges facing country with rapidly gr owing population to an outsider these problems seem almost intractable as bad government pol icies and crippling poverty exacerbate existing shortages creating feedback loop for example the central government subsidizes diesel fuel at cost to the treasury of several billion dollars annually nearly 11 of gdp the diesel subsidy not only drains government revenue but also distorts commodity prices and makes water pumping and trucking costs artificially low thereby giving farmers incentive to conserve water furthermore the subsidy encourages smuggling which may be officially sanctioned at the highest levels according to one recent report diesel smuggling is facet of elite corruption that has led one international economist working in yemen to complain that more and more people are being pushed into destitution while handful of people are living as if there is tomorrow 19 however when the government attempted to lift the diesel subsidy in 2001 and 2005 riots ensued and the policy was swiftly reversed the cultivation of qat stimulant whose leav are widely chewed throughout the horn of africa also drains yemens scarce underground water resources qat is cash crop20 and its harvests surpass local coffee and wheat production which has led to increased demand for food imports qat also may use as much as 40 of water resources consumed by local agriculture as farmers drill deeper wells to access freshwater the water table drops and drinking water becomes contaminated with minerals yemenis may now be using fossil water to irrigate crops most analysts believe that if yemens major aquifers are depleted the only realistic solution to the countrys water crisis would be strategy based on increased wateruse efficiency and the construction of several largescale desalination plants how such massive investment in the infrastructure would be financed remains unknown though it is an age old tradition and ingrained in yemeni culture qat chewing also cripples attempts at promoting sustainable development not only does it deplete the countrys water resources and reduce food security low income chewers spend significant portions of their time and salaries between 10 and 30 on qat according to one yemeni social critic development can be achieved in yemen as long as this plant called qat takes up 90 percent of the spare time of the yemeni people some may argue that this is an old tradition of yemen just like the arms and jambiyas traditional daggers but even if that were so harmful traditions must be thrown away 21 according to the world bank the culture of spending extended afternoon hours chewing qat is

according to the economist intelligence unit in 200910 the government plans to encourage local private enterprise and attract foreign investors by strengthening the financial sector increasing the number of microfinance banks modernizing the local commercial courts reducing red tape and updating investment regulation these efforts will continue to be hindered however by poorly educated

attack the countrys shoreline is vast and the number of patrol and deep water vessels in its fleet is limited though president saleh has pledged to deploy 1600 specially trained soldiers to fight piracy in essence the piracy issue is more of an opportunity for the yemeni government to appear engaged to western and fellow arab states on an issue in which all parties have shared interests while it is possible that yemen could secure additional pledges of foreign support in the name of combating piracy it also is possible that smugglers could be selling subsidized yemeni diesel in east

crimes for participation in the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks according to one report the remaining 97 are an eclectic group of intentional unrepentant combatants and accidental warriors yet separating the detainees into two groups and determining where different individuals fall on spectrum of past and potential violence is nearly impossible task 26 in december salim hamdan who was convicted in august of aiding qaeda and sent enced to five and onehalf years in prison was released and handed over to the yemeni authorities he was returned to yemen and subsequently released after serving the remainder of his sentence among those held at guantanamo who have not been charged are the brother of the deputy commander of qaeda in yemen what to do with the remaining yemeni prisoners is subject of debate within the united states government the yemeni government has poor track record of keeping known terrorists with us blood on their hands in prison as president saleh has instead opted to negotiate with hardened militants in order to use them against more lethal jihadists or to secure pacts of non belligerence from qaeda affiliates on january 22 2009 president obama signed series of executive orders to close the us detention facility at guantanamo bay cuba with yemenis composing nearly 40 of the remaining prison population us policymakers will now be tasked with reviewing their individual cases according to initial reports listed options include repatriation to their home nations or willing third country civil trials in this country or special civil or military system 27 the yemeni government is pressing us officials to fund rehabilitation program for prisoners similar to saudi arabian government program that uses clerics and social support networks to deradicalize and monitor prisoners between 2002 and 2005 yemeni religious affairs minister and supreme court justice hamoud alhittar ran an unsuccessful dialogue program with yemeni islamists in which he attempted to convince prisoners that jihad in islam is for defense not for offensive attacks more than 360 militants were released after going through the program but there was almost postrelease support such as helping the detainees find jobs and wives key elements of the saudi initiative several graduates of the program returned to violence including three of the seven men identified as participants in the september bombing of the us embassy in yemen other observers have suggest ed funding supermaxtype prison in yemen though costs are uncertain and there is little us faith in the yemeni authorities ability to maintain security 25 coddling terrorists in yemen washington post may 17 2008 26 gregory d johnsen and christopher boucek the dilemma of the yemeni detainees

annually in total us foreign aid for fy2009 the administration has requested 282 million in assistance for yemen an increase from its 207 million aid package in fy2008 between fy2006 and fy2007 yemen also received approximately 315 million from the us department of defenses section 1206 account section 1206 authority is department of defense account designed to provide equipment supplies or training to foreign national military forces engaged in counterterrorist operations the primary recipients of the 1206 support are the yemeni special operations forces ysof the yemeni army 11th brigade and the yemeni ministry of defenses primary logistics support command known as the central repair base us economic aid to yemen also supports democracy and governance programming for almost five years the national democratic institute ndi has run programs in yemens outlying provinces to support conflict resolution strategies designed to end revenge killings among tribes in november 2005 the millennium challenge corporation mcc suspended yemens eligibility for assistance under its threshold program concluding that after yemen was named as potential aid candidate in fy2004 corruption in the country had increased yemen became eligible to reapply in november 2006 and had its eligibility reinstated in february 2007 nearly six months after it held what some observers described as relatively successful presidential election yemens threshold program was approved on september 12 2007 however after reports of jamal badawis release from prison surfaced month later the mcc canceled ceremony to inaugurate the 206 million threshold grant stating that the agency is reviewing its relationship with yemen since then there have been repor ts on the status of mcc assistance to yemen

strong though recurring tensions over counter terrorism cooperation and lack of us interest in yemen within the broader foreign policy community persist on the security front yemen s been unwilling to extradite wanted militants and it is doubtful that the new administration c ould secure new pledges of cooperation on this issue overall us policymakers face series of difficult questions should the united states engage the yemeni government on security cooperation alone or should us policy focus on development and reform irrespective of the level of president salehs cooperation on counterterrorism issues if the united states does increase its aid to yemen how much can the country realistically absorb given corruption and lack of infrastructure and security finally if policymakers show an interest in yemen are there opportunities for cooperation and coordination with saudi arabia and the rest of the gcc on formulating strategies to support sustainable development
