policy implementation issues for congress summary the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 established 10year program to acquire civilia n medical countermeasures to chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn agents for the strategic national stockpile provisions of this act were designed to courage private companies to develop these countermeasures by guaranteeing govern ment market for ccessfully developed countermeasures congress has expressed concern about th implementation of project bioshield it has held multiple oversight hearings nd considered several pieces of legislation to improve the execution of this program including the pande mic and allhazards preparedness act pl 109417 hr 1089 and hr 1684 stakeholders and policymakers have criticized specific contract award decisions and the rate at which they are made additionally contract awar ds reported by the partment of health and human services hhs do not directly correspond with figures provided in the presidents annual budget documents which may suggest problems with interagency coordination and communication both the department of homeland security dhs and hhs have responsibilities in this program funds fo r this program are appropriated to dhs while contracts are executed through hhs the interagency process responsible for deciding which countermeasures to proc ure has changed multiple times since this programs inception the homeland security appropriations act 2004 pl 10890 provided an advance appropriation of 56 billion to acquire cbrn countermeasures over 10 year period fy2004fy2013 this act also limited the amount that could be obligated during specified time periods the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 assigned the 56 billion advance appropriation to project bioshield countermeasure acquisitions two separate rescissions reduced the total amount available for project bioshield by to tal of 25 million congress retains the power to make additional ppropriations and resci ssions to this account hhs has awarded project bioshield cont racts for countermeasures against anthrax smallpox botulinum toxin and ra diological or nuclear agents these awards total approximate ly 2331 billion however the largest contract 878 million for an anthrax vaccine was cancelle d in december 2006 for failure to meet contract milestone taking this into account approximately 1889 billion remains available for obligation through fy2008 and 4064 billion available for obligation through the end of the program in fy2013 this report discusses acti ons taken by

terrorist attacks and other emergencies project bioshield appropriations acquisitions and policy implementation issues for congress following the terrorist attacks of 2001 th federal government determined that it would need additional medical counterm easures eg diagnostic tests drugs vaccines and other treatments to respond to an attack using chemical biological radiological or nuclear cbr n agents the enactment of the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 was designed to be an important part of federal efforts to obtain new civilian medical countermeasures it provides countermeasure developers with guaranteed government market fo r their products as congress continues oversight of federal efforts to protect the united states the effectiveness and efficiency of the project bioshield imple mentation may draw legislative attention this report discusses acti ons taken by congress and the administration that have affected this progra m describes the decisionma king process for choosing countermeasures describes th countermeasures for which the department of health and human services hhs has contracte d and discusses accoun ting discrepancies between the presidents budget and hhs reporting of project bioshield awards overview of project bioshield the project bioshield act of 2004 p l 108276 contains three major provisions one relaxes some procedures for bioterrorismrelated procurement hiring and research grant awarding another permits the emergency use of countermeasures not approved by the f ood and drug administration fda the third authorizes 10year program to encourage the development and production of new countermeasures for ch emical biological radiol ogical and nuclear cbrn agents this last provision is usually referre d to as project bioshield and is the focus of this report1 in contrast to federal pr ograms that directly fund research and development of biomedical countermeasures pr oject bioshield is procur ement program it acts as guarantee that the federal govern ment will buy succe ssfully developed countermeasures for the strate gic national stockpile sns2 it allows the government to enter into contracts to pr ocure countermeasures while they still are in development up to eight years before pr oduct delivery is expected the governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33907crs2 3 dr john vitko director dhs chemical and biological divi sion public comments at the project bioshield stake holders meeting washing ton dc september 25 2006guarantees that it will buy certain quantity at specified price once the countermeasure meets specific requirements the g overnment pays the agreedupon amount only after these requirements are t and the product is delivered to the strategic national st ockpile if the product does not meet the requirements within the specified time frame the contract can be cancelled without any payment to the contractor thus project bioshield is intended to re duce the developers market risk that is the possibility that cust omer will buy the successfully developed product however it does not reduce the development risk that is the possibility that the countermeasure will fail during development th pandemic and all hazards preparedness act p l 109417 modified the project bioshield act to allow for milestonebased payments for up to half of the total award before countermeasure delivery project bios hield procur ement process the project bioshield procurement pro cess requires actions by the department of homeland security dhs hhs and the president and relies on interagency working groups figure 1 illustrates the project bioshield decisionmaking and acquisition process dhs roles the first step in the bioshield acquisition process is to determine whether particular cbrn agent poses material threat to national security this analysis generally referred to as materi threat assessment mta is performed by dhs between 30 and 40 subject matte r experts are consulted during an mta3 on the basis of this assessment the dhs secretary determines whether that agent poses material threat to national secu rity the project bioshield act of 2004 requires such written material threat determination mtd for procurement using bioshield funds and authorities this decl aration neither addre sses the relative risk posed by an agent nor determines the prio rity of its acquisition furthermore the issuance of an mtd does not guarantee that the government will pursue countermeasures agai nst that agent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33907crs3 4 hhs public health

costs it so broadened the types of countermeasures that may be acquired from this account to include those ag ainst biological chemical radiological and nuclear agents rescissions although congress provided the entire ppropriation for the 10year program congress retains the power to increase or decrease the amount available for project bioshield two separate rescissions have removed total of 25 million from the project bioshield sp ecial reserve fund the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 contained an across theboard rescission of 059 this rescission applied to the amount of the project bioshield advance appropriation that b ecame available for obligation in fy2004 table 2 this rescission removed 5 million from the amounts available for obligation in fy2004 as well as reducing the total special reserve fund by an equal amount thus the amount available fo r obligation in fy2004 was reduced from 890 million to 885 million and the total amount available for fy2004fy2013 was reduced from 5593 billion to 5588 billion table 1 and table 2 the consolidated appropriations act 2005 pl 108447 contained an across theboard rescission of 08 this re scission applied to the 2528 b illion that became available for obligation in fy2005 table 2 this removed 20 million from the amount available for obligation for fy2005fy2008 as well as reducing the total special

5588 billion to 5568 billion table 1 and table 2 future funding options acrosstheboard rescissions generally only affect those amounts that become available in that fiscal ear therefore the special reserve fund is unlikely to be affected by future acrosstheboard rescissions except in fy2009 when the remaining 2175 billion becomes available table 2 however congress retains the power to make both

strategy may allow for more efficient prioritization and balance of counterm easures providing optimized protection from cbrn attacks using finite f unds in the shortest time since hhs has not issued contracts for the all of the agents that already have mtds an increase in this number may not increase the rate of countermeasure awards however hhs has predicted that additional mtds would be issued unless technology advances or if our understanding of the potential threats changes82 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33907crs27 83 pharmaceutical research nd manufacturers of america industry profile 2006 p 4appropriators set limits on how much could be obligated during specified periods of time the pace by which hhs awards countermeasur contracts roughly corresponds to these limits by this criteri on this program is on track to fulfill its goals hhs cannot obligate the money fa ster than it becomes available stakeholders industry leaders and polic ymakers have criticized hhs for some of the countermeasures it has chosen in decisions as complicated and weighty as these any choice is likely to be criticized given the failure of the largest contract to date some critics may conclude that project bioshield has fallen short of its goals since the majority of the money that has been obligated though not the majority of contracts has not yet resu lted in products in the stoc kpile however one of the unique features of project bi oshield contracts is that the government may contract for products that require up to eight years mo re of development it was designed to allow the government to promise to buy something but only pay for it on delivery thus the company rather than the government bears the majority of the development risk ie that the product will never be deliverable one industry group estimates that more than half of all pharmaceuticals will fail during the last eight years of development83 thus it may be expected that at least some project bioshield contracts will be cancelled the government bears some development risk in the form of opportunity costs since the money available for obligation is finite ie money obligated to countermeasure that will ultimately fail in development cannot be simultaneously obligated to nother needed countermeasure it is possible that the establishment of the biodefense advance research and development authority barda in hhs will reduce the likelihood that future project bioshield contracts will fail during the advanced development phase established by the pandemic and allhazards prepar edness act pl 109417 one of bardas roles is to support the advanced research and development of promising countermeasures in theory funding this part of the development process through such dedicated mechanism could allow c ountermeasures to further mature through the development process longer before co mpeting for project bioshield contract this could reduce the risk that c ountermeasure will fail while under project bioshield contract pl 109417 included authorization for approximately 1 b illion to support this type of activity for fy2007 through fy2008 although congress did not appropriate money for barda in fy 2007 the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq account ability appropriations act 2007 pl 110 28 transferred 99 million from national in stitutes of health accounts to fund barda even if barda becomes ope rational in fy2007 it will take some time to determine what projects to fund provi funding and receive returns on this investment it remains to be seen how hhs decision to combine barda with the hhs office responsible for executing proj ect bioshield office of public health emergency medical counterm easures will affect the execution of both programs additional criticism of the project bi oshield procurement process may stem from the perceived opacity of its decisi onmaking process hhs is moving to address some of these issues by publishing its phemce

companies th at might develop n eeded count ermeasures through stakeholder meetings some critics also suggest that the pr oject bioshield process has been poorly managed overall such suggestions ar reinforced by the annual accounting discrepancies between hhs nd dhs it remains to be seen whether these concerns will be allayed through the management changes being implemented subsequent to the
