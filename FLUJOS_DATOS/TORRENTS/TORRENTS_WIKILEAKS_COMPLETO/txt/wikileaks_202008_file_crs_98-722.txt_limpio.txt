and us foreign policy updated regularly by raphael perl terrorism middle eastern groups and state sponsors 1998 summary during the 1980s and the early 1990s iran and terrorist groups it sponsors have been responsible for the most politically significant acts of middle eastern terrorism in late 1997 signs began to appear that major factions within iran want to change irans image from backer of terrorism to constructive force in the region if this trend in iran takes hold there is chance that statesponsored middle eastern terrorism will decline over time as iran moves away from active opposition to the arabisraeli peace process the arabisraeli peace process is longstanding major us foreign policy initiative and the administration and congress pay particularly close attention to terrorist groups and state sponsors that oppose it islamist groups such as hamas have largely displaced secular nationalist groups as the most active antipeace process organizations hamas has become stronger politically since its founder was released from an israeli prison in october 1997 but acts of terrorism by hamas and its allies have declined since mid1997 possibly because of greater antiterrorism vigilance by the palestinian authority over the past few years radical islamic groups have increasingly sought to oust prous regimes and gain removal of us troops from the persian gulf this is the chief goal of independent terrorist financier and chieftain saudi dissident usama bin ladin bin ladin the independentlyfinanced leader of broad terrorist coalition receives safehaven in afghanistan and thus far in 1998 he has been outspoken in support of attacks on us troops in the middle east the administration contends it has convincing evidence that bin ladins network was involved in the august 7 1998 bombings of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania prompting august 20 military action against his bases in afghanistan his officiallysanctioned presence in afghanistan could lead that country at some point to be placed on the us list of state sponsors of terrorism us policy to counter middle eastern terrorism operates on several different levels us counterterrorism policy has generally been directed against state sponsors which are readily identifiable targets problem for us policy has been how to coordinate us counterterrorism policies with those of us allies most allied governments believe that engaging these countries diplomatically might sometimes be more effective than trying to isolate or punish them but us officials believe that economic and political pressure against states sponsoring terrorism has made some of these states more cautious in recent executive orders and legislation the administration and congress have stepped up efforts to directly pressure terrorists and terrorist groups some of which obtain support and funding from persons living in the united states in october 1997 under 1996 antiterrorism law the administration formally named 30 groups half of which are middle eastern as terrorist groups barring them from having presence in the united states the august 20 1998 military strikes on bin ladins network suggests that military action might play an increasing role in us efforts to combat individual terrorist groups contents introduction 1 groups 2 radical islamic groups 3 hizballah party of god 4 hizballahs broader

eastern terrorist groups and the middle eastern countries on the us terrorism list1 the report also discusses us unilateral and multilateral efforts during the previous year to combat middle eastern terrorism this analysis draws extensively from the state departments annual report on international terrorism entitled patterns of global terrorism 1997 state department publication 10535 released april 1998 the report uses number of additional sources including conversations with us counterterrorism officials experts investigative journalists and foreign diplomats middle eastern terrorist groups and their state sponsors have been the focus of us counterterrorism policies for several decades since the 1970s many of the major acts of terrorism against americans and us targets have been conducted by middle eastern groups or states according to the state departments report on international terrorism for 1997 subsequently referred to as patterns 1997 the middle east in 1997 witnessed some of the worlds most deadly acts of terrorism including the most lethal act of terrorism ever committed in egypt luxor few us citizens were killed and wounded in acts of terrorism in jerusalem in 1997 but these casualties were few compared to 19962 in june of that year the us military complex near dhahran saudi arabia was bombed killing 19 us airmen major antipeace process bombings in israel appear to have declined since september 1997 however the august 7 1998 bombings of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania which the united states asserts was conducted by middle east terrorist network killed over 250 people including 12 americans this network has threatened future acts of terrorism against the united states even after us military action of august 20 1998 five out of the seven states currently on the us terrorism list are middle eastern iran iraq syria libya and sudan the other two are cuba and north korea which will not be covered in this report terrorism list countries are often referred to in policy literature as synonymous with the term rogue states although 1 each year under the provisions of section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 as amended 50 usc 2405j the secretary of commerce in consultation with the secretary of state provides congress with list of countries that support international terrorism 2 in 1997 worldwide the number of terrorist attacks 304 continued to be relatively low and the casualties 221 dead and 693 wounded were lower than in 1996 314 dead and 2912 wounded crs2 there is agreed definition of what constitutes rogue state for example syria is not generally considered rogue state in part because it has participated in peace talks with israel patterns 1997 said iran remains the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 1997 but the report only covered few months of the presidency of mohammad khatemi in iran patterns 1997 characterizes sudan and syria as primarily harboring terrorist groups and training camps rather than actively perpetrating terrorism and iraq is described more as potential than an active terrorist threat patterns 1997 as did patterns 1996 credits syria with taking some steps to restrain terrorist groups groups middle eastern terrorist groups and state sponsors differ in their motivations objectives ideologies and levels of activity the radical islamic groups appear to be the most active stating as their main objectives the overthrow of secular prowestern middle eastern governments the derailment of the arabisraeli peace process or the ouster of us forces from the persian gulf and middle east many of the older palestinian groups founded in the 1960s and 1970s are leftist and nationalist in orientation and have become less active than they were decade ago nonetheless they share with their islamic counterparts opposition to peace with israel and to us influence in the middle east other leftist groups such as the kurdistan workers party pkk fight for much different causes such as the formation of separate ethnically based states or the overthrow of incumbent regimes the table below shows the fifteen middle eastern groups named by the state department on october 8 1997 as foreign terrorist organizations ftos pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 1041323 the first twelve of the groups listed were also named in president clintons january 23 1995 executive order 12947 as antipeace process terrorist groups these twelve have been redesignated every year since he listing of these groups blocks their assets in the united states and makes it criminal offense for us persons to provide material support or resources to them the january 23 1995 designation also bars us dealings with any individuals of those groups named as specially designated terrorists sdts two groups not on the october 8 1997 fto list below are discussed in this report the palestine liberation organization plo is included because of the debate over whether or not the palestinian authority pa headed by plo leader yasir arafat is taking sufficient steps to prevent terrorism by other groups in areas under its control another group discussed here the veterans of the afghan conflict refers to loose network of radical islamic fighters who battled the soviet occupation of afghanistan the terrorist network headed by saudi exile usama bin ladin is loosely organized and diffuse perhaps explaining why it was not originally included in the january 23 1995 or october 8 1997 terrorist group designations however on august 20 1998 president clinton issued an executive 3 fifteen other groups not considered middle eastrelated were also designated as ftos at that time crs3 order that had the effect of adding the bin ladin network to the list of middle eastern terrorist groups designated in january 1995 under executive order 12947 middle eastern terrorist groups october 8 1997 fto designation group descriptionlevel of activity hizballah

particularly the seizure of the us embassy in tehran in november of that year radical islam has attracted widespread press attention as the driving ideology of the most active middle eastern terrorist groups and state sponsors of the fifteen middle eastern terrorist groups named in the october 8 1997 state department designation six are radical islamic organizations hamas palestinian islamic jihad hizballah the armed islamic group and egypts islamic group and jihad the veterans of the afghan conflict led by crs4 usama bin ladin are perceived as an increasingly significant radical islamic threat the following provides information on the objectives activities external ties and strength of the islamist groups hizballah party of god4 hizballah founded in 1982 by lebanese shiite clerics imbued with the islamic revolutionary ideology of irans ayatollah khomeini has long record of violence against israel and the west especially the united states the organizations initial goal was to establish an islamic republic in lebanon as part of broader regionwide islamic republic more recently perhaps in recognition that such goal may be unattainable hizballah has focused on attempting to derail the arabisraeli peace process or at the very least to try to end israels control over six to ten mile deep security zone in mostly shiite musliminhabited southern lebanon during the 1980s hizballah was principal sponsor of antiwestern and particularly antius terrorism it is known or suspected to have been involved in suicide truck bombings of the us embassy april 1983 the us marine barracks october 1983 killing 220 marine 18 navy and 3 army personnel and the us embassy annex september 1984 all in beirut it also hijacked twa flight 847 in 1985 killing navy diver robert stethem who was on board and it was responsible for the detention of most if not all us and western hostages held in lebanon during the 1980s and early 1990s eighteen americans were held hostage in lebanon of which three were killed on june 5 1998 hizballahs leader denied the group was linked to the marine barracks bombing or the holding of hostages but he said he supported the marine bombing the perpetrators of which have not been found recent patterns reports have said hizballah was responsible for march 17 1992 bombing of israels embassy in buenos aires hizballah did not claim responsibility for the attack outright but it released surveillance tape of the embassy implying responsibility in may 1998 the fbi told argentina it believes that hizballah working with iranian diplomats was also responsible for the july 18 1994 bombing of the argentinejewish mutual association building in buenos aires that left nearly 100 dead5 during visit to south america in may 1998 fbi director louis freeh said hizballah is suspected of building support network in brazil at the triborder area with neighboring argentina and paraguay6 hizballah retains terrorism infrastructure in lebanon the broader middle east and overseas but it is not known to have conducted any terrorist attacks in 1997 or thus far in 1998 however it has continued to conduct surveillance of the us embassy in lebanon and its personnel according to patterns 1997 4 for further information on hizballah see hizballah radical militia in lebanon by kenneth katzman crs report 93905 oct 7 1993 more recent version of that report was

in 94 washington post august 8 1998 6 diderich joelle fbi suspects hizbollah network in s america reuters may 13 1998 crs5 hizballahs focus for the past few years has been on military operations against israel in march and april 1996 an escalation of hizballah attacks on israeli forces in lebanon including rocket attacks on northern israel prompted an israeli counteroffensive operation grapes of wrath during april 1127 1996 hizballahs several thousand fighters are increasingly adopting more conventional and more effective military attacks against israel resulting in greater israeli losses and fewer hizballah casualties hizballahs new tactics have prompted growing sentiment in israel to withdraw completely from lebanon and the israeli cabinet voted in april 1998 to withdraw if lebanon guarantees the security of lebanons northern border lebanon and hizballah have refused to offer such guarantees on the other hand hizballah and israel conducted major swap of prisoners and remains in june 1998 israel returned 40 corpses of lebanese guerrillas and released 60 lebanese prisoners in exchange for the remains of an israeli soldier itamar ilya one of the hizballah corpses returned was that of of hizballahs leader hasan nasrallah it should be noted that the united states does not consider hizballahs military operations against israeli or israels proxy forces in southern lebanon as terrorism but rather as military action israeli observers say they believe although they are not certain that hizballah has acquired from iran usmade stinger antiaircraft weapons7 if hizballah has the weapon it has not yet used it against israeli aircraft and it is not clear that hizballah is able to maintain the weapon hizballah also is increasingly focused on political activities in lebanon hizballah may be positioning itself to survive if there is peace agreement between israel and syria and lebanon although an agreement does not appear imminent hizballah holds seven seats plus three allies in lebanons 128 seat national assembly elected in september 1996 down from eight seats and four allies in the previous assembly hizballah has not accepted any cabinet positions but it does meet with members of lebanons other sects and factions including traditionally dominant christians whom it previously shunned other reports indicate that hizballah is increasingly involving itself in the tourism businesses as means of earning revenue and softening its terrorist image and it continues to provide social services for poor lebanese not adequately served by the government hizballahs broader connections hizballah maintains active connections with likeminded groups in october 1997 hizballah publicly admitted training hamas militants in lebanon8 saudi and bahraini investigations of antiregime unrest have revealed the existence of local chapters of hizballah composed of radical shiite muslims many of whom have studied in irans theological seminaries and received terrorist training in lebanon saudi officials apparently believe that one such organization in saudi arabia saudi hizballah was responsible for the june 25 1996 bombing of the khobar towers housing complex for us military personnel 7 israel says hizbollah may have stinger missiles reuters may 18 1997 8 hizbollah says training hamas militants in lebanon reuters october 3 1997 crs6 near dhahran saudi arabia9 similar organization in kuwait kuwaiti hizballah in 1996 allegedly assisted its allies in bahrain by smuggling weapons to bahrain according to patterns 1996 kuwaiti hizballah may also be engaged in activities directed against the us military presence in the gulf10 according to patterns 1997 bahraini courts in march 1997 sentenced to jail 36 individuals for being members of the proiranian bahrain hizballah organization factions of these gulfstate hizballah organizations were active in the early 1980s under other names such as the dawa islamic call party in kuwait the islamic front for the liberation of bahrain and the organization for the islamic revolution in the arabian peninsula saudi arabia wide variety of press reporting indicates that iranian diplomats posted in lebanon syria sudan and elsewhere abroad provide logistical or other support to hizballahs foreign cells in north america south america africa and europe some of these diplomats were holders of the us embassy hostages in tehran during 19798111 in july 1998 iran appointed one of the leaders of the hostage holders hossein sheikholeslam as ambassador to syria sheikholeslam has been an avowed supporter of the export of the islamic revolution and of hizballah then secretary of state christopher said on may 21 1996 that iran gives hizballah about 100 million per year patterns 1997 says iran which backs hizballah with several hundred revolutionary guards stationed in lebanon continues to give hizballah substantial amounts of weapons explosives and organizational aid as well however iran reportedly wants hizballah to become more selfsufficient financially and according to patterns 1997 hizballah might occasionally conduct operations not approved by tehran many observers believe syria which has substantial military and intelligence presence in lebanon indirectly supports or authorizes antiisrael operations by hizballah and patterns 1997 repeats its previous assertions that syria has not acted to stop antiisraeli attacks by hizballah and palestinian rejectionist groups in southern lebanon syria also permits iran to supply weapons to hizballah through the international airport in damascus specially designated terrorists sdts12 hizballahs secretary general hasan nasrallah has been named specially designated terrorist sdt designation made pursuant to president clintons january 23 1995 executive order 12947 on middle eastern terrorism an sdt is person found to pose significant risk of disrupting the middle east peace process or to have materially supported acts of violence toward that end under the executive order the designation means that 9 conversations with saudi and us officials during 199697 one suspect in the bombing hani abd alrahim alsayegh has admitted being member of saudi hizballah but denies role in the bombing he was apprehended in canada in march 1997 and deported to the united states on june 18 1997 but subsequently refused to cooperate with the fbi

years nasrallah is believed to be close ally of irans former president ali akbar hashemirafsanjani other hizballah figures named as sdts are imad mughniyah the 36 year old hizballah intelligence officer and alleged holder of some western hostages in the 1980s shaykh muhammad hussein fadlallah the 60 year old senior shiite cleric and leading spiritual figure of hizballah and subhi tufayli the 49 year old former hizballah secretary general who leads radical breakaway faction of hizballah members in lebanon tufaylis followers clashed with the lebanese army in late january 1998 hamas and palestinian islamic jihad hamas islamic resistance movement and palestinian islamic jihad13 are sunni islamist palestinian groups based in the west bank and gaza strip palestinian islamic jihad pij which was formed in 1979 and remains almost purely guerrilla organization appears internally united in its opposition to territorial or political compromise with israel hamas which was formed by muslim brotherhood activists during the palestinian uprising intifadah in 1987 received significant political boost in october 1997 when its founder shaykh ahmad yassin was released from prison by israel see box on yassin the charismatic yassin serves as bridge between hamas two main components the radicals that conduct terrorist attacks primarily through clandestine wing the izz addin alqassam brigades and the more pragmatic elements affiliated with hamas social services charity and educational institutions according to press reports some hamas pragmatists have held talks with palestinian authority presidentplo leader yasir arafat and are open to working with him and to eventual compromise with israel but hamas as whole opposes arafat and the current peace process with israel both hamas and pij have refused arafats recent offers to join the palestinian authority administration us officials say palestinian islamic jihad is politically closer to iran than is hamas although both groups are said by the state department to receive funds several million dollars per year and possibly military training from iran both groups also have offices in syria and sudan as well as closely monitored and controlled presence in jordan pij receives some limited aid from syria as well according to patterns 1997 hamas reportedly receives funding from wealthy private benefactors in the persian gulf monarchies and us officials say from residents of the united states and western europe many individual donors however appear to believe their contributions go to charitable activities for poor palestinians served by hamas social services network and are not being used for terrorism 13 palestinian islamic jihad should not be confused with islamic jihad which is name often used by elements of hizballah in the conduct of terrorist or military operations or with jihad the egyptian group which is sometimes called egyptian islamic jihad or egyptian jihad crs8 patterns 1997 as have previous patterns reports characterizes hamas strength as an unknown number of hardcore members and tens of thousands of supporters and sympathizers and pijs strength as unknown an independent poll conducted in palestiniancontrolled areas in june 1998 gives hamas the support of 14 of palestinians in the gaza strip and 11 in the west bank up from about 10 in these areas last year14 pij which does not operate openly registers the support of about 3 up from 2 last year these poll outcomes although not much different from the year earlier results suggest that support for hamas might grow if the peace process between israel and the palestinians continues to falter hamas and pij have not targeted the united states directly although pij has threatened to do so some american citizens have died in attacks for which these groups have claimed responsibility five out of the 65 killed in four hamaspij bombings in israel february 25 march 4 1996 were american citizens these bombings had the apparent effect of shifting public opinion toward benjamin netanyahu in israeli national elections on may 29 1996 possibly proving decisive in his election victory as prime minister since then march 21 1997 hamas bombing in tel aviv conducted three days after israel broke ground on jewish settlement in east jerusalem killed three israelis and the bomber on july 30 1997 hamas suicide bombers killed 16 including us citizen and wounded 178 in jerusalem on september 4 1997 three hamas suicide bombers killed 5 plus themselves including us citizen about 181 were wounded in that bombing in jerusalems ben yehuda pedestrian mall there have been known major hamaspij terrorist attacks since then although some potential attacks since then have been thwarted in advance by israeli andor palestinian security forces shaykh yassin said hamas had nothing to do with an august 27 1998 bombing in tel aviv that injured about 20 people however the bombing came one day after yassin said hamas would attack israel in retaliation for the august 20 us strikes on the bin ladin network us connections some observers allege that hamas has an extensive fundraising and political apparatus in the united states working from seemingly innocent religious and research institutions and investment companies15 others have challenged this view saying that most american organizations that agree with hamas philosophy oppose the use of violence and are exercising free speech in july 1995 the united states detained in new york suspected hamas leader musa abu marzuq who had lived in falls church virginia until early 1994 he received permanent resident alien status in 1990 and allegedly was involved in fundraising for hamas in the united states in april 1997 israel dropped its request for his

with israel in may 1997 jordan accepted his deportation to amman where abu marzuq is closely watched but under legal restrictions pij is led by ramadan abdullah shallah about 40 years old who previously was an adjunct professor at the university of south florida he ran an islamic studies institute affiliated with the university called the world and islam studies enterprise wise the university severed its connection to wise in june 1995 few months before shallah was chosen to head pij following the assassination of his predecessor fathi alshiqaqi some have alleged that shallah used wise to raise money for pij and to invite alleged islamic radicals to the united states for conferences16 the united states has blocked the assets of some alleged hamaspij leaders according to treasury department report to congress for 1997 the office of foreign assets control has blocked two accounts belonging to hamas and pij leaders under president clintons january 23 1995 executive order on middle east terrorism as of the end of 1997 total of about 675000 in hamas assets in the united states mostly real estate were blocked as were pij bank accounts totalling about 18000 pij leader shallah had control over these accounts17 on june 9 1998 the department of justice announced it had seized about 14 million in cash and property in the united states from suspected hamas activist mohammad salah and the quranic literary institute sdts several hamas and pij activists have been named as sdts they include ramadan abdullah shallah pij musa abu marzuq hamas abd alaziz awda

founder hamas born in 1937 in ashkelon shaykh yassin is the founder and undisputed leader of hamas yassin is blind nearly deaf and confined to wheelchair since an accident in his youth he was refugee in the shati camp in gaza after the 1948 arabisraeli war and in the 1950s he joined the islamic fundamentalist muslim brotherhood organization he worked as teacher and preacher in gaza after israel captured the gaza strip in 1967 in 1973 yassin founded the islamic center in gaza which soon controlled all muslim religious institutions there and he founded gazas islamic society after the 1979 islamic revolution in iran during this period israel allowed yassin access to israeli media through which he openly criticized yasir arafat and the plo he founded hamas after the intifadah uprising took hold in 1988 israel arrested yassin in 1989 and sentenced him to life imprisonment for allegedly issuing orders to kidnap and kill two israeli soldiers israel released him from prison in october 1997 under compromise with jordan and he returned to his home in gaza the deal followed failed israeli attempt to assassinate another hamas leader khalid mishal in amman arafat visited yassin after his release although the two are considered rivals in the past yassin has advocated the establishment of an islamic state in all of what was palestine immediately after his release yassin suggested that terrorist attacks against israel could end if israel made substantial concessions however during februaryjune 1998 yassin visited several arab and islamic countries raising money and vowing that military operations against israel would continue until all of what was palestine is liberated yassin said the united states brought upon itself the august 7 1998 embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania because of its imposition of sanctions and sieges on muslim countries in africa such as libya and sudan he denied hamas involvement interspersed with medical treatment in egypt yassin was received at high levels in sudan yemen saudi arabia qatar kuwait uae iran and syria he reportedly received millions of dollars 50 to 300 million in financial pledges from saudi arabia and iran and kuwait said it would allow hamas to open an office there in syria he was permitted to meet with leaders of other antipeace process groups israel allowed yassin to return to gaza after his tours since his release and the tours yassins popularity among palestinians has grown but he is still less popular than arafat according to palestinian observers source abu toameh khaled the sheikhs progress the jerusalem report july 20 1998 palestine facts website crs11 the islamic group and jihad the egyptian oppositionist islamic group and its ally aljihad18 seek to replace egypts prowestern secular government with an islamic state although they have different operational leaders both groups recognize as their spiritual leader shaykh umar abd alrahman an egyptian cleric who is currently in prison in new york following his october 1995 conviction for planning terrorist conspiracies in the new york area19 improved security measures as well as some limited economic reforms and improvement have reduced the groups opposition activities in egypt since 1995 to the point at which some of the groups leaders inside egypt have said they are observing an undeclared truce with the egyptian government since january 1998 however the militant leaders outside egypt have rejected any compromises and have been able to orchestrate several high profile attacks the islamic group claimed responsibility for an attack that nearly succeeded in killing president mubarak during his visit to ethiopia on june 26 1995 it also claimed responsibility for an april 18 1996 attack that killed 18 greek tourists who were mistaken for israelis two gunmen professing support for aljihad killed nine german tourists and their egyptian busdriver outside the national antiquities museum in cairo on september 18 1997 the islamic group claimed responsibility for the most lethal terrorist attack ever in egypt the november 17 1997 attack on tourists in the valley of the kings near luxor gunmen killed 58 tourists and wounded 26 others and themselves committed suicide or were killed by egyptian security forces the militants left at the scene leaflet calling for the release from prison of shaykh abd alrahman the islamic group and aljihad formed in the early 1970s as offshoots of the muslim brotherhood which opted to work within the political system after being crushed by former president gamal abd alnasser the leaders of these groups particularly abd alrahman have said relatively little about how they would conduct egypts relations with israel if they were to come to power however the clinton administration congress and most observers assume that egyptianisraeli peace and the arabisraeli peace process would be set back severely if the radical islamist groups came to power in egypt the islamic group recruits and builds support openly in poor neighborhoods in cairo alexandria and throughout southern egypt running social service programs and distributing charity it also conducts attacks against local security officials banks western tourists egyptian copts and other perceived symbols of western culture and foreign influence previously the islamic group has attempted to

french is the most radical of islamic factions fighting to establish an islamic state in algeria but the gia is highly fragmented25 the gia composed partly of algerian islamic guerrillas who fought in afghanistan formed as breakaway faction of the islamic salvation front fis in 1992 after the regime cancelled the second round of parliamentary elections on fears of an fis victory according to patterns 1997 the gia has killed 133 expatriates in algeria mostly europeans since 1992 but the number of foreigners killed in 1997 was seven slight decline from nine in 1996 and substantial drop from 31 in 1995 apparently frustrated by the regimes efforts to combat the gia some of its top commanders have been killed by algerian security forces the gia has shifted its strategy somewhat over the past eighteen months the gia and other groups have conducted campaign of civilian massacres sometimes wiping out entire villages in their areas of operations the gia has conducted these civilian attacks to intimidate rival factions including the fis and to demonstrate that the government lacks control over the country the gia conducted its most lethal terrorist attack on december 31 1997 when it killed 400 algerian civilians in town 150 miles southwest of algiers according to patterns 1997 the massacres represent one of the worlds most serious domestic terrorist threats although it should be noted that renegade elements of the regimes security forces and other opposition groups have also conducted civilian massacres according to us officials the gia or factions within it also allegedly committed at least some of the bombings in algeria that were intended to disrupt june 5 1997 parliamentary elections the gia has undertaken operations outside algeria it hijacked an air france flight

ideological differences have not prevented the nonislamist groups from working with the islamist organizations against the peace process despite such cooperation recent patterns reports indicate that the leftwing and nationalist groups are less active in international terrorism than they were in the 1970s and 1980s and are far less active than are the radical islamist groups the apparent decline of the leftwing and nationalist terrorist groups might be attributed to decreased support from some state sponsors particularly libya and syria as well as the loss of superpower soviet patronage and the rise of islamic political ideology that ideology has tended to eclipse the secular ideology of the leftwing and nationalist groups 31 sayyid nosair radical islamist associated with shaykh abd

come into full compliance with their commitments to israel critics including many in congress maintain that recent patterns and plo commitments compliance reports are too lenient they note that the pa has released suspected terrorists such as hamas leader ibrahim makdameh march 1997 and has failed to arrest others they add that arafat has continued to make occasional public statements that armed

in italy after us aircraft forced down the egyptian airliner flying them to safehaven crs24 abu abbas who was not on board the ship during the hijacking was released by the italian government but was later sentenced in absentia warrant for his arrest is still outstanding in italy the four other plf hijackers were tried convicted and sentenced in italy as result of the incident the tunisian government expelled the plf and it relocated to baghdad on may 30 1990 plf members unsuccessfully attempted seaborne landing from libya on tel aviv beach arafat refused to condemn the attempt and as consequence the united states broke off its dialogue with the plo which had begun in 1988 the plf has become less active to the point at which israel reportedly longer considers it major terrorist threat the group is not believed to have undertaken major terrorist operation since failed raid on the israeli sea resort town of eilat in may 1992 abbas originally opposed the plos decision to support the madrid peace process in october 1991 but he now supports the pa and says armed struggle should be used only if the peace process fails in april 1996 he voted to amend the plo charter to eliminate clauses calling for israels destruction in april 1998 israel allowed him to relocate to the gaza strip from baghdad although the plf maintains an office in baghdad and receives some iraqi support the plf has received libyan support in the past according to patterns 1997 sdts abu abbas who was born the year israel was founded 1948 has been named as an sdt he was inspired by the cuban revolution and the vietcong and underwent guerrilla training in the soviet union39 according to administration officials in 1996 the justice department dropped warrant for his arrest because it believed there was insufficient evidence against him on april 30 1996 the senate voted 990 on resolution sres253 seeking abu abbas detention and extradition to the united states abu nidal organization ano also known as the fatah revolutionary council the abu nidal organization was created in 1974 when its founder abu nidal his real name is sabri albanna broke with the plo after plo leader yasir arafat restricted plo terrorist activities to targets within israel or the occupied territories40 abu nidal has targeted terrorist attacks against any who accept compromise whether they are israelis plo officials or moderate arab states the abu nidal organization has been far less active in the 1990s than it was in the 1970s and 1980s possibly because of abu nidals reported health problems cancer and heart condition splits within the organization friction with state sponsors and clashes in southern lebanon and elsewhere with arafat loyalists since its formation the abu nidal organization has carried out over 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries killing or injuring almost 900 people one of its most wellknown operations was dec 27 1985 attack at airports in rome and vienna in which 18 died

enforcement authorities other nonislamist organizations two other groups not attempting to derail the arabisraeli peace process or spread irans islamic revolution have purpose of influencing the domestic politics of their countries of origin one group the peoples mojahedin organization of iran pmoi is working against the regime in iran kurdistan workers party pkk the pkk established in 1974 is marxistleninist group composed of kurds41 seeking to establish an independent marxist state in southeastern turkey where there is predominantly kurdish population the pkk generally targets government forces and civilians in eastern turkey but it attacked turkish diplomatic and commercial facilities in several western european cities in 1993 and 1995 with an estimated 10000 to 15000 fulltime and 60000 to 75000 parttime guerrillas the pkk has recently moved beyond rural insurgent operations to somewhat increased use of urban terrorism although most assessments indicate that turkey is successfully containing the pkk insurgency since 1995 the turkish military has conducted several major 41 for more information on the pkk see turkeys kurdish imbroglio and us policy by carol

benefit from us support crs26 and numerous minor incursions into northern iraq in attempts to eliminate pkk bases there the pkk and its leader abdullah ocalan receive safehaven in and modest aid from syria iraq and iran according to patterns 1997 abdullah ocalan who is not named as an sdt is about 50 years old he was student in political science at ankara university during 196678 where he formed his ideas on kurdish nationalism42 the peoples mojahedin organization of iran pmoi the peoples mojahedin organization of iran pmoi the largest organization within broader national council of resistance ncr has leftwing roots but unlike the pkk it is not composed of an ethnic minority it is working to try to overthrow the clerical regime in iran just as it previously sought to bring down the shah of iran despite its leftist past the group asserts that it is committed to free markets and democracy should it achieve power in iran and it publicly supports the arabisraeli peace process and the rights of irans minorities in late october 1994 the state department issued congressionallymandated report on the organization asserting that the pmois assets in iran and iraqbased military wing do not pose serious challenge to the regime in iran43 the group itself acknowledges that it is not close to achieving power in iran but it claims to have substantial support inside iran state department mistrust of the group is based on the groups killing of several us military officers and civilians during the struggle against the shah its support for the takeover of the us embassy in tehran in 1979 its authoritarian internal structure and its use of iraq as base for its several thousand strong military wing the national liberation army although the pmoi is opposed to regime in tehran that has been consistently identified as the most aggressive state sponsor of terrorism the state department has named the pmoi as terrorist group because of its attacks on iranian diplomatic facilities and its antiregime operations inside iran its attacks in iran sometimes result in the deaths of iranian civilians although it does not appear to purposely target civilians the administration condemned pmoi terrorist attack against revolutionary court in tehran the bombing killed 3 and wounded several others many members of congress disagree with the state departments refusal to meet with the group and believe the pmoi could constitute viable and preferred alternative to the iranian regime middle eastern state sponsors the administration and congress have devoted substantial time and attention to pressuring state sponsors to end their support for terrorist groups in some cases 42 interview with abdullah ocalan by michael gunter middle east quarterly june 1998

countries support for international terrorism however there appears to be broad agreement within the administration and congress that none of the five middle eastern terrorism list states iran iraq libya sudan and syria yet merit consideration for removal from the list44 these five along with afghanistan have also been named for the past two years as countries not cooperating fully with us antiterrorism efforts pursuant to section 40a of the arms export control act under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 which established this list countries so designated are ineligible to purchase items on the us munitions list45 as noted above afghanistans placement on the noncooperative list might signal that it is being considered for designation to the terrorism list itself however the united states does not recognize the taliban movement as the legitimate government of afghanistan and might therefore assert that the taliban does not have sufficient control over the country to be considered state sponsor of terrorism however the taliban movement has firm control over the areas in afghanistan in which bin ladin is headquartered qandahar is the political seat of the taliban other countries such as lebanon or yemen have not been placed on the terrorism list because their governments are perceived as unable to control areas where terrorists are operating the five terrorism list countries like the groups they reportedly sponsor differ in their objectives and their degree of involvement in terrorism iran and sudan support paramilitary and terrorist groups to promote their antiwestern radical islamic ideology and oppose the arabisraeli peace process syria is led by an authoritarian nationalist and secular government that appears to support terrorist groups as levers against israel and other neighbors including turkey and jordan iraq has used terrorism mostly to strike at people or institutions that contributed to iraqs defeat in the gulf war or that implement international sanctions against iraq in some cases such as that of iran the state sponsor might be directly involved in planning and executing terrorist attacks often using its own agents in other cases such as syria the state sponsor might harbor terrorist groups and provide them with level of support that is often difficult to determine precisely the following sections analyze the terrorism support activities and objectives of the five middle eastern countries currently designated by the secretary of state under section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 50 usc app 2405j as having repeatedly provided state support for international terrorism 44 removal from the list requires advance notification to the house international relations committee the senate foreign relations committee and the senate banking committee each of the current chairs of those committees representative benjamin gilman senator jesse helms and senator alfonse damato has been highly critical of the terrorism list states and has opposed closer us relations with virtually all of them 45 the countries currently on this noncooperative list are already ineligible for such purchases under other statutes or us decisions crs28 iran46 the may 1997 election of mohammad khatemi as irans president could mark key turning point in irans support of terrorism if he can gain firm control over irans military and security services that have contributed to iraniansponsored terrorism khatemi and his allies resent irans image as terrorist state and appear to want to further erode irans isolation in formulation similar to that of the past few years patterns 1997 asserts that iran is the most active state sponsor of international terrorism however suggesting optimism about khatemis presidency us officials noted when patterns 1997 was released that khatemi was in office for only five months covered in the report for 1997 in contrast to patterns reports over the past few years patterns 1997 credits irans new leadership with condemning some terrorist attacks including the luxor incident of november 1997 see above and anti regime violence in algeria the report noted that khatemi in january 7 1998 cable news network interview agreed that terrorist attacks against noncombatants should be condemned iran condemned the august 7 us embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania but supreme leader ali khamenei also condemned the august 20 us airstrikes as well as the embassy bombings at the same time although major terrorist attacks have been linked to iran since khatemi took office iran continues its support for the terrorist groups discussed above as receiving iranian assistance khatemi as well as more hardline leaders have expressed public support for hamas and hizbollah in what iran calls their struggle against israeli occupation and shaykh yassin was warmly received by iranian leaders including khatemi during his visit to tehran in may 1998 khatemis public statements might be intended to defuse criticism from his opponents who believe he might try to sell out the principles of the islamic revolution patterns 1997 says that iran has continued to attack antiregime dissidents based in iraq and in the fall of 1997 hosted conference of peace process rejectionist groups the primary targets of this direct form of iranian terrorism are pmoi officials and iranian kurdish leaders there have been number of developments in cases of past incidents of iranian sponsored terrorism on april 10 1997 german court determined that irans leaders

khatemi maintain that because ayatollah khomeini is longer alive they cannot lift the sentence some iranian officials have said iran has intention of sending assassination squads to europe to implement the sentence but they have refused to make such pledge in writing to the european union irans government has refused to pressure private iranian group with links to the regime the 15th khordad foundation to withdraw its offer of 25 million for the murder of rushdie key question is whether or not iran is determined by the united states and saudi arabia to have been directly involved in the june 1996 khobar towers investigation the most recent press reports about the saudi investigation of the bombing indicate that the saudis believe that iran had role in the bombing working through dissident saudi shiites however the investigation is ongoing according to us officials and earlier reports suggested bin ladins network might have been involved for further information see crs

process has not acted to stop antiisrael attacks by hizballah and palestinian rejectionist groups in southern lebanon the assumption of this assertion is that syria with about 35000 troops in lebanon could limit violence against israel by these groups if it chose to do so suggesting that preserving its alliance with iran is one syrian motivation syria allows iran to resupply hizballah through the

noted above syria warmly welcomed hamas founder shaykh yassin in may 1998 and allowed him to meet there with radical palestinian and hizballah leaders however patterns 1997 notes that syria sometimes acts to restrain the activities of some of the groups it harbors suggesting it views these groups as tool of its foreign policy some observers have alleged that syria had foreknowledge of the june 1996 khobar towers bombing49 these allegations are based largely on the unexplained death of one of the suspects jafar shuwaykat while he was in syrian custody saudi investigators reportedly believe that equipment for that bomb resembles that used by hizballah and was brought into saudi arabia from lebanon via syria and jordan syria maintains that peace process rejectionist groups are fighting israeli occupation of palestinian land and of south lebanon and are not violating any syrian laws and will not be expelled syrian officials contend that when comprehensive peace with israel is achieved terrorist groups will disband for lack of support libya50 partly in response to international sanctions libya has attempted to appear responsive while avoiding real concessions to international demands on its alleged involvement in the bombings of pan am flight 103 december 21 1988 as well as the 1989 bombing of french airliner uta flight 772 over niger the pan am incident

resolutions prohibit air travel into and out of libya or arms transfers to that country resolution 748 and freeze libyan assets and prohibit the sale to libya of petroleumrelated equipment resolution 883 libya has made proposals to try the two accused agents in third country courts but these proposals were widely perceived as libyan efforts to forestall handing over the two intelligence agents on august 24 1998 the clinton administration said it would accept compromise under which the pan am 103 suspects are tried at court in the netherlands but using scottish judges and legal procedures the administration said most of the pan am victims families favored the compromise but some criticized it as an abandonment of us demands that the suspects be tried in britain or the united states

july 1996 to investigate the uta 772 bombing according to patterns 1997 the french investigation concluded that qadhafis brotherinlaw and intelligence operative muhammad alsanusi masterminded the bombing in late 1998 or in 1999 french criminal court is expected to begin trial in absentia of six libyan suspects in the uta bombing all of whom are intelligence officers some of libyan leader muammar qadhafis actions suggest he has not abandoned support for terrorism as an instrument of libyan foreign policy although qadhafi faces an islamist threat to his regime in libya qadhafi has urged radical islamic rejectionists of the arabisraeli peace process to use all necessary means to oppose it and he has hailed some of their acts of terrorism as courageous libya provides some support for pij according to patterns 1997 in general however libya is closer politically and ideologically to the leftwing nationalist palestinian groups and it provides safehaven and some assistance to the abu nidal organization which is headquartered in libya it also provides financial assitance to the pflpgc in october 1996 german authorities issued warrants for four libyans believed to be in libya who are suspected of initiating the april 5 1986 bombing of berlin nightclub belle disco that attack killed two us military personnel and turkish woman and triggered us military retaliatory raid on tripoli and benghazi ten days after the incident in november 1997 germany began trial of 5 other defendants in the attack sudan51 sudan since 1996 has appeared to be primarily passive sponsor of terrorism although it shows some signs of being an active sponsor by protecting known terrorists and groups allowing them to meet in sudan and permitting iran to funnel assistance to them groups present in sudan include the abu nidal organization hamas palestinian islamic jihad and hizballah both president umar hassan bashir and islamist leader hassan alturabi warmly welcomed shaykh yassin when he visited in may 1998 and formally allowed him to open hamas office in khartoum egypt has accused sudan of harboring the egyptian opposition islamic group and jihad and algeria has made the same charge in regard to its opposition armed islamic group and islamic salvation front sudan also supports opposition and insurgent groups in uganda tunisia ethiopia and eritrea according to patterns 1997 sudanese officials see these organizations as freedom fighters and say there is reason to expel them from sudan sudan has refused to comply with three security council resolutions 1044 of january 31 1996 1054 of april 26 1996 and 1070 of august 16 1996 demanding it extradite the three islamic group suspects in the june 26 1995 assassination attempt against president mubarak during his visit to

sudans mission in new york are alleged to have facilitated or had ties to conspirators planning to bomb the united nations and other new york area targets in 1993 partly in response to sudans behavior on these issues the united states closed its embassy in khartoum in february 1996 although diplomatic relations were not broken the us ambassador to sudan has since worked out of the us embassy in kenya which was bombed on august 7 on the basis of sudans support for terrorism its efforts to destabilize its neighbors and its poor human rights record on november 3 1997 president clinton banned us trade with and investment in sudan on the other hand there are signs that sudans economic weakness and political isolation have left it susceptible to international pressure on the terrorism issue in august 1994 sudan turned over the terrorist carlos ilyich ramirez sanchez to france possibly in an effort to counter us charges that it harbors terrorists saudi and us pressure apparently contributed to sudans decision to expel usama bin ladin in may 1996 although some of his followers and business associates remain there as does his network of businesses according to us officials the united states said that bin ladin was associated financially with the alleged chemical plant in sudan that the united states attacked on august 20 1998 the chemical plant strike appeared to signal us belief that sudan approved of or was involved in the august 7 us embassy bombings or that it might be allowing the bin ladin network to try to field chemical weapons hassan alturabi52 the actions of sudans chief islamic leader hassan turabi who is about 67 complicate efforts to interpret sudans involvement in terrorism turabi whose only formal position is speaker of the national assembly sees himself as guide for sunni islamists in and outside sudan and he does not want to be overshadowed by the islamic revolution in iran using the informal base of his popular arab and islamic conference organization turabi hosts major conferences on islam in khartoum attended by members of radical islamic organizations throughout the region these conferences give the impression that turabi is trying to promote regionwide islamic revolution he reportedly continues to be politically and ideologically close to usama bin ladin even though turabi acquiesced in bin ladins expulsion from sudan in 1996 bin ladin sees turabi as mentor and an ideological source of inspiration on the other hand he has sometimes tried to broker reconciliation between radical islamic movements and secular incumbents for example between hamas and the plo he has had higher education in england and in france and is well spoken iraq53 usiraq differences over iraqs regional ambitions and its record of compliance with ceasefire requirements will probably keep iraq on the terrorism list as long as saddam husayn remains in power observers are virtually unanimous in assessing 52 some of the information in this section is

updated regularly by kenneth katzman crs33 iraqs record of compliance with its postwar obligations as poor and its human rights record as abysmal however international pressure on iraq on these broader issues appears to have constrained iraqs ability to use terrorism patterns 1997 reports that iraq is rebuilding its intelligence network but adds that there is evidence that iraq has directly participated in international terrorist attacks since 1993 since 1991 iraq has conducted attacks on its opponents in northern iraq such as members of the opposition iraqi national congress inc as well as some outside iraq and it organized failed assassination plot against former president bush during his april 1993 visit to kuwait the international terrorist groups that iraq harbors including the abu nidal organization abu abbas faction of the plf abbas family enjoys sanctuary in baghdad although abbas himself has been based in the gaza strip since april 1998 and terrorist bombmaker abu ibrahim are relatively small and inactive iraqs contacts with more prominent terrorist groups such as hamas and the pflp appear to be limited and iraq has traditionally enjoyed relatively good relations with yasir arafat and the plo arafat backed iraq during the iraniraq war and opposed military action to oust iraq from kuwait in 1991 in deference to arafat iraq refused to receive shaykh yassin during his tour of arab and islamic countries february june 1998 as lever in its relations with iran iraq continues to host the iranian opposition pmoi and the pmois army the national liberation army nla has bases in iraq near the border with iran however iraq apparently has reduced support for the group as iraqs relations with tehran have improved over the past two years pkk

counterterrorism policy there is universally agreed strategy either within the united states or between the united states and its middle eastern and european allies for countering middle eastern terrorism there are variety of options available to pressure terrorist groups and state sponsors although success often depends on bilateral multilateral or international cooperation with us efforts within the united states efforts to deter suspected middle eastern terrorist groups are constrained by concerns about the infringement of civil liberties and contradictions with longestablished immigration policies an exhaustive discussion of us efforts to combat middle eastern terrorism is beyond the scope of this paper but the following sections highlight key recent middle east counterterrorism initiatives and trends in the administration and in congress54 the us approach to middle eastern terrorism has tended to vary with different circumstances and allied perceptions although the united states has tracked and brought several individual middle eastern terrorists to justice us counterterrorism policy has tended to focus on pressuring state sponsors of terrorism in part because terrorists with state backing in the past have been better able to conduct operations than groups without state sponsorship to pressure middle eastern terrorist groups and their state sponsors the united states has employed combination of unilateral and multilateral measures which us officials maintain have succeeded in making state sponsors and their client groups more cautious military force on the few occasions when the united states has used military force against middle east sponsors of terrorism such action has been generally unilateral although us allies have often been the victims of middle eastern terrorism they appear to believe that military retaliation will inspire cycle of attack and reaction that might be difficult to control on some occasions us allies have provided some logistic and diplomatic support for us retaliatory attacks the us actions have almost always enjoyed strong congressional support major us attacks have taken place in retaliation for terrorist acts sponsored by libya and iraq on april 15 1986 the united states sent about 100 us aircraft to bomb military installations in libya the attack was in retaliation for the april 2 1986 bombing of berlin nightclub in which 2 us military personnel were killed president reagan announced that there was considerable evidence of libyan responsibility for that terrorist bombing on june 26 1993 the united states fired cruise missiles at the headquarters in baghdad of the iraqi intelligence service which allegedly sponsored failed assassination plot against former president george bush during his apr 1416 1993 visit to kuwait other us retaliation against iraq since 54 an extended discussion of us counterterrorism policy policy options and legislation is provided by crs issue brief 95112 terrorism the future and us foreign policy updated regularly by raphael perl crs35 1991 has been prompted by iraqi violations of ceasefire terms not related to terrorism the august 20 1998 cruise missile strikes against the bin ladin network represented us strike against group not state sponsor and did not have the approval of the taliban regime in afghanistan or its patron pakistan sudan vehemently protested the simultaneous us attack on the chemical plant in khartoum asserting it is only pharmaceutical manufacturing plant us military action against state sponsors of terrorism has had some effect on their support for terrorism although not necessarily complete or longlasting both saddam husayn and muammar qadhafi remained defiant of the united states after us military action against them libya was quiescent after the attack but it apparently returned to the use of terrorism in the december 1988 bombing of pan am 103 and the uta bombing the following year since the 1993 strike it has avoided attacking high profile us targets unilateral economic sanctions the united states has been willing to apply economic sanctions unilaterally to state sponsors of terrorism even though there is substantial disagreement among experts about the effectiveness of unilateral sanctions the listing of country as state sponsor of terrorism alone triggers wide range of us economic sanctions countries on the list are prohibited from receiving us foreign aid exportimport bank guarantees and sales of items on the us munitions control list us exports to terrorism list countries are subject to strict licensing requirements that generally prohibit exports of items that can have military applications such as advanced sensing computation or transportation equipment 55 placement on the us terrorism list does not automatically trigger total ban on trade with the united states however us trade ban is in effect for every middle eastern terrorism list state except syria under separate executive orders foreign aid appropriations bills over the past several years have barred any direct or indirect assistance to most states on the terrorism list however us contributions to most international programs have continued to flow because of administration waivers or specific agreements with nongovernmental organizations that us support would not benefit specific terrorism list countries section 327 of the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 building on identical provisions of previous foreign aid legislation amends the international financial institutions act 22 usc 262c et seq by requiring us representatives to international lending institutions such as the world bank to use the voice and vote of the united states to oppose loans to terrorism list states as shown in the table above the united states also tries to maintain some leverage over terrorism list states and groups by blocking some of their assets in the united states the august 20 executive order against the bin ladin network was intended to try to choke off bin 55 the above list of sanctions are under the following authorities section 6j of the export administration act as amended pl 9672 50 usc app 2405 j section 40 of the arms export control act as amended pl 90629 22 usc 2780 and section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended pl 87195 22 usc 2371 crs36 ladins sources of funding although us officials acknowledged that doing so would take substantial international cooperation it does not appear that unilateral us economic sanctions by themselves force major changes in the behavior of state sponsors of terrorism iraq expelled known terrorists and obtained removal from the list in 1982 but that removal was attributed by observers more to the merging of us and iraqi strategic interests in the early 1980s than to us pressure on terrorism iraq was reinstated to the list following the invasion of kuwait major us allies did not join the us trade ban imposed on iran may 6 1995 and the move did not in itself measurably alter irans objectionable behavior on the other hand virtually all middle eastern terrorism list states have publicly protested their inclusion on the list and other us sanctions suggesting that these sanctions are hurting politically andor economically three years after being included on the terrorism list sudan expelled usama bin ladin from that country us officials assert that us sanctions even if unilateral have made some terrorism state sponsors think twice about promoting terrorism multilateral approaches in concert with us unilateral sanctions the united states has sought to develop multilateral approaches to combating middle eastern terrorism this involves in some cases closer coordination of overall policies and ontheground cooperation and in other cases attempting to persuade other countries to support sanctions against countries that sponsor terrorism however allied business interests and philosophical differences between the united states and its allies over how to dissuade states from sponsoring terrorism have often hampered us efforts to forge multilateral consensus in the case of libya some us allies which buy substantial amounts of libyan light crude oil geared to certain refineries in europe have been reluctant to follow us urging since 1994 to enact ban on purchases of libyan oil in the case of iran european countries and japan strongly opposed 1996 law the iranlibya sanctions act ilsa pl 104172 imposing us sanctions on foreign companies that invest in the energy sector of iran or libya that law was intended to deny iran and libya the financial resources to fund terrorism and weapons and technology acquisitions the united states has tried to use or organize international meetings to forge greater multilateral cooperation on terrorism although progress and implementation of agreed measures have been slow in the wake of february and march 1996 suicide bombings in israel conducted by groups believed supported by iran president clinton convened march 1314 1996 summit of peacemakers in sharm elsheikh egypt some critics maintain that the sharm elsheikh meeting attended by leaders or senior officials from 29 countries as well as follow up meetings in europe was primarily symbolic intended to shore up prime minister peres in his upcoming election contest against likud leader binyamin netanyahu at the june 2022 1997 g7 plus russia summit in denver the participating foreign ministers agreed to further antiterror cooperation by sharing information and coordinating their domestic legislation on fundraising by terrorist organizations on may 18 1998 as part of useuropean union eu agreement under which the united states waived ilsa sanctions for eu firms the united states and crs37 the eu issued joint declaration on counterterrorism cooperation in that declaration the two sides agreed to implement or develop extradition and mutual legal assistance arrangements work to cut off terrorists sources of funding continue to enhance the effectiveness of the palestinian authority in fighting terrorism and to undertake further informationsharing and intelligence exchanges on may 25 1998 the eu countries agreed on code of conduct to curb arms sales to states that might use the arms to support terrorism however the code is not legally binding on the eu states56 bilateral approaches the united states has tried to aid some governments facing opposition from groups that conduct acts of terrorism the administration has sought to rein in the radical proiranian hizballah organization in lebanon by providing military and law enforcement assistance to the government of lebanon in december 1996 the administration initiated new aid package for lebanon part of which consisted of training for lebanons internal security forces the united states also has provided nonlethal aid such as excess trucks and equipment to pa security forces in an effort to strengthen them against the opposition hamas and pij several middle east countries including egypt israel jordan kuwait saudi arabia tunisia and turkey receive antiterrorism assistance through the antiterrorism assistance program run by the state department bureau of diplomatic security in which the united states provides training in airport security explosives detection and crisis management the administration has also tried to encourage better on the ground cooperation with governments in the region in february 1995 pakistan cooperated with us law enforcement agents in capturing in pakistan ramzi ahmad yusuf see above at the time of his capture in june 1997 the state department said pakistan was helpful in the search for mir aimal kansi who was sought in connection with the jan 25 1993 shooting outside cia headquarters in langley virginia two cia employees were killed and three were wounded in that attack on january 23 1998 kansi was sentenced to death for the crime on occasion allies of the united states probably for internal political or foreign policy reasons have appeared reluctant to cooperate with us efforts to capture terrorists in 1985 egypt gave safe passage to the hijackers of the cruise ship achille lauro it offered them safe passage in return for their ending the hijacking in this incident egypt apparently did not want to offend arab states that might have accused egypt of selling out palestinians to the united states in april 1995 according to us officials saudi arabia did not attempt to detain known terrorist when plane on which he was believed to be passenger landed in saudi arabia the terrorist is believed to be imad mughniyah hizballah leader who reputedly held some of the us hostages in lebanon57 saudi arabia might not have wanted to antagonize radical islamist elements inside saudi arabia or cause further deterioration in relations with iran which supports hizballah saudi officials point out that there was very little 56 plan still lets rogue states buy arms associated press may 26 1998 57 hizballah denies mughniyah on board plane fbisnes95079 apr 25 1995 p44 crs38 time for them to react to the us request for help the director of the fbi louis freeh and attorney general janet reno have expressed dissatisfaction with the level of saudi cooperation with the fbi investigation of the khobar towers bombing the administration and congress have sometimes taken steps to try to compel other governments cooperation with us antiterrorism efforts on june 21 1995 president clinton signed presidential decision directive 39 pdd39 enabling us law enforcement authorities to capture suspected terrorists by force from foreign countries that refuse to cooperate in their extradition58 congress in reaction to press reports about the mughniyah incident included provision section 330 in the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 prohibiting the sale of arms to any country that the president certifies to congress is not cooperating fully with us anti terrorism efforts sections 325 and 326 of that law amend the foreign assistance act by requiring the president to withhold us foreign assistance to any government that provides assistance or lethal military aid to any terrorism list country selective engagement according to recent patterns reports it is the policy of the united states to apply maximum pressure on states that sponsor and support terrorists however the united states does conduct diplomacy with some state sponsors and countries that have influence on them in order to curb state support for terrorism the united states has diplomatic relations with iran iraq or libya but it does have diplomatic relations with sudan and syria the united states has engaged syria in the arabisraeli peace process and has not moved to expand us sanctions or persuade us allies to impose sanctions on syria the united states has allowed us private investment in syrias oil and other industries to expand as by product of its participation in the peace process syria conducts dialogue with the united states on terrorism and us officials have occasionally expressed measure of satisfaction with what they describe as declining syrian support for terrorism and syrian cooperation in resolving some specific terrorism cases throughout 1998 the united states has said it would welcome dialogue with the khatemi government in part in an effort to reduce irans support for terrorism iran has not accepted the us offer of dialogue because of factional infighting between khatemi and his opponents the united states might decide to offer incentives to the taliban regime in afghanistan in an effort to persuade it to turn over bin ladin to us law enforcement authorities see above the domestic front the february 1993 world trade center bombing as well as israeli allegations that month that hamas was receiving funding and direction from arab residents in the united states placed greater focus in the administration and congress on domestic efforts to combat middle eastern terrorist groups the trade center bombing exposed the vulnerability of the united states to middle easterninspired terrorism as did other event previously the bombing also sparked much academic research 58 policy on terror suspects overseas washington post february 5 1997 crs39 and law enforcement investigation into the activities of radical muslims in the united states and alleged fundraising in the united states for middle east terrorism us responses to these trends were contained in president clintons january 23 1995 executive order on middle eastern terrorism and in several provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 some of the new measures particularly those dealing with immigration and investigative powers have drawn substantial criticism from us civil liberties groups which fear excessive intrusions by law enforcement authorities these groups also have said that the prohibition on donations to groups allegedly involved in terrorism infringes free speech some arab american organizations have complained that us residents and citizens of arab descent are being unfairly branded by suspicions of terrorist involvement citing the april 1995 oklahoma city bombing some critics maintain that us experts prematurely accuse arab and muslim groups of terrorist acts for further information on domestic responses to terrorism see crs ib95112 terrorism the future and us foreign policy updated regularly by raphael perl
