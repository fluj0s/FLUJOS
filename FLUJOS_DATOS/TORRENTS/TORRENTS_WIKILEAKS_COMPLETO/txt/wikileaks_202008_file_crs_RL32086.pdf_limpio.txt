the late 1920s following action taken in number of states in dealing with state contracts the federal government began development of body of labor standards protections for workers employed by private contractor s in federal contract work the first of these statutes th davisbacon act 1931 set basic labor standards primarily prevai ling wage rates for worker s engaged in construction work under contract for the federal govern ment two other major contract labor standards statutes followed the walshh ealey public contracts act 1936 and the mcnamaraohara service contract act 1965 respectively dealing with labor standards for workers engaged in contract s for production of goods and the provision of services these statutes amended from time to time and supplemented by other enactments deal only with fe deral contract work they do not directly impact work performed for private sector entities clearly however there are economic implications from these primary federally contracting statutes for private sector work in part the thrust of the statutes was to establish the federal government as model employer to be emulated by the private sector more directly th ey were intended to provide economic protections to the targeted groups of workers and to assist in some measure in stabilizing the industries directly involved both davisbacon and walshhealey were enacted prior to the more general fair labor standards act flsa 1938 wh ich has come to provide structure of minimum wages overtime pa requirements restrain ts upon child labor and industrial homework among other things both for public and private workers indeed the mcnamaraohara act was sh aped and finally adopted while flsa amendments those of 1961 and 1966 were being developed to bring wagehour protections to service workers through the years these statutes have been the focus of numerous hearings and an extensive literature their provisions have been added to various federal program statutes usually by reference and they have sparked substa ntial debate pro and this report presents brief historical introduction to the th ree federal contract labor standards statutes davisbac on

congress adopted series of labor standards statutes applicable to contract work for the fe deral government c onstruction production of goods or provision of services these st atutes do not apply to the private sector except when it is engaged in contract wo rk for the federal government in some instances coverage is triggered by contr act to which the federal government is signatory on other occasions the laws may apply to various forms of federally assisted work through grants loan gu arantees revolving funds and the like the first of these statutes the davis bacon act 1931 set certain wage and related standards for federa l contract construction wo rk in 1936 congress added the walshhealey public contracts act setting basic labor standards in the production of goods under contract for the fe deral government the third of these statutes the mcnamaraohara service contract act 1965 mandates minimum labor standards where services are pr ovided under contract to the federal government1 these statutes are supplemented by other federal enactments and often by laws at the state and local level this report sketches the history of thes statutes what they provide how they are similar and how they differ it suggests how they fit into the broader framework of general wagehour and related legislation nd it notes certain areas of controversy that have veloped with respect to the several enactments introduction early in the 19th century the federal government began development of special body of labor standards protec tions applicable to its own direct workforce however much of the work of the federal government was not undertaken by its direct employees but rather through contracts with the private sector by employers who operated beyond the reach of federal regulation and to w hom standards applicable to federal employees did not apply through the early 20th century public work was awarded to the lowest responsible bidder responsible was defined as the

work the government sought consideration was given to the conditi ons under which such work was performed2 regulation of wages hours and ch ild labor was regarded as beyond the reach of government attempts to legislat in those areas were generally found to be unconstitutional and were vigo rously opposed as an illega l and unjustified intrusion upon private sector prerogatives industrial health safety and sa nitation were left largely to local jurisdictions where states and local governments were able to enact measures that would withstand the test of constitutionality they appear to have been of little impact either lacking substance or unenforced most contractors appear to have been reputable some we re not often bid brokers sought contracts and then with the award in hand would subcontract to firms willing to work at the lowest cost3 since government would normally specify the quality of the fabric or materials the style and construction standards the prime area in which to cut costs was on labor engaging the cheapest viable workers and pressing them to work as long as ndurance would permit these were often not permanent employees of the contractor but rather casual workers whose welfare was of little continuing concern neither to the bid broker nor to the subcontractor where government protected its own di rect workforce through wagehour and related standards contracting out for public work placed premium on low wages and sometimes led to adverse wo rking conditions by paying less private contractors could enhance their competitive position thus an informal alliance might be struck between the procurement officer and the lowwage employer each for their own reasons conspiring to cut costs by keeping wages low at the same time by indirectly tolerating abusive conditions government sacrificed its role as model employer an oftexpressed desire and as an example for the private sector4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32086crs3 5 concerning early

first the states and then the federa l government embarked upon program of reform often encounterin g constitutional challenges5 but in at least two areas government was free to act as an employer it could set standards that applied to its own direct employees just as any priv ate sector employer could then do more significant here as consumer it could set standards for the goods services and construction that it was willing to purchase in the public marketplace it could for example write into bid specifications requirements that certain unfair labor practices would not be tolerated in the context of public procurement and in that way it reserved to itself the right to define the concept of fairness the davisbacon act 1931 during the years following world war i various efforts were made to bring greater level of professiona lism to the construction i ndustry however certain practices continued that embarrassed the better contractors and complicated the process of doing business with governme nt assessing contractor and worker credentials posed problem for example was particular firm equipped to fulfill the terms of specific contract and were the workers employed by the firm competent workmen some contractors woul d bid above their leve l of expertise and having won contract on the basis of the west projected costs would then attempt to draw together workforce sometimes they were successful but at other times they may not have been6 it was also alleged that itinerant contractors would enter local market bid on public construction work bring onto the worksite crew from outside the area complete the work and move on some of these contractors did excellent work perhaps better than local firms could have done or were equipped to do but it appears there were also firms that we re lessthancompetent and to whom the opprobrious title flybynight operators was given in either case outside firms came under attack during the 1920s incr easingly so as the great depression dawned and as local companies and thei r employees became desperate for work7 as the federal government commenced major expenditures for public buildings and public works the broader more

thr ough several congresses prior to its enactment the final legislation was introduced by sena tor james davis rpa who had served as secretary of labor under presidents harding coolidge and hoover and by representative robert bacon rny 10 the davisbacon act provides wage floor contractors may need to pay in excess of the davisbacon rate in order to secure qualified workershours and conditions of work combined with wagebased economic competition as an issue of public policy in part the federal construction pr ogram was intended to spur the economy of depressed areas by providing jobs for local workers and contracts for their employers but it appears outside contractors working with imported lowwage crews would often underbid local firms and once having finished the immediate project would move on8 the economic impact sought from the work was thus defused the effort to provide work and cont racts for distressed communities frustrated but public contracting activity of the 1920s and 1930s needs further exploration how frequently for example did outside contractors compete with local firms on an unfair basis however defi ned what were their labor practices the quality of work of the respective fi rms and the economiccost implications of dealing with local or outside contractors n eeds assessment much of what is asserted with respect to this peri od appears to be anecdotal davisbacon enacted in 1931 as an emergency measure urged by president herbert hoover congress adopt ed the davisbac on act pl 717989 it mandated that not less than the locally prevailing rate of wages for work of similar nature had to be paid on construction work to which the federal government or the district of columbia was party10 specific rate was set but the act provided in case any dispute arises as to the prevailing rates of wages for work of similar nature applicable to the contr act which can not be adjusted by the contracting officer the matter shall be referred to the secretary of labor for determination and his decision thereon shall be conclusive on all the parties to the contract in effect the initial determination was left to the parties to the contractor and the workers and only secondarily to the secret ary of labor in that manner congress sought to end the wagebased competition from the flybynight operators to stabilize the local contracting community and to protect workers from unfair exploitation employers could compete on the basis of efficiency skill or any otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32086crs5 11 in the senate report on the davisbacon legislation it was affirmed that the measure does not require the government to establish any ne w wage scales in any portion of the country instead it merely gives the government the power to require its contractors to pay their employees the prevailing wage scales in the vici nity of the building projects this is only fair and just to the employees the contractors and the government alike see us

hearings commenced almost immediately but in january 1932 before congress could act pr esident hoover issued executive order 5778 in an attempt to improve the adminis tration of the statute while the order was not successful as administrative reform it did defer formal amendment of the act for several years12 as enacted in 1931 the davisb acon act attracted many critics13 some contractors it was alleged paid the locally prevailing wage but then demanded rebates from their employees in 1934 congress adopted the copeland anti kickback act pl 73324 the act specified fine of up to 5000 or imprisonment of up to five years or both for anyone who induces any person engaged in covered federa l construction work to give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under his contract of employment by force intimidation threat of procuring dismissal from such employment or by any other manner whatsoever14 other complications arose as well with respect to the davisbacon act most of which were addressed in amendments adopted in 1935 pl 74403 among the changes made in the statute were the following first in 1931 the dollar volume coverage threshold had been set at 5000 however it was charged that contractors fragmented their work to make it come in under the threshold matter of particular concern with respect to paintin g and decorating thus the threshold was lowered to 2000 and coverage for painting and decorating work was specified in the statute second where the 1931 statute had concerned only public buildings the 1935 amendments extended coverage to

1960s congress undertook review of the statute the first major oversight of the act since the 1935 amendmen ts were adopted the investigation and hearings led to two changes first although there was

opportunity for rebuttal and crossexamination that the congress prescribed under the walshhealey act as amended in 195250 and the court found that the secretarys wage rate determina tion methodology

government business it was expected that contract service employees were to be paid overtime rates where appropriate on the basis of the regular rate as termined under the flsa but what exactly was

three acts taken together would cover the field of contract work controversy and amendment though the concept of the service contract act sca may have been clear problems quickly arose as dol

various amendments was to define the terms of coverage the 1972 amendments after several years of experience both employers and service workers seemed convinced that change in the statute was in order further some members of congress involved in the original enactment expressed concern that implementation of the statute was not proceeding as they had expected the legislation pl 92473 some estimated would benefit nearly two million employees of private service contractors on federal installations66 the five man provision generally following the walshhealey language the sca permitted the secretary to make such rules and regulations allowing reasonable variations tolerances and exem ptions to and from any or all provisions of this act as he may find necessary and proper it also provided apparently as fallback position that not less than the minimum wage under the flsa should be paid to covered workers the intent of the provisions seems to have been to provide flexibility and to allow the secretary time to develop suitable wage rate determination methodol ogy and machinery during hearings in 1971 and 1972 it was di sclosed that the secretary to significant degree had failed to make the requisite determinations and was relying upon the flsa minimum wage as the locally prevailing rate for sca purposes thus congress amended the act to require that the secretary would actually make wage rate determinations fo r progressively smaller contr acts after july 1 1976 they were to be made for all c ontracts under which more than five service employees are to be employed67 successorship and related requirements 1972 in service contracts labor cost is often primary competitive element with the workers over time likely to secure some improvement in wage and benefit levels thus with each successive round of bidding competitor contractor coming fresh to the job would be almost certain to present bid lower than that of current contract holder based simply on lower wage and benefit rates where contracting firm opera ted under collective bargaining agreement its displacement would be almost guaranteed regardless of the quality of services provided the implications it was ar gued

modified the act would require that successor c ontractor for substantially the same services in locality could not pay any service employee less than the wages and fringe benefits including prospective increases resulting from arms length negotiations to which he or she would have been entitled under the predecessor contract68 the provision was contentious althoug h the secretary was granted authority to modify contract if he found after h earing that the wage and benefit rates were substantially at variance with those prevailing locally for similar services the provision seemed some argued unduly to fa vor workers absent discretionary intervention by the secretary wages nd benefits would be unlikely to fall downward economic pressures not withstanding conversely it could be argued the requirement would somewhat remove wages and benefits from the competitive mix encouraging employers to compete in other ways69 other issues concern had been expressed that direct federal employees could be disadvantaged through contracting out under potentia lly less costly service contracts to insure comparability congress added language to the statute to provide that each such service contract must contain statement of the rates that would be paid by the federal agency to the various classes of service employees if the workers were direct federal employees and that the secretary shall give due consideration to such rates in making wage and fringe benefit determinations finally subject to any appropriations restra ints service contract s could be negotiated for up to

economic stabilizati on measure by 1936 when congress took up the legislation that would become the walshhealey act it had before it the experience with davisbacon and subse quently with the national industrial recovery act nira in each case davisbacon and walshhealey congress acted in its role as consumer and carefully avoided extending bor standards to the private sector in 1937 judicial attitudes toward wage hour legislation involving the private sector changed80 after decades of refusing to give constitutional sanction to labor standards regulation for the private sector the supreme court modified its stance and seemed willing to allow congress greater latitude in dealing with such issues as result the flsa was adopted in 1938 during consideration of th flsa legislation congress seemed to focus on the experience with the nira it was acutely aware of nira deficiencies but that statute th rough its demise provided an indication of what the courts would accept now freer to deal directly with labor standards in the private sector congress was able to move beyond both davisbacon and walsh healey in crafting wagehour legislation81 the juxtaposition of mcnamaraohara 1965 and the expansion of the flsa during the 1960s and 1970s is more puzzling in reporting the initial legislation on mcnamaraohara both the house and senate committees noted that service employees in many instances are not cove red by the fair labor standards act or state minimum wage laws82 the flsa beginning with relatively narrow pattern of coverage had gradually b een extended to an ever wider segment of the workforce however the 1961 flsa amendments ex panded coverage t about 36 million new workers primarily in the retail trades and the service sector and under the 1966 flsa amendments to

service contracts by amending the flsa instead after an interval of nearly 30 years it chose to revisit the federal contract labor st andards field and to adopt new statute supplement to davisbacon and walshhealey while almost simultaneously expanding the flsa to provide protection fo r many of the same workers thus by the closing decades of the 20th century two separate distinct but often parallel federal wage hour structures had been veloped minimum wage and overtime pay protections were provided to most private and public sector workers through the flsa for construction worker s employed on federal contract work there was superminimum wage the loca lly prevailing rate under the davisbacon act84 service employees would similarly enjoy superminimum wage not less than the

and marvin levine the prevailing minimum wage under the walsh healey act in emanuel stein ed proceedings of the fourt eenth annual conference on continuedestablishing standards in retrospect given the history of the fe deral contract labor standards statutes it may appear that congress was unduly op timistic about the ease with which they could be administered when davis bacon was adopted in 1931 there was little experience upon which to draw but as s ubsequent statutes we re adopted congress attempted to resolve administrative issues by writing qualifying language into each new piece of legislation problems howev er continued to arise and to spark demands that the several statutes be either revised or repealed setting reasonable wage rate establishing the minimum wage under the fair labor standards act proved to be relativel simple congress would conduct hearings and at some point would mandate national wa ge floor the rate with certain variations was set forth in the statute leaving little to the discretion of the secretary of labor85 there was need to assess local standards or to develop database from which to determine comparability congress passed legislation and the wage floor was set prevailing wage rates however have been quite different matter first there were three different approaches the locally prevailing wage davisbacon the locally prevailing minimum wage walshhealey and the minimum monetary wages in accordance with prevailing rates for such employees in the locality mcnamaraohara second in none of the statutes was the concept of minimum andor prevailing actually defined nor did the st atutes provide the secretary with precise formula for their calculation as discussed bove the walshhealey rate would become by default coequal with the federal minimum wage under the flsa third there were variety of qualifiers that the department had to take into account for example how was one to defi ne the various classes of laborers and mechanics for davisbacon purposes or th various classes of service employees for mcnamaraohara rates in the case of the latter the secretary was directed to give due consideration to the rates that would be paid by the federal agency to service employees had they chosen to use direct federal workers but not necessarily to be bound by it ultimately davisbacon and mcnamaraohara rates would include fringe benefit component not an easy figure to determine fourth the rates for davisbacon nd mcnamaraohara were to be associated with the individual crafts or types of work pe rformed notwithstanding the absence of standardization of job titles and job content86httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32086crs28 86 continued labor new york university albany matthew bender 1961 pp 393435 and james c fontana employer

course tions of the work were to be fabricated at distant location and transported to the actual site of the work moreover workers of the skill needed for project might not be locally available both the department in calculating wage and the contractor when recruiting workforce might need to look to an adjoining jurisdiction perhaps locality several states away in order to find comparably skilled workers employed on projects of character similar 87 with walshhealey the process was more difficult contract for army uniforms for example might be let out fo r bids in washington dc but the actual work might be performed anywhere new orleans grand rapids san juan the production location might not be known when bids were solicited and to add dimension of complexity uniform mig ht involve co mponents from variety of jurisdictions buttons zippers braid under such circumstances what was the locality for wage rate determination purposes the concept of locality appears in the walshhealey act in the phrase or groups of industries currently operating in the locality rudolf modley et explain that because the secretary has neve r used groups of industries as basis for wage rate determination he always fe lt free to ignore the locality language of the act further they note the secretary has taken the position that determinations are to be made on nationwide or industrywide basis where an analysis of government procurement shows that bids are submitted and contracts awarded for delivery on nationwide basis88 thus variety of geographical standards might apply under the service contract act the problems are similarly difficult wage rates for janitors working under mcnamaraohar contract to clean federal building in downtown paso could readily be iden tified through local market survey but when service workers came to include diverse crafts white collar and technical workers the range of rates became equally diverse computer service workers for example could be sited almost

union review september 2002 pp 3137competing or comple mentary structures through the years an elaborate structure of labor standards s been developed each with its own body of implementing regulations and enforcementcompliance guidelines there is the body of laws enacted to protect persons engaged in federal contract work davisb acon walshhealey and mcnamara ohara variously and differently these statutes deal with wages and hours of work overtime pay rates in the case of walsh healey there are concerns about child and prison labor and industrial homework to these must be added the c ontract work hours and safety standards act cwhssa supplemen ting the davisbacon act and in some cases the mcnamaraohara act most employers of workers engaged on federal contract work will also be subject to the occupational safety and health act separate from the federal contract labor standards statutes but applicable to the same bodies of workers there is the flsa setting minimum wages overtime pay rates restraining child labor and industrial homework etc most of ten employers engaged in federal contract work will be subject to the flsa and the cwhssa in addition to davisbacon walsh healey and mcnamaraohara although not treated here it is not directly federal issue there is body of state labor standards that deal with minimum wages overtime pay and occupational safety laws sometimes in conjunction with osha where work is conducted with mixed state and federal funding the high er standard or combination of requirements could apply more recently there has developed new body of wage laws largely at the municipal level namely th living wage laws though they vary among jurisdictions they generally set minimum wage and related standards that must be met when contractors do business with local governmental units89 the various labor standards laws are different each from the other in their requirements the triggering mechanisms their coverage etc since they are living statutes they can be expected to change from time to timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32086crs30 90 see for example timothy j bartl work and pay in the new century upgrading our wage and hour laws to meet

state and local protective legislation was enacted to protect workers and to assist in some measure in stabilizing industry and the workplace each very largely has devel oped in separate pattern as legislators responding to workplace realities acco mmodating workers employers and the public have modified the st atutes adding technical co rrective provisions and giving way to the need for flexibility hardly static the statutes have been in continuing state of evolution some have argued with respect to the federal structure that it is dated difficult to enforce and to comply with and very much in need of updating90 is such updating worth considering could it be achieved without major change to the substance of protections that have been crafted through nearly century at the same time some may question whether advocates of modernity of flexibility of bringing labor standards law into the 21st century want to update or to diminish the protective qualities of the statutes to the point of facto repeal91 through the years some have ques tioned certain redundancy in the labor standards law structure and the continuing need for protective standards for federal contract workers separate from those pplicable to the workforce at large92 might consolidation of the statutes be useful were that attempted how complex might that process become and what difficulties might be encountered are there areas in which reform is needed and where through restructuring the labor standards statutes c ould be rendered easier to force more protective of workers and less burdensome for employers
