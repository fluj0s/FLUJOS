limiting the damage awards in malpractice suits though some ttention also has been given to insurance reforms third related area that has received less consideration in malpractice discussions is patient safety patient safety refe rs to the panoply of rules practices and systems related to the prevention of medical injury intrinsic to patient safety efforts are strategies to prevent medical errors while patient safety and medi cal errors have generated great deal of discussion in legislatures in the past several year s such discussion typically has taken place separately from the bates concerning malpractice for example s 544 the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 encourag ed the voluntary reporting and analysis of medical error data s 544 became pl 10941 on july 29 2005 however medical liability issues are addressed in other legislation specifically hr 5s 354 the help efficient ccessible lowcost timely healthcare health act of 2005 s 22 the medical care access protection act of 2006 and s 23 the healthy mothers and hea lthy babies access to care act the separation of patient sa fety concerns from medical malpractice issues has not always been the case several states have passed legislation that included provisions that addressed bot h malpractice and patient safety issues research studies have explored the links between the two issues and few bills introduced during the 109th congress such as s 1337 and s 1784 address those links therefore it is appropriate and timely to reconsider these issues collectively and revisit the role patient safety initiatives could play in the prevention of both medical errors and medical malpractice strategies to enhance patient safety differ according to the specific provider type targeted for instance physician education includes providing clinical guidelines about appropriate treatments for specific medical conditions while hospital education involves performance feedback from an exte rnal organization at the same time general approaches may apply to both physicians and hospitals for example medical error reporting is key component fo r patient safety enhancement regardless of the provider focus the impact of patient safety initiatives on the quality of care provided continues to be an open question i ndividual initiatives have resu lted in promising outcomes but the overall impact of these efforts has been mixed to some degree this is the case because implementation has not been as pervasive as initial intentions suggested and also because not enough research has been

punitive damage awards in malpractice cases see the crs report rl31721 punitive damages in medical malpractice actions burden of proof and standards for awar ds in the fifty states by henry cohen the separation of patient sa fety concerns from medical malpractice issues has not always been the case during the firs t malpractice insurance crisis in the mid late 1970s california passed pioneering bill the medical injury compensation reform act micra which included provisions not only limiting damage awards and other legal reforms but also stre ngthening patient safety and physician disciplinary activities but the controversy over damage awards eclipsed those other topics and subsequent state and federal legislative activity centered on reforming malpractice tort law this dynamic was repeated during the second malpractice insurance crisis during the midlate 1980s another spate of malpractice tort reforms were proposed and debated separa from the proposals related to health care quality and the mostly academic discussions concerni ng patient safety throug h most of the 1990s patient safety issues did not command widespread gislative attention spite research that found that medical errors cau sed significant health and financial problems for the individuals injured their families and the nation as whole it wasnt until 1999 institute of medi cine study on medical errors which avoided including discussion about the malp ractice insurance controversy that the issue of patient safety finally reached na tional prominence since publication of that report the intense media attention helped propel patient safety issues to the forefront of health care debates and gislative proposals given th interest in patient safety and observations by some that the nation is in the midst of its third malpractice insurance crisis some fe deral and state legislators have developed proposals to address these issues therefore it may be appropriate to consider these issues collectively and revisit the role patient safety initiatives could play in the prevention of both medical errors and medical malpractice the link between malpractice and medical error has its detractors some health care observers refer to studies that found that the majority of malpractice claims filed do not involve negligent medical care5 in other words the majority of patients who file malpractice claims have suffered medical injuries but not of the type that would be legally compensable on the grounds of provider negligence6 moreover seminal medical errors study showed that many lawsuits are won by patients even though expert reviewers cannot establish an evidence of negligence at the same time only small proportion of patients whose injuries are caused by negligence actually end up filing malpractice claim some observers cite the gap between malpractice claims and provider negligence as evidence of faulty litigation system in need of reform thus they support solu tions that target the legal system such as malpractice tort reforms7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32092crs3 8 l landro the informed patient some hosp itals offer new service helping patients complain wall street

1999 p 2other observers argue that the emphasis on liability and damage awards negatively impacts the patientprovider relationship which in turn affects malpractice claims number of st udies have shown that communication breakdowns lead to patient frustration nd anger which increases the likelihood of litigation8 some health care observers assert that the collapse in communication and trust in addition to health care delivery system in which time spent providing services has been compressed adds an unh ealthy antagonistic component to modern medicine they conclude that this adversarial element acts as significant barrier to quality improvement and patient safety efforts such an assessment was reflected in an editorial by several wellrespected patient safety researchers who observed that the threat of malpractice liability to deter bad medical care has had limited impact on reducing patient injuries9 indeed the variety of disciplines involved in this debate ie medicine insurance law government speaks to the complexity of the issues it follows that any meaningful discussion about them necessitates thor ough analysis including an analysis of patient safety patient safety and medical errors while concern about patient injuries is not new data about adverse events was sparse and limited until fa irly recently small pioneering study looked at sample of 23 california hospitals in 197410 that analysis found that nearly 5 of hospitalizations involved injuries to pa tients extrapolating from the number of hospitals in the sample to all ca hospitals the study investigators estimated that there were 140000 pa tient injuries in that state alone in 1974 more comprehensive study was undertaken in 1991 largely in response to the lack of robust patient injury data by member s of the harvard medical practice study hmps group the group analyzed 1984 data from over 30000 discharges at 51 new york hospitals and more than 67000 litigation records and the study is considered to be the most influential pa tient injury study the hmps found that the proportion of hospitalizations involving dical injuries was around 4 lucian l leape one of the hmps investigators later extrapolated from the ny data and estimated that 180000 individuals died annually in the us as result of medical injury he noted that this was equivalent to three jumbojet crashes every 2 days11

findings immediately seized the attention of mainstream news media along with dramatic storie s about individuals seriously rmed by errors the iom report placed medical errors in the forefront of health care discussions most of the attention focused on the ioms estimate of the number of deaths that could be attributed to errors between 44000 nd 98000 annually in addition the report estimated that the cost to the nation of all preventable adverse events was 17 billion year but beyond those dramatic statistics the iom report emphasized need to move away from blaming individual provide rs and focus instead on preventing errors via safer health care systems the iom concluded that medical errors generally are the result of many variables since bla ming single person does nothing to change those contributing variables the same rror could occur over and over again thus enhancing patient safe ty requires systemic approach in order to make changes to system conditions that lead to errors in the first place in effect this conclusion broadened the medical errors discussion to include the characteristics of health care delivery systems that contribute to the prevalence of adverse events also this groundbreaking approach to addressing rrors was seen as an opportunity for lessening the adversarial quality in patientprovider relationships engendered by the malpractice liability debate patient safety initiatives soon after publication of the ioms finding s strategies to reduce medical errors were put forth from both public and private sector entities for example 34 medical errorrelated bills were introduced in stat legislatures in the year following the release of the iom report the proposal s addressed broad spectrum of related issues such as adverse event reporting reduction of medication errors systemwide analysis and public disc losure of information13 at the federal level thenpresident clinton charged an interagency task for ce to inventory current federal efforts to reduce errors and outline action items for fu ture implementation three months later the task forces report endorsed many of the io ms recommendations and enumerated diverse set of strategies for addressing them14 some of those strategies included allocating funds to establish patie nt safety center within the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq implementing

some patient safety advocates point out that medical malpractice claims and awards are not reliable gauge of an individual physicians competence as discussed earlier only sma ll percentage of patients who experience medical injuries end up filing malpractice claims and of t hose who do file claims majority did not experience injuries that meet the legal defi nition for negligence therefore even the most conscientious physicians face uncertainty as to whether they will be sued and negligent physicians may not be held accountable through the legal system17 in addition questions remain as to wh ether the prior experience of being sued or the threat of possible litigation make physicians practice medicine more safely some studies point out that large body of research has accumulated showing that medical malpractice liability causes doctors to practice defensive medicine18 the premise underpinning defensive medicine is that the fear of liability and the potential negative outcomes associated with malpractice claims lead physicians to administer additional health care treatments or avoid highrisk services primarily to reduce their liability risk the implication is that defensive medicine results in either an increase in overall spending for health care that may not be medically necessary or decrease in access to certain services or for certain patients detractors suggest that the growth of costconscious managed care has limited physicians ability to provide care thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32092crs6 19 mello malpractice liability 20 physicians who serve in the military

that em pirical studies on defensive medicine have produced mixed findings with most failing to demonstrate any real impacts on medical practice arising from hi gher malpractice premiums or prior experience of being sued19 another issue for considera tion is that many physicians may not face the full financial consequen ces of their profe ssional conduct most physicians are insured against medical malpractice and premiums for professional liability insurance are not adjusted to reflect provider experiences with malpractice claims or other disciplinary actions ie malpractice premiums are not experience rated how then can patient safety be improve d with the individual provider in mind some have suggested that serious deviations from quality care can be addressed by strengthening licensure and accreditation requirements and modifying physician disciplinary procedures others recommend lesspunitive lessadversarial approach of assessment feedback and ongoing profe ssional education licensing and disciplining of physicians the regulation of physician licensure and standards for ppropriate physician conduct has traditionally been the responsibility of the states through the licensure process states ensure that all licensed physicians have appropriate education and training and hold providers accountable to the recognized standards of professional conduct under each states medical prac tice act the responsibility for physician licensure and discipline rests with the state medical boards20 state medical boards any disciplinary sanctions imposed by state medical boards are reported to the federation of state medical boards medical credentialing societies and appropriate government agencies including the national practitioner data bank see below for more details state medical boards also can assist the public by disclosing the current status of physicians license any disciplinary actions or in some instances any pendi ng charges many state boards have increased consumer accessibility to this in formation by making it available online for example massachusetts passed pi oneering law in 1996 making information about physicians discip linary activities malprac tice payments and criminal convictions available to the general pub lic other states including california georgia new york virginia and wash ington now offer similar online

the majority of those boards other observers counter that medical boards are not given adequate resources to respond to the large number of complaints that they receive they assert that boards lack sufficient funding authority and information to be able to act in an appropriate and timely manner boards also may not be able to respond quickly they say because formal actions against physicians must follow strict process of complaint investigation and hearing the federation of state medical bo ards fsmb private nonprofit association of state medical boards has worked to improve state medical

and li censing entities throughout the united states and some other countries information on medical malpractice settlements or claims is not collected reporting to the fsmb is voluntary and only actions that can be legally released or are matter of public record are included in the data center beginning in 2001 fsmb reports on discip linary actions against physicians became available to the public21 national practiti oner data bank established under the health care quality improvement act of 1986 pl 99660 and made operational in september 1990 the national practitioner data bank npdb is central repository for information about physicians dentists and in some cases other health care professionals it contains reports on medical malpractice payments actions taken by state board of medical examiners to suspend or revoke practitioners license and actions taken by hosp ital or other health care tity to limit or revoke clinical privileges the intent of the data bank is to improve the quality of health care by encouraging hospitals state licensing boards and other health care entities to identify and discipline those who engage in unprofe ssional conduct and to restrict the ability of incompetent providers to move from stat to state without disclosure or discovery of prior adverse actions taken against them while hospitals are the only health care entities with mandatory requi rements for querying the da ta bank npdb information is available to state licensing boards prof essional societies certain federal agencies and others as specified in the statute npdb information is not available to the general public some legislators and cons umer groups have advocated for the public release of npdb information they argue that the public has the right to know

underreporting may be severe problem and so the completeness and accuracy of the npdb information are an open question health care practitioners also oppose the public disclosure of npdb information

be found at httpwwwnapedumalpractice payments made by physicians in different specialties would be misleading since some medical specialties typically have higher rates of malpractice suits than other specialities the same can be said about certain doctors who take on riskier cases than their colleagues als data bank entry showing payment for malpractice claim does not necessarily indicate negligent care it is possible this was case in which the physician was not negligent some assert but settled out of court in order to avoid the costs and publicity associated with lengthy trial public disclosure of reported information the concern that many providers voice against making npdb data public is the same one they express about participating in reporting systems in general their concern is rooted in the assumption that such information whether it be about medical errors adverse events or disciplinary actions will be used against them professionally at time when malpractice insurance is becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to find in some regions and for certain specialities providers may believe they are being asked to disclose sensitive information with guarantee of legal administrative or professional protection in addition opponent s of public disclosure argue that it creates strong disincentives for openness nd candor in the reporting system thereby reducing the value of the information gathered disclosure proponents argue that placing medical practitioners on public tice creates strong incentives for quality improvement and assures consumers that at minimum mechanism is in place to identify serious errors and negligent pr oviders moreover they characterize physicians fear about liability as unwa rranted for example proponents of public reporting say that physicians in states th at have posted disciplinary actions on the internet are reporting that they have seen negative impact from making this information public23 provider educati on

system failures most patient safety initiatives thus far have focused on hospitals an abundance of solutions have been proposed such as reporting hospital performance dissemina ting clinical protocols and adopting innovative technology to aid hospitals in the creation of culture of safety this endeavor was further energized by the imple mentation of patient safety standards by the nations largest hospital accrediting body the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho the jcaho standards stressed not only hospitals role in the prevention of medical errors but also its responsib ility for disclosing to patients when they ve been harmed by such errors reporting of medical errors patient safety studies and initiatives emphasize the importance of transparency in health care delivery communication is the principal medium through which transparency concerns are addressed and one of the key features of patient safety based communication strategy is sy stem for reporting adverse events30 lessons from the airline industry some of the early thinking on this issue borrowed ideas from other industries particularly aviation in the airline industry pilots controllers and others can submit information to the aviation safety reporting system asrs which is administered by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa31 the asrs is system for reporting near misses that is incidents that do not result in accidents but nonethel ess violate standard practices or rules the system also analyzes the root causes of near misses and communicates the findings to those involved as well as others working under similar conditions such design is considered useful for identifying possible hazards and developing solutions to prevent accidents key characteristics of the asrs are that it operates independently of any regulatory body is comp letely confidential and reporters are given immunity from retribution in more than 30 years of existence asrs has received and processed more than 600000 reports and many aviation experts credit asrs with helping to greatly increase commercial aviation safety however it is important to note that the asrs does not deal with incidents that result in passenger injury or aircraft damage serious aviation accidents are investigated by the national transportati on safety board under different system moreover pilots have extra incentive to perform flawlessly since major mistake puts them in as much immediate danger as their passengers the dualsystem arrangement for addressi ng near misses and serious

voluntary confidential systems for reporting harm events medical error th at has been carried out but does not result in injury minimal harm events and near misses analysis of such information could then be used to identify system vulnerabilities and develop preventive strategies mandatory vs voluntary reporting there are many ideas among stakeholders regarding the design of health care reporting system including who should report and what they should report key area of discussion is whether reporting system should mandate participation or be voluntary32 the primary purpose of mandatory re porting system is to hold providers accountable by ensuring that serious mista kes are reported and i nvestigated and that appropriate followup action is taken medical practitioners that continue unsafe practices risk citations penalties sanctions suspension or revocation of licenses and possible public exposure and loss of business however the focus on collecting adverse event data and disciplining indi vidual providers bypa sses the majority of errors errors that are caused or exacerbate d by poorly designed health care delivery systems according to the iom voluntary reporting systems play valuable role in encouraging improvements in patient safety33 experience from ongoing voluntary reporting efforts have shown that such systems are helpful in identifying errors that occur on such an infrequent basis that they would be difficult to detect by any one single health organization and error trends or patterns that allude to system problems that may affect all health care organizations identification of such events could facilitate the development of strategies to prevent more serious errors from occurring nevertheless key criticisms against voluntary systems are that due to their very design underreporting is constant concer n and such systems are inadequate for addressing egregious medical errors examples of health care reporting programs both private and public entities have implement ed patient safety reporting pr ograms for example in 1996 jcaho implemented its sentinel event policy sep34 this policy outlines jcahos expectations for how health car organizations should address sentinel events ie medical events involving deat h or severe physical andor psychological injury the sep instructs organizations to identify sentinel events complete thorough analysis of the root causes of t hose events implement strategies to reduce their prevalence and track the effectiveness of those strategies the policy also encourages health care organizations to share their findings with jcaho in order for it to pass on those lessons learned to others as of april 2006 jcaho has released 36 alerts that describe different types of serious

errors in hospitals35 the reporting requirements vary widely for instance state mandates differ in what health facilities are required to do with reported informa tion review reports about medical violations share in formation with patients disseminate evidencebased errorprevention protocols etc in general the quality and quantity of information collected are major concerns only fe w states get enough information to conduct proper analyses and some of the informati on reported is not useful but few states are able to conduct analyses and use th findings in their role as regulator36 honesty policies while most of the attention paid to better communication has centered on reporting systems few health care entities have implemented programs that directly engage individuals injured by medical errors honesty policies have been instituted in small minority of hospital and health care systems to encourage providers and staff to admit that they have committed errors in addition these institutions offer compensation to injured patients to pay for medical treatment or cover lost inco such practices however are uncommon providers typically resist disclo sure of adverse medical events37 supporters of honesty policies assert that ch policies help maintain openness and trus t in patient provider relationships which may diffuse potentially volatile situations others argue that these policies elicit declared admissions of guilt thereby exposing medical practitioners to even greater liability clinical standards in hospital settings medical guidelines generally are developed with particular health condition in mind and individual providers as the target audience however given the increased awareness about medical errors caused by weaknesses in health care systems there is more attention being paid to the application of clinical standards to hospitals for instance ahrq develope d set of quality indicators qis to measure the level of quality associated with the medical

programs in general individual initiatives have resulted in promising outcomes but the overall impact of these efforts has been mixed to some degree this is the case because implementation has not

would be very difficult to provide comprehensive quantitative assessment of the impact of patient safety programs some insight can be gleaned from individual privatesector initiatives as well as

some findings show that patient mortality decreased after hospital performance data was released whereas other findings showed effect while these studies were not necessarily focused on the prevention of medical errors they still provide some indication of how similar programs may affect patient safety efforts in general one study of hospital reporting system in wisconsin highlighted some of the common concerns involved in such efforts47 the study assessed the impact of disclosing the findings from the quality counts report which compared the performance of 24 hospitals in this st udy some hospitals performance data was made public other hospitals data was not publicized the end results provided some evidence of the value of publicizing performance data to encourage quality improvement activities for example hospitals with low scores for obstetric and cardiac care whose results were made public were later involve d in the most quality improvement efforts in contrast th hospitals whose performance was not made public had the lowe st level of quality improvement activity not surprisingly the analysis also found that making perform ance data public gene rated feelings of distrust and anger among the participatin g hospitals all of the hospitals had slightly negative view of public reporting in general although they differed with respect to how they thought such reporting would affect their public image as to be expected hospitals with higher scores were more likely to assert that their public image would be helped while those with lower scores were more likely to assert that their image would be hurt disclosing medical errors to injured patients anecdotal evidence suggests positive impact of honesty polic ies on the reduction of malpractice claims the veterans affairs medical cente r in lexington kentucky regularly is held up as model for such policies the lexington center chose to adopt the practice after dealing with two costly malpracti ce cases since then center administrators claim that their policy has led to savings partly due to decreased legal expenses also the center did not experience deluge of malpractice litigation as initially feared copic cos malpractice insurer in denver had similar experiences copics policy directs provide rs to report medical complications and adverse events copic responds within 72 hours with offers to compensate the patient for medical expenses related to injuries caused by errors and lost wages according to copic this policy has led to reduction in the number of claims and smaller claim payments despite these promising outcomes some observers urge caution they assert that patients may not receive adequate compensation wit hout the assistance of legal counsel furthermore these policies are not adequate mechanisms for addressing very serious medical errors eg patient deaths othe rs point out that it would be inaccurate to generalize the experience of the lexington center to

of patient safety programs cultural issues just as there are numerous solutions proposed to enhance patient safety so to are there numerous barriers to implementing those solutions part of the reason why more has not been done is cultural some say medicine is conservative discipline that does not change easily providers especially physicians place great value on their professional autonom and expertise in an environment such as this efforts to change daytoday practice patterns by outsiders may be met with resistance cultural barriers apply not only to providers but to other players in the health care system for instance proponents of publiciz ing patient safety information note the central role of the c onsumer but study after study has shown that the vast majority of consumers gene

where at least some portion of the payments is based on performance assessed against defined measure while most of the current discu ssions about p4p in health care address quality based measures performance metrics can target any of number of variables including profitability volume or customer or patient satisfaction the terms merit and bonus pay systems also describe similar arrangementsstaff and supplies are of paramount concern52 for example state mandatory reporting systems are hampered by insuffici ent funding the budgets for many state programs are small relative to their responsibilities and some recentlyenacted programs have not been implemented because of lack of funds some observers also point out that federal reim bursement does not ta ke into account medical error rates or implementation of error reduction measures so there is little incentive for providers to enhance patient safety unless busines s case can be made for the potential savings resulting from patient safety initiatives cost will continue to be substantial barrier to such efforts so organizations have launched individual initiatives to address the financial feasibility concerns expressed by health care providers for example in april 2003 coalition of providers plans purchasers and others launched bridges to excelle nce whose mission is to reward high quality health care53 in the public sector hhs announced on july 10 of that same year the launch of demonstration that would provide bonuses to hospitals that perform well on selected qualityofcare standards54 more

initiatives are indicative of the growing interest in pay for performance in health care56 additional resource concerns focus on the time and effort needed to design implement and maintain patient safety programs including training staff some argue that this detracts from time that could be spent on direct health care however others counter that these efforts are mo re efficient use of time and money in the long run liability and professional concerns third set of barriers are prompted by concerns about professi onal and legal liability as was mentioned earlier some of the resistance to

error prevention efforts also relates to the lack of research in this area three of the most highlyregarded experts on patient sa fety concluded that health care studies have focused on biomedical research for decades in contrast error prevention especially the systems issues that underlie great proportion of patient injury is young field which has commanded the attention of only small number of researchers and until recently has received little funding58 to illustrate the 84 million requested in the presidents fy2007 budget to support ahrqs patient safety efforts is equivalent to the single largest investment in this area by the federal government however that appropriation amounted to ss than onehalf of 1 of the comparable budget request for the national institutes of health federal and state patient safety activities congressional interest in activities at the federal and state levels has evolved from generic quality issues to concerns related specifically to medical errors and patient safety as part of this evol ution the development and implementation of legislative proposals has varied in scope focus and purpose federal legislation since the states traditionally play the role of regulator of pr ovider behavior the federal governments presence historically has been small but there was growing realization in the latter 1970s and th roughout the

safety evaluation system is define d as the collection management or analysis of information for reporting to or by patient safety organizationand contracts64 the patient safety and quality improvement act provides for extensive privilege and confidentiality protections for certain patient safety information deemed patient safety work products specifically information is afforded these protections if it is considered to be existing within patient safety evaluation system pses65 in other words this information is considered to be patient safety work product if it is created within the boundaries of pses for this reason ahrq needs to provide clear guidan ce as to the boundaries and scope of pses to make clear what information falls under its aegis and therefore is protected in addition the statute requires entities pursu ing certification as pso to provide the secretary with relevant information regarding their existing relationships with health care providers that might constitute conflict of interest and ahrq was interested in gathering information from the public regarding what type of relationships specifically would trigger concerns about an entitys ability to perform independently as pso the second meeting focused on the issu arising during the operation of component pso meaning an entity that is component of another organization specifically the statute has additional s ecurityrelated require ments for component psos to ensure that privacy of the patie nt safety work products it collects is not compromised in particular these requirements help to make certain that protected information is not shared with the parent organization finally the third meeting solicited comment on broader issues relating to security and confidentiality specifically

relating to standards for deidentifying data and securing identifiable health information according to ahrq the information generated through these meetings has been analyzed by the agency but is not publicly available the comments received highlighted several important issues which may be helpful to the agency as it moves forward ahrq is formulating draft rule and expects to release it in the

survey found that at least third of the states had implemented reporting systems by the late 1990s the purpose of those reporting systems was mainly to collect information on patient injuries or issues related to health care facilities eg structural problems most of the repo rts came from hospitals and nursing homes but some states also collected data from other facilities such as ambulatory care centers these systems reportedly prot ected data confidentiality though privacy policies varied from state to state only few states aggregated the information or conducted trend analysis th overall effectiveness of th programs was hampered by resource and data limitations66 on the issue of patient safety specifica lly many state legislatures did not wait for their federal counterpart to act the number of patient safetyrelated bills introduced in the states tripled in the year following the release of the iom report then nearly doubled in the year after that out of the 22 states that introduced bills in 2001 two years after the release of the iom report half of them were introducing medical error legislation for the first time however during the 2005 legislative sessions states made limited progress three states kentucky virginia and wyoming enacted legislation to addr ess medical errors nd to improve patient safety in the first quarter of 200567 as previously noted 28 states have some type of medical error reporting mandate in place the requirements cover spectrum of issues such as the type of information to be reported to whom the information is submitted and for what purpose for example washington requi res the reporting of medicationrelated errors but new jersey requires the reporting of serious preventable adverse events connecticut requires medical

new york requires hospitals to report infec tion rates which are included in an annual report published by the st ate health department while federal medical malpractice legislation usually did not include patient safety provisions there was some evidence that the link between the two issues has been made at the state level for ex ample pennsylvania passed bills in 2002 and 2003 that contained provisions concerning ma lpractice tort reform insurance reform and patient safety enhancemen t according to governor rendell the comprehensive approach was an attempt to address concerns about malpractice insurance and medical safety68 couple of other states passed or debated similar bills that also linked those issues state patient safety centers budding movement in the states is the creation of state patient safety centers the common purpose of these entities is to promote patient safety efforts within the state approaches which vary by state include educating consumers and providers about safety issues developing systems for error reporting and analysis recommending patient safety goals to the state and supporting collaboration among public and private sector organizations while it is too early to assess the impact of these centers the state commitment of authority and resources towards these centers lends legitimacy and expectation to efforts that primarily had been conducte d on voluntary basis eg patient safety coalitions state patient safety centers may yet play an active role in generating the systemic changes cited as key to enhancing patie nt safety69
