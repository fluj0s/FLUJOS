originally the corps was asked to alter water flow in the everglades to control flooding open land for agriculture and provide water supplies to ur ban areas the cornerstone of this effort was the central and southern florida project which was authorized by the flood control project act of 1948 ch 771 62 stat 1171 this project resu lted in nearly 1000 miles of canals 720 miles continueddoi and the corps jointly funded mod waters in fy2007 previously doi had solely funded the project joint funding of mod waters has gene rated controversy and raised the question of whether the corps is authorized to receive appropriations to work on the project the administrations position ppeared to be for the corps to pay for roughly twothirds of the remaining 146 million required to complete the project from fy2007 to fy20091 for fy2006 25 million was appr opriated to the doi and 35 million to the corps for this project provision in the interior appropriati ons act for fy2006 pl 10954 conditions funding for mod waters on meeting state wate r quality standards this provision cites provisions in the fy2004 interior appropr iations act which states that funds appropriated for mod waters will be provided unless the secretary of the interior secretary of the army administrator of the epa and attorney general indicate in joint report to be f iled annually til december 31 2006 that water entering the arm loxahatchee national wildlife refuge and ever glades national park does not meet state water quality standards and the house nd senate committees on appropriations respond in writing disapproving the fu rther expenditure of funds2 the fy2007 administration request did not contain this condition howe ver the housepassed interior appropriations bill and senatereported

surrounding the modified water deliveries project three issues are being debated about th implementation of mod waters including its estimated funding level project delays and the controversy surrounding land acquisition in the 85 sma funding the question of whether the corps is authorized to fund mod waters was an issue during the deliberation over th fy2006 energy and water appropriations arguments used to support the proposition that the corps could be authorized to directly fund mod waters cite 102f of the everglad national park protection and expansion act of 1989 pl 101229 which is the only section that authorizes funding and authorizes such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the act this provision would include 104 which author izes mod waters though it primarily authorizes activities carried out by the corps arguments used to argue against corps authorization to fund mod wate rs could cite the long hist ory of transfers from the nps to the corps which could be argued to establish strong precedent for the lack of corps authority due to these conflicting arguments and the lack of clear legislative intent the authority for the corps to directly fund mod wa ters might still remain debatable in the fy2007 energy and water appropriations bate the senate energy and water appropriations committee has not provided funds to the corps for mod waters rising project costs for mod waters has led some critics to question its viability the original cost of completing mod waters was estimated at 813 million in 19907 the current estimated cost for completing the project is 398 million8 t d t approximately 252 million has b een appropriated for cons tructing and implementing mod waters and 146 million more is estimated to be needed to finish the project ie fy2007fy20099 some contend that changes in the implementation plan the rising cost of land acquisition and flood mitigation requirements have led to higher costs10 this was reflected according to some in the changes in the 1992 general design memorandum which were deri ved from updated modeling data and the projects need to be compatible with

estimated to be completed by 1997 yet now some argue it is unclear as to when or even whether the project will be completed the fy2006 administration request indicates that funding will be requested through fy2009 some contend that delays ar due to the undefined roles of doi and the corps in implementing the project lack of unified approach to re storation redesigning the project and litigation regarding the 85 sma and tamiami tr ail portion of the project11 some argue that the delay in implementing mod waters jeopardizes implementation of cerp project s causes further degradation within everglades national park and will set precedent for delays and deliberation rega rding land acquisition activities when cerp projects are being implemented12 some proponents of the project contend that ongoing land acquisition in the 85 sma will minimize any future delays land acquisition in the 85 square mile area implementation of mod waters is dependent on acquiri ng land in the 85 sma land acquisition in this area is controversial because there are several unwilling sellers nd the corps is exercising eminent domain in some cases to acquire necessary lands the 85 sma is region adjacent to enp of approximately 5600 acres due to its low topography and lack of drainage part s of the 85 sma frequently flood for several months during the year with the implementation of mod waters the corps expects that most of the 85 sma would flood the corps developed flood mitigation plan in 1992 to provide flood mitigation for residents in the 85 sma and allow for the implementation of mod waters however the 1992 plan was later deemed unworkable by the superintendent of everglades national park who claimed that it would not provide full flood protection for current and fu ture residents in the 85 sma13 the corps began to devise new plan for mod waters and the 85 sma in 1999 which considered several alternative plans including the complete buyout of the 85 sma new plan referred to as altern ative 6d was proposed by the corps in 2000 this plan includes perimeter levee s eepage canal pump station and storm water drainage for flood protection in the 85 sma instead of complete buyout of the 85 sma this plan proposed the acquisition of approximately 2500 acres in the 85 sma 39 of the total area and the acquisition of 77 residential tract s 24 tenantoccupied tracts and 53 owneroccupied tracts in the 85 sma 13 of the total number of residential areas in the 85 sma14 some residents who were unwilling to sell their land in the 85 sma filed suit against the corps in 2001

prevented the corps from acquiring land in th 85 sma the corps later appealed this decision and are now acquiring lands in the area to help implement mod waters congress included provision in the consolidated appropriations resolution for fy2003 division f t itle i 157 of pl 1087 that authorizes the corps to implement flood protection plan alternative 6d for the 85 sma as part of mod waters three conditions are specified in the section authorizing implementation of alternative 6d 1 the corps may acquire residential property needed to carry out alternative 6d if the owners are first offered comparable property in the 85 sma that will be provided with flood protection 2 the corp s is authorized to acquire land from willing sellers in the floodprotected portion of the 85 sma to carry out the first condition and 3 the corps and th nonfederal sponsor may carry out these provisions with funds provided under the ev erglades national park protection and expansion act of 1989 pl 101229 16 us c 410r8 and funds provided by the doi for land acquisition for restoring the everglades some critics of land acquisition in the 85 sma base their ar guments on the same principles used to criticize the acquisiti on of the entire 85 sma that the federal government should not exercise eminent domai n to remove unwilling llers and that the federal government is obligated to protect all residential areas from floods under pl 101 229 some critics also argue that there are several unwilling sellers in the area and that if condemnations pro ceed delays due to litig ation will be inevitabl and will eventually harm the ecosystem16 the corps asserts that there are several willing sellers in the 85 sma17 approximately 78 of the 843 needed tracts have been acquired and of the remaining 189 tracts 57 are in negotiations for acquisition and 43 are expected to be condemned18
