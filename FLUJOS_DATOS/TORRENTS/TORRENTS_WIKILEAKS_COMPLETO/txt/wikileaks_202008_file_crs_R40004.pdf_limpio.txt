deliberations in early 2008 had been on an economic stimulus package designed to boost what was flagging economy as the year ends congressional attention has returned to economic stimulus for the same reason leadership in the house of representatives along with presidentelect obama have indicated that economic stimulus legislation will be top priority early in the 111th congress while the 2008 economic stimulus included rebate for individual taxpayers and several business tax cuts estimated to cost 1517 billion in fy2008 similar tax package is not anticipated for 2009 instead proposals that have been mentioned target employmentrelated issues such as an employee wage credit to encourage hiring and the suspension of taxes on unemployment benefits other proposals mentioned have included the extension of bonus depreciation suspension of rules requiring withdrawals from individual retirement accounts and the waiver of penalties associated with early withdrawals from individual retirement accounts thus far tax policy initiatives that have been announced for the 111 th congress unrelated to stimulus have included health care reform and health care tax policy and what to do about expiring tax cuts enacted during the bush administration other likely areas for congressional action in 2009 are suggested in part by items on which temporary action in the 110 th congress was taken energy taxes extenders temporary tax provisions regularly renewed and the alternative minimum tax in the 110th congress the most prominent congressional taxpolicy action focused on small business in may 2007 congress approved legislation pl 11028 increasing the federal minimum wage and providing smallbusiness tax cuts later in that year major focus of tax legislation was the alternative minimum tax amt for individuals which was projected to apply to growing number of taxpayers congress has been addressing the amts growth with temporary measures that restricted its scope with the latest scheduled to expire in 2008 one year extensions were enacted in 2007 and 2008 congress addressed and took final action on tax legislation in variety of other areas over the course of first and second sessions including energy taxation tax measures related to the 2007 farm bill and extension of set of narrowly fo cused expiring tax benefits the extenders where the proposals involved tax cuts prominent issue was whether and how to offset the revenuelosing effect of tax cuts congress thus considered range of revenueraising tax measures over the course of the yearfor example attempting to reduce the tax gap between the taxes us taxpayers owe and what they pay as well as restricting tax shelters and tax benefits for us firms that operate abroad this report which includes contributions

likely economic effects of tax policy are often hotly debated for example if the economy is sluggish and unemployment is high tax cuts are sometimes recommended by some as fiscal stimulus to boo st demand or in the longer term tax cuts for saving and investment are championed by some as means of boosting longterm economic growth at the same time taxes can also affect longrun growth through the federal budget along with spending tax revenues determine the size of the budget surplus or deficit and the size and nature of the budget balance can affect longrun growth by determining the extent to which governmentborrowing needs compete for capital with private investment thus damping longrun growth taxes also have distributional effect that is the rate and manner in which taxes apply to different activities groups and income levels can alter the distribution of income within the economy for example taxes can affect the distribution of income across income levels affecting vertical equity by applying at different rates to different income levels and taxes can affect horizontal equity by applying differently to different types of income with these broad economic effects in mind discussion of three aspects of the economy follows first is look at the current state of the economy both in terms of longrun growth and the short run state of the business cycle next is review of the recent current and expected future state of the federal budget third is brief review of the level and distribution of the tax burden

housing and financial markets may result in the worst recession seen in several decades enacting economic and fiscal policies meant to bring return of stability may be needed into the beginning of the next decade prior to the recent downturns the economy performed relatively strongly through the first half of 2007 yielding 22 consecutive quarters of real growth

growth over the last four quarters has been mixed with two quarters of negative growth 2007q4 and 2008q3 and two quarters of positive growth 2008q1 and 2008q2 this follows period of relatively strong growth that existed since the last recession ended in november 2001 despite 10 months of recession in 2001 real gross domestic product gdp grew at 08 rate during that year this rate was followed by stronger annual growth rates between 2002 and 2004 though growth was weaker in 2005 and 2006 relative to 2004 the economy continued to perform well as real gdp continued to grow at roughly 3 into the first several quarters of 2007 economic growth continued 1 in july 2007 federal reserve chairman ben bernanke characterized the economys performance as being more consistent with sustainable expansion after registering more rapid growth earlier in th recovery although he also noted that weakness in the housing market has placed drag on growth2 as 2007 progressed however signs of economic weakness surfaced in number of areas one prominent area was housing where prices stopped rising after years of growth and drops occurred in house sales and residential investment second financial markets came under strain as investor concerns about the credit quality of mortgages especially subprime mortgages had damping effect on credit flows further banks began repo rting large losses resulting from declines in the market value of mortgages and other assets leading them to become more restrictive in their lending to firms and households 3 the federal reserve board responded by taking actions to ease monetary policy beginning in the second part of 2007 additional interest rate cuts continued in march april and october 2008 the apparent worsening of the economic situation led to support for economic stimulus legislation from the administration congressional leaders and federal reserve board chairman ben bernanke both the administration and tax policymakers in congress began developing stimulus package in midjanuary which was enacted in february4 see tax cuts for economic stimulus in 2008 below as the crisis continued congress enacted additional legislation intended to prevent economic conditions from worsening including the troubled asset relief program and injections of capital into certain financial and housing related institutions though gdp grew in the first two quarters of 2008 with 28 growth rate in the second quarter it fell sharply in the third quarter to 03 at the same time the unemployment rate rose from 49 in january to 65 in october 1 us department of

congressional budget office cbo the federal budget registered deficit equal of 32 of gdp in fy2008 this defic it rose from fy2007 deficit of 12 of gdp5 prior to the increase in fy2008 the deficit had fallen for three consecutive years relative to the size of the economy the deficit in fy2008 marked the seventh year in row the budget has registered deficit after being in surplus for the fouryear period fy1998fy2001 the budget data indicate that the increase in the deficit was result of both growth in outlays and decline in revenues as percentage of gdp the decline in revenues was more pronounced although not by wide margin revenues have declined from 209 of gdp in fy2000 to 177 in fy2008 drop of 32 percentage points outlays have increased by 25 percentage points over the same period to 209 of gdp in fy2008 the decl ine in revenues had four main sources the recession of 2001 and subsequent sluggish economic growth enacted tax cuts the economic stimulus payments tax rebates and the current economic slowdown cbos most recent budget report released in september 2008 projects rise and then gradual decline in the deficit as percentage of gdp between fy2009 and fy2018 with deficits existing throughout the period 6 these estimates were made prior to the most severe current economic turbulence this projection assumes that current policies remain in place and if that assumption is dropped the outlook will change this consideration is important given congressional interest in extending or making permanent some or all of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts which are scheduled to expire at the end of calendar year 2010 in addition the application of the alternative minimum tax amt to an increasing number of taxpayers may exert pressure to increase the amts exemption amount cbo estimated that extending l tax provisions scheduled to expire between fy2008 and fy2018 would reduce federal re venue by 39 trillion over fy2009fy2018 7 this increase amounts to 107 of cbos projected baseline revenues for the period8 the longerterm budget situation is concern to many policymakers chiefly because of the combination of rising health care costs and demographic pressures posed by an aging population that will begin with the retirement of the baby boom generation under current law spending on social security medicare and medicaid is expected to increase substantially as share of the economy cbos december 2007 analysis of the longterm budget outlook projected several different scenarios for growth of the three programs under its alternative baseline projection which reflects likely policy cbo estimates that spending on the programs will grow the current level of 84 of gdp in fy2005 to 145 in fy2030 and 186 by fy2050 9 according to 5 us

of the federal tax burden is the level of federal receipts as percentage of output gross domestic product or gdp by this measure the federal tax burden has fluctuated considerably over the past five years in fy2000 federal receipts reached postworld war ii peak as percentage of output at 209 by fy2004 however receipts had fallen to 163 of gdp in fy2008 receipts equaled 177 of gdp 11 in part the fluctuations were result of the business cycle the long economic boom of the 1990s helped push receipts to their record level in fy2000 while the ensuing recession and sluggish recovery helped reduce the level of revenues in subsequent years however policy changes too were responsible significant tax cuts in 2001 2002 and 2003 each contributed to the decline in taxes another way to look at the tax burden is to comp are it across income classes in combination the various components of the federal tax system have progressive impact on income distribution that is upperincome individuals tend to pay higher portion of their income in tax than do lowerincome persons in isolation however the different components of the system have different effects the individual income tax is progressive but while payroll taxes are progressive in the lower and middle parts of the income spectrum they become regressive as incomes increase the corporate income tax and estate tax are both progressive although they impose only small burden excise taxes are regressive cbo has published distributional analyses for all federal taxes for each year since 1979 the studies use consistent methodology so the results can be compared to get an idea of the direction of federal tax policys distributional impact over the period according to the studies the overall effective federal tax rate declined from 222 of income in 1979 to 205 in 2005 without more detailed analysis it is not clear whether the system has become more or less progressive over the entire period while rates in all quintiles have fallen the pattern is mixed 12 for further information see crs report rl33786 individual tax rates and tax burdens changes since 1960 by thomas l hungerford and crs report rl32693 distribution of the

proposals have not included tax cuts as enacted in february 2008 instead proposals that have been mentioned target employmentrelated issues such as an employee wage credit and the suspension of taxes on unemployment benefits other proposals mentioned have included the extension of bonus depreciation suspension of rules requiring withdrawals from individual retirement ac counts and the waiver of

minimum tax presents timesensitive issue for congress as each year passes more and more individuals will be subject to the amt rather than the regular tax according to one recent study in 2001 24 million individual income tax returns 18 of the total contained an amt liability in 2004 an estimated 35 million returns 26 had an amt liability in 2010 an estimated 371 million returns 256 will owe the amt13 the portion will decline for number of years thereafter if the tax cuts in economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra expire occurs as scheduled after 2010 but then will resume growth the reason for the increase in the applicability of the amt is its basic mechanics the amt functions like parallel income tax with lower rates than the regular tax but with broader basethat is with fewer deductions exemptions credits and special tax preferences than are allowable under the regular tax each year taxpayer pays either his or her regular tax or the tentative amt whichever is higher taxpayers are permitted flat exemption amount in calculating their amt however the exemption is fixed at flat dollar amount that is not indexed for inflation and while the amt only has two rate brackets 26 and 28 the bracket dividing point is likewise not indexed in contrast the structural features of the regular income tax personal exemptions the standard deduction and ratebracket thresholdsare indexed thus as time passes and incomes grow in both real and nominal terms the amt exceeds the regular tax for more taxpayers the phenomenon was magnified by the rate reductions and tax cuts for married couples provided by egtrra and the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra as well as other tax cuts enacted in the past the original purpose of the amt was to ensure that individual with substantial income could use tax benefits and omissions from the tax base to reduce his or her tax liability below certain point there are several reasons why policymakers may be concerned with the prospect of its increased applicability first taxpayers who become subject to the amt face higher tax liability than they otherwise would some taxpayers moving into amt status may thus view the applicability of the amt as tax increase second taxpayers in amt status are not able to fully participate in tax cuts enacted under the regular tax for example

tax cuts enacted under egtrra and jgtrra third the amt introduces complexity to the tax system and the amount of time spent in tax preparation increases for taxpayers in or near amt status on more conceptual level the amt can be viewed as balancing conflicting goals of the income tax on the one hand various deductions exemptions credits and other benefits under the regular income tax are thought to be useful in promoting various activities considered to be socially desirable or conducive to economic growth on the other hand it is often deemed desirable for tax system to achieve certain level of fairness both in horizontal terms the equal treatment of individuals with the same income but in different circumstances and vertical terms the relative treatment of individuals at different income levels further economists argue that broadbased tax systems with low ratesa characteristic of the amtare less damaging to economic efficiency than higherrate systems that apply to bases laden with special benefits with the amt taxpayers can use the tax benefits available under the regular tax only up to point where considerations of equity and efficiency trigger applicability of the amt the benefits economic growth and social goals are balanced with fairness and efficiency concerns to the extent the amts growth has resulted from inflation and lack of indexation it might be argued that the amts advance is unintended and the balance between equity and social and economic goals intended for the amt has been upset 14 factor that substantially complicates the amt issue is its revenue effect which assumes increased prominence given current federal budget deficits for example indexing the amt for inflation would eliminate much of the impetus of the taxs increasing applicability according to the congressional budget office cbo indexi ng the amt would reduce federal revenues by 569 billion over 10 years an amount equal to 16 of federal revenues expected over the period if egtrras tax cuts are extended or made permanent the cost of restraining the amt would be considerably larger 15 congress has addressed the amt on temporary basis since 2001 by increasing the exemption amount thus reducing the number of taxpaye rs who would otherwise pay the amt most recently for tax year 2008 the tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act division c of pl 110343 increased the amt exemption to 46200 singles and 69950 couples the act also extended the allowance of nonrefundable individual income tax credits to offset amt tax liability

reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 provided substantial tax cut that it scheduled to be phased in over the 10 years following its enactment however to comply with senate procedural rule for legislation affecting the budget the byrd rule the act contained language sunsetting its provisions after calendar year 2010 thus all of egtrras tax cuts expire at the end of 2010 14 it might be argued that the level intended by congress is that established under th omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 where the permanent exemption levels and bracket amounts and rates were

reduction in statutory individual income tax rates creation of new 10 tax bracket an increase in the perchild tax credit tax cuts for married couples designed to alleviate the marriage tax penalty and repeal of the estate tax in addition egtrra provided for temporary reduction in the individual alternative minimum tax amt by increasing the amts exemption amount but scheduled the amt relief to expire at the end of 2004 the jobs and growth tax relief and reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 provided for the acceleration of most of egtrras scheduled tax cutsthat is it moved up the effective dates of most of the tax cuts egtrra had scheduled to phasein gradually generally making them effective in 2003 the phasedin repeal of the estate tax was not accelerated by jgtrra many of jgtrras accelerations however were themselves temporary and were scheduled to expire at the end of 2004 also jgtrra temporarily implemented reduction in the maximum tax rate on dividends and capital gains reducing the rates to 15 5 for individuals in the 10 and 15 marginal income tax brackets the reduction was initially scheduled to expire at the end of 2008 in 2004 congress thus faced two expiration issues related to egtrra and jgtrra one was question for the longer term the scheduled expiration of egtrras tax cuts at the end of 2010 the second was the expiration of jgtrras accelerations at the end of 2004 in september congress addressed the second of these with enactment of the working families tax relief act wftra pl 108311 wftra generally extended jgtrras accelerations of egtrras tax cuts through 2010that is up to the point at which egtrras cuts are scheduled to expire wftra also extended egtrras increased amt exemption for one year in 2005 tipra extended jgtrras dividend and capitals gains rate cuts along with its amt reduction the dividend and capital gains cuts were extended through 2010 the increased amt exemption through 2006 notwithstanding the various extensions and accelerations the issue of egtrras scheduled expiration at the end of 2010 remains and was debated in congress throughout 2008 the debate over extension of the tax cuts has centered on three broad issues its likely impact on the federal budget deficit its possible effect on longterm economic growth and its results for the fairness of the tax system in general opponents of an extension have argued that it would exacerbate budget situation already made difficult by the looming retirement of the babyboom generation and resulting stresses on the social security system those supporting extension maintain that the tax cutsthrough their positive effects on work effort and savingwill stimulate longterm growth development that will ease the advers effects of the tax cuts on the budget opponents question whether these effects will be large enough to offset the extensions budget effects with respect to fairness opponents of extending the measures argue that the tax cuts reduce the progressivity of the tax system by providing larger effective taxrate reductions for upperincome individuals than for persons in lower income brackets proponents of the taxcut extensions emphasize that they would provide tax cuts across all income classes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40004g15g138g147g152g155g561g22g138

expiration of the highest marginal tax rate and to extend others to some this modification would allow for compromise between the need to raise revenue while also improving fairness some believe that compromise might occur with the tate tax which is scheduled for repeal in 2010 to retain the tax but allow higher exemptions andor lower rates as economic stimulus considerations continue in december 2008 it is likely that the tax cut expirations may not be addressed in 2009 except for the estate tax as more pressing concerns about the economy take precedence

congressional interest both in revenuereducing measures for example scaling back the amt and concern about the federal budget deficit it appears likely that policymakers will also focus attention on possible revenueraising measures that would in effect help pay for taxcuts elsewhere one possible area is tax administration in the senate finance committee leaders from both parties have expressed interest in closing the tax gap and in possibly restricting tax shelters some provisions such as credit card reporting reporting the basis for capital gains and the economic substance doctrine have been considered in legislation as discussed above the tax gap and tax shelter concepts are closely related but not synonymous so clarification is useful the tax gap is concept defined by the internal revenue service for use in administering the tax codeit is the difference between the amount of tax voluntarily and timely paid by taxpayers and the actual tax liability of taxpayers the tax gap thus includes both deliberate and illegal tax evasion and nonpayment that occurs for more innocent reasons for example taxpayer error or simple inability to pay the concept of tax shelter is less precisely defined but is generally an economic concept though whether to make it legal one as well is in fact an issue that has been debated in congress and elsewhere tax shelter is taxplanning device that individual or corporate taxpayers use to either illegally evade or legally avoid taxes tax shelters often arise from the combination of different tax rules in ways that were not intended by policymakers g22g145g142g561g22g138g161g561g9g138g153g561 recent and projected large federal budget deficits have generated congressional and executive branch interest in raising revenue by reducing the tax gap other motivations for reducing the tax gap include adverse effects on 1 public trust in the fairness of the tax system which may adversely affect voluntary compliance with tax laws and 2 economic efficiency by providing an incentive for inputs of labor and capital to shift to those sectors of the economy with lower taxes 16 the irs defines the gross tax gap as the difference between the aggregate tax liability imposed by law for given tax year and the amount of tax that taxpayers pay voluntarily and timely for that year17 and it defines the net tax gap as the amount of the gross tax gap that remains unpaid 16 for comprehensive review of the literature on tax compliance see james adreoni brian erard and jonathan feinstein tax compliance journal of economic literature vol 36 2

year18 currently the measurements of these tax gap concepts exclude illegal activities because the irs lacks adequate data on these activities19 for tax year 2001 the irs estimates gross tax gap of 345 billion equal to noncompliance rate of 16320 for the same year irs enforcement activities coupled with other late payments recovered about 55 billion of the gross tax gap resulting in an estimated net tax gap of 290 billion 21 the estimated gross tax gap of 345 billion consists of underreporting of tax liability 285 billion nonfiling of tax returns 27 billion and underpayment of taxes 33 billion22 for 2001 the 285 billion of underreporting of tax liability had the following components 197 billion in individual income tax 54 billion in employment tax 30 billion in corporate income tax and 4 billion in estate taxes 23 there are estimates of the underreporting of excise taxes24 the percentage of individual income tax that was underreported varied significantly depending on the degree of information reporting and whether or not withholding was required for example only 12 of the sum of wages salaries and tips was underreported but 571 of nonfarm proprietor income was underreported these data suggest that increased information reporting and withholding would reduce the tax gap the increase d revenue would have to be weighed against higher administrative costs of the irs and higher compliance costs of individuals the estimates of the gross tax gap have been heavily publicized perhaps as result some public officials have emphasized better enforcement of tax laws to raise revenue according to some enforcement alone is likely to have limited impact on the gross tax gap acting on this view the irs is implementing what it terms comprehensive approach to reduce the gross tax gap three factors are seen limiting the net revenue pote ntial from increased enforcement first much of the gross tax gap for individual income tax filers is due to types of unreported income that are difficult to detect usually the income is not covered by thirdparty information returns eg income earned by informal business proprietors who operate on cash basis second even when the unreported income is detected some of the resulting tax liability cannot be easily collected particularly from those taxpayers who are currently unable to pay third many detected tax liabilities are so small relative to enforcement costs that it is not cost effective to pursue collection continued available at httpwwwirsgovtaxstatsproductsandpubsarticle0id13010300html 18 ibid 19 the irs made tax gap

considered comprehensive strategy for reducing the tax gap guided by the following four key principles25 unintentional taxpayer errors and intentional taxpayer evasion should both be addressed sources of noncompliance should be targeted with specificity enforcement activities should be combin ed with commitment to taxpayer service policy positions and compliance proposals should be sensitive to taxpayer rights and maintain an appropriate balance between enforcement activity and imposition of taxpayer burden26 in the 109th and 110th congresses numerous bills were introduced concerning the tax gap and many proposals were made in budgets submitted by the bush administration in the 111th congress bills relating to the tax gap may be introduced and presidentelect obama may include proposals to reduce the tax gap in his budget submissions g22g138g161g561g21g145g142g149g157g142g155g156g561 in popular usage the term tax shelter denotes the use of tax deductions or credits from one activity to reduce taxes on another in economic terms tax shelter can be defined as transaction for example paper investment or sale that reduces taxes without resulting in reduced return or increased risk for the participant27 but so vague and general is the term in most usages that it could also be defined simply as tax saving activity that is viewed as undesirable by the person or agency observing the activity and using the term tax shelters can be either legal tax avoidance or illegal tax evasion to the extent tax shelters are illegal they therefore contribute to the tax gap to the extent that they are legal but unintended uses of the tax law loopholes they reduce tax revenue beyond the loss caused by the tax gap like the tax gap tax shelters not only reduce tax revenue directly but raise questions about tax fairness among taxpayers not using shelters in addition while some shelters lack economic substance that is have effect on economic activity others involve the actual shifting of economic resources solely for the purpose of saving taxes and may thus reduce economic efficiency congress has evinced considerable interest in tax shelters in recent years and has enacted some restrictions into law the american jobs cr eation act of 2004 ajca pl 108357 contained number of provisions designed to restrict tax shelters in part the acts provisions were directed at specific tax

search for additional tax revenue for example during the 2008 election campaign democratic leaders included call to end tax breaks that reward companies for moving american jobs overseas economic theory is skeptical about whether tax policy towards us multinationals can have longterm impact on domestic employment although shortterm and localized impacts are certainly possible taxes can however alter the extent to which firms engage in overseas operations rather than domestic investment under current law tax benefit known as deferral poses an incentive for us firms to invest overseas in countries with relatively low tax rates in general terms deferral permits us firms to indefinitely postpone us tax on their foreign income as long as that income is reinvested ab road in foreign subsidiaries deferral is generally available for active business operations abroad but the tax codes subpart f provisions restrict deferral in the case of income from passive investment if made proposals to restrict deferral may consist of expansion in the range of income subject to subpart f in recent years however the thrust of legislation has been more in the direction of expanding deferral and cutting taxes for overseas operations than for expanding subpart f for example the american jobs creation act of 2004 cut taxes on overseas operations in several ways while in 2006 the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act tipra pl 109222 restricted subpart f in the case of banking and related businesses receiving active financing income and in the case of the look through treatment overseas operations receive from other firms further several analysts have recently argued that attempts to tax overseas operations are either counter productive or outmoded in the modern integrated world economy traditional economic analysis however suggests that overseas investment that is taxed at lower or higher rate than domestic income impairs economic efficiency

enforcement procedures in its standing rules these enforcement procedures generally restrict the size and shape of revenue and spending legislation and the timing of legislative action but may be set aside under certain circumstances one of the most important enforcement procedures affecting the development and consideration of revenue legislation is referred to as payasyougo paygo31 in essence paygo requires that legislation reducing revenues or increasing mandatory spending include offsetting revenue increases or mandatory spending decreases so that it is deficit neutral statutory paygo requirement was established in 1990 but effectively was terminated in late 2002 the house and senate each have their own paygo rule s the houses rule was established in 2007 and the senates rule in effect since 1993 was modified in 2007 in manner to make it comparable to the house rule both rules require deficit neutrality in revenue and direct spending legislation over both five and tenfiscalyear periods as well as the current fiscal year each chamber waived their paygo rules in the 110 th congress to consider in particular legislation dealing with the economic decline the 111th congress may consider revenue measures that could entail significant revenue loss including further modification to the alternative minimum tax and the extension of tax cuts that expire in 2010 the house and senate may choose to revise paygo by modifying their paygo rules restoring statutory requirement or both or other budget enforcement mechanisms to accommodate the consideration of such measures while promoting fiscal discipline over the long term

fy2008fy2013 the smaller revenue loss over the five year period compared to the first year is due to the shifting of tax deductions into the present from depreciation the tax rebates were equal to basic tax credit plus perchild tax credit the credits were refundable under the basic credit individuals received tax credit equal to the greater of two amounts that depended respectively on their precredit tax liability and their earned income first taxpayer could claim credit equal to their income tax liability but not to exceed 600 1200 for joint return for the earned income amount taxpayer could claim 300 tax credit 600 for joint return if the individual has at least 3000 in qualified income generally income from salaries and wages plus social security and veterans disability payments or an income tax liability of at least 1 and gross income exceeding the sum of the applicable standard deduction and one personal exemption two for joint returns the child tax credit was 300 for each qualifying child the tax credit was ultimately based on individuals 2008 tax and income and was issued from the us treasury during the 2008 calendar year with the treasury basing its distributions on individuals 2007 tax returns when filing their 2008 tax returns in 2009 individuals will recalculate the credit based on 2008 information and can claim an additional credit if the 2008 information increases the amount of the credit if the 2008 credit is less than that actually received individuals will not be required to pay the difference according to the treasury department the checks began to be issued in may 2008 33 the plan phased out the combined child and basic credit for individuals earning threshold amount of more than 75000 150000 for joint returns it reduced the credit by 5 of the individuals income in excess of the threshold phaseout threshold g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g22g138g161g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561 under current law businesses are allowed to expense ie deduct immediately the acquisition cost of limited amount of new investment in machines and equipment rather than depreciating it over period of years expensing thus provid postponement deferral of taxes which constitutes tax benefit because of the economic principle of discountingthe idea that given amount of funds is worth more the sooner it is received prior to the stimulus act for 2008 firms were permitted to expense up to 128000 of investment the allowance was gradually reduced phased out for firms whose investment exceeds 510000 threshold the 128000 amount was temporary increase over permanent cap of 25000 that is set to apply in 2011 and thereafter the permanent phaseout threshold is 200000 the stimulus bill provided one year for 2008 additional increase in the expensing cap and threshold to 250000 and 800000 respectively when not eligible for expensing outlays for tangible business propertythat is machines and equipment and commercial structuresare required to be deducted gradually ie depreciated over number of years for 2008 the stimulus plan provided temporarily more generous depreciation rules for machines and equipment under which 50 of the assets cost could be deducted in its first year like expensing this provision provided tax benefit in the form of deferral although it was not as large 33 brett ferguson congress passes 152 billion stimulus

demand side of the economy in the short run when aggregate demand is thought to be temporarily insufficient to ensure full employment of the economys resources in designing fiscal stimulus one consideration is therefore whether the chosen approach is effective in injecting funds into the economy individuals may save rather spend part of tax cut or transfers from the government and different stimulus tools may have different effects on saving second consideration is timing see for example the above statement by chairman bernanke stimulus measures address shortterm temporary slackness in aggregate demand and if stimulus is mistimed it may occur when the economy has resumed positive growth and thus contribute to inflationary pressures further at least part of fiscal stimulus is spent on imported goods which means that its impact is partly diluted finally fiscal stimulus can potentially reduce longrun economic growth countercyclical fiscal policy works by increasing the federal budget deficit and herein is quandary while tax cut or spending increase might boost demand in the short run its effect on the budget deficit can reduce longterm economic growth by reducing the amount of national saving available for investment because of these considerations fiscal stimulus package is frequently thought to be effective if it quickly and effectively injects funds into the economy but does not reduce longterm growth by permanently increasing the federal budget deficit 35 temporary or onetimeonly tax cuts or spending increases have sometimes been proposed as way to provide shortrun stimulus without perm anently reducing longrun growth in addition another specific design question facing policymakers is the appropriate mix of tax cuts and spending tools from strictly economic perspective the answer depends on the particular tax cut or spending increase that is chosen for example an increase in government spending can consist of either increased transfers to individuals for example increased payments under the various government incomesupport programs or an increase of government purchases here an increase in purchases would increase aggregate demand more than either an increase in transfers or tax cut of identical size because it is likely that at least part of the latter will be saved rather than spent 36 drawback to some types of government purchases however is that the government may not be able to put them into place quickly different types of tax cuts are also thought to vary in their effectiveness of injecting funds into the economy on the business side for example investment incentives are generally thought to provide more stimulus per dollar of revenue loss than cut in corporate tax rates because firms may spend part of the benefit from rate cut on increases in dividends rather than on investment and dividend recipients may save rather than spend part of the former for individuals there is empirical evidence suggesting that lowerincome individuals are more likely to spend more of tax cut or transfer payment than are higherincome persons in the case of both business and 34 for detailed analysis of the stimulus

impact on the budget deficit in the long run congress has enacted tax cuts in the recent past partly to provide fiscal stimulus the economic growth and tax reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 was enacted partly as means of boosting an economy that entered recession in march 2001 egtrra contained broad range of tax cuts but was designed partly to deliver an immediate stimulus and thus included ratereduction tax credit that was mailed to individuals in 2001 as checks from the us treasury 37 following the september 11 2001 attacks and in the midst of increased certainty that the economy was in recession congress considered additional fiscal stimulus proposals that initially included tax rebate for individuals the final stimulus package that was adopted the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 p l 107147 however did not contain rebate the act did include temporary bonus accelerated depreciation that was aimed at boosting business investment as well as temporary extension of net operating loss nol carrybacks for businesses prominent fiscal stimulus measures adopted in past decades were the revenue act of 1964 the kennedy tax cut of 1964 pl 88272 and the tax reduction act of 1975 pl 9412 the 1964 act reduced both individual and corporate tax rates and augmented the existing investment tax credit for businesses the 1975 measure included tax rebate 38

proposals considered by congress in 2007 was hr 3970 the tax reduction and reform act introduced by chairman charles rangel of the house ways and means committee on october 25 the bill was an omnibus tax package containing variety of both individual and corporate income tax provisions very preliminary revenue estimates indicate the bill would reduce revenue by net total of 538 billion over 5 years and by 75 billion over 10 years39 on the individual side chief focus of the bill was the individual alternative minimum tax amt as described elsewhere in this report without legislative action the amt will include an increasing portion of taxpayers in its scope the bill had two amt provisions 1 oneyear patch that did not repeal the tax but that extended temporarily higher exemption level and allowed nonrefundable regulartax credits to offset the amt and 2 complete repeal of the individual amt after 2007 ultimately temporary reduction in the scope of the amt for 2007 and 2008 was enacted

3970 proposed number of general tax cuts for individuals including an increased standard deduction an increased child tax credit and expansion of the number of taxpayers qualifying for the earned inco tax credit the bill would have extended for one year set of temporary individual income tax benefits extenders among the largest of these was the optional deduction for state and local sales taxes and the deduction for tuition in the fall of 2008 legislation was enacted the tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 pl 110343 to extend the temporary tax benefits through the end of 2009 in addition to these tax cuts the bill proposed number of revenueraising items applicable to individuals including surtax on upperincome individuals designed to offset the cost of repealing the amt restoration of limits on itemized deductions and the personal exemption and an increase in the floor for itemized deductions in addition the bill would have taxed the carried interest income of investment fund managers as ordinary income rather than capital gains the estimated net effect of the bills individual income tax cuts and revenueraisers was revenue loss of 450 billion over 5 years and 64 billion over 10 years in broad outline the proposals corporate income tax provisions coupled very large tax cut provisionreduction of the highest statutory tax rate to 305 from current laws 35with number of narrower but in some cases sizeable revenueraising items as with individuals the bill also proposed oneyear extension of tempor ary corporate tax benefits and it also would have made permanent temporarily increased expensing benefit applicable to investment in equipment by relatively small businesses prominent among the bills revenueraising measures was repeal of the tax deduction for domestic production and deferral of deductions attributable to taxdeferred foreignsource income together the estimated net revenue impact of the corporate provisions would have been to reduce revenue by 87 billion over 5 years and by 10 billion over 10 years g10g152g158g156g146g151g144g561g22g138g161g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343
