past 25 years several factors have been identif ied as possibly contributing to increasing income inequality some researchers have suggested the decline in unionization and falling real minimum wage as the primary causes others have argued that rising returns to education and skillbiased technol ogical change are th important factors explaining rising inequality most analysts agree that the likely explanation for rising income inequality is due to skillbiased technological changes combined with change in institutions and norms of which falling minimum wage and declining unionization are part since most people are concerned with upward mobility and given the central importance of income mobility to the debate over income inequality this report examines the relation between income mobility and inequality income mobility studies are an important complement to income inequality studies income inequality does not address the issue of whether or not the poor are getting poorer whereas income mobility does while there appears to be considerable relative income mobility about 60 of individuals change income quintiles over 10 years it is not far about 60 of those individuals who changed income qui ntile in the 1980s or 1990s only moved to the next quintile but most individuals in the poorest quintile in 1980 experienced an increase in their real income between 1980 and 1989 half saw their real income increase by more than 36 of those in the richest quintile almost half saw their real income fall by 10 or more durin g the 1980s but there are differences in income changes between the 1980s and the 1990s those in the poorest income quintile may have done slightly better in the 1990s than in the 1980s while individuals higher up in the income distri bution quintiles 25 appear to have done better in the 1980s than in the 1990s in both the 1980s nd 1990s income growth was progressive and had an equalizing effect on the income distributi on but the equalizing effect had larger absolute value in the 1990s than in the 1980s mobility however had disequalizing effect and in f act outweighed the progressiv ity effect thus increasing the annual inequality in both decades the longterm income inequality is lower than the income inequality in the first year of the decade the results suggest that mobility had greater equalizing eff ect on longterm inequality in the 1990s than in the 1980s three broad types of government econo mic policy affect income growth and mobility and hence income inequality 1 regulation 2 the tax system and 3

the house ways and means committee held hearing on economic opportunity in february 2007arguments are offered for and against reducing income inequality the classic argument against rising income inequality is the rich get richer and the poor get poorer this can increase poverty reduce wellbeing and reduce social cohesion consequently many argue that reducing income inequality may reduce various social ills some researchers are concerned bout the consequences of rising income inequality research has demonstrated that large income and class disparities adversely affect health and economic wellbeing7 in contrast there are those arguing that rising inequality is nothing to worry about and point out that average real income has been rising so while the rich are getting richer the poor are not necessarily getting poorer in addition many argue that some income inequality is n ecessary to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship the possibility of large rewards and high income are incentives to bear the risks furthermore many argue that income or social mobility reduces income inequality and increas wellbeing milton friedman argued in 1962 that mobility is an important determinant of wellbeing major problem in interpreting evidence on the distribution of income is the need to distinguish two basically different kinds of inequality temporary short run differences in income and differences in longrun income status consider two societies that have the same distri bution of annual income in one there is great mobility and change so that the pos ition of particular families in the income hierarchy varies widely from year to year in the other there is great rigidity so that each family stays in the same position year after year clearly in any meaningful sense the second would be the more unequal society8 since congress and most people are cerned with upward mobility and given the central importance of income mobility to the debate over income inequality this

aspects in rm haig ed the federal income tax new york columbia university press 1921 12 simons p 50 states that p ersonal income may be defined as the algebraic sum of 1 the market value of rights exercised in consum ption and 2 the change in the value of the store of property rights between the begi nning and end of the period in question 13 see for example w michael cox and richard alm you ar what you spend new york times oped contribution february 10 2008 p 14 14 the same reasoning would apply to an increase in debt which is subtraction from wealth 15 see appendix for more information on the definition of income used in the analysis pre government income includes only income from nongovernmental sources and excludes any adjustment for taxesexamining income inequality provides information on the dispersion of income and snapshot of wellbeing it does not provide dynamic info rmation on wellbeing over period of time are the same people always at the bottom of the income distribution income inequality does not ddress the issue of whether or not the poor are getting poorer whereas income mobility does what is income precise definition of income is important in studying inequality and mobility most people think of income as the salary they receive from their employer or adjusted gross income as reported on their income tax return broader definition of income is the haigsimons concept of income henry simons started from the proposition that personal income connotes broadly the exercise of control over the use of societys scarce resources10 robert haig defined income in terms of power to satisfy economic wants rather than in terms of satisfactions themselves11 both economists argue that income is the sum of consumption and additions towealth 12 there are some who argue that only consumption should be considered because they claim it is better measure of wellbeing13 but additions to wealth reflect rights that could have been exerci sed in consumption and may be so exercised in the future14 for analytic purposes income has to be measured and expressed in numerical terms in terms of national currency c onsequently consumed goods and services produced through home production such as child care services provided by family members and food grown by family members are not included in income since monetary value is difficult to calculate in this analysis income is measured in dollars and includes earnings asset income interest and dividends government cash transfers pension payments the face value of food stamps and transfers from private individuals realized capital gains are not included since they are not an annual income flow and vary greatly from year to year taxes which may be negative are subtracted to produce what is called postgovernment income15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34434crs4 16 see crs report rl34155 income inequality and the us tax system by thomas l hungerford 17 peter gottschalk and timothy m smeeding crossnational comparisons of earnings and income inequality journal of economic literature vol 35 2 june 1997 pp 633 687 18 see the appendix for description of how equivalenceadjusted income is calculatedincome inequality earnings and income inequality has been rising in the united states since 198016 the evidence suggests that the increase in inequality is primarily due to those at the top of the income distribution pu lling away from households lower down in the distribution furthermore it appears that the real incomes of the poor have been roughly steady over the past 25 years th united states is not the only industrial country experiencing rising income inequa lity income inequality also increased in most developed countries throughout the 1980s and 1990s though at different rates and starting from different levels17 one common measure to characterize income inequality is the gini coefficient which varies from 0 to 1 gini coefficient of 0 indicates that income is evenly distributed among the population that is everyone has the same income while value of 1 indicates perfect income inequality that is one individual has all the income the 20year trend from 1980 to 1999 of the gini coefficient for equivalenceadjusted family income is displayed in figure 1 18 source authors calculations of the panel study of income dynamics psid02025030350404505055 1980 1981 1982 1983

given fulltime minimum wage job the gini coeffi cient would be reduced by 14the top solid line in the figure shows the trend in pregovernment before taxes and receipt of government transfers income inequality between 1980 and 1999 the gini coefficient increased by 224 from 0408 to 0500 the bottom dashed line shows the 20year trend in the postgovernment after taxes and receipt of government transfers income inequality the postgovernment family income gini coefficient was also steadily increasing over this period increasing by 33 from 0307 in 1980 to 0408 in 1999 the trends in the two gini coefficients increase roughly in tandem the postgovernment income gini coeffi cient is about 30 lower than the pre government income gini coefficient this strongly indicates that government transfers and taxes have veling effect on the distributi on of income this leveling effect however appears to have not chan ged over this period tax and transfers were equally progressive throughout the period not all sources of postgovernment in come however have leveling effect for example research has shown that rising male earnings inequality is significant source of the rise in family income inequality while changes in female earnings have had an equalizing effect on family income inequality19 table 1 reports the estimated effect on the gini coefficient arising from 1 increase in an income source holding the level of other income sources constant for selected years20 increasing both labor income and asset income by 1 would lead to an increase in the gini coefficient in interpreting this result it must be kept in mind that if labor or asset income are zero then 1 increase is also zero only individuals with positive labor or asset income would benefit from this hypothetical increase21 consequently individuals at the top of the income distribution would benefit the most from such an increase overall the estimated results are qualitatively similar across the selected yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34434crs6 table 1 how changes in income from different sources affects income inequality 19801999 income sourcepercent change in gini from 1 increase in income

security pension and total taxe s have the effect of reducin g income inequality as measured by the gini coefficient these are the income sources that lead to the difference between pregovernment income and postgovernment income the estimated effect is negative in all of the selected years but the values vary somewhat from year to year total taxes appear to have the largest progressive effect on income inequality different taxes however have different effects on inequality payroll taxes such as social security taxes state income taxes and federal income taxes are separated and the individual effects on inequality are estimated see the last three rows of table 1 payroll taxes have the smalle st effect on inequality and the effect varies around zero positive and negative over the selected years suggesting these taxes have very little equalizing effects on income federal nd state income taxes have consistent negative effect on inequality that is reduces income inequality with

the basic facts journal of economic perspectives vol 11 2 spring 1997 p 24 24 longitudinal data contain information about sample of individuals and families over period of time which is collected from periodic surveyshaving the greatest equalizing effect this is arguably due to the refundable tax credits especially the earned income credit income mobility most people are concerned with upward mobility but upward mobility means different things to different people many think of upward mobility as increasing inflationadjusted or real income othe rs think of it as upward movement in the income distribution not only keeping up with the jones but surpassing them social scientists have deve loped several measures to examine the different concepts of income mobility22 two methods are used in this study to examine income mobility the first is transition matrix which compares persons place in the income distribution in the base year to his or her place in the distri bution in the final year of the period under consideration the second is the difference be tween real income in the base year and the final year these two measures pr ovide information on relative and absolute changes in wellbeing the two measur however may or may not provide consistent picture of income mobility for example it is possible for someone to experience downward relative mobility that is fall in the income distribution even though their real income is increasing it just didnt increase as much as other peoples income income mobility studies also can provide information on the relation between 1 inequality in one year with inequality in another and 2 shortterm inequality and longterm inequality the trend in inequality is affected by income growth and reranking or mobility within the income distribution whose income grows and by how much affects inequality additionally peter gottschalk notes that inequality in each subperiod and mobility across s ubperiods would both impact inequality of permanent or average earnings23 previous studies of income mobility several studies have examined income mobility over the past 20 years using variety of methods and l ongitudinal data sources24 researchers at the department of the treasury have produced three of these studies in each study the researchers use 10year sample of individual tax returns the earliest treasury study limited the sample to taxpayers who filed tax return in each of the 10 years between 1979httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34434crs8 25 us department of treasur office of tax analyst household income changes over time

continuedand 1988 the observation period25 their results show that 40 of the taxpayers who started out in the poorest income quintile in 1979 ended in the richest two income quintiles 10 years later while only 14 remained in the poorest quintile this sample selection criteria however eliminates many lower income individuals who do not file tax return in one or more years for example many elderly families are not included who tend to remain near th bottom of the income distribution the treasury sample therefore is statistically biased towards finding little downward mobility the next two treasury studies focus on the 10year period 1987 to 1996 or 1996 to 200526 the sample is limited to taxpayers who filed tax return in the first year 1987 or 1996 and the final year of the period 1996 or 2005 consequently the sample is little more repres entative of the us population than in the first treasury study but taxpayers under age 25 in the firs t year are eliminated from the analysis the sample selection criteria still omits many lower income individuals and families who do not file tax return such as the elderly the two studies find that lifetime income is more equally distributed that is inequality is lower than income in single year because of considerable m obility for example both studies find that more than half of those taxpayers in th poorest income quintile move up to higher quintiles by the final year the upward m ovement however is not far about half of those who move up in the distribution only move to the next income quintile as with the first treasury study the sample selection criteria yields sample that is statistically biased toward finding upward mobility and little downward mobility several studies have used the university of michigans panel study of income dynamics psid to examine income mobility the psid is well suited for studying income mobility because 1 it is repres entative of the broader us population rather than of taxpayers 2 it include s sources of income not reported on tax returns but not capital gains and 3 it includes detailed demographic information on the individuals and families in the sample all the studies find considerable income mobility but less than was found in the three treasury studies and the movement is not very far one researcher concludes that the rags to riches success stories are fairly rare as well as riches to rags sob stories27 the same researcher also found that when longer term measure of income is considered individuals appear less mobile within the income distri bution another study found that mobility increases when the length of the time pe riod under consideration increases but again observed mobility rates are lower than those found in the treasury studies28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34434crs9 28 continued demography vol 36 3 august 1999 pp 299314 29 katherine bradbury and jane katz are lifetime incomes growing more unequal looking at new evidence

studies finds that earnings mobility has declined significantly over the years31 another study finds that changes in earnings mobility have been smaller than changes in inequality and the authors conclude that changes in mobility have not substantially affected the evolution of inequality so that annual snapshots of the distribution provide good approximation of the evolution of the longer term measures of inequality32 relative income mobility in the 1980s and 1990s transition matrices of relative income mobility are reported in table 2 for the 1980s panel and the 1990s panel b two summary measures of association are shown in the last two rows of each pane l one measure is the immobility ratio which shows the proportion of individuals not changing income quintiles between the first and final year the other measure is cramérs v which has range of 1 to 1 with value of 1 indicating perfect association between the income quintile in the first year and the final year quintile that is mobility the first row in panel of table 2 shows that of the poorest 20 of individuals the poorest quintile in 1980 53 were still in the poorest quintile 10 years later while 25 made it to the richest quintile t he traditional horatio alger rags to riches success story the immobility ratio is 0377 indicating that overall 377 of the individuals remained in the same income quintile between the two years while there appears to be considerable mobility it is not far about 60 of those individuals who changed income quintile between 1980 and 1 989 only moved to the next quintile the same overall pa ttern is seen for the 1990s in panel b but both the immobility ratio and cramérs v are larger suggesting relative income mobility was lower in the 1990s than in the

experience downward mobility all the marginal effects are statistically significant the results also suggest that individuals from larger families are more likely to experience upward mobility the quantitative results for the two decad however are quite different the estimated effect of having more than high school education on upward mobility is considerably lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s 334 for the 1980s versus 102 for the 1990s the individuals in the olde st age group 65 or older were much less likely to experience upward mobility compa red to the youngest age group in the

and mobility contribute to changes in income inequality over time income growth can have an equalizing progressive effect on incomes if the income of those individuals at the botto m of the income

figure 1 the reshuffling or reranking income mobility in the income distribution between two points in time affects inequality through disequalizing effect34 the progressivity effect focuses solely on

larger absolute value in the 1990s than in the 1980s the reranki ng effect however had disequalizing effect and in fact outweighed the progre ssivity effect in both decades reranking or relative income mobility had the effect of increasing the annual gini coefficient income mobility can reduce longterm income inequality however with high income mobility individuals at the top or the bottom of the income distribution will not necessarily be there in the future suggesting that longerterm incomes may be more equal than annual inco mes consequently longt erm inequality will be lower than

affect the trend in inequality in the 1980s and 1990s the equalizing effect of income growth was more than offset by the disequalizing effect of mobility three br oad types of govern ment economic policy affect income growth and mobility and hence income inequality 1 regulation and legislation 2 the tax system and 3 gove rnment transfers each of these three types of economic policy affect inequality through different mechanisms regulation and legislation can affect income inequality directly by reducing the extreme ranges of the income distributi on for instance increasing in the minimum wage increases the earnings of lowwage workers who are often near the bottom of the income distribution36 efforts to reduce excessive executive pay could reduce the growth in executive pay and could reduce or limit increases in income inequality by affecting the upper tail of the income distribution37 enforcement of anti discrimination laws can help keep workers from falling to the bottom of the income distribution by safeguarding wages and employment opportunity for the aged women and minorities it is often argued however that these policies have unintended consequences many claim that minimum wage hikes for example reduce employment among lowskilled individuals although recent empirical research shows there is little or disemployment effect from raising the minimum wage38 earnings and income can be quite volatile and large reductions in familys income reduce economic wellbeing it is this income volatility that causes mobility within the income distribution which in turn contributes to rising income inequality the progressive personal income tax system is part of redistributive taxtransfer system that insures individuals and families against risks of volatile income associated with human capital and random events39 one analyst shows that redistributive taxation can reduce variation in aftertax income and that the optimal income tax may be progressive tax40

that the federal income tax system while progressive has become less progressive at the top of the income distribution since 196042 additionally many tax deductions exclusions and exemptions are targeted to higher income taxpayers thus further reducing the progressivity of the income tax system43 government transfers both social insura nce for example social security and unemployment

reductions due to risks associated with human capital and random events44 protected by this insurance function indi viduals may engage in risky but profitable economic activities they would otherwise not undertake in th absence of such protection which can increase economic growth the insurance protection of the redistri butive taxtransfer system however may create moral hazard problem indivi duals may recklessly engage in risky economic activities or neglect to take necessary precautions in their economic activities in addition the redistribution ma also involve some inefficiencies the socalled leaky bucke t of arthur okun45 the inefficiencies the leaks in the bucket carrying money from the rich to the poor include the administrative costs of collecting taxes and operating the social welfare programs as well as the disincentives associated with taxes and government transfers the disincentive effects while real and measurable are of ten not as large as expected but research continues on the estimation of these effects46 concluding remarks income mobility can affect income inequality in two ways first the disequalizing effect of reranking or mobility has contributed to rising inequality sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34434crs18 1980 second mobility has an equalizing ffect on longerterm income though the effect appears to be small economic policies to reduce the growth of income inequality may work in part through their effects on income mobility reducing income mobility that is stabilizing incomes may reduce the rising trend in income inequality but it could also increase inequality of longerterm income the specific effect on longerterm inequality however depends on how the policy affects mobility it is possible for example that policies establishing an income floor could reduce both the rising trend in income inequality and inequality of longerterm incomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34434crs19 47 see barbara butrica and richard v burkhauser estimating

income and ft is the cumulative distribution of income the change in inequality is directional change and compares inequality in the base year with inequality in the final year the choice of reference point the base year or th final year gives rise to an index number issue in the present case the forwardl ooking perspective is the natural one to use consequently the base year 1980 or 1990 is the reference point52 the first component is the progressivity effect of income growth between the two years for example if the income of those individuals at the bottom of the income distribution grows faster than for those individuals at the top then income inequality will decrease holding other fact ors constant in this case the income growth effect will be negative indicating income growth is progressive the second component is the effect of reranking or mobility within the income distribution this component is an averag of changes in income ranks ie place in the income distribution weighted by relative income it will be equal to zero when there is reranking and positive otherwise income mobility also affects longterm income inequality an equalization measure developed by gary
