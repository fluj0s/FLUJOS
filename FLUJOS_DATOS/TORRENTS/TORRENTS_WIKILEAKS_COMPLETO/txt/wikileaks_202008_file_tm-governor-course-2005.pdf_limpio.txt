teach transcendental meditation technique non certified governors are not governors governors will need to be r ecertified every five years or so anything dealing with lecturing or teaching or checking except an initiator checking his initiates can only be done by recer tified governors but teacher of tm who is not certified can be hired in some ot her capacity at peace palace r some other

is unknown pricing of tm program proposed to be on 3 levels 2500 4000 6000 anything above 2500 would be tax deductible donation this idea is not yet finalized when presenting fees use very elevating words very respectful and very cheerful if man donates or not he will do that when he wants we dont mind not too much attention on money the policy is only recertified governors can teach his father parents if the father really wants to learn he needs to pay the fee and learn properly otherwise he is not respecting the knowledge and what it can do to say he will only start i f it is free is like

sales permit in each s tat also insurance is necessary on 2 levels 1 for general 100000 monthly revenue means 100mo insurance that we pay this covers general accidents that could occur so we make sure

this comes w their 100year membership for setting up new spa and building it out you must get building permit which takes 60 days per location for regional permityou must follow up regularly or it will take longer regional permits may vary per state raja rogers says that 2 cit ies may be so close as to be in separable but have different restrictionssome strict and some not s strictknow these

additional points from governor who has already set up spa have someone contact th town do it on names basis just find out if they have any rules on health spas that offer massage be careful about how this is worded massage parlors have bad reputation all over the us and towns dont want them so make sure that you ta lk about opening health spa be careful there too though if they think it is medical clinic there are whole set of rules that relate to that you might want to call the health and human services commission t confirm hat the state only regulates massage therapists and not massage establishments again do it on names basis 6 maharishi vedic organic agriculture guiding principles have farms everywhere advertise as vedic organic and explain that this higher price covers the cost of growing the produce with the vedic melodies this is nectar action steps organic means food grown without toxins of any sort pesticides or herbi cides and not genetically engineered maharishi vedic organic means that the plants also have the adde d healthy influence that as they grow they are nourished by the vedic melodies of natur vedic organic produce enlivens the deepest values of natures

maharishi sthapatya veda guiding principles really for peace to be enjoyed on earth reconstruction is vital point without proper vastu there will always be problems those who really want to be peaceful in life have to live in vastu the individual consciousness administers the individual body the cosmic consciousness administers the physiology of the galactic body if the rela tionship between individual and cosmic consciousness is not harmonious then there is discomfort or disease in the individual physiology it is therefore necessary to establish an unbreakable relationship be tween individual and cosmic consciousness through transcendental consciousness and an unbreakable relationship between the individual body and the cosmic body through sthapatya veda remember we are going to rebuild world in every way this is huge undertaking so we must inspire all builders to re construct all cities and must build bes ide existing cities 7a peace palaces guiding principles
