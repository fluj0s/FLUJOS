cuts to stimulate the economy followed the terrorist attacks of 2001 which heightened concerns about an economic slowdown among the tax proposals discussed were corporate rate cut and an investment subsidy march 2002 tax cut contained temporary partial expensing for equipment interest in this issue continued including proposals by president bush for reductions in taxes on corporations through temporary dividend relief which were enacted in may 2003 the temporary bonus depreciation expired at the end of 2004 dividend relief was extended through 2010 in legislation passed in 2006 temporary bonus depreciation was also part of recent fiscal stimulus package adopted in 2008 pl 110185 some economists doubt the efficacy of fiscal policy in general even when stimulus is needed especially in an open economy and given the difficulties of achieving proper timing also deficit financing of tax cut has potential negative long run effects because it crowds out investment stimulus designed to increase investment spending rather than consumption spending would if successful reduce that negative effect investment subsidies had largely been abandoned as countercyclical devices over the last two decades in part because of lack of evidence from statistical studies relating investment spending to the cost of capital some recent empirical evidence has found some larger effects at least with some studies although not enough to suggest that all of the tax cut is spent especially with corporate rate reductions moreover the average behavioral response identified in these studies may be larger than responses during downturn when many firms have excess capacities and planning lags may make investment responses poorly timed recent studies of the 2002 temporar investment stimulus tended to find it relatively ineffective stimulus measure an investment subsidy has more bangforthebuck than corporate rate cut or dividend relief since the latter benefits existing as well as new capital corporate rate cut is estimated to produce as little as twothirds of the investme nt induced by an investment credit with an equivalent revenue loss the historically most common investment subsidy is the investment credit although the same effect could be achieved with accelerated depreciation or partial expensing temporary investment credit would be more effective than permanent one and temporary investment credit could also be made incremental it is not really possible to structure permanent incremental credit one disadvantage of permanent investment credit is that it distorts the allocation of investment and can easily produce negative tax rates 10 investment credit would produce negative tax rates in excess of 100 for shortlived assets arguments have been for corporate tax rate cut because of estimated large effects on the stock market these calculations are overstated because they do not account for the adjustment process and of interest rate increases given the uncertainty about the size of stock market effects or their beneficial effect on the economy there is case for not considering stock market effects an important factor in choosing an investment subsidy this

economy followed the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 which heightened concerns about an economic slowdown among the tax proposals that were discussed in the 107th congress were corporate rate cut and an investment credit an investment credit could be considered on either temporary or permanent basis on october 24 2001 the house passed hr 3090 which included temporary partial expensing for three years provision similar to an investment credit the bill also contained some other provisions including repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and an extension of net operating loss carrybacks proposals developed in the senate contained business tax cuts as well the finance committee chairmans plan included several tax cuts for bu siness allowing 10 of investments placed in service to be expensed an increase in expensing dollar limits for small businesses and some other provisions the finance republicans plan would provide 30 expensing and repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax but without refunding accumulated credits immediately as was the case in hr 3090 the 10 one year expensing provision was included in the version of hr 3090 that was approved by the senate finance committee on november 8 2001 this bill did not pass the senate however majority leader daschle proposed streamlined bill using hr 622 as vehicle that would include 30 one year expensing provision final version of hr 3090 approved in early march of 2002 included the house expensing provision two years at 30 this provision was referred to as bonus depreciation further action was taken in the 108 th congress at the beginning of 2003 president bush proposed corporate tax relief in the form of an exclusion for dividends and step up in basis this proposal provides tax reductions for corporate income to the investors rather than the firm the effects would probably be similar to corporate rate cuts in the long run but may have different effects in the short term in particular such cuts might be more likely to be translated into spending because they would be received directly by individuals in hr 2 enacted in may 2003 provision allowing 15 maximum tax rate on both dividends and capital gains was enacted the provision expires in 2008 this bill also increased the bonus depreciation rate to 50 and extended it through 2004 bonus depreciation expired at the end of 2004 as the economy recovered interest in short run stimulus measures diminished short run stimulus again became topic of concern in the aftermath of hurricane katrina dividend relief was extended in legislation passed in 2006 through 2010 although not on the grounds of shortterm stimulus recent problems in the mortgage markets and concerns about the economy have prompted new interest in fiscal stimulus the stimulus propos recently adopted pl 110185 included two major components an individual income tax rebate and temporary bonus depreciation similar to that enacted for 20022004 this report discusses issues associated with the use of business tax subsidies first is fiscal policy appropriate second how successful are subsidies likely to be and what form might they take to be most effective finally what other consequences might flow from the use of business tax subsidies especially if they are to be permanent investment subsidies have typically been provided through an investment tax credit the investment tax credit was originally introduced in 1962 as permanent subsidy but it came to be used as countercyclical device it was temporarily suspended in 19661967 and restored prematurely as an antiinflationary measure it was repealed in 1969 also as an antiinflationary i

and made permanent in 1976 after that time the credit tended to be viewed as permanent feature of the tax system at the same time economists were increasingly writing about the distortions across asset types that arose from an investment credit the tax reform act of 1986 moved toward system that was more neutral within the limits of empirical estimates of depreciation and repealed the investment tax credit while lowering tax rates investment subsidies can also be provided through accelerated depreciation but these measures tend not to be used for countercyclical purposes at least one reason for not using accelerated depreciation for temporary countercyclical purposes is because such revision would add considerable complexity to the tax law if used in temporary fashion since different vintages of investment would be treated differently an inve stment credit by contrast occurs the year the investment is made and when repealed only requires firms with carryovers of unused credits to compute credits an exception to the problem with accounting complexities associated with accelerated depreciation is partial expensing that is allowing fraction of investment to be deducted up front and the remainder to be depreciated this partial expensing approach also is neutral across all assets it applies to but the cash flow effects are more concentrated in the present and revenue is gained in the future temporary partial expensing provision allowing 30 of investments in equipment to be expensed over the next two years was included in hr 3090 in 2002 and expanded to 50 and extended through 2004 in tax legislation enacted in 2003 it expired in 2004 the new stimulus proposal h r 5240 pl 110185 also included temporary bonus depreciation for 2008 historically corporate rate changes have tended not to be used for countercyclical purposes the recent interest in the corporate tax rate cuts appears associated with arguments about the effects of tax changes on stock markets similar argument has been made for capital gains tax cut the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax included in an earlier version of hr 3090 in 2001 is similar to corporate tax rate in some respects but its effects on marginal investments are uncertain and could possibly discourage investment

stimulus during the 20022003 period and while many economists supported stimulus more recently in 2008 some uncertainty remained moreover economists have in general become more skeptical of fiscal policy as countercyclical tool particularly through the mechanism of tax cuts because of lags in decisionmaking and administrative lags in getting tax cuts to individuals fiscal stimulus enacted through tax cut can be poorly timed finally in an open economy with flexible exchange rates some of the fiscal stimulus can be offset through decline in net exports as increased interest rates attract capital from abroad and bid up the price of the dollar concerns about the path of the economy led to proposals for fiscal stimulus including support from the chairman of the federal reserve board as

the objective of fiscal stimulus is to increase spending and fiscal policies can differ in the extent to which they induce spending while fiscal stimulus delivered through direct spending has relatively straightforward effect fiscal stimulus delivered via personal tax cut tends to have more muted effect on the economy because only part of it will be spent the smaller the share spent the smaller the stimulus although for most types of tax cuts the presumption is that much of the tax reduction will be spent there are however theoretical reasons to believe that higher income individuals will spend smaller fraction of tax cut and empirical evidence to support that view 2 indeed the propensity to save makes capital gains tax cuts which have been under discussion questionable candidates for stimulating aggregate demand3 there is also fear that consumers who feel uncertainty about the future will not spend tax cut note that there is tension between short run and long run fiscal policy measures that increase consumption are expansionary in the short run but may detract from growth in the long run because deficit finance causes aggregate savings to fall unless the economy is at such low rate of employment that the stimulus induces sufficient output to offset the loss in savings that is government spending and tax reductions financed by deficits tend to crowd out investment however if the policy could be in form that would stimulate investment spending this negative effect on long run growth might be avoided gove rnment investment spending such as spending on infrastructure is one possibility that could provide short run stimulus without detracting much from long term growth and can even enhanc longterm growth if the productivity of the government investment is greater than the productivity of private investments however it is often difficult to enact and implement such spending in timely fashion another policy aimed at expanding investment is subsidy to private inve stment spending if the revenue loss which adds to the deficit were spent on investment there would be crowding out there is however caveat if the type of business subsidy is one that is permanent and not neutral in the long run the economy will also sustain permanent loss in efficiency from the misallocation of capital the success of such policy hinges on the effectiveness of investment subsidies in inducing spending it is difficult to determine the effect of business tax cut and particularly the timing of induced investment business tax cut is aime d at stimulating investment largely through changes in the cost or price of capital if there is little marginal stimulus or if investment is not responsive to these price effects in the short run then most of the cut may be saved either used to pay down debt or paid out in dividends some of the latter might eventually be spent after lag that is if tax cut simply involved cash payment to firm most of it might be saved particularly in the short run business tax cuts of most types also have effects on rates of return that increase the incentive to invest and it is generally for that reason that investment incentives have been considered as countercyclical devices 2 recent study that finds evidence of higher marginal propensities to save among wea lthy individuals is jonathan mccarthy

studies of aggregate investment using factors such as the tax credit or other elements that affect the tax burden on capital or the price of capital as explanatory variables tended to find little or relationship4 number of criticisms could be made of this type of analysis among them the possibility that tax subsidies and other interventions to encourage investment were made during periods of econom ic slowdown recent study using micro data found an elasticity the percentage change in investment divided by the percentage change in the user cost of capital for equipment of 0255 widely cited study by cummins hassett and hubbard used panel data and tax reforms as natural experiments and found effects that suggest price elasticity of 066 for equipment 6 this last estimate is much higher estimate than had previously been found and reflects some important advances in statistical identification of the response yet it is not at all clear that this elasticity would apply to stimulating investment in the aggregate during downturn when firms have excess capacity that is firms may have larger response on average to changes in the cost of capital during normal times or times of high growth when they are not in excess capacity certainly one might expect the response to be smaller in low growth periods an additional problem is that the timing of the investment stimulus may be too slow to stimulate investment at the right time if it takes an extensive period of time to actually plan and make an investment then the stimulus will not occur very fast compared to cut in personal taxes that stimulates consumption indeed the stimulus to investment could even occur during the recovery when it is actually undesirable there is some evidence that the temporary bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 had little or effect on business investment study of the effect of temporary expensing by cohen and cummins at the federal reserve board found little evidence support for significant effect 7 they suggest several potential reasons for small effect one possibility is that firms without 4 summary of this early literature can be found in several sources for nontechnical summary see

study knittel confirmed that firms did not elect bonus depreciation for about 40 of eligible investment and speculated that the existence of losses and loss carryovers may have made the investment subsidy ineffective for many firms although there were clearly some firms that were profitable that did not use the provision8 cohen and cummins also suggested that the incentive effect was quite small largely because depreciation already occurs relatively quickly for most equipment reducing the user cost of capital by only about 3 that planning periods may be too long to adjust investment across time and that adjustment costs outweighed the effect of bonus depreciation knittel also suggests that firms may have found the provision costly to comply with particularly because most states did not allow bonus depreciation study by house and shapiro found more pronounced response to bonus depreciation given the magnitude of the incentive but found the overall effect on the economy was small which in part is due to the limited category of investment affected and the small size of the incentive 9 their differences with the cohen and cummins study reflect in part uncertainties about when expectations are formed and when the incentive effects occur cohen and cummins also report the results of several surveys of firms where from 23 to over 90 of respondents indicated bonus depreciation had effect on the timing of investment spending overall bonus depreciation did not appear to be very effective in providing shortterm economic stimulus it is possible however that stimulus during current times when losses are not as large as they were in 20022004 when the economy was already in recession could be more successful

ratio of induced spending to revenue loss the general type of tax incentive whether one can increase the incentive per dollar of revenue loss by making the subsidy temporary and whether one can be successful by restricting the subsidy to marginal investment 8 matthew knittel corporate response to bonus depreciation bonus depreciation for tax years 20022004 us department of treasury office of

generally an investment credit or other subsidy confined to investment such as accelerated depreciation has more bang for the buck than corporate rate cut or dividend relief because it does not reduce taxes on the flow of income to existing capital assets the size of both the absolute amount and the difference between an investment credit and corporate rate cut depend on the durability of the investment as derived in the appendix corporate rate cut has an effectiveness compared to an investment credit given economic depreciation based on the ratio gd rd where g is the normal growth rate r is the after tax rate of return d is the economic depreciation rate and u is the corporate tax rate setting g r and u to 0025 005 and 035 respectively this measure suggests 69 ratio for structures assuming d equals 03 and 88 ratio for equipment assuming an average depreciation rate of 015 as d gets very large the value approaches 100 and as it gets very small the value approaches 50 thus corporate rate cut will stimulate from almost ⅔ to less than 90 as much investment per dollar of revenue loss as an investment subsidy directed at the same type of investment note also that the superior performance of the investment credit relative to the corporate rate cut is less pronounced for short lived assets this effect occurs because investment is larger relative to the existing capital stock because of the need to replace the stock more frequently corporate assets also include non reproducible capital eg land that receives tax reduction with investment increase which also reduces the stimulus per dollar of revenue loss the relative size of the stimulus also depends on the ratio of growth to return and on preexisting subsidies at the extreme with expensing the corporate rate cut will have effect at the same time short lived assets may have somewhat larger absolute bang for the buck for an investment credit since the size of the stimulus per dollar of revenue loss is e1uz where is the investment demand elasticity and z is the present value of tax depreciation which is larger for short lived assets for the typical equipment investment if is 025 each dollar of revenue loss from an investment credit produces 35 cents of investment for structures assuming the same elasticity the increase is 28 cents even at the high elasticities estimated at 066 these increases would not be dollar for dollar the equipment investment would increase by 92 cents and the structures by 74 cents note however that the elasticities could vary across assets and in particular could be smaller for structures another aspect of an investment credit vs corporate rate cut is the degree of certainty about the subsidy if businesses fear that lower corporate rates will subsequently be raised they will have less of an incentive to invest indeed perception that corporate rates could be increased could actually have negative effects on investment as discussed below investment credits however are allowed at the time of the investment and are certain since tax benefits would be highly unlikely to be retroactively disallowed some other types of corporate tax changes can be likened more to an investment subsidy or to rate reduction an acceleration of depreciation allowing costs of investments to be deducted more quickly or allowing expensing deducting the entire cost when the expenditure is made httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31134g23g156g146g151g144g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g22g138g161g561g5g158g157g156g561g157g152g561

the alternative minimum tax10 provides benefit for existing assets but mixed effects on investment since the marginal tax burden on investments under the minimum tax can be greater than or less than the burden under the regular tax for firms permanently on the minimum tax the tax burden on new investment is actually smaller than the tax burden under the regular tax so that repealing the minimum tax would actually discourage investment in this case modification of the minimum tax by allowing accelerated depreciation methods lives are already equated or virtually equated would be like an investment subsidy for firms th at remain under the alternative minimum tax but could have mixed effects if the change caused fi rms to switch to the regular tax it would be less likely to discourage investment than repeal of the tax expanding the net operating loss carry back periods or investment tax credit carryback periods if such credit were enacted has large cash flow effect which is like corporate rate cut but it would also allow more firms to benefit more fully from investment subsidies and existing accelerated depreciation note that dividend relief is similar to rate cut in that it affects the return to current investment if provided to individuals in the form of an exclusion or lower rate rather than to the firm as deduction the incentive may be lessened since there is direct and immediate effect on the firm capital gains relief for individuals is even less effective because provides benefits for income accumulated in the past as well as current income

been attempts to increase the bang for the buck two methods have been proposed and could be combined the first is to make the investment tax credit temporary theoretically temporary investment subsidy like the investment credit would have more pronounced effect on investment in the short run than permanent one and of course would cost much less like temporary sale demand should shift and firms should move planned investment spendi ng forward it is however very hard to find good empirical evidence of this effect in part because the same problems that have plagued earlier empirical studies remain among them the fact that temporary subsidies have been enacted during downturn and assuming that investment is only shifted the crowding out issue still remains another of the difficulties with temporary subsid ies is that in order for them to have more powerful effect that permanent subsidies investors have to believe that such subsidies will indeed be temporary although the bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 was allowed to expire it was extended and expanded in 2003 and historical experience teaches otherwise temporary subsidies have tendency to become permanent as noted above the empirical evidence suggests that even temporary subsidy was not very effective as an economic stimulus although the reasons for that are not entirely clear and studies face many difficulties it is possible that such stimulus would be more effective currently without the overhang of losses from recession note that temporary corporate rate cut will have the opposite effect relative to permanent rate cut it will have little effect on new investment in fact temporary rate cut could discourage 10 the alternative minimum tax is tax system that imposes an alternative tax with lower rate and broader base that must be paid if higher than the regular rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31134g23g156g146g151g144g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g22g138g161g561g5g158g157g156g561g157g152g561

deductions are larger in the early part of an investments life than should be the case to reflect economic depreciation while they are too small in the later part11

focus more of the effect on the margin such subsidy was discussed at the beginning of president clintons administration subsidy could be more focused on the margin by applying it only to investment in excess of fixed base while temporary incremental subsidy is feasible it is virtually impossible to design permanent incremental subsidy this issue is complicated one which is discussed in considerable detail in crs study written at that time12 g5g152g151g156g142g154g158g142g151g140g142g156g561g152g143g561g18g142g155g150g138g151g142g151g157g561g22g138g161g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561g561

lower corporate tax rate may up to point increase economic efficiency because currently corporate income is taxed more heavily than other types of capital income corporate rate is also neutral across different types of assets moreover corporate tax rate reduction cannot go to the point that investments are subject to negative tax rates an investment credit however has the potential for distorting investment because it favors short lived assets and is generally applied only to certain categories of investment it can also easily produce negative tax rates moreover with the present value of depreciation so high because of low inflation rates and the tax rate much lower than in the past historical levels of investment credits will produce negative tax rates consider fiveyear property which accounts for about 44 of investment depending on the time of year the investment is made we estimate the present value of depreciation deductions assuming 7 nominal discount rate reflecting 5 real return and 2 inflation rate is between 086 and 089 per dollar of investment depe nding on the time of year the investment is made to avoid negative tax rates any investment credit that does not have basis adjustment that is depreciation is allowed on the entire investment not just the cost net of the credit cannot exceed 385 at the higher present value and 49 at the lower value with basis adjustment the credit can range between 559 and 7 the zero tax rate is reached when the present value of tax depreciation deductions multiplied by the tax rate plus the credit exceed the tax rate times the investment 13 11 proposal to exploit this effect by enacting future corporate rate cut could work in theory but is unlikely to be very effective if firms doubt that the rate cut would actually take pl ace it would also not provide firms with cash flow to make increased investments 12 see crs report 93209 incremental investment subsidies by jane g gravelle 13 these estimates measure effective tax rates at the firm level rates would increase because of the individual level tax by shareholders but would decrease because of the deduction of the inflation portion of interest by firm with higher tax rates the net effects depend in part on whether investments made through pension funds and iras are considered continued

assets would have marginal effective tax rate of 122 to 196 that is negative effective tax rate the computation of effective tax rates is explained in the appendix accelerated depreciation methods can be designed to be more neutral and there are several types of investment subsidies that are relatively neutral at least across the assets they apply to including partial expensing allowing credits only for investment in excess of depreciation or varying credits with asset durability however the largest distortion that has typically occurred is between assets eligible for credits or accelerated depreciation and assets that are not eligible primarily equipment in the former case and structures in the latter case partial expensing in hr 3090 is restricted to equipment but is not permanent

by raising the stock market price it is not clear what consequences rise in the stock market induced by tax changes might have as an independent influence on the economy although such rise might help to maintain consumer confidence in the economic outlook 14 some simple calculations of this effect have been discussed based on comparing tax rates for example cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 very large cut which would lead to an increase of around 15 based on the ratio of 1t1t where t is the new tax rate of 025 and t is the old tax rate of 035 this calculation is based on rational expectations view of the world rather than any empirical measures of the supply and demand responses in the stock market that some economists would prefer to use even so this analysis is partial equilibrium one that does not take account of three important effects the expected adjustment of the capital stock in response to change adjustment costs of such changes and the possibility of higher interest rates we discuss these in turn consider simple adjustment process where ge ometric adjustment path occurs in that case beginning at time zero the rate of return t years into the future given fixed after tax rate of return r will be pt r1t r1tr1te g t and the after tax rate of return be rt pt1t if this expression is integrated summed after being discounted at rate r from time zero to infinity the same approach that produces the original 15 price increase the increase in the continued marginal for unincorporated businesses rates could be higher or lower absolute value of the negative rates lower or higher depending on the marginal tax rate of the individual they would probably be lower that is have higher subsidy rate 14 for discussion focused specifically on the dividend

initial effect on the stock market will be only half as big this value will also begin to fall as time goes on until it returns to its original value15 secondly the value will be reduced if the firm faces adjustment temporary loss of productivity due to alteration of the productive processes how quickly this adjustment path occurs and the magnitude of adjustment costs is something we know relatively little about in an empirical sense but it will clearly reduce perhaps significantly the initial increase in value the second problem with the analysis of stock market effects is that it not only assumes adjustment costs but assumes there are other effects in the economy that might alter the rate at which earnings are discounted but the interest rate will almost certainly rise indeed in simple world with only one asset and fixed savings rate even ignoring the resource claims on the deficit by assuming the revenue is made up elsewhere tax cut simply increases the after tax rate of return and raises the discount rate just enough to offset the rate cut the result is that there would be effect on the stock market this criticism is perhaps more serious one which could greatly reduce any potential effect on the stock market but without general equilibrium analysis such an effect cannot be estimated indeed one could argue that the future tax cuts are causing the stock market values to decrease by increasing future interest rates and also discouraging investment for the same reason 16 note that according to this type of analysis the effect of an investment credit on the stock market can either raise or lower stock prices while profits rise in the short run in the long run the value of financial assets relative to the physical value of the firms assets falls if the investment credit were 10 for example the asset value would fa ll by 10 with two opposing forces in play the initial effect on the stock market is uncertain according to rational expectations theory which may be one of the reasons that some analysts have proposed rate cut rather than an investment credit for those economists who doubt that rational expectations approach is the best method of predicting the effects on the stock market in th short run however the inclination would be to expect an initial rise in the stock market from either policy as more investors choose to buy stocks the magnitude of these effects is however very difficult to determine but is likely not to be very large relative to the other short run swin gs in the market such view would suggest that considerations of the stock market not play an important rule in evaluating alternative counter cyclical tax instruments g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 this analysis suggests that fiscal stimulus may not necessarily be desirable currently and that business tax subsidy may not necessarily be the best choice for fiscal stimulus largely because of 15 with imperfect competition the value might settle at
