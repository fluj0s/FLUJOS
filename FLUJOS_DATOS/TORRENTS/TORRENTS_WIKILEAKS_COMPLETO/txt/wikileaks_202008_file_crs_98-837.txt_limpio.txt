between the clinton administration and congressional critics over president clintons public affirmation in shanghai on june 30 1998 of the so called three regarding us policy toward taiwan is the latest episode in over 20 years of arguments between the administration and the congress over appropriate us policy in the uspeoples republic of china prctaiwan relationship the three involve us nonsupport for taiwan independence one china one taiwan and taiwan representation in international organizations where statehood is requirement administration supporters argue that the three are consistent with past us statements and do little damage to us interests in taiwan while discouraging movement in taiwan toward political independence that might prompt hostile prc response in contrast many in congress viewed the president as sacrificing us interests and those of taiwan for the sake of smooth summit meeting in china in response they criticized the three and proposed resolutions in the senate and house reaffirming support for taiwan the resolutions sconres 107 sconres 30 and hconres 301 passed in the weeks following the presidents china trip sometimes acrimonious congressionalexecutive debate over the appropriate balance in us policy toward beijing and taipei dates back at least to the 1970s before the normalization of us relations with the prc and the cut off of official us relations with taiwan the debate results from the executive branchs tendency to give priority to relations with beijing over relations with taiwan and the congress tendency to be more receptive to taiwan concerns regardless of prc sensitivities from often intense prctaiwan competition for international especially us support and from ambiguity in us policy which appears at times to tilt in favor of prcbacked positions but concurrently also strongly supports taiwan as congress considers whether and how to further adjust us policy in the wake of president clintons statement of the three it can consider sets of questions in key areas of policy concern notably the impact of the presidents three declaration the consequences of prctaiwan rivalry for us and other international support prospects for parallel us engagement with both beijing and taipei the prctaiwan military balance the us role in promoting prctaiwan talks to ease tensions and promote better relations and the

policy issues the current controversy over the three the controversy over president clintons public affirmation on june 30 1998 of the socalled three regarding us policy toward taiwan represents the latest round in long series of arguments often between the administration and critics in the congress over appropriate us policy in the uspeoples republic of china prc taiwan relationship during roundtable discussion in shanghai following his summit meeting with chinese leaders in beijing president clinton said that we dont support independence for taiwan or two chinas or one taiwanone china and we dont believe that taiwan should be member in any organization for which statehood is requirement1 this marked the first time us president had publicly affirmed the three though clinton administration officials have been saying them publicly and in private conversations with chinese leaders publicized by chinese media since at least 1996 earlier us statements including some made privately by senior administration officials to chinese counterparts going back as far as 1971 provide basis for the current three according to clinton administration officials in particular the administration maintains that the three are consistent with the one china affirmations contained in the communiques of 1972 1979 and 1982 that provide the framework for usprc relations2 those communiques reflect agreements between the us and prc in which the us broke off us official ties with taiwan acknowledged the position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china recognized the prc as the government of china and agreed to limit us arms sales to taiwan provided beijing pursues peaceful approach toward the island supporters of the administrations policy in the congress and elsewhere argue that the presidents statement is balanced by the strong show of us force in support 1 for more extensive crs coverage of the issues noted in this report see taiwan recent

1998 crs2 of taiwan seen when the united states in early 1996 deployed two us aircraft carrier battle groups to the taiwan area in the face of provocative prc military exercises there they judge that the statement of the three does minimal damage to taiwans interests that are consistent with us interests arguing notably that taiwan declaration of independence at this time would likely provoke prc military attack that in their view is not in the interests of the united states3 critics in congress the media and elsewhere assert that the administration appears to be buckling in the face of prc pressure sacrificing taiwan interests and us interests in relations with taiwan for the sake of assuring smoother us relationship with beijing in particular the critics underline taiwan government claims that the three appear to go beyond us commitments in the three us prc communiques in order to restrict taiwan government efforts to seek greater role in world affairs as government separate from the prc some charge that repeating the three aligns us policy closer to the one country two systems formula beijing has used to govern its takeover of hong kong and its proposed takeover of taiwan others are suspicious that the president made this statement as gesture to the chinese leadership to insure that his nine day trip to china was without acrimony and that the united states gained little in return in concrete terms for the statement some also are sympathetic with nongovernment advocates of self determination in taiwan who charge that the three effectively curb the right of the people of taiwan to decide whether or not they want to be independent of china4 us interests in taiwan of concern to these observers include active trade and investment taiwan is one of the top ten us trading partners and each year buys notably more us exports than the prc substantial us investment in taiwan is reciprocated by large taiwan investment in the united states taiwans free market economic system and vibrant political democracy enjoy broad us support although longer an official us ally taiwan occupies critically important strategic location astride the major sea lanes of east asia is one of the worlds largest purchasers of us military equipment5 and cooperates unofficially but extensively with the united states in dealing with international issues ranging from development assistance to environmental protection taiwan government and nongovernment relations with comparable sectors of american society are among the most extensive for country of its size for example the largest source of private funding for chinese studies in the united states in recent years has come from foundation the chiang chingkuo foundation based in taiwan meanwhile there are hundreds of

resources and organized together to promote us policies in tune with their goal of greater international recognition of taiwan6 past controversies in the evolution of us policy toward taiwan past episodes of controversy over appropriate us policy toward taiwan and mainland china7 included major debate in the congress during the 1970s over the pros and cons of the administration breaking all official us ties with taiwan for the sake of establishing normal diplomatic relations with beijing sharp and bipartisan congressional criticism of the carter administrations handling of the normalization with beijing in 1978 and 1979 leading notably to total congressional rewrite of the draft legislation proposed by the administration that ultimately became law as the taiwan relations act in april 1979 and controversy surrounding the reagan administrations decision to sign the august 1982 communique with the prc which restricted us arms sales to taiwan so long as beijing followed peaceful policy toward the territory the end of the cold war and the 1989 tiananmen crackdown in china coincided with taiwans rise as newly emerging democracy with vibrant free market economy prompting some calls in the congress the media and elsewhere for the administration to upgrade us relations with taiwan despite strong prc opposition congress was almost unanimous in 1995 in urging president clinton to reverse administration policy and allow taiwans president lee tenghui to make private visit to cornell university his alma mater president clinton acceded in may 1995 the visit took place in june 1995 beijing reacted strongly and with repeated shows of force in the taiwan strait from july 1995 to march 1996 after several months of prc military demonstrations in the strait the clinton administration with strong congressional support deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area the potentially dangerous faceoff of us and prc forces ended quietly but was widely seen to have added incentive to ongoing private clinton administration efforts to reassure chinese leaders of us intentions while building an administration policy of us constructive engagement with china statements by clinton administration officials affirming the three regarding us policy toward taiwan meant to reassure the prc over american intentions and thereby open the way to smoother us relations with mainland china 6 see among others steven goldstein taiwan faces the twentyfirst century new york foreign policy association 1997 7 see among others nancy tucker taiwan hong kong and the united states new york twayne 1992 see also goldstein taiwan faces opcit crs4 reasons for executivelegislative friction over us policy toward taiwan differing administrationcongressional priorities the current controversy between congressional critics and the administration over the three mirrors past episodes of legislativeexecutive friction over policy toward taiwan as in the past the administrations priority appears currently focused on managing the us relationship with taiwan in ways that would not unduly complicate or upset the important us relationship with the prc on the mainland from the perspective of congressional critics this approach at times including the present has prompted the administration to go too far in accommodating the prc by cutting back restricting or otherwise defining us interaction with taiwan in ways favored by beijing more receptive to the entreaties of taiwan representatives and their supporters in the united states and sensitive to the many tangible us benefits derived from relations with taiwan congress has repeatedly taken steps at many junctures over the past decades to adjust us policies in ways more supportive of taiwan interests and less favorable to beijing8 many observers believe and scholars report that from the administrations perspective congress can afford to lean in this direction which complicates and sometimes endangers the relationship with beijing because it does not bear primary responsibility for managing us foreign policy9 at times administration officials see congressional actions in support of taiwan as illadvised in turn many congressional observers for their part sometimes see administration officers as being so anxious to preserve smooth relationship with beijing that they are prepared to make unwarranted sacrifices of us interests in relations with taiwan prctaiwan rivalry an underlying fact that defines the frequent legislative executive debate over us policy toward taiwan is the ongoing rivalry between beijing and taipei although the rivalry waxes and wanes leaders in both capitals see their competition especially for international support largely in zerosum terms thus gain for one side in international support is seen as loss for the other both sides agree that by far the most important arena for their competition for international support is washington dc for taiwan us support in arms sales statements of strategic concern political backing and other ways is criticaltaiwan would not survive as separate entity without us support thus taiwan officials work hard with many channels of influence in the united statesnational and local governments media business nongovernment nonprofit organizations academic groups and universities lobbyists and othersto foster positive us government approaches 8 those instances have included the cases of the taiwan relations act the lee tenghui visit and others noted above as well as recent congressional resolutions passed almost unanimously by the congress reaffirming support for taiwan in the wake of president clintons statement of the three see crs issue brief 98034 9 on the private views of administration and congressional officials regarding policy toward taiwan since the 1970s see among others ramon myers ed the unique relationship hoover institution 1989 and thomas robinson america in taiwans post cold war foreign relations the china quarterly vol 148 december 1996 crs5 toward taiwan for beijing chinese officials try to use their position in us strategic economic or political calculus as leverage to persuade pressure or coerce the us government to curb its support for taiwan and thereby help smooth the way toward prc efforts to reunify taiwan with the mainlanda top goal of prc leaders us policy ambiguity the us policy debate also is grounded in prevailing us policy ambiguity about relations with taiwan on the one hand us governments in the process of establishing and improving relations with beijing have issued three communiques and other statements most recently the three that often appear supportive of the prc position on the taiwan issue the communiques reflect agreements between the two countries in which the us broke off official ties with taiwan acknowledged the position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china recognized the prc as the government of china and agreed to limit us arms sales to taiwan provided beijing pursues peaceful approach toward the island administration public statements in recent years explicitly rule out us support for an independent taiwan or taiwans membership in the or other such international organizations where statehood is requirement these two issues were not of primary importance in the 1970s and most of the 1980s when the authoritarian taiwan government was ruled by chiang kaishek and his chiang chingkuo they strongly supported the concept of one china argued that their governmentthe republic of china based in taipeiwas the sole legitimate government of china strongly opposed taiwan independence and largely eschewed taiwans participation in international organizations where beijing was member since democracy took hold in taiwan in the late 1980s the administration of lee tenghui has responded to popular pressure in taiwan by softpedaling past commitments to reunify one china it has asserted taiwans international legitimacy as one of two legitimate governments in china and sought greater international recognition through membership in international organizations and highlevel contacts with governments that already have relations with beijing10 against this background us leaders have repeatedly taken positions and policy actions designed to shore up important us relationships with taiwan11 the taiwan relations act is replete with expressions of us concern with taiwans security and determination to continue to provide arms to the island government the reagan administration endeavored to balance its signing of the 1982 communique restricting us arms to taiwan with six pledges to taiwan leaders including assurances that the united states would not set date to stop arms sales to taiwan would not amend the taiwan relations act and would not negotiate with beijing over arms sales to taiwan the bush administration resumed cabinetlevel contacts with taiwan in 1992 and also agreed to 5 billion transfer of 150 f16 fighters despite existing restrictions stemming from the 1982 communique the clinton administration released in 1994 the results of taiwan policy review that called for modest upgrading of us interchange with taiwan taiwan media also have reported on five 10 at present taiwan maintains official diplomatic relations with less than 30 countries 11 see among others tucker taiwan hong kong op cit and goldstein taiwan faces op cit crs6 supposedly secret meetings held in the past few years between taiwans national security adviser and us officials led by the deputy national security adviser and the under secretary of state for political affairs12 the us government has also been ambiguous about the us commitment to taiwans security following the termination of the us defense treaty one year after the agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the prc in 1979 us officials have refused to say what actions the united states might take in the event of prc military threat to the island the us government made clear that arms sales would continue and that the united states expected the taiwan issue to be dealt with peacefully the taiwan relations act affirmed that the united states would maintain sufficient forces in the pacific to deal with contingencies in the taiwan area after the usprc military faceoff in the taiwan area in early 1996 the clinton administration strongly and repeatedly affirmed us interest in seeing the prc and taiwan ease cross strait tensions and resume cross strait negotiations the latter were being carried out by ostensibly unofficial representatives of the prc and taiwan but were suspended in the wake of the lee tenghui visit to the united states the two sides agreed earlier this year to resume the high level dialogue of their ostensibly unofficial representatives later in 1998 meanwhile several former clinton administration officials including secretary of defense william perry and assistant secretary of defense joseph nye were notably active in 1998 promoting cross strait dialogue some have warned taiwan that us support might not be forthcoming if taiwan were to provoke prc attack by declaring taiwan to be independent and others have called for possible settlement of the taiwan issue which could involve beijing disavowing the use of force taiwan disavowing the option to declare independence and the united states curbing arms sales to the island in congress some members have examined the formidable prc ballistic missile capability against taiwan to argue that the united states should work with taiwan to provide theater missile defense for the island13 us economic interests also argue for policy straddling relations with both beijing and taiwan the clinton administration strongly emphasized the importance of the china market in explaining its 1994 reversal on linking trade issues with chinese human rights practices14 administration leaders have hailed chinas continued economic growth and determination to hold the line against currency devaluation as of particular importance in managing the consequence of the asian economic crisis the united states is keenly interested in taiwans economic role especially in the ongoing regional economic crisis though its currency has fallen relative to the us dollar and its growth rate has flagged bit taiwan is widely seen as the east asian economy best situated to weather the current crisis us policy makers 12 these reports have been replayed by the foreign broadcast information service fbis internet version 13 for background see crs issue brief 98034 14 see notably chinaus relations by kerry dumbaugh crs issue brief 98018 crs7 worried about another round of currency devaluations in asia hope taiwans currency remains strong devaluation in taiwan would place added pressure on the hong kong dollar and the chinese yuansomething us policymakers wish to avoid asian economic uncertainty also slows taiwans investment in the chinese mainland worth over 30 billion taiwan investment is widely seen as moderating factor in the ongoing taiwanprc rivalry meanwhile taiwans relatively healthy economy and large foreign exchange reserves are attractive to cashstarved southeast asian leaders they are now willing to offend prc sensitivities by meeting with senior taiwan leaders in the hope of gaining added assistance from taiwan taiwan has also taken steps to meet us requirements for entry into the world trade organization wto once it wraps up few pending issues with other trading partners the sole obstacle to taiwans wto entry will be the widely recognized implicit requirement backed by the prc that the prc must enter the wto first before taiwan can enter issues for congressional consideration as congress considers whether and how to adjust us policy toward taiwan in the wake of the three episode it can focus on several clusters of issues relating to us policy in the usprctaiwan triangular relationship listed below are questions along with brief explanations where needed of possible use for congress in its policy considerations impact of the three what has been the impact of the presidents statement of the three on taiwans efforts to play larger role in world affairs are reports from taiwan that the us presidents action has damaged taipeis pursuit of flexible diplomacy true has it negatively affected the election prospects and political support in taiwan for the opposition democratic progressive party dpp which advocates selfdetermination for taiwan are chinese leaders now using the precedent of the us presidents statement to press japanese leaders to issue similar statement during highlevel chinesejapanese meetings later this year assuming that one can reasonably make the case that some us interests in relations with taiwan were at least somewhat negatively affected by the presidents articulation of the three what offsetting positive benefits for us interests came from this statement since us administration leaders make such statements as thethree at least in part in order to reassure prc leaders of us intentions regarding taiwan what other measuresactions will the prc seek from the united states regarding taiwan specifically do prc leaders seek written us statement reaffirming the three do they seek specific us guarantees that us arms sales to taiwan will be further restricted in particular given the growing prc ballistic missile capability visavis taiwan do they seek us crs8 guarantees that the united states will not transfer missile defense systems and or missile defense technologies to taiwan intensified prctaiwan international rivalry taiwan feels embattled in the face of strenuous prc efforts to restrict taipeis international profile beijing has used its veto power in the security council threats of trade and other retaliation and other means to squelch taiwan initiatives in international affairs even in nonstatehood organizations like the asia pacific economic cooperation apec forum and the world trade organization wto beijing presses against taiwan last year for example beijing reportedly blocked taiwan initiative to host future apec summit meeting and it is widely held that beijing lobbies against taiwans joining the wto before the prc beijing also opposes taiwans application for observer status in the world health organization who is this prc approach conducive to the easing of cross strait tensions sought by the united states should the us government take position in regard to the reported prc refusal to allow taiwan to host an apec summit now that taiwan has met most requirements for wto entry and the prc still is far from meeting those requirements should the united states actively support taiwans entry to the wto prior to that of the prc parallel us engagement with beijing and taipei taiwan authorities for several years have argued for parallel us engagement with both the prc and taiwan and the uschina summits reportedly have been accompanied by secret meetings between taiwans national security adviser and the deputy us national security adviser and the under secretary of state for political affairs is the current balance of highlevel administration contacts with beijing and taipei appropriate should the us government consider improving contacts with taipei at time of upswing in usprc exchanges cross strait military balance according to us specialists on prc military affairs15 recent prc military strategy is focused particularly on efforts to build capabilities to deal with the taiwan issue beijings growing ballistic missile capability both short range and long range was well demonstrated during the 19951996 taiwan strait exercises and poses growing potential danger to taiwans security and stability 15 see among others hans binnendijk and ronald montaperto strategic trends in china national defense university 1998 crs9 what is the appropriate us response to the chinese missile capability is taiwan interested in acquiring us theater missile defense tmd systems or technologies are such systems practical and cost effective for taiwans defense why do prc officials link chinese adherence to usbacked arms control initiatives notably chinas joining the missile technology control regime mtcr with demands that the united states in turn curb arms sales to taiwan notably that the united states agree not to sell tmd systems or technology to taiwan what should be the us response to any such linkage some analysts point to weaknesses in taiwans software eg organization training and experience of taiwans armed forces popular support in taiwan for defense against the mainlandie the will to fight as more important than gaps in taiwans military hardware they aver that beijings militarybacked pressure tactics are designed to intimidate taiwan into submitting to prcfavored reunification arrangement and they are uncertain of taiwans ability to endure in the face of this pressure 16 what are significant taiwan weaknesses in this regard is this an appropriate matter for us consideration if so would more training opportunities for taiwan forces in the united states help to reduce current perceived weaknesses in taiwan forces in these areas us role in promoting cross strait talks the clinton administration has repeatedly called on taipei and beijing to resume the cross strait dialogue interrupted after the 19951996 events and recently retired clinton administration officials like william perry and joseph nye have argued for more assertive and active us stance to help ease cross strait tensions and reduce the likelihood of confrontations involving the united states17 should the united states go beyond current rhetoric and take specific actions to encourage constructive cross strait dialogue barring outside intervention what is the short term outlook for the cross strait dialogue and what does this mean for us interests 16 this was discussed at length at seminar on china taiwan and other subjects sponsored by the institute for international and strategic studies in washington dc on june 30 1998 17 discussed in crs issue brief 98034 crs10 taiwan selfdetermination and us policy the three include the statement that the united states does not support taiwan independence to some in taiwan and the united states this appears to set us policy against the right of taiwan people to determine their own future status us officials have clarified that saying that the united states does not support taiwan independence is different than saying that the united states opposes taiwan independence18 does the current us stance rule out the united states establishing relations with taiwan if the people there decide to declare official independence economic issues economic issues for us policy in relations with taiwan and prctaiwan relations include conditions governing taiwans entry into the world trade organization wto and taiwans possible role in assisting efforts to help stabilize the asian economic crisis and in providing financial support for fuel oil for north korea promised as part of the usnorth korean agreed framework accord of 1994 should the united states support taiwans entry into the world trade organization wto based solely on its meeting wto economic requirements now that beijing appears unlikely to gain wto entry in 1998 and taiwan has reached agreements with the united states on wto entry should the us government support taiwans wto entry before prc wto entry given us anxiety over the asian economic crisis should the united states be in closer official consultations with taiwan leaders over the implications of the regional situation should the united states encourage taiwan to play more prominent role in dealing with economic needs caused by the crisis including the difficulty the united states faces in getting additional funding needed to supply fuel oil to north korea under terms of the usnorth korean framework agreement of 1994 congressional and state department officials interviewed in late summer 1998 believed that taiwan if asked by the united states would provide funding for fuel oil for north korea 18 see among others the taiwan communique 82 august 1998 american institute in taiwan director richard bush said this while visiting taiwan in july and confirmed it in an interview september 21 1998 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98837
