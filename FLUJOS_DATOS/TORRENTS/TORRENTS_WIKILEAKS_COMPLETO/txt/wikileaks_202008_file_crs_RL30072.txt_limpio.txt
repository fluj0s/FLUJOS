force february 16 1999 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report opens with discussion of the contingent work force and the public policy issues associated with this labor market development the focus of the report then narrows to analyze in detail one component of the contingent labor force namely temporary workers who and how many are they why have firms increased their use of temps supplied through staffing companies does temporary status in and of itself confer relatively low wages and few benefits what policy responses have been advocated the report is not intended to track legislation it will not be updated related report is crs report 98695 parttime job growth and the labor effects of policy responses an overview temporary workers as members of the contingent labor force summary contingent work is broadly speaking any employeeemployer relationship other than fulltime secure position at firm which offers benefits contingent workers may include temporary workers parttime workers oncall workers leased employees day laborers the selfemployed independent contractors and employees of contract services firms some observers dispute the inclusion of all these groups because they think not all nontraditional employment relationships are insecure the lack of consensus on an operational definition for contingent work arrangements means that agreement also is absent on the size and growth of the phenomenon without knowing these things it is difficult to gauge whether legislative response is warranted and if one were what would be the appropriate remedies temporary workers employed by staffing companies for placement in assignments of varying duration at client firms are widely considered part of the contingent labor force agency temporaries are disproportionately young female and minorities and in clerical as well as lowskilled bluecollar occupations they more often give economic eg only kind of job they could get than personal eg family obligations reasons for being in nontraditional job most would prefer to have traditional jobs they are more likely to be unemployed than permanent workers some analysts believe the rapid growth of the temporary help supply ths industry has been fueled by changes in the economy that put premium on staffing flexibility and labor cost savings agency temporaries afford type of flexibility which it is suggested has become increasingly important to client firms trying out workers before making permanent job offers the temptohire route enables firms to avoid poor hiring decisions which could become costly firing decisions many agency temporaries are not utilized in this way however others argue that ths jobs have increased because they allow user firms to avoid costly legal obligations associated with the direct employment of workers ie health benefits pension plans social security and unemployment insurance policies to address the contingent worker issue most often are justified on the basis of workplace equity that is similarly endowed individuals who perform like jobs should receive equivalent hourly wages and benefits as well as equal treatment under labor regulations regardless of their employeeemployer relationship because contingent workers at firms that fail to provide discretionary benefits would not be helped by certain proposals eg shorter vesting periods and portability for pensions some have suggested requiring all employers to offer minimum benefit package rather than transforming discretionary into mandated benefits others have recommended loosening the connection between work and benefits eg encouraging people to selfinsure through taxfavored treatment of health care expenses and retirement savings still others question the appropriateness of acrosstheboard measures being applied to the several different kinds of contingent work arrangements and are concerned about balancing extension of the social welfare system with the loss of staffing flexibility for firms as well as the loss of jobs for those workers who prefer

18 temporary workers as members of the contingent labor force the report opens with an overview of the contingent labor force before focusing on one of its component groups namely temporary workers the personal and job characteristics of workers supplied to client firms by temporary help agencies are analyzed employment trends in the temporary help supply industry are examined along with explanations for its longterm rise the report closes with discussion of the public policy implications of temporary employment and other contingent work arrangements the contingent labor force contingent work is broadly speaking any employeeemployer relationship other than fulltime secure position at firm which offers range of benefits variations on the traditional or permanent employment relationship have become more prevalent in recent decades as they embody one response of firms to heightened global price competition and volatility in the demand for goods or services in this report the terms contingent nontraditional flexible and nonstandard are used interchangeably for want of definition contingent workers may be defined to include some or all of the following agency temporaries workers employed by staffing companies for placement in assignments of varying duration at client firms shortterm hires or directhire temporaries workers whom firms put on their payrolls for limited periods of time eg department stores during the winter holiday season and amusement parks during the summer oncall workers individuals who often make up pool from which employers regularly hire as needed and who may be scheduled to work for several days or weeks in row eg construction workers supplied by union hiring halls substitute teachers and nurses day or casual laborers people who get jobs by waiting at location to which employers customarily come to pick up workers the selfemployed owners of businesses eg restaurants and law offices independent contractors consultants or freelancers individuals who obtain customers on their own to whom they provide products or services leased workers employees of professional employer organizations that specialize in payroll benefit and other personnel administration matters who work under contract on an ongoing basis at client firms location and crs2 contract services workers employees of firms that provide services to other companies under contract who may or may not work at the contractees job site and who may or may not work for more than one contractee examples include accounting cleaning computer and data processing and protective services firms parttime workers are often considered to belong to the contingent labor force because they work shorter than fulltime schedules and have relatively low wages as well as limited access to employee benefits but many parttimers lack what some consider to be necessary property of contingency that is the absence of longterm relationship with single employer1 and because persons in the abovedescribed employment relationships may be scheduled to work less than 35 hours week the consideration of parttimers as separate category of nontraditional workers can result in double counting2 there also are analysts who dispute the inclusion of the selfemployed in the contingent labor force because many of these individuals have stable employment situations eg doctors because little was known about contingent workers and because not all flexible employment relationships may be inherently tenuous the us bureau of labor statistics bls began to collect data in 1995 that distinguishes between alternative and contingent workers the four alternative work arrangements that were identified independent contractors oncall workers temporary help agency workers and employees of contract firms are composed of persons who obtain employment through labor market intermediaries eg temporary help agencies and other business services companies or whose place time or quantity of employment may be unpredictable in 1997 the latest year for which data are available about 126 million workers reported they were in alternative work arrangements the proportions of these individuals who said they did not expect their employment to last long that is who said they held contingent jobs ranged from 35 for independent contractors to 57 for agency temporaries3 many analysts nonetheless consider alternative and contingent work to be synonymous they believe the distinction complicates the popular understanding of who is contingent worker and think that the bls means of determining contingency cannot be used to describe business hiring practices because firm does not hire person based on his or her perceived job security firm hires on the basis of an employment arrangement4 1 in 1997 just 1 out of 10 parttime workers said they were in contingent jobs ie they lacked an implicit or explicit contract for longterm employment us bureau of labor statistics bls contingent and alternative employment arrangements february 1997 usdl news 97422 december 2 1997 2 in 1997 20 of temporary help agency workers were employed on parttime basis as were 53 of oncall workers 26 of independent contractors and 17 of workers provided by contract services firms ibid 3 ibid 4 barker kathleen and kathleen christensen charting future research in barker and continued crs3 rather than using sense of impermanence5 about ones job as the sole defining attribute of contingent labor some researchers rely on multiple criteria one set of characteristics that has been suggested is little or job security irregular or variable work schedules that are dependent on management decisions rather than individual preferences access to benefits that firms provide to their employees and lack of attachment to particular company6 another example of multipart definition is the following nonstandard arrangements differ from standard jobs in at least one of the following ways 1 the absence of an employer as in selfemployment and independent contracting 2 distinction between the organization that employs the worker and the one for whom the person works as in contract and temp work or 3 the temporal instability of the job characteristic of temporary day labor oncall and some forms of contract work7 the lack of consensus on what constitutes contingent work means that agreement also is absent on the size and growth of the phenomenon estimates of the number of contingent workers range widely perhaps 56 million or 44 of employed persons in 1997 according to the us bureau of labor statistics broadest definition8 perhaps 340 million or 252 of the civilian labor force in 1996 according to the national planning associations npa narrowest definition9 the npas definition indicates that almost onethird of all jobs created between 1980 and 1996 were contingent positions which expanded by 36 over the period or nearly 10 percentage points greater than growth in the overall labor force10 without knowing the size and growth of the phenomenon as well as the extent to which contingent workers would prefer traditional jobs it is difficult to gauge whether the labor market development warrants legislative response and if it does 4 continued christensen eds contingent work american employment relations in transition ithaca ny cornell university ilr press

were first collected for 1995 crs4 what are the appropriate remedies the very heterogeneity of the contingent labor force also could complicate the crafting of public policy the connection to public policy concern has arisen in some quarters that the publicprivate social welfare system which evolved with the traditional employeeemployer relationship in mind is not adequately serving an expanding share of the labor force it is argued that while business has reaped benefits from its use of nontraditional employment arrangements eg staffing flexibility and labor cost savings the members of the contingent labor force have borne variety of costs eg limited opportunity for productivity enhancing training and for union representation and small paychecks that result in low standard of living both in work and retirement years more specifically temporary and parttime workers may be unable to meet the eligibility requirements of certain mandated benefits among them the unemployment insurance ui programs quarterly earnings and hours threshold or the family and medical leave acts annual hours threshold when firms offer discretionary benefits temporary and parttime workers also may find it difficult to qualify for participation paid holidays were provided to 71 of temporary workers employed by temporary help supply firms in 1994 74 worked for firms that provided paid vacations and 49 for firms that offered health care coverage however because of minimum service and contribution requirements less than 10 of workers employed in the temporary help supply industry received paid holidays and vacations or participated in health plans11 others have countered that flexible work arrangements actually help those in the labor force and in the population generally by strengthening the competitiveness of us firms and thereby promoting economic and job growth they assert that further extending labor protections would inhibit expansion of the economy and prompt companies to cut or slow job growth in response to higher employment costs because some workers want flexibility in their schedules in order to engage in other pursuits young workers schooling older workers leisure activities parents family responsibilities policies that would curb nonstandard work arrangements could adversely affect these individuals in addition it is noted that temporary help agencies offer training and benefits to their employees and provide pathway to traditional jobs12 for example training in such skills as data entry and word processing was available to nearly 9 out of 10 temporary workers employed by staffing companies in 199413 there also is consternation in the public policy community that firms may be deliberately misclassifying employees as contingent workers in order to evade various 11 bls occupational compensation survey temporary help supply services november 1994 bulletin 2482 washington dc us govt print off 1996 p 1 hereafter cited as bls occupational

are selfemployed rather than employees of the company to which they are providing good or service client firms are not required to contribute on the contractors behalf toward workers compensation ui and social security benefits independent contractors similarly are not covered by wage and hour protections among other labor standards that apply to employees of firms as variously defined in federal statutes15 in recognition of the greater diversity of employment relationships that exist today policymakers have introduced proposals and held hearings to study or reshape the nations publicprivate social welfare system16 federal agencies eg the internal revenue service department of labor and national labor relations board and the courts have become involved in defining who is an employee as well as which firms the individual works for17 legislation also has been proposed and hearings held on the classification of workers as independent contractors or employees18 narrowing the focus to temporary workers although the subject can be approached as though contingent workers are homogenous such treatment masks important differences between the demographic and job characteristics of the member groups their preferences for nonstandard versus traditional employment and their compensation ie earnings and benefits compared to that of traditional workers this report will analyze one

help supply ths industry consequently the analysis in this report is confined to ths workers also known as agency temporaries rather than directhire temporaries see page 1 for definitions demographic characteristics agency temporaries are disproportionately young female and minorities as shown in table 1 over onefifth of ths workers were below 25 years of age in 1997 while the same was true for under 15 of workers in traditional employment relationships women accounted for more than onehalf of temps in contrast to less than onehalf of traditional workers little over onefifth of agency temporaries were black little over onetenth of workers in traditional jobs were black and about 12 of temporary workers in 1997 were of hispanic origin compared to almost 10 of traditional workers agency temporaries have completed somewhat fewer years of schooling than have workers in traditional employment relationships in 1997 about 22 of temps age 2564 were college graduates compared to almost 30 of traditional workers among young 1624 year old workers many fewer agency temporaries 16 than traditional workers 43 were enrolled in high school or college in 199719 it appears then that the overrepresentation of youth employed as temps is not primarily motivated by desire to combine school attendance and labor force participation similarly mothers do not seem to rely heavily on staffing companies to provide them with flexible means of combining paid work and family responsibilities fewer women employed as temps were raising children 48 than was true of women in traditional jobs 5620 indeed agency temporaries much more often offered economic than personal reasons for their employment relationship in 1997 three out of every five temporary workers said that economic reasons eg only kind of work they could get explained their employment at staffing companies female temps were much more likely to indicate personal reasons than were male temps 35 and 22 respectively most ths workers three out of five also reported they would have preferred traditional jobs21 female temps were somewhat more likely than male temps to prefer their flexible work arrangement to traditional jobs 35 and 31 respectively 19 bls contingent and alternative employment arrangements february 1997 20 cohany sharon r workers in alternative employment arrangements second look monthly

2564 year olds crs8 most agency temporaries 80 like traditional jobholders 82 work full time ie 35 or more hours week fulltime temps averaged only one or two fewer hours week than fulltime workers in traditional jobs however relatively more temporary 9 than traditional 3 workers were involuntarily employed parttime that is they would have preferred to work more hours but were unable to do so for economic reasons22 in addition to the greater extent of underemployment among ths workers they are more likely to be unemployed or out of the labor force than permanent workers23 differences in the personal and job characteristics of temporary and traditional workers account for portion of these disparities in labor market outcomes24 nonetheless the increased use of agency temporaries is unlikely to have had much impact on aggregate job stability ie number of workers switching jobs and number unemployed because this nonstandard work arrangement still comprises small proportion of all jobs in the nation see section on the trend in temporary employment occupational and industrial composition agency temporaries are concentrated in administrative support including clerical and comparatively lowskilled bluecollar ie operators fabricators and laborers occupations in 1997 these occupational groups accounted for almost two thirds of ths workers compared to about 30 of individuals holding traditional jobs25 because so many bluecollar jobs are in manufacturing industries it is not surprising that agency temporaries are overrepresented at factories almost 32 of temps as opposed to nearly 18 of traditional employees worked at manufacturers in 199726 with few exceptions most of these demographic occupational and industrial patterns have remained largely unchanged over time27 two related exceptions are that the incidence of male and of bluecollar temps has increased substantially between 1989 and 1994 for example temporary help agencies increased bluecollar workers on their payrolls by 96 which led to 10 percentage point rise to 40 in 22 ibid 23 segal lewis m and daniel g sullivan the growth of temporary services work journal of economic perspectives v

temps today than was true in the recent past manufacturers greater use of agencysupplied temporary workers could thus be understating the number of people whose livelihood actually depends on goods production and also could be contributing to sluggish hiring at the nations factories since the 19901991 recessions end29 another potential exception to the historical pattern concerns businesses use of temps to fill technical jobs there are reports that technical and professional workers eg those with information technology skills have been fastgrowing portion of the ths industry in the 1990s30 the trend in temporary employment at least part of the job growth in the ths industry could reflect shift from firms directly hiring individuals for shortterm assignments to firms instead obtaining them through staffing companies31 to the extent such shift has occurred the observed employment gains at temporary help agencies would overstate the actual expansion of temporary jobs in the economy based on the very limited data available there appear to be many more direct hire than agencysupplied temporaries32 directhire temps may have accounted for 27 of employed persons in 1995 agency temps 133 the cyclical dimension employment in the ths industry is quite sensitive to changes in the business cycle based on 19721995 data of the national association of temporary and staffing services the

arrangements for job security 33 these data are based on survey of households so they describe the number of people with jobs the data in table 2 are based on survey of establishments so they describe the number of jobs because an individual may have more than one job the number of jobs is likely to exceed the number of employed persons crs10 recessions to 30 during expansions while the allindustries annual job growth fluctuated much more narrowly during the downswings 2 and upswings 5 of the business cycle34 similarly changes in national output from its 19721986 trend level produced much greater employment responses in the industry than in the total nonfarm economy35 as shown in table 2 ths employment contracted slightly more 15 during the 19901991 recession than employment across all nonfarm industries 11 these findings are consistent with the notion that client firms partly use agency temporaries to address shortrun fluctuations in demand for goods and services36 contracting with temporary help agencies for workers on an as needed basis allows firms to minimize the number of workers on their payrolls who become surplus and subject to termination when output demand subsequently slackens in other words agency temporaries seem to be used to insulate firms core or permanent employees from the vagaries of the business cycle the painful corporate downsizings of the deep 19811982 recession have been credited with business desire to stay lean and mean in order to avoid such largescale layoffs in the future the rapid increase in temporary employment immediately after the 19901991 recession may reflect employers reluctance to hire employees until they are certain that an economic recovery is well underway between 1991 and 1994 jobs at temporary help agencies rose 59 as against almost 6 across all nonfarm industries see table 2 although the pace of employment gains in the ths industry 40 compared to the economy overall 10 has diminished considerably since the mid 1990s some analysts believe the industrys still fastpaced job growth reflects fundamental change in the way that business is utilizing labor see section on reasons for growth the longterm trend employment gains in the ths industry have been much greater than across all nonfarm industries on average since 1982 the number of jobs in the industry has risen 577 in contrast jobs throughout the nonfarm economy have increased by much smaller 41 this disparity elevated the industrys share of all nonfarm jobs from negligible 05 in 1982 to over 2 today see table 2 34

expansion of temporary help employment crs11 the ths industry has been fueling aggregate employment growth for decades most recently it accounted for 9 of the net new jobs created in the nonfarm sector between 1989 the last peak in the business cycle and 1998 employment in the personnel supply services industry of which 90 is in its temporary help component is projected to continue expanding at an above average rate37 while total nonfarm jobs might increase at 17 annual average rate between 1996 and 2006 the employment gain of personnel supply firms is projected to be considerably larger at 4338 past experience suggests that temporary help agencies will account for much of this growth39 staffing companies thus are expected to continue as major contributor to job growth into the next century employment in the personnel supply services industry might rise as share of all nonfarm jobs in the economy in 2006 to 3 not inconsequential figure for purposes of comparison the construction industry is projected to account for 4 of jobs in 2006 single industry within the manufacturing sector is estimated to reach 2 eating and drinking places are projected to account for 65 and health services 940 reasons for growth explanations for the growth in contingent work including temporary employment typically have demand rather than supply focus put another way it is more often thought that companies have increased their demand for contingent vis avis traditional work arrangements than that workers due to changes in labor force composition eg more mothers working for pay have increased their preference for shortterm as compared to stable positions41 internationalization of product markets industry deregulation and technological innovations are widely thought to have made the business environment increasingly price competitive and productservice demand increasingly variable combination of work arrangements arguably enables companies to more efficiently achieve the 37

statistics note the data from the current employment statistics ces survey include not only the temporary or leased employees of staffing companies but also their employees who recruit screen place and pay the workers supplied on contract basis to other firms under the standard industrial classification sic system the code for help supply service providers is 7363 because the data cover all jobs in the industry they count individuals registered with more than one temporary agency multiple times if the workers received payments from more than one agency in addition the ces survey includes as workers in the help supply services industry those persons moonlighting as temporaries whose primary jobs are in other industries preliminary crs13 greater flexibility in staffing can be achieved through such human resources strategies as 1 bringing on board workers directly or through temporary help agencies when production must be increased to fill the more sporadic orders of customers who longer want to maintain sizable inventories and then letting them go during slower periods in order to buffer firms core workforce from dismissals and 2 contracting with individuals or business services firms having specialized skills to perform tasks that may not be costeffectively provided by firms own employees42 labor cost savings can be achieved through reduction in nonproductive time ie having justintime employment rather than constant staff level and through the seemingly low wages and limited benefits of contingent compared to traditional jobs reliance on marketmediated work arrangements eg companies using agencysupplied temporary workers and companies contracting out work to business services firms employees also can minimize hiring and firing costs associated with direct employment relationships43 some analysts contend that firms have increased their demand for ths workers precisely because the arrangement allows them to utilize labor without taking on the specific social legal and contractual obligations that have increasingly been attached to employer status since the new deal44 temptohire or permatemps workers supplied by temporary help agencies afford type of flexibility which it is suggested has become more important to client firms over time that is enabling them to tryout workers before extending permanent job offers the ths industry in sense offers riskfree recruitment channel for firms seeking new employees many managers claim that it has become more difficult in recent years to dismiss poor performers as an increasingly litigious society has combined with the erosion of the legal doctrine of employmentatwill and the provision of various equal employment opportunity laws at the same time it has become more costly to hire poor performers liability concerns have reduced the value of references from previous employers as employers have become reluctant to offer negative appraisals of former workers45 the employmentatwill doctrine arose from common law under it an employer controls nearly all aspects of the work environment including the authority to terminate an employee at any time for any reason46 some assert that

obrien legal and policy implications of the flexible employment continued crs14 the courts have eroded the influence of the employmentatwill concept by prohibiting specified criteria eg age from serving as the basis for firing decisions47 the dismissal of an employee can have costly consequences if it is determined that the action violates such federal laws as the civil rights act the americans with disabilities act and the national labor relations act if as alleged expenses associated with wrongful dismissal litigation have escalated over time the ability to preview workers supplied by temporary help agencies could have become more important to firms seeking to avoid poor hiring decisions very little evidence exists concerning the temptohire explanation for the growth in temporary jobs survey of former agency temporaries conducted for the national association of temporary and staffing services showed that 29 of ths workers obtained permanent positions based on their assignments at client firms48 although survey of employers sponsored by the upjohn institute for employment research found that 21 of businesses using agency temporaries did so to screen them for permanent jobs other reasons were much more frequently offered by respondents for their use of temps49 however over onehalf of those companies that increased their use of ths workers in the 1990s were motivated by desire to fill permanent positions 24 did so to screen candidates for permanent jobs and 37 did so because they found it difficult to find qualified workers on their own others claim that the temporary help agencies themselves actually discourage the transition of their employees into permanent jobs with user firms some agencies charge client firms fee if they hire the temporary worker within x days of an assignment to deter firms from using temporary instead of permanent employment agencies or they may contractually prohibit user firms from offering and temps from accepting permanent jobs for some period after completion of an assignment50 it also is contended that another and perhaps more important obstacle to the temptohire pathway is resistance on the part of client firms who do not want agency temporaries to think that user firms are under any obligation to offer them permanent 46 continued relationship journal of labor research v 17 4 fall 1996 hereafter cited

positions rather than subscribing to the temptohire viewpoint these observers believe that marketmediated arrangements have flourished because they relieve user firms of expensive legal obligations associated with traditional employment particularly those costs linked to the hiringfiring decision eg mandated benefits including ui and social security as well as voluntarily provided benefits including pensions51 it is suggested that firms in recent years have chosen human resources strategy which uses ths workers on regular yearround instead of occasional basis52 the phenomenon of permanent temps is offered in support of this perspective while 35 of agency temporaries in 1997 were on their current assignments for less than 3 months according to bls data nearly 29 stayed on the same assignment for one year or longer based on transitions over the 19831993 period over onehalf of ths workers got permanent positions while over onefifth were still in temporary jobs one year later53 and among users of agency temporaries 56 of firms indicated that they seldom or never moved temps into permanent positions compared to 43 who said they did so often occasionally or sometimes54 these findings suggest that sizeable minority of individuals who work for temporary help agencies may be characterized as permatemps either in the sense of having longterm attachment to particular client nonemployer firm or to the temporary labor market in general proponents of the permatemp viewpoint urge changes in employment regulations to better protect contingent workers whom they regard as being trapped in secondary labor market characterized by high job turnover low compensation as well as limited training and advancement opportunities these changes typically include requiring pay and benefit equity for contingent and traditional workers in comparable positions revising eligibility rules for ui and vesting requirements under the employee retirement income security act erisa and reforming the national labor relations act advocates argue that those temporary workers and independent contractors who are in longlasting relationships with client firms should be considered their employees and thus entitled to the same benefits and protections as permanent employees55 some contingent workers have brought law suits and have involved the us department of labor in efforts to secure benefits denied them by such client firms as microsoft and time warner56 in addition permatemps have begun to organize in order to give voice to what they believe is secondclass treatment in the workplace57 51 gonos the interaction between market incentives and government actions 52 parker flesh peddlers and warm bodies 53 segal and sullivan the growth of temporary services work 54

positions be removed by reasserting the employmentatwill doctrine or by rolling back regulations thought to impede the free functioning of the labor market58 at the least they urge the preservation of staffing companies legal status as the employer of temporary workers temptohire proponents argue that actions to dissuade firms from using agency temporaries by raising their cost visavis traditional workers could hamper the development of superior job matches which benefit firms through improved productivity and lower labor costs and workers through greater job satisfaction and longer job tenure twotier compensation systems another explanation put forth for the increase in contingent jobs is that they make it easy for firms to create twotier compensation structures which provide otherwise identical workers performing the same jobs different wage and benefit packages company may want to have different compensation systems for different classes of workers because 1 some jobs involve incentive and management problems that can be addressed through particular pay structure eg paying abovemarket wages only to those workers in whom the firm invested greatly in recruitment and training in order to curtail turnover 2 some workers have varying preferences for and therefore assign different values to the components of compensation eg young workers may prefer higher wages to receiving health benefits and 3 some incumbent workers eg unionized employees within firms workforce have more bargaining power than others however firms that provide health or pension benefits to only some employees risk losing the income tax exemption associated with benefit provision and firms that differently compensate similar employees performing the same jobs risk morale and productivity problems there are two reasons to think that ths workers have been more frequently utilized over time to establish twotier compensation systems the cost to employers of providing benefits generally and health insurance particularly has increased relative to wages in recent decades thus the value to firms of reining in benefit expenditures would have risen in addition the appearance of morale problems at companies that had instituted twotier compensation systems for their own employees coincided with the timing of rapid growth in bluecollar temps this suggests that firms that found it difficult to pay new regular employees lower wages than their established employees began to experiment with using lowerpaid temporaries to fill the new openings the relatively large gap between temporary and regular wages in the bluecollar occupations is also consistent with the notion of bluecollar temporaries filling the bottom of twotier pay structure59 wages regardless of the different survey data examined temporary workers would seem to be attractive to firms based on their relatively low pay levels in 1997 according to data from bls establishment survey employees in the ths industry averaged 1018 per hour or fourfifths of the 1277 per hour averaged by 58 lips brad temps and the labor market regulation spring 1998 p 39 59 segal and sullivan the growth of temporary services work p 134 crs17 productionnonsupervisory employees on private sector payrolls60 the pay gap is wider based on bls survey of individuals in alternative work arrangements with full time temps earning nearly twothirds as much per week as fulltime workers in traditional jobs median weekly earnings of 329 versus 510 respectively such gross pay comparisons may be misleading however they may overstate the costsavings to firms using staffing companies if there are differences in the personal characteristics of temps and employees of client firms that result in productivity differentials ths workers also may be concentrated in different occupations and industries than permanent workers moreover the gross wage gap may not be evidence of employer discrimination against temporary workers one analysis estimated the hourly pay differential between temporary and permanent workers after adjustment for variety of wagerelated characteristics on an unadjusted basis the researchers calculated the wage rate of agency temporaries to be 22 less than that of permanent workers in 1996 after taking into account differences between the two groups in terms of age race sex education and geographic location the pay gap shrank to 14 by controlling for certain job characteristics ie union and parttime status as well as broad occupational group in addition to the aforementioned personal characteristics the wage disparity narrowed further to 8 upon correcting for unobserved differences between the two groups of workers eg years of experience the researchers estimated that temporary status alone might reduce persons hourly wage by 561 in another study the researchers separately analyzed women and men employed fulltime in various work arrangements they found that in 1995 for women with similar personal and job characteristics the hourly wage of fulltime temps was not significantly different from that of fulltime workers in traditional jobs in contrast among otherwise equivalent men those employed fulltime by staffing companies still earned about 8 less than men employed fulltime in traditional jobs62 in addition gross wage comparisons may overstate the costsavings to firms that use temps because the reported pay levels do not reflect the premium that agencies charge client firms in 1995 for example firms paid temporary help agencies 40 more on average than temps received in wages63 when client firms were asked to compare the billed hourly rate for ths workers with the hourly wage rate of regular employees in similar positions 62 replied that the cost of temps was higher64 benefits the costsavings associated with the use of temps becomes more apparent upon including the fringe benefit component of the compensation package 60 preliminary figures subject to revision 61

and benefit cost of regular employees in similar positions just 19 replied that the cost of temps was higher while 38 said it was lower65 agency temporaries are much less often covered by either health or pension benefits than traditional workers in addition they have lower coverage rates than other workers in nonstandard jobs see table 3 adjusting for differences in personal and job characteristics between temporary and traditional workers does not much diminish the gap in health and pension benefit receipt between the two66 temporary status thus reduces workers access to two benefits regarded as key to persons current and future economic and physical wellbeing less than one in ten agency temporaries had employerprovided health benefits in 1997 although more than one in four was eligible according to unpublished bls data the disparity between eligibility and participation chiefly seems due to health insurance coverage through another source eg family member or

job is likely to be of greater importance to contingent workers in singleearner than in dualearner families where spouse may be eligible for employerprovided insurance for example in 1995 fewer female ths workers who were married and in singleearner families with children had health care coverage than married female temps in similar families with dualearners 53 and 68 respectively being in twoearner family did not increase the likelihood that male temps would have health benefits as much as it did among female temps in addition health insurance coverage rates were quite low for married male temps both in singleearner 36 and dualearner 47 families with children67 as shown in table 3 pension coverage also is very low among ths workers some 105 of agency temporaries were eligible for employerprovided pensions in 1997 an even smaller share 37 actually were included in plans although congress passed legislation intended to induce people to save for retirement on their own relatively few temps 11 whose employers did not offer pension plan have individual retirement accounts68 policy implications policies to address the contingent worker issue often are justified on the basis of workplace equity it is asserted that similarly endowed individuals who perform like or comparable jobs within companies should receive equivalent hourly wages and benefits as well as equal treatment under labor regulations regardless of their employeeemployer relationship69 others contend however that parttime discrimination does not begin to approach the policy concerns of race or sex discrimination parttime status is not an immutable characteristic and the differentiation is not stigmatizing or invidious70 parity advocates note in response that minorities and women are overrepresented in some contingent work arrangements and therefore are more adversely impacted than other groups by the disparate treatment employers accord parttime and temporary workers for example

provided for the extension of certain benefits to contingent workers is the effect on others due to their lack of coverage ie the externality argument firms that do not offer health benefits create spillover burden on other health plans or on taxpayers because someone will pay for their employees coverage71 someone includes companies that provide health benefits to their employees family members who work at firms without plans someone also includes benefitproviding companies as well as their employees who must pay more for medical services marked up to cover the cost of giving uncompensated care to the uninsured population egemployees of firms that do not offer health plans72 some proposals meant to gain fair treatment for contingent workers actually extend to all workers with low earnings or few hours eg changing the hours threshold in the family and medical leave act or the quarterly earningshours threshold in the ui program raising the minimum wage and expanding the earned income tax credit other proposals eg sick leave vacation or health insurance eligibility on pro rata basis shorter vesting periods and portability for pensions would put contingent workers on more equal footing with traditional workers at companies that provide discretionary benefits individuals in flexible work arrangements at firms that fail to offer voluntary benefits would not be helped by employmentbased remedies unless as some have suggested all employers were required to offer governmentprescribed basic benefit package73 instead of transforming discretionary into mandated workplace benefits the idea of loosening the historical connection between employment and benefit provision has been embraced by diverse members of the public policy community their approaches to accomplishing the detachment markedly differ however some favor encouraging people to selfinsure their financial wellbeing later in life through establishment of taxfavored individually owned investment accounts or to selfinsure their physical wellbeing through taxfavored treatment of health care expenditures for those who lack employmentbased coverage others support governmentfinanced system of universal access to health benefits for example some observers argue for restrained policy response to the flexible work issue as noted at the outset of this report estimates range widely as to the size of the contingent labor force because consensus definition is lacking the appropriateness of applying acrosstheboard regulatory proposals to the several different kinds of employment relationships considered nonstandard has been questioned as well74 another oftraised caution involves striking balance between the benefits of extending the social welfare and regulatory systems to contingent workers against the loss of staffing flexibility for firms and of jobs for workers who prefer nontraditional 71 ibid p 930 72 handelman gwen thayer on our own strategies for securing health and retirement benefits in

things acts as job clearinghouse to help workers get the permanent jobs most want76 in addition little information is available on some other components of the contingent labor force including
