jekyl and mr kirchner ref buenos aires 360 b buenos aires 311 c buenos aires 305 d buenos aires 302 buenos aires 301 classified by ambassador anthony wayne for reasons 14 bandd 1 c summary and comment argentinas president nestor kirchner is trying to stake out position for himself close to chavez yet still working well with the us on issues important to argentina with domestic political advantage and 2007 elections in mind we expect kirchner to continue the balancing act kirchner will lash out with largely indirect criticism he will cozy up to chavez and yet he will maintain number of open doors to us kirchner recognizes the value of maintaining quiet positive relations with the us particularly on key strategic issues eg nonproliferation and counterterrorism but sees value domestically in aligning himself publicly with the us or its policies in fact he gets domestic boost from lashing out at perceived pressure and in striking an independent pose charles gaulle argentinas commercial and economic relationship with venezuela is also of strategic importance refs b the difference being that domestically kirchner does perceive value in particular electorally in publicly linking himself to chavez he is bringing home the bacon the meetings between senior goa ministers and ag gonzalez and us burns and as shannon were uniformly positive recognizing an important common agenda in many areas refs cd and septels and the press play from the visits was positive and profuse in light of this dynamic kirchners statements in venezuela that argentina will not contain venezuela and his invitation for chavez to visit in march are indicative of the goas desire to maintain what they see as balance in relations with the us and venezuela end summary 2 c attorney general gonzales february 67 visit and us nick burns and as shannons february 89 visit to buenos aires and meetings with senior kirchner ministers served to underscore improving bilateral relations the breadth of that relationship as well as highlight us policy priorities in the region kirchner insiders cabinet chief alberto fernandez and planning minister julio vido confirmed to burns and shannon the importance of the relationship to the goa the strong workinglevel cooperation on counterterrorism counternarcotics and international support for nonproliferation together with foreign minister taiana they shared concerns about the situation in bolivia and ecuador and the need for strengthening stability in the region including through joint efforts in haiti they also emphasized the importance they place on attracting us investment although negative decision made public during the visit regarding us investment fund seeking share of local energy transmitting company indicates that the actual message to potential investors at best is mixed cabinet chief fernandez publicly characterized relations as good the day after burns visit 3 c the kirchner style from the beginning however has been combative in the face of real imagined and fabricated challenges from sources as varied as the catholic church neoliberalism and the washington consensus the world bank and imf parasitic foreign multinationals the press and political opponents whether from within or from outside the peronist party and indirectly stated the the us this style has stood him in good stead as the economy boomed buoyed by favorable external factors his popularity ratings have soared and have remained high due in small part to his pugnacious character 4 sbu kirchner demonstrated again over the last two weeks his willingness to attack external institutions for domestic political gain he lashed out on several occasions at the ifis and other international organizations rejecting their latest gentle criticisms of goa economic policies and blaming them again for the 20012002 financial crisis and also for current high poverty levels his outburst followed mildly critical comments from the world bank and world trade organization officials about the sustainability of the goas economic policies he was also responding to an imf spokesmans comment to the press that an imf agreement was normally prerequisite for paris club debt rescheduling despite the imfs explanation that this was paris club not imf requirement kirchner blamed the imf his favorite whipping boy for blocking paris club deal he and his economic minister felisa miceli also used the opportunity to pander to the publics extreme hostility towards the imf by rejecting categorically any possibility of fund program with argentina 5 c this dynamic helps explain the two faces of kirchner we see in our bilateral relations kirchner is essentially pragmatic but excessively focused on domestic issues and public opinion the low point in recent bilateral relations occasioned by the goa performance at the mar plata summit of the americas in november 2005 perhaps convinced kirchner he had gone bit too far down the populist route since then we have seen gradual and steady improvement in relations with an increasing willingness by seniorlevel officials in engaging in dialogue with us and in identifying areas where we can strengthen cooperation 6 c however we do not expect to see public embrace of the us or many of our policies the public image of the us in argentina is the lowest in the region kirchners regular verbal assaults on policies and institutions linked in the public mind to the us eg globalization and the international financial institutions resonate very well here as long as they dont foretell serious break see latest inr us image paper from the octnov 2006 latinobarometro poll comparing argentina with 17 other regional publics kirchner calculates with at least one eye always on the next election that there is little upside to being linked too closely with the us and little downside to occasionally standing firm and protecting the peoples interests before the hegemonic power 7 c the press here eggs this on couching many issues as the ideological struggle between the us and venezuela for predominance in the region as reflection of this goa actions are either portrayed as prochavez or as rapprochement with the us contacts inform us that kirchner also sees himself as maintaining this balance between the two charles gualle between the cold war powers us and ussr the embassy has seen on several occasions when the press appears to be too caught up in portraying the improving us goa relations that kirchner will find an opportunity to publicly stick pin in that balloon in the aftermath of the gonzalezburnsshannon visits kirchner while in venezuela recently to sign number of commercial agreements may have felt compelled to right the balance and demonstrate his independence with his gratuitous remark that argentina would not contain chavez ref the media here has in fact tied kirchners comments in venezuela to burnsshannon remarks made here during their recent visit that the us could work well with governments like argentina and brazil but that venezuela was another matter 8 c comment it is clear we have foreign policy differences with the kirchner administration particularly over how we view chavez and his actions in venezuela and the region press reports here say chavez will be paying return visit to kirchner next week coinciding with president bushs visit to uruguay septel senior goa contacts tell us the visit is still unconfirmed ambassador has expressed our strong concerns that chavez will use the occasion to organize another antius rally as is being reported in the press and that such an act would negatively impact our bilateral relations this unfortunately would be the type of gesture to be expected of kirchner one focused on shortterm electoral political gain with little thought for longerterm consequences we should not expect significant changes in the goas foreign policy or goa public statements in support of the us nor is kirchner likely to change many of his interventionist economic tendencies all of this is especially true in an election year but on most of the key bilateral and multilateral issues important to the us in fact we believe we can continue to build strong cooperation in quiet deliberate way wayne
