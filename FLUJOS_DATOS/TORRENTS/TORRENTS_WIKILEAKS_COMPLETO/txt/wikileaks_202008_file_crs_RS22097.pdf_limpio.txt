julie kim specialist in international relations foreign affairs defense and trade division summary balkan cooperation with the interna tional criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty in the hague has long been an issue of ongoing us and international concern on july 21 2008 the serbian government announced the peaceful arrest in belgrade of former bo snian serb leader ra dovan karadzic longtime hightarget fugitive who had eluded capture for 13 years only two other icty indicted individuals are still at large including gen ratko mladic who along with karadzic is under indictment for genocid and crimes against humanity occurring during the 1992 1995 bosnian war full cooperation with icty has long been key prerequisite to advancing the shared goal of closer association with and eventual membership in the european union and nato for the wester n balkan countries this policy of conditionality has occasionally come under criticism alt hough the recent arrest of karadzic appears to have affirmed the strate gy icty is scheduled to conclude its work and close its doors in 2010 or 20 11 the second session of the 110th congress may consider foreign aid legislation that include s recurring provisions linking us assistance to serbia with icty coopera tion many members also main tain an interest in nato and eu enlargement processes this repor t may be updated as events warrant for related information see crs report rs21686 conditions on us aid to serbia by steven woehrel introduction and us concerns the european union eu and nato have long tied their enlargement policies with respect to their western balkan states with assessments of thei r cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the form er yugoslavia icty established in 1993 to address serious violations of international humanitarian law that occurred during the violent conflicts in the former yugo slavia cooperation on war crimes judicial proceedings has been seen as an obliga tion of the countries in the region and prerequisite to closer association with the eu and nato on numerous occasions icty conditionality policy has held up euroatlantic integration processes for some western balkan countries that would otherwise likel have gone forward the policy has also arguably provided key incentive for the balkan states to meet their obligations with respect to icty and facilitate the apprehension of indicted suspectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22097crs2 1 for example see statements by judge fausto pocar icty president to the security council june 4 2008 and december 10 2007

indictments in march 2005 by mid2008 the tribunal had completed proceedings for 113 of 161 indicted suspects under its completion strategy devised in 2004 icty was slated to c onclude all in itial trials by 2008 and all court proceedings by 2010 this timetable may slip little although icty officials still expect to complete almost all initial trials by the nd of 2009 and appeals by 2011 improvements in efficien cy and court proceedings ve facilitated adherence to planned timetables as has the tribunals ongoing efforts to refer some cases to domestic courts in the region however further dela ys may result if the remaining three suspects are not soon detained and transf erred above all icty offi cials have urged the security council not to close the tribunals doors before karadzic and mladic are brought before the hague and not to let their trials become victim of the tribunal s completion strategy1 the tribunals most highprof ile trial to date against fo rmer serbian leader slobodan milosevic ended without verdict after milosevics d eath on march 11 2006 by heart attack while in custody another prominent case the trial of serbian radical party political leader vojislav sese lj opened in november 2007 most recently in april 2008 the tribunal acquitted and released former kosovar prime minister ramush haradinaj of all charges of alleged crimes against humanity the courts office of the prosecutor has said it would appeal the judgment second codefendant in the haradinaj case was also acquitted while third was sentenced to sixyear prison term us administration and congressional inte rest in balkan cooperation with the tribunal stems from longstanding us suppor t for icty and insistence that the top ranking indictees be turned over to the hagu key us goal for the balkan region is to secure its integration into euroatlantic institutions such as the european union and nato full cooperation with icty has l ong been held up by us and other international officials as precondition to further euroatlantic in tegration although the degree to which this conditionality should be observed has been subject to debate with respect to eu and nato association and partnership affiliations the bush administration has also supported the tr ibunals completion st rategy in annual appropriations bills congress s conditioned some b ilateral us assist

certifying improved cooperation w ith icty the second session of the 110th congress may again consider certification requirements for serbia in foreign aid legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22097crs3 summary of recent transfers on july 21 2008 the serbian government announced that its security services in belgrade had arrested former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic one of the top two fugitives who had eluded capture for 13 years karadzic was indicted in 1995 by icty on 11 counts of war crimes and crimes agains t humanity including genocide he had reportedly been living openly in belgrade for the past few years under false identity as doctor of alternative medi cine named dragan dabic nd in disguise so altering that even after his arrest many observers thought him unrecognizable as karadzic analysts attributed the timing of the longove rdue arrest to the recent creation of new serbian government and to its determination to bring the country closer to european union membership although his attorneys have attempted to appeal his extradition karadzic is expected soon to be transferred to the hague on june 11 2008 serbian aut horities arrested stojan zupljanin in his home near belgrade zupljanin put up armed resistance but initially claimed he was victim of mistaken identity zupljanin was security and police commander and aide to wartime bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic his indictment from 1999 charges him with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against muslim and croat communities in northwestern bosnia bosnian serb authorities said they had exchanged information with belgrade that facilitated zupljanins arrest which represented the first capture of major war crimes suspect in about year be lgrade transferred z upljanin to the hague on june 21 in june 2007 serbia facilitate d the transfer of two fugitive suspects to the hague former general zdravko tolimir top aide to gen mladic and vlastimir djordjevic former serbian police commander their arrests came shortly after new serbian government was formed that year and pave d the way for forward movement in serbias negotiations with the eu on an association agreement in the previous year two bosnian serb suspects were handed over from 2004 to early 2005 spate of transfers of mainly bosnian serb indictees took pla ce many the result of voluntary surrenders negotiated by serbian au thorities in addition some top former yugoslav army generals surrendered as did former kosovo prime minist er ramush haradinaj former croatian general gotovina was arre sted in late 2005 with respect to serbia icty officials have welcomed belgrades repeated expressed commitment to fulfill its obligations to cooperate with the tribunal ev while they have criticized belgrades tendency to rely on negotiated surrenders rather than arrests icty officials warmly welcomed serbias arrest of stojan zupljanin in june 2008 which they said confirmed the prosecutors assertion that the remaining fugitives were within reach of belgrade remaining suspects at large the surprising arrest of karadzic has elevated expectations that the final remaining indicted war crimes suspects at large may so soon be apprehende d above all gen ratko mladics capture is highly anticipated although some observers predict that he will not surrender peacefully or allow himself to be captured alive mladic as karadzic is charged with genocide crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war as part of the bosnian serb campaig n in 1991 to 1995 to control territory and drivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22097crs4 2 details of the indictments can be found at the icty home page httpwwwunorgicty 3 statement by icty prosecutor carla ponte december 10 2007out nonserb populations from srebrenica and other areas2 the second remaining fugitive is goran hadzic former political leader of breakaway serbs in croatia in her final address to the security council in december 2007 former icty chief prosecutor carla ponte focused almost entirely on the issue of the remaining fugitives she decried serbias failure to take action to arrest and transfer the remaining suspects despite expressions of optimis m earlier in the year she reported in december evidence from serbia of clear roadmap any serious lead s or any serious efforts to arrest the four fugitives in short full cooperation with icty3 she repeated assertions that both mladic and karadzic we re within reach of authorities in serbia in the past few years several news stories re ported sightings of karadzic nd mladic and unconfirmed surrender negotiations with local authorities in bosnia nato and european union military forces have conducted numerous operations targeting associates of the fugitives the arrest of zupljanin in june 2008 fueled increased specu lation about possible further arrests of the remaining three top suspects policy implications the united states and the european union often in conjunction with ictys office of the prosecutor have frequently wielded conditionality policies in order to foster improved balkan cooperation with icty on the incentive side western officials have expressed support for the euroa tlantic aspirations of the we stern balkan states and for moving forward in these integration processe s some of which have lagged primarily over limited icty cooperation all of the western balkan states have made closer ties to nato and especially the eu key strategic priority at the same time western officials also emphasize that the balkan states must adhere to standards on international commitments and the rule of law especially with regard to meeting obligations on icty cooperation and overcoming the gacy of the wartime years us and eu policy on icty cooperation and euroatlantic integration had frequently come under scrutiny in late 2006 nato agreed to invite serbia and bosnia in addition to montenegro to join part nership for peace even though mladic and karadzic remained at large similarly the eu resumed stalled saa negotiations with serbia in june 2007 after belg rade made further progress in bringing suspected war criminals to the hague some observers belie ve that in view of kosovos declaration of independence in february 2008 western institutions need to r each out to serbia to sustain its western integration prospects and association others including icty officials believe that the longstanding conditionality policy of the eu has proven to be the most effective tool to bring about arre sts and transfers of war crimes suspects and needs to be maintained in order to finally bring about the arrest of ratko mladic in particular in the 110th congress members of congress may continue to consider icty conditionality policy in the context of appropriations for bilateral us assistance to serbia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22097crs5 long delays in bringing in mladic and ka radzic may also bear consequences for the tribunals plans to complete its operations on schedule and cl ose down in the next couple of years russia for example firmly opposes any further prolongation of ictys mandate while icty officials insist that the tribunal cannot close before mladic and karadzic face trial at the hague bosnia and herzegovina in recent years major goal held by bosnia and herzegovina was to achieve membership in natos partnership for peace pfp program and to complete stabilization and association agreement saa with the european union for years limited cooperation with icty especially by the republika srpska rs contributed to slowdown in both efforts until january 2005 for example rs authorities had not turned over single indicted suspect the icty issue also provided former high representative ashdown justifica tion for removing obstr uctionist officials freezing assets and even reshaping governing institutions especially in the defense and security sectors the eu opened saa negotia tions with bosnia in november 2005 after bosnias leaders came to preliminary agreement on police reforms stalled reforms in the police and other sectors presented obst acles to concluding the saa although incomplete icty cooperation wa s also viewed as an unfulf illed requirement bosnia finally signed an saa in midjune 2008 as noted earlier bosnia gained entry into natos pfp program in late 2006 and in 2008 nato invited bosnia to enter into an intensified dialogue with the alliance the icty prosecutor has cited improved cooperation from bosnia and bosn ias current leadership suppor ts in principle the arrest of any of the remaining fugitives icty has also praised the work of bosnias war crimes chamber of the state court of bosnia in its proceedings with war crimes trials that had been transferred from icty croatia croatia had largely positive record of cooperation with icty since 2001 except for one highprofile case involving i ndicted gen gotovina in march 2005 eu members indefinitely post poned the opening of membersh ip talks with croatia and created special task force to assess croatias icty coope ration the croatian government adopted an action plan to incr ease efforts to track down gotovina icty prosecutor ponte reported full cooperation with zagr eb on october 3 paving the way for the eu to formally open accession negotiations with croatia gotovinas subsequent capture largely resolved the matte r of icty cooperation for croatia with the exception of some outstanding issues on access to government documents serbia despite serbias notable achievement of extraditing wartime serbian leader slobodan milosevic to the hague in 2001 serbia s level of coopera tion with icty had remained limited in the ensuing years begi nning in late 2004 the former kostunica government substantially increased effo rts to encourage the voluntary surrender of indicted persons leading to the transfer of over 15 indicted accused nevertheless the government remained ambivalent about arrests in particular serbias security services were thought to be actively resi sting efforts to assist in pprehending mladic after the formation of new serbian government head ed by president tadics democratic party but returning kostunica as prime minist er after january 2007 elections belgrade emphasized the need to resolve the icty fugitive issue for good by midyear in 2007 the icty prosecutor reported notable progress in serbias level of cooperation including political commitment new governing structures to facilitate capture and more responsiveness to tribunal re quests for documentation she nd other officials also noted that an early 2007 judgment by the internati onal court of justice in which serbia washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22097crs6 4

obligation to cooperate fully with icty in bringing those charged with genocide to justice4 finally in 2008 new and str onger electoral mandate for the democratic party in favor of closer ties to the eu appeared to set the stage for further action the june 2008 arrest of zupljanin and pecially the july arrest of karadzic were received very positively in foreign capitals at the same time many in ternational officials emphasize their expectations of so bringing mladic to justice serbias cooperation with icty has been an intermittent sore spot in its foreign relations in accordance with annual foreign ai d legislation the united states suspended portions of bilatera l assistance to serbia over wa r crimes issues in fy2004 fy2005 fy2006 and again in may 2007 affecting sm all portion of fy2007 funds which was released in july 2007 serbia and mont enegro had long been denied entry into partnership for peace despite having made so significant progress in defense reforms until the late 2006 nato summit at natos april 2008 summit in bucharest alliance members conveyed their desire to intensify relations w ith serbia which had cooled primarily over hard feelings by belgrade over us and other european recognition of kosovos independence in february 2008 the icty cooperation issue has also had big impact on serbia and montenegros path toward eu accession5 the eu opened saa negotiati ons with serbia in october 2005 but suspended the talks in may 2006 exp licitly over the issue of icty cooperation one year later brussels agreed to resume saa talks with serbia given belgrades mid year progress in furthering icty cooperation and initialed an accord in november after long debate eu members agreed to sign the saa with serbia in late april 2008 move seen as an effort to boost proeur opean forces in serbia in advance of early parliamentary elections in may before ratifying the saa however eu members said they would again take into account an asse ssment of serbias c ooperation with icty some analysts believe that serbias ambitious drive to achieve eu candidate status within short period of time drove the new serbian governments moves to arrest karadzic and may potentially bring belgrade to close in on the last remaining fugitives6
