after the 2000 election had tended to focus on technological fixes such as eliminating punchcards consensus emerged subsequently that the issues and the solutions needed were more complex and often involved tradeoffs among diverse goals v reflects those developmentsit funded replacement of punchcard and lever systems but also broader improvements in election administration g24g152g157g146g151g144g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g156g561 currently most jurisdictions use optical scan direct recording electronic dre systems or both there is consensus on whether any one technology is best although use of optical scan and dre systems has been increasing for several years states have different practices and requirements v does not require any particular voting system but it sets requirements that influence what systems election officials choose systems used in federal elections must provide for error correction by voters manual auditing accessibility alternative languages and errorrate standards systems must also maintain voter privacy and ballot confidentiality and states must adopt uniform standards for what constitutes vote on each system

least one per polling place and other factors drove some states to adopt dres but controversy exists about the security of those systems some experts and advocates believe that the problem is serious enough to require that all voting systems produce paper ballots that can be verified by voters and that will serve as the official record of the votes for any recount others believe that other safeguards can make dres sufficiently safe from tampering that use of printed paper ballots would create too many problems and that the controversy risks drawing ttention away from the demonstrated utility of dres in addressing problems of access to and usability of voting systems v requires paper audit trail for the voting system but not paper ballots however many states have instituted paperballottrail requirements several bills introduced in recent congresses would address this issue see crs report rl33894 election reform issues and legislative proposals in the 109 th congress and crs report rl32526 electronic voting systems dres legislation in the 108th congress most would require specific design standard for paper ballots rather than setting performance standard that can be met in different ways which was the approach taken by v with respect to voting system requirements proponents of paper ballots argue that legislated design standard is the only way to ensure that voting systems exhibit the desired level of verifiability and security opponents argue that such design standard freezes technology and stifles innovation thereby precluding the development and implementation of technologies with superior levels of verifiability and security than is possible with current technology see crs report rl33190 the direct recording electronic voting machine dre
