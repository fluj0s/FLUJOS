background daylight saving time dst is not new concept in 1784 when benjamin franklin was minister to france an idea occurred to him in that part of the year when the sun rises while most people are still asleep clocks could be reset to allow an extra hour of daylight during waking hours he calculated that french shopkeepers could save one million francs per year on candles in 1907 william willett british builder member of parliament and fellow of the royal astronomical society proposed the adoption of advanced time the bill he introduced was reported favorably asserting that dst would move hours of work and recreation more closely to daylight hours reducing expenditures on artificial light there was much opposition however and the idea was not adopted during world war i in an effort to conserve fuel germany began observing dst on may 1 1916 as the war progressed the rest of europe adopted dst the plan was not formally adopted in the united states until 1918 an act to preserve daylight and provide standard time for the united states was enacted on march 19 1918 40 stat 450 it established both standard time zones and set summer dst to begin on march 31 1918 the idea was unpopular however and congress abolished dst after the war overriding president woodrow wilsons veto dst became local option and was observed in some states until world war ii when president

hour at 200 am on the last sunday in october states were allowed to exempt themselves from dst as long as the entire state did so if state chose to observe dst the time changes were required to begin and end on the established dates in 1968 arizona became the first state to exempt itself from dst in 1972 the act was amended pl 92267 allowing those states split between time zones to exempt either the entire state or that part of the state lying within different time zone the newly created department of transportation dot was given the power to enforce the law currently the following states do not observe dst arizona hawaii american samoa puerto rico and the virgin islands during the 1973 oil embargo by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec in an effort to conserve fuel congress enacted trial period of yearround dst pl 93182 beginning january 6 1974 and ending april 27 1975 from the beginning the trial was hotly debated those in favor pointed to the benefits of

extending dst into march reported in 1975 that modest overall benefits might be realized by shift from the historic sixmonth dst may through october in areas of energy conservation overall traffic safety and reduced violent crime however dot also reported that these benefits were minimal and difficult to distinguish from seasonal variations and fluctuations in energy prices congress then asked the national bureau of standards nbs to evaluate the dot report in an april 1976 report to congress review and technical evaluation of the dot daylight saving time study nbs found significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities it did find statistically significant evidence of increased fatalities among schoolage children in the mornings during the fourmonth period januaryapril 1974 as compared with the same period nondst of 1973 nbs stated that it was impossible to determine what if any of this increase was due to dst when this same data was compared between 1973 and 1974 for the individual months of march and april significant difference was found for fatalities among schoolage children in the mornings in 1986 the 99th congress enacted pl 99359 which amended the uniform time act by changing the beginning of dst to the first sunday in april and having the end remain the last sunday in october in 2005 the 109th congress enacted pl 10958 the energy policy act of 2005 section 110 of this act amended the uniform time act by changing the beginning of dst to the second sunday in march and changing the ending date to the first sunday in november the act requires the secretary of energy to report to congress within nine months of the march 2007 effective date on the impact of this section on energy crs3 consumption in the united states congress retains the

moving state or an area within state from one time zone to another requires regulation issued by the department of transportation dot the governor or state legislature makes the request for state or any part of the state the highest elected officials in the county may make request for that county the standard in the statute for such decisions is the convenience of commerce in that area the convenience of commerce is defined broadly to consider such circumstances as the shipment of goods within the community the origin of television and radio broadcasts the areas where most residents work attend school worship or receive health care the location of airports railway and bus stations and the major elements of the communitys economy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22284 after receiving request dot will then determine whether it meets the minimum statutory criteria before issuing notice of proposed rulemaking which will solicit public comment and schedule public hearing usually the hearing is held in the area requesting the change so that all affected parties can be represented after the close of the comment period the comments are reviewed and appropriate final action taken if the secretary agrees that the statutory requirement has been met the change is instituted usually at the next changeover to or from dst moving an area on or off dst under the uniform time act moving an area on or off dst is accomplished through legal action at the state level some states require legislation while others require executive action such as governors executive order information on procedures required in specific state may be obtained from that states legislature or governors office although it may exempt itself if state decides to observe dst the dates of observance must comply with federal legislation
