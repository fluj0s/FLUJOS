presentation to saudi business leaders 10 snf the overarching theme of the visit according to french embassy riyadh was to strengthen the personal relationship between pres sarkozy and king abdullah former pres jacques chirac and king abdullah had strong friendship with agreement on host of issues reportedly the saudis were concerned by sarkozys election last year because of his expressed support of israel and jewish background this visit was to dispel saudi concerns and to assure the saudis that pres sarkozy could be counted on as strongly as pres chirac likewise the french told us they are modifying their mid east policy the levant states have been frances top mid east focus while the arabian gulf had been at the bottom of the list recognition of saudi arabias emerging influence and status has resulted in the french putting saudi arabia at the top of the french foreign policy middle east list good visit but not great 11 snf comment per the french dcm they were quite pleased with pres sarkozys visit they were disappointed they could not issue any joint communiqus on any major issues such as iran or the mepp still they viewed the reciprocal state visits were steps forward in frenchsaudi relations press coverage of pres sarkozy was positive with front page newspaper pictures of both leaders smiling together 12 snf however our saudi contacts provided some negative comments minor in substance but significant to saudi sensibilities initially sarkozys fiance carla bruni was expected to accompany him but finally did not travel which the saudis found offensive given their strict conservative culture against the company of an unmarried woman various protocol faux pas were committed by the french delegation during the visit the french advance made in saudi opinion unreasonable logistical demands finally pres sarkozy was viewed as less than gracious in saudi eyes during certain events such as avoiding tasting traditional arab foods and bored look during the televised arrival sword ceremony while these are minor points the fact our saudi contacts mentioned them shows their discontent these incidents riyadh 00000102 003 of 003 characterized one overarching private comment from the saudis that pres sarkozy has not replaced pres chirac in saudi eyes other usually wellinformed saudi contacts have lamented the overtly commercial nature of the visit sarkozy
