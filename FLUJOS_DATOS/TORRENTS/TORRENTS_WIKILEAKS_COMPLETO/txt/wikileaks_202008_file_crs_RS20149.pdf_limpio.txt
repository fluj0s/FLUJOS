settled in southern albanian region s inhabited by albanians of greek ethnicity and clashes ensue greece might aid its kin17 and turkey might aid the albanian government however athens resolved

enter greece which would repel them by military force prompting turkis h forces to aid the albanians greece has cured its northern border with 1000 additional police and while incidents may occur it is unlikely to use force systematically to repel refugees gre ece hosts over 400000 albanian immigrants and must be sensitive to their possible reaction to the illtreatment of refugees however greece fears resolution that would create an independent kosovo heralding greater albania which would further destabilize the region and could provoke wider war some suggest that greece has territorial designs on the former yugoslav republic of macedo nia based on the early 20 century balkan wars but this analysis does tth reflect modern greeces selfimage as european state satisfaction with its borders homogeneity and lack of desire to import the fyroms eth nic woes or poverty greeces objection to the fyroms name choice stemmed from concerns about the latter s improbable irredentism with respect to northern greek territory not from its own turkey since 1923 the turkish republic has attempted to follow the precept f mustafa kemal ataturk its founder peace at home peace abroad thus
