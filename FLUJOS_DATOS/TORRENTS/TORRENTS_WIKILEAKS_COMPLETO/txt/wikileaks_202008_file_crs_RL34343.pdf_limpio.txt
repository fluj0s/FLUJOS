an overview of proposals in the 110th congress introduction tax reform has been of cong ressional interest in the 110th congress this report examines three main categories of tax re form fundamental ta x reform tax reform based on the elimination of the individual alternative minimum tax and treasurys proposals for reforming the corporate income tax most proposals for fundamental tax reform involve the concept of replacing our current income tax system with some form of consumption tax usually with single or flat tax rate other proposals would signif icantly broaden the income tax base and lower tax rates proponents of these tax revisi ons are concerned about the administrative and compliance costs of th current income tax system proponents also believe that the current income tax system discourages saving reduces economic growth causes economic distortions and worsens the nations balance of trade critics question whether most of thes proposals will improve macroeconomic performance express concern about equity i ssues and maintain that transitional costs will be prohibitive most observers believe that the problems and complexities of our current tax system are not primarily re lated to the number of tax rates but rather stem from difficulties associated with measuring the tax base in the 110th congress numerous bills have been introduced that would eliminate the individual alternative minimum tax amt and require major changes in the tax code arguably the most significant b ill was introduced by house ways and means committee chair charles b rangel the tax reduction and re form act of 2007 hr 3970 temporary patch for the am t was passed in the first session of the 110th congress but the issue of amt reform continues to be bated in the second session the treasury released two reports that examined proposals for reform of the business income tax system fundamental tax reform most proposals for fundamental tax refo rm would change the tax base from income to consumption consequently th initial sections of this report examine topics concerning broadbase d consumption taxation late r in this report other tax reform proposals are discussed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34343crs2 the relationship between income and consumption although our current tax structure is primarily an inco tax it actually contains elements of both an income nd consumptionbased tax for example the current tax system includes in its tax base wages interest dividends and capital gains all of which are consistent with an income tax at the same time however the current tax system excludes some savings such as pension and individual retirement account ira contributions which is cons istent with tax using consumption base the easiest way to understand the di fferences between the income and consumption tax bases is to define and understand the ec onomic concept of income in its broadest sense income is measure of the command over resources that an individual acquires during given time period conceptually individuals can exercise two options with regard to their income they can consume it or they can save it this theoretical relationshi p between income consumption and saving allows very useful accounting identity to be established income by definition must equal consumption plus saving it follows that tax that has measure of comprehensive income applies to both c onsumption and savings consumption tax however applies to income minus saving consumption tax can be levied at the individual level in form very similar to the current system an individual woul d add up all income in the same way as is done now under the income tax but then w ould subtract out net savings saving minus borrowing the result of these cal culations would be the consumption base on which tax is assessed quivalently consumption ta x can also be collected at the retail level in the form of sales tax or at each st age of the production process in the form of valueadded tax vat regardless of the form or point wher consumption tax is collected it is ultimately paid by the indi vidual doing the consuming it should be noted that consumption in the economy as whole is smaller than income thus to raise equal amounts of revenue in given year tax rates on comprehensive consumption base would have to be higher than the tax rates on comprehensive income base proposals to shift from an income tax to consumption tax differ in their treatment of the estate and gift tax some proposals w ould eliminate the estate and gift tax while others would not affect it what should be taxed should the tax base be inco or consumption is one inherently superior to the other how do they stack up in terms of simplicity fairness and efficiency the three standards by which tax systems are generally assessed there appears to be insufficient theoretical or empirical evidence to conclude that consumptionbased tax is inhe rently superior to an inco mebased tax or vice versahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34343crs3 1 the loss in economic efficiency due to tax is referred to by economists as the deadweight loss or excess burden of the tax 2 for an analysis of effects of ta x policy on saving see crs report rl33482 saving incentives what may work what may not by thomas l hungerfordone issue associated with the choice of tax base is equity how the tax burden will be distributed across income classes and different types of taxpayers for example tax is progressive if tax paid as percentage of income increases as income rises although some types of c onsumption taxes can be designed to achieve any desired level of progressivity with respect to consumption alone their progressivity with respect to income could only be approximated also consumption tax would involve redistri bution of the tax burden by age group with the young and old generally bearing more of the total tax burden than those in their prime earning years who have higher sa vings rate since savings are not subject to consumption tax and the transition fro m an incomebased tax to consumption based tax would have the potential for creating windfall gains for some taxpayers and losses for others definitive assessment cannot be made of the effects of taxing consumption on either economic efficiency or the aggregat level of savings although the current tax systems distortions of the relativ attractiveness of present and future consumption saving would be eliminated to raise the same am ount of tax revenue consumptionbased tax woul d require an increase in marginal tax rates since consumption is smaller than income these higher marginal tax rates in turn would increase the current systems distortion between the attractiveness of market eg purchased products and nonmarke t activities eg leisure1 the net effect on overall economic efficiency cannot be as certained theoretically in addition economic theory indicates consumpti on tax would not necessarily produce an increase in saving the increase in aftertax income might reduce saving while the increase in the return to saving may increase it the net result is uncertain2 positive aspect of consumptionbased tax is the ease with which the individual and corporate tax systems could be integrated in addition the problems introduced in the current system by separate provisions for capital gains attempts to distinguish between real and nominal in come and depreciati on procedures would essentially be eliminat ed it is doubtful however that consumptionbased tax would have much effect on the complexitie s introduced into the system to promote specific social and economic goals many of the same factors that influenced the design of the current income tax system could exert the same influences on the final design of consumption tax whether one prefers income or consump tion one tax rate or multiple tax rates critical point to remember is that the be nefits to be derived from tax revision would result from defining the tax base more co mprehensively than it is under current law tax with base that is comprehensivel defined would prove more equitable and efficient than tax with less comprehensively defined basehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34343crs4 3 for an overview of the economic issues rele vant to broadbased consumption taxation see crs report rl32603 the flat tax valueadded

proposals the valueadde d tax vat the re tail sales tax the consumedincome tax and the flat tax ba sed on proposal formul ated by robert hall and alvin rabushka of the hoover institution3 valueadded tax valueadded tax is tax levied at each stage of production on firms value added the value added of firm is th difference between firms sales and firms purchases of inputs fro m other firms the vat is collected by each firm at every stage of production there are three alternative methods of calculating vat the credit method the subtraction method and the addition thod under the credit method the firm calculates the vat to be remitted to the government by twostep process first the firm multiplies its sales by th tax rate to calculate vat collected on sales second the firm credits vat paid on inputs agai nst vat collected on sales and remits this difference to the government the firm calculates its vat liability before setting its prices to fully shift the vat to the buyer under the creditinvoice method type of credit method the firm is required to show vat separately on all sales invoices and to calculate the vat credit on input s by adding all vat shown on purchase invoices under the subtraction method the firm cal culates its value dded by subtracting its cost of taxed inputs from its sales ne xt the firm determines its vat liability by multiplying its value added by the vat rate4 under the addition method the firm calculates its value added by adding all payments for untaxed inputs eg wages and profits next the firm multiplies its value added by the vat rate to calculate vat to be remitted to the government retail sales tax in contrast to vat retail sales tax is consumption tax levied only at single stage of production the retail stage the retailer collects specific percentage markup in the retail price of g ood or service which is then re mitted to the tax authoritieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34343crs5 5 for comprehensive overview of this concept see crs

wage tax and cashflow ta x on businesses wage tax is tax only on salaries and wages cashflow tax is generally tax on gross receipts minus all outlays it is essentially modifi ed vat with wages and pensions subtracted from the vat base and taxed at the indivi dual level under standard vat firm would not subtract its wage and pension c ontributions when calculating its tax base under this proposal some wage income would not be included in the tax base because of exemptions under standard vat all wage income would be included in the tax base5 international comparisons there are two major distinctions between recent flat tax proposals for the united states that would change the tax base from income to consumption and the current tax systems of other develope d nations first although the united states is the only developed nation without br oadbased consumption tax at the national level other developed nations adopted broadbased consumption ta xes as adjuncts to or replacements for other consumption taxes rather than as replacements for their incomebased taxes most of the c ongressional proposals would replace our current income taxes with consumption taxes second all develope d nations with vats except japan calculate their vats using the creditinvoice method in contrast most of the current us flat tax proposals which include vat compone nts use the subtraction method of calculation other types of fundamental tax reform two other types of fundame ntal tax reform are 1 reforming the current income tax by broadening th tax base and lowering tax rates and 2 tax plan thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34343crs6 gives taxpayers choice between the current income tax system and simplified income tax income tax reform base broadening income tax base

p 7 15 ibid p 35 16 ibid p 1during the first session of the 110th congress the treasury released two major studies concerning corporate tax re form business taxation and global competitiveness and approaches to improve the competitiveness of the us business tax system for the 21st century these studies may be the basis for legislation in the second session of the 110th congress report on business taxation and global competitiveness on july 23 2007 the us department of the treasury held conference on business taxation and global competitiveness the treasury released background paper which argued that the current business tax base includes an array of special provisions that reduce taxes for particular types of activities industries and businesses these provisions take the form of exclusions from income deductions allowed or enhanced from what otherwise would be allowed preferential tax rates income deferral and tax credits some of these provisions are intended to ease tax compliance and administration such as allowing cash accounting for small corporations but others were intended by congress to encourage particular types of activity the premise underlying many of the special provisions is that they promote activities that have spillover effe cts or address various externalities or market failures unwarranted tax subs idies may lead to the misallocation of capital as they encourage investment decisions based on tax characteristics rather than economic fundamentals and generally reduce economic growth together these provisions substantially narrow the corporate tax base which requires that tax rates be higher in order to raise the same tax revenue for example it is estimated that these special corporate tax provisions narrow the corporate tax base by roughly 25 percent if the tax base were broadened by removing these special provisions the t op corporate tax rate of 35 percent could be reduced to 27 percent or as an alternative about 40 percent of investment costs could be written off immediately ie expensed by all businesses14 the treasury states that the united st ates has the second highest statutory corporate tax rate among countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an organization consisting of most developed countries15 the treasury maintains that broadening the corporate tax base and reducing the statutory corporate tax rate would improve the global competitive position of the united states16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34343crs17 17 us department of the treasury office of tax policy approaches to
