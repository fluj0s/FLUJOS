congress summary on september 8 2003 the federal co mmunications commission approved the merger of univision communications inc the dominant spanish language media company in the us which owns the leading spanish language broadcast television network cable television ne twork television station group music recording and publishing company and internet site and hispanic broadcasting corporation hbc the largest spanish language radio operator in the us the commission explicitly rejected the argument that there is something unique about the needs of the spanish speaking population in the us or about the financing production or distribution of spanish language progra mming for us households that requires distinction to be made between spanish language media outle ts and other media outlets the hispanic community is the largest minority community in the us but it is not linguistically homogeneous although most hispanics speak english well almost 8 million hispanics speak english either not at all or not well survey data indicate that latino households tend to watch television as family rather than as individuals when family members have varying levels of english proficiency the family is likely to watch spanish language programming particularly for news to accommodate those with limited understanding of english as result more than half of all bilingual spanishenglish lati adults prefer to watch primarily spanish language news programming on television the demand by advertisers to reach the rapidly growing buying power of the spanish speaking population has attracted investment capital to the spanish language broadcasting industry there are far more broadcast television and radio stations as well as broadcast cable and satellite channels serving the spanish speaking population than ever before although spanish language outlets have captured smaller share of adve rtising revenues than of audience their advertising revenues ar the most rapidly growing in the media industry at the same time especially after the univisionhbc merger ownership and control of spanish language media in the us are far more concentrated than the media overall us broadcast policy as mandated by congress is premised on the broad public policy objectives of competition localism and diversity of voices congress has not explicitly addressed whether or how those objectives should be pursued for particular subsets of the population such as the spanish speaking population two identical bills hr 3027 and s 1563 would prohibit the fcc from approving any assignment or

congress and implemented by the federal communications commission fcc or commission through its media ownership rules is premised on the broad public policy objectives of competition localism and diversity of voices congress has not explicitly addressed whether or how those objectives should be pursued for particular subsets of the population such as the spanish speaking population two identical bills hr 3027 and s 1563 would prohibit the fcc from approving any ssignment or transfer of broadcast television or radio license used to serv language minority without hearing regarding the effects on competition and diversity in the programming and distribution markets for the specific minority language at issue and also would require the fcc to report to congress regarding the ownership and control of broadcast stations used to serve language minorities the ownership restrictions in the fcc ru vary by market size based on the total number of broadcast sta tions in geographic market1 in applying these rules there has been debate about whether the re levant diversity market for reviewing mergers of spanish language broadcast pr operties should include all outlets

prog ramming on television the demand by advertisers to reach the rapidly growing buying power and youthful urban demographics of the span ish speaking community has attracted both national advertising and inve stment capital to the spanish language broadcasting industry there are far more broadcast television and radio stations as well as broadcast cable and satellite channels serving the spanish speaking community than ever before at the same time there are strong market forces propelling consolidation in the us media sector see crs report rl32026 market dynamics and public policy issues in the video programming industry and crs report rl32027 market structure of the video programming i ndustry and emerging public policy issues these forces exist for spanish language media outlets as well as english language outlets univision has asserted that its merger with hbc is in the public interest because it gives it the size and scope needed to compete with english language media giants for national advertising dollars currently spanish language programming receives only small though rapidly growin g share of those national advertising dollars but that merger of two dominant spanish language media companies reduced the number of independent spanis h language voices available to spanish speaking viewers and listeners and potentially raises barriers to competitive entry by other companies offering spanish language programming the 2000 us census awakened many americans to the size buying power and linguistic diversity of the hispanic popul ation in the united states since then analysts at the census bureau res earch foundations and market research organizations have mined the census da ta and performed additional surveys that significantly expand the information available on the demographic purchasing and viewing characteristics of the hispanic popula tion these rich data sources show the hispanic population is not homogeneous but rather includes subgroups with very different needs and demands for spanish language programming selective review of the data therefore could lead to one of two simplistic conclusions that english language programming provides all hispanics g ood alternative to spanish language programming or that english language programming does not serve the hispanic population at all neither conclusion accurately describes the far more complexhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32116crs3 3 the fcc has identified the uniqueness of foreign language programming in general and spanish language programming in particular in

population demographic data about th size and linguistic ability of the spanish speaking population help inform public policy makers millions of americans have primary languages other than english the federal government has not adopted media rules for each of these foreign speaking populations for example the fcc has not expressed concern about the diversity of voices for the chinese speaking population in the us that does not speak english the spanish speaking population in the us is uniquely large and includes uniquely large cohort that does not speak andor comprehend english well this raises the issue of whether policy makers should consider implementing rules specific to that population3 the hispanic4 population in the united states has doubled since 19805 there were 388 million people in the united states in july 2002 who identified as hispanic or latino 13 of the total population making the hispanic community the largest minority community in the country according to the

that the hispanic buying power statistics are somewhat overstated because they do not take into consideration the vast amount of money that is sent by us hispanics to latin america in the form of personal remittances according to the world bank remittances to latin america and the caribbean are approximately 20 b illion per year and growing the true figure could actually be much higher ce cash is often sent to latin america via informal routes the lehman report cites recent study by the interamerican development bank that found that the typical latin american working in the us earns less than 20000 year but sends home about 3000 of that moreover to the extent that the hispanic community is competing with the african american community for the attention of investors and advertisers the lehman report claims that on per capita basis the growth of african american buying power has outpaced hispanic buying power over the last six years on an absolute basis african american buying power remains 23 hi gher than hispanic buying power spanish speaking population television viewing patterns an issue for policymakers relates to the television viewing patterns of the spanish speaking population and the degr ee to which that population relies on english language programming as opposed to spanish language programming to receive news and public affair s information to the extent that the spanish speaking population increasingly relies on english nguage programming for news and public affairs programming there would be less of rationale for providing special treatment of spanish langua ge programming however if that population continues to rely on spanish language programming for significant portion of their news and public affairs information it might be reasonable to treat spanish language programming as distinct from english language programming nielsen data show that both hispan icamerican television households and spanish dominant television households wa tch more

news corp viacom and genbc it claims that vertical integration into radio and other media would allow it to offer national advertisers full range of advertising ou tlets with greater access to advertising revenues univision believes it would have the increased financial capability needed to expand and improve its program offeri ngs and to acquire and convert english language outlets to spanish language programming107 in addition viewers would benefit by gaining access to information about mainstream pr oducts and services the available market data neither prove nor disprove univisions claim as discussed above large portion of the differential between spanish language television audience share nd advertising revenue shar reportedly asserted by univision president ray rodriguez can be explained by differences in household income moreover the data in tables 15 nd 16 show that market forces have begun to reverse that situation responding to the growing buying power and favorable demographics of the spanish speaking popul ation that became widely publicized as result of the 2000 census this could suggest that consolidation in spanish language media ownership is

stations affiliated with univision have refused to accept telemundo advertising with respect to the first assertion wh ile it does not benefit consumers when unused existing programming is warehous ed and therefore not available to competitors and hence viewers there is indication that the warehoused mexican and venezuelan programming currently represents an essential input for which univisions competitors do not have alternative sources of supply it is possible that denying competitors access to this availabl programming could raise their costs if alternative sources of programming are more expensive but the trend has been toward us produced programming specifically targeting the us hispanic population telemundo itself states that it has rapidly moved fro m total reliance on outside primarily foreign progra mming sources to producing 70 of its programming inhouse133 on the other hand univision continues to rely on these two sources for close to 50 of its pr ogramming which must be extremely popular given univisions dominant ratings there is apparent benef it to consumers from the continued long term exclusive cont ract and warehousing of programs that univision chooses not to use but it is not clear that the practice currently has anticompetitive consequences the second assertion like the first would appear to be serious only to the extent that the talent to whom co mpetitors allegedly are denied access represent an essential programming input while it is true that the american public seeks media coverage of celebrities the impact of denying non univision networks access to univision celebrities does not appear to under mine their ability to offer progra mming univision has obligation to share the popular ity of its talent with its competitors but this assertion does highlight the potential for vertically integrated company with market power to leverage its market position in fashion that could make it difficult for effective competition to develo p if univisions music group which has 35 share of the spanish language market in the us were to prohibit its talent from appearing on nonunivision television cable or radio networks for example that likely would constrain the ability of smaller competitors to the univision telefutura and galavision networks from ving access to the type of talent needed to challenge univisions dominance typically programmer seeks positive publicity for its talent wherever such publicity is available network that refuses to allow its talent to be interviewed on other networks most likely is exhibiting market power the third assertion involves advertising on media outlets that reach particular target audience telemundo wants to incr ease its relatively small audience share to become not so distant second to univision it claims that the most effective way to reach potential viewers of its spanish language television network to inform them of its new programs is by advertising on other spanish language outlets especially radio outlets that have large audiences that claim appears to be supported byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32116crs40 134 august 21 2003 telemundo ex parte to the fcc at p 4 135 47 cfr 73658itelemundo spending 74 of its 2002 advertising budget on radio134 univision and entravision outlets have the widest reach to the spanish speaking population entravisions refusal to air telemundo advertisements if practiced by all univision related media outlets could result in the dominant televisionradio combination denying its television competitors access to majority of spanish speaking radio listeners and television vi ewers absent rules th at prohibit such conduct consolidation that extends dominant firms reach potentially denies key access to competitors as explained in crs report rl32026 market dynamics and public policy issues in the video programming industry one of the market dynamics driving consolidation is the efficiency gains from being able to market programs across multiple media outlets firms have integrated to improve the coordination of these program marketing efforts if some comp etitors are denied access entirely or in part to the dominant media outlets which may have upwards of 80 of the audience share then they will only have access to in ferior marketing outlets when company is trying to reach and inform the spanish speaking community in the us about its product even media product if it is denied access to dominant media outlets it may be placed at significant competitiv disadvantage while univision for example has obligation to allow its competitors to piggyback off the popularity of its programming given its market do minance refusing to accept advertising may have anticompetitive consequences some parties that compete with ivision have expressed concern that univision continues to enjoy nascency waiver from the fcc rule prohibiting television station affiliates from being represented by their affiliated network in the spot market for nonne twork advertising time135 the rule is intended to address two potential areas of competitive concern 1 competition among national representation rep firms for station clients where station might choose the networks rep to improve its chances of getting or retaining network affiliation and 2 competition between networks and national spot advertising national rep firm often advises its client stations as to the appropriate level of their national spot rates without the rule network could act in the networks interest by assuring reasonably high spot rates to reduce competition with network advertising rates networkassociated rep firms also can in fluence station programming decisions in favor of the networks program rather than national spot program with the waiver univision might be able to exploit its favorable position as the dominant television network to coerce its affiliates such as the 49 affiliate television stations owned by entravision to use the univision rep rather than an independent national firm or to push its affiliates toward network advertising rather than national spot advertising these specific allegations raise the broader issue of the impact on competition localism and diversity of voices when dominant media firm seeks to vertically integrate into related media markets akin to the public policy debate that hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32116crs41 136 see for example the transcripts from the senate commerce committee hearings on radio ownership january 30 2003 and july 8 2003 137 see catherine yang test case for big media bueno malo business week may 12 2003 at p 70surrounded the vertical integra tion of clear channel radio136 if there is danger that vertically integrated firm can extend its market power in one market into upstream or downstream markets can that danger be better contained by ownership rules or by specific conduct rules what is the potential effect of consolidation in the spanish language media market on small businesses on the provision of local programming nd on diversity of voices opponents of the proposed univisionhbc merger have argued that allowing the merger to be consumma ted would result in the span ish language media industry being divided into haves associated with univision and all others that would be have nots they have argued that the integrated company would attract 80 or more of all advertising revenues flowing to spanish language media137 raise advertising rates in fashion that would harm small hispanicowned businesses drive down commission rates to harm indepe ndent hispanic advertising agencies and leave too little revenue available for the small independent stations to continue to provide local news public affairs and entertainment programming thereby reducing the diversity of spanish langua ge voices the question for policy makers is with the size of the spanish language programming pie inexorably growing with or without further consolid ation will consolidation augm ent and accelerate that rate of growth in fashion that fosters local programming and diversity of voices or will it place such large portion of spanish language media assets in one set of hands that localism and diversity of voices are harmed with or without consolidation the numbe r of minutes available for advertising on the major spanish language television cab and radio channels with the large audiences sought by national advertisers is not likely to grow as quickly as the demand for that time so advertising rates on those channels are likely to increase existing outlets can increase the minutes of advertising aired per hour but only to limited degree before viewers and listeners view the additional advertising as degrading product much of this advertising time historically has been purchased by companies that primarily serve the hispanic community and are small relative to national or multinational companies newly attracted to spanish language media but some of those traditional advertisers may be displaced by the national companies in the short run the displaced advertisers who primarily are seeking to reach spanish speaking customers and therefore have limited options are likely to turn to the smaller independent spanish language outlets those outlets reach far fewer viewers or listeners however market forces already exist and are likely to be quickly strengthened for the evolution of thos independent outlets and outlets newly converted to spanish language formats into new spanish language television and radio networks but it is not clear whether those new networks will be able to erodehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32116crs42 138 univision 10k at p 6univisions dominant audience share or even survive key issue relating to consolidation then is whether it will f acilitate the erection of new competitive barriers that would undermine efforts to develop spanish lang uage networks that could be more than fringe competitors to univision it is difficult to put together an exclus ively broadcast network today that would reach most of the spanish speaking community the scale needed to provide serious competition to univision broad reach require s cable andor sate llite coverage but as explained earlier it is increasingly difficult for new program network to gain carriage by large msos or satellite systems unless it is affiliated with existing popular programming such as the univision or galavision networ ks that provides leverage and also crossmarketing possibilities or it agrees to give the cable or satellite system an equity interest if an independent programmer identifies viable program focus for new network it still mig ht not be able to successfully find distribution before an integrated giant could kill it with copycat network it is possible as additional networks are formed and there is more demand for spanish language programming that the longterm exclusive contracts between univision and televisa nd venevision and univision s practice of effectively warehousing programming could have comp etitive implications if new programming sources do not develop there could be r eal harm to viewers if the long term exclusive contracts denied new networ ks and hence viewers access to the televisa and venevision programming that univision chooses not to air higher advertising rates for the large spanish language media outlets likely will harm those small hispanicowned businesses that have been accustomed to relatively low rates but the higher advertising revenues generated can be expected in turn to generate more and better programming for consumers as long as the large media outlets have to be concerned about the th reat of smaller firms growing or of new competitive entry if they are not responsive to consumers similarl if consolidation drives down the commissions for independent spanish language advertising agencies that need not be harmful to consumers as long as programming options remain available there is only anecdotal in formation available about the amount of local news public affairs or other programming currently offered by the various spanish language media outlets or whethe r individual outlets provide any such programming and hence diverse voice the larger spanish language television stations most of which are owned by or affiliated with ivision or telemundo appear to offer local news programming but some smaller stations do not the size of the owner may not be relevant univis ion reports that most of its stations produce local news and other pr ogramming of local importance138 it is likely that the univision stations that do not produce local news or public affairs programming are the smaller univision stations in market in which univision has more than one television station or station in small market on the other hand some independent low power sta tions despite limited reach nd limited funding resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32116crs43 139 report and order and notice of proposed rulemaking 2002 biennial regulatory review review of the co mmissions broadcast ownership rules and other rules adopted pursuant to section 202 of the telecommunications act of 1996 mb docket 02277 cross ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers mm docket 01235 rules and policies concerning multiple ownership of radio broadcast stations in local markets mm docket 01317 definition of radio markets mm docket 00244 definition of radio markets for areas not located in an arbitron survey area mb docket 03130 adopted june 2 2003 and released july 2 2003 at paragraph 399 the report and order was published in the federal register on september 5 2003 at 68 fr 46285have made special commitments to local ne ws and public affair s programming but others do little more than broadcast music videos in its discussion of radiotelevision cross ownership rules in its recent media ownership proceeding the fcc stated we do not include low power television and low power radio stations in measuring viewpoint diversity these stations are often operated with the express purpose of serving niche audiences with ethnic or political content that larger media outlets do not address139 yet many observers find that low power television has been an important source of local news and diverse voices for the spanish speaking community given the concentration of the spanish speaking population in certain neighborhoods low power television can serve that community efficiently one important public policy issue is the impact of consolidation on these independent spanish language voices on one hand they would longer provide diverse local voice in the market if th ey become the second station of large company and either discontinued local ne ws or simply rebroadcast the primary stations programming or if they remained independent but lost advertising revenues to dominant competitor and could long er afford to produce local programming on the other hand if consolidation accelerat ed the flow of mainstream advertising dollars to spanish language media with the overflow demand for limited major station advertising minutes financing additional spanis h language stations and networks then the smaller stations w ould be able to expand their local news programming and their voices there appear to be important market characteristics unique to spanish language programming from the demand perspectiv many spanish language households do not view english language programming as good alternative and therefore some advertisers do not view eng lish language programming as good alternative from the supply perspective there are important foreign sources for entertainment and non local news programming and low power broadcasting can help meet some of the niche needs of spanish speaking households the option exists to explicitly take these unique characteristics into account wh reviewing proposed license transfers involving broadcast stations that provide primarily spanish language programming as would be required by hr 3027 and s 1563 as an alternative or complement to such structural regulation it might be feasible to impleme nt rules of conduct such rules might prohibit dominant companies from using their existing market power in an anticompetitive fashion for example by prohibiting dominant media companies that exceed threshold levels of audience share for unique populations from refusing to accept competitors advertising
