maes and freddie macs portfolio to reduce the risk to the federal government and the economy in 2003 these governmentsponsored enterprises gses combined retained portfolio had risen to 16 trillion from 136 billion in 1990 one of the more controversial aspects of gse reform is this proposal to limit the size of the investment portfolios which consist of mortgages and mortgagebacked securities mbss that are subject to several types of ﬁnancial risk if these risks are not managed properly or if market movements turn dramatically against the gses the government may face two unsatisfactory alternatives either let the gse go into default and hope that the ﬁnancial repercussions can be controlled or step in and assume payments on the gse debt at signiﬁcant cost to taxpayers proponents of portfolio limits argue that shrinking portfolio size reduces the likelihood and cost if this choice will ever have to be made the gses and their supporters argue on the other hand that the proﬁts

comb ined portfolios and the amount of mbss outstanding why are the tfolios so large the gses are designed by their congressional charters to be profitmotivated enterprises their portfolios have grown as part of profit maximiz ation the gses have funding advantage that appears to be limited because of the close connection between the gses and the federal government market forces that limit the size and risk of other financial intermediaries portfolios do not pply to the gses the gses can borrow more money at lower rates these rates are sligh tly higher than the comparable treasuries but lower than companies or competitors with similar financials that lack federal government connection fede ral deposit insurance corpora tion staff has estimated that without the implicit guarantee the gses woul d have credit ratings of aa or rather than their current aaa ratings this reduced cost of borrowing can give the gses profit advantage in an activity they undertake rela tively little money is required to finance the purchase of mortgages while they are being combined into mbss when mbss are sold money borrowed can be repai d because shortterm bonds and loans have lower interest rates than longterm ones the gses use portfolio management techniques to allow them to borrow using shortterm bonds to finance longterm mortgages the key issue is whether the benefits of this portfolio growth to the companies and homeowners exceed their costs to the nation the main cost is the implied guarantee of gse debt provided by the federal govern ment without charge the mo re gse debt the greater the value of the implicit guarantee the larger th portfolios and the greater the profit there are some benefits to the nation fro m the gses portfolio section 128 of hr 1461 would require the gses to contribute 5 35 in the first year of their profits to an affordable housing fund the higher the prof its are the larger this fund will be based on recently available results crs has estima ted that this contribution will be 380 million in the first year and 540 million in later years8 the gses say that large portfolios add liqui dity to the secondary mortgage market independent analysts do not di spute that retained portfolio and active trading can help to maintain liquid market for mbss and courage investments in them the reason that the portfolios contribute to liquidity is that they allow the gses to sell and buy mbs when others are unwilling they disagree that the portfolios need to be as large as they are the exact distribution of the benefits of th gses status is subject to debate cbo has concluded that the gses retain more than 40 of the subsidy from the implicit guarantee9 the larger their portfolios the more implicitly guaranteed borrowing and the larger the gses profits in contrast the benefit to homeowners is largely independenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22307crs4 10 crs report rl32795 governmentsponsored enterprises gses regulatory reform legislation by mark

among the different classes they are customized for inve stors to match their tolerance and preference for prepayment risk versus anticipated yield 13 dwight jaffee on limiting the retained mortgage portfolios of fannie mae and freddie continuedof portfolio size and is estimated to result in mortgage rates that are lower by 7 to 40 basis points 007 to 04010 on the maximum singlefamily loan that fannie and freddie may purchase 417000 at rate around 65 rate this saves the homeowner 005 to 030 per day or 20 to 110 per year gse risks the gses share many risks with all busine ss these risks can affect the companies stockholders employees bondholders and busine ss partners the gses risks can also affect the nations financial system and the economy there are many ways to analyze these risks one useful strategy is to look at credit risk prepay ment risk interest rate risk and operational risk credit risk credit risk is the risk that the borrowers mortgagors will not repay their loan on time in other words the risk of delinquency and fault when fannie and freddie buy mortgages and combine them into mbss they add their guarantee that the loans will be repaid on time they char ge an annual fee of about 20 basis points 020 for this guarantee standard poo rs and most other ma jor observers conclude that because of the different maturity dates loantovalue ratios private mortgage insurance and geographic diversificati on credit risk is not serious problem11 prepayment risk prepayment risk is potentially more serious this is the risk to an investor that 30year mortgage will be paid before the full 30 years is concluded homeowners prepay for two major reasons moving and to obtain more favorable terms as the cost of refinancing has declined over the last 10 years the decline in interest rates necessary to justify refinanc ing with or without cash out or financing improvements to the home has been reduced in recent years the decline in mortgage rates has caused prepayment rates to increase this results in uncertainty for lenders and the holders of mbss12 when the gses create mbss and sell them to investors this is risk for the investor not the gse when gses keep the mbss this is risk to them interest rate risk interest rate risk comes from financing the mbs portfolios by borrowing money issuing bonds and is re lated to prepayment risk in 2003 fannie had 962 billion of debt outstanding freddi had 740 billion fannie and freddie use shortterm bonds and financial derivatives to finance longterm loans university of california at berkeley finance professor dwight jaffee has demonstrated how either an increase or decrease in market rates can cause the gses unhedged portfolios to lose value13 when interest rates increase they must roll over their bonds

decrease homeowners prepay their mortgages and the gses buy new ones at lower rates to minimize the losses that occur when interest rates change the gses constantly use sophis ticated portfolio ma nagement techniques including derivative securities one techni they have used involves selling callable bonds that give them the option to pay the bonds off before the stated maturity much as mortgagors prepay mortgages interest rate risk can be very serious many savings and loan associations became insolvent in the early 1980s because of it during that time fannie maes portfolio was poorly hedged according to secretary s now fannie mae became insolvent on mark tomarket basis only combination of legislative tax relief regulatory forbearance and decline in interest rates allowed fa nnie mae to grow out of its problem14 despite stateoftheart hedging today the gses portfolios have significant interest rate risk former chairman greenspan wrote moreover the success of interestraterisk management especially the exceptionally rapid timing necessitated by dynamic risk adjustments requires that th ultimate counterpar ties to the gses transactions provide sufficient liquidity to finance an interest raterisk transfer that counters the risk otherwise large and destabilizing adjustments will result in sharp changes in the interest rates required to rebalan ce and hedge portfolio15 in other words if the gses have to make large adjustments to their portfolios only very large financ ial instituti ons will be able to handle the other side of the financial transactions operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed internal procedures and systems it is addr essed by the various reforms in the house and senate bills that increase regulatory powers and in s 190 reducing the size of the gses portfolios smaller portfolio would be easier to adjust because the size of transactions would be smaller it would be possible to find more counterpar ties for these smaller transactions in addition the risk to the financial system from possible future accounting and other operational problems would be less with smaller enterprises limitations on portfolio size are consistent with ot her changes in the proposed legislation fannie maes current accounting problems and those of freddie mac in 2003 raise questions about internal controls accoun ting systems provide the basis for portfolio adjustment decisions if the accounting syst em is providing inaccurate information the resulting portfolio adjustment decisions are likely to be incorrecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22307crs6 former chairman greenspan raised the c oncern that as the gses portfolios have grown the size and number of transactions needed to rebalance their portfolios have increased as the size of the adjustments required has increased th number of financial institutions that can meaningfully participate has decreased reducing systemic risk at summary level risk has two dimensions the probability that the event will occur and the cost if it does complete pproach to reducing risk works on both aspects reducing the size of the portfo lios would reduce both dimensions the implied guarantee allows the gses to gr ow without the usual market forces that would raise their costs as their risks rose as result fannie and freddie represent significant systemic risk to the nations financial system both because they can make mistakes and because their size and concentra tion raise the likelihood of high costs for the economy when they do with smaller portfolios the gses would be able to adjust more nimbly to changing financial markets reducing the seriousness of the systemic risk requires reducing the size of the implied guarantee some have proposed comp lete privatization of the gses such as occurred for the college student loan market when sallie mae gave up its congressional charter and became entirely private this would totally eliminate the implied guarantee the gses would be subject to market forces that might drive them to reduce the size of their portfolios this option is not currently before congress closer regulation along the lines proposed in hr 1461 and s 190 woul d reduce much of the operational risk but risks coming directly from the size of the portfolios of mortgages and retained mbss would remain as long as the portfolios remain larger than necessary to provide liquid secondary mortgage market while it is true that this would distribute the risk more widely this is less of concern because the cost of bailout would be less for any one company in addition it is likely that these other companies would use simpler ways to fund their portfolios which would reduce the risk of hedging
