after its congressional sponsor and the heritage it brought into the age of an allvolunteer military servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs5 without conscription to fill the ranks of active duty armed services the inducements to potential recruits must be sufficient to attract them to enlist the montgomery gi bill provides recruits with the promise of educational assistance when they separate

readjustment counseling centers 73 home healthcare programs and almost 900 outpatient clinic s about 88 of vas 207000 employees provided medical services to an estimated 47 million veterans during fy2002 caseload expected to reach 49 million by the end of fy2003 the fy2001 caseload was about 42 million unique patients almost 2000 medical care employment slots were predicted to shift from inpatient programs to outpatient care during fy2002 outpatient visits are rapidly increasing the total number of such visits reached 438 million during fy2001 and was project ed to increase by 23 million over fy2002fy2003 from slightly less than 47 million to 492 million veterans who are provided outpatient care average around 12 visits per year according to va data accompanying the fy2003 budget the daily inpatient caseload for fy2002 was projected to be 57522 rising to 58361 patients by the end of fy2003 there is decline in all service units except for two categories acute care and nursing homes acute care patients have increased because of the larger number of total numbers of veterans who are seeking va medical services and while the total number of acute care cases has increased by 2700 over the last year the average daily census for acute care has declined by 20 patients the result of decline in the average length of stay the aging of the veteran population and the congressional commitment to increase the cap acity of va to serve this population means that the number of patients receivi ng convalescent care will increase by over 7000 during fy2003 with the average daily nursing home census rising by 1205 patients the fy2003 budget request for va medical care the administration asked congress to provide 227 billion fo r va medical care for fy2003 continuing the annual increases in funds as the prog ram continues to serve larger number of veterans each year fy2002 congressional appropriations for va medical care were 213 billion 1 billion above the 203 provi ded for fy2001 congress approved 19 billion for fy2000 pl 1087 congress provided 239 billion for va medical care for fy2003 the same amount previously approved by both the house and senate committees onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs6 appropriations 26 billion over fy 2002 and 11 billion above the amount requested in its report to accompany the draft b ill srept 107222 the senate committee states that it is deeply c oncerned about overwhelming evidence that the va medical system is failing its co re constituencyserviceconnected lower income and special needs veterans fro m numerous anecdotal examples where vas core constituency does not have acce ss to timely quality medical care because the networks that serve them are operating with long waiting lists the report cites va data claiming that 310000 veterans are on waiting lists for medical care and that many veterans are waiting as much as 6 months for an appointment to see medical staff wa iting time expected to grow if current guidelines and expectations do not change however in spite of the evidence supporting the perception of expanding wa iting lists and longer appointment times there does not appear to be evidence that va is denying care to veterans who need it and it appears that va is making decisi ons about the order of treatment given to veterans entirely on medical basis the report suggests that there are 3 reasons for the growth in demands on the va medical care system increased access to system with generous health benefits has encouraged veterans to seek care at va eligibility reform in 1996 made more veterans eligible for care veterans were eligible for out patient care before 1996 if va physician prescribed it but were widely perceived as not eligible the lack of an alternative nati onal prescription drug program has encouraged veterans an aging population with an increasing demand for drugs to seek drug benefits from va especially given that va is limited in the extent to which it pursues copayment obligations the report supports view shared by those who believe that va should primarily serve core constituency seeking care because they have been adjudicated as having serviceconnected basis for care or because they have been determined as meeting the incomeasset tests that indicate limited ability to pay for care elsewhere if that view were to become the basis for determining who does not receive care at any time then medical tria ge judgement about the priority by which limited medical resources are used to provide needed care would give way to categorical priority system that prejudges eligibility for health care independent of judgements by medical staff about the urge ncy of any particular medical service at the present time veterans presenting themselves at health care intake desk and stating medical symptom are screened and treated by medical professionals who do not evaluate administrative criteria before providing the medically indicated services there is evidence that any such applicants for immediate medical evaluation and care are being turned away and va data suggest that the medical system is improving the delivery of care by decreased waiting times for appointments and diminished times in the facility waiting rooms as va staff see more walkin patients while reducin g waiting room times it is possi ble that appointment delays will increase unless additional staff slots are provided to handle the increased loadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs7 thus the increases in appropriations to va medical care over the last few fiscal years and the growth in capacity supported by those increases have encouraged even more veterans to seek care from va the growth in the number of veterans served will likely continue to increase as veterans recognize the advantages to them of seeking care from va facilities pl 1087 gives va the authority to require va medical facilities to provide care according to statutory priorities whether such authority would result in va limiting medical services according to administrative criteria rather than medical judgements is not stated medical care cost collections in addition to the funds provided by congress va medical care is also author ized to recycle budget authority from amounts va facilities collect from various sour ces with an obligation to help defray the cost of va care for certain patients the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 105 33 gave va authority to retain net receipts of the medical care collections fund mccf allowing the funds to be spent for medical services to veterans rather than be transferred to the treasury as under prev ious law congress also created new fund for fy2002 the health services im provement f und hsif wh ich collects increases in pharmacy copayments that we nt in to effect on february 4 2002 this new fund also receives income from enhan ced use leases wh ich are arrangements for sharing va medical assets with paying customers from outside of va these leases can include the revenue from liqui dation or leasing of va capital assets as well as income from va services fo r which users have contracted the congressional budget office cbo estimated that collection receipts added 691 million in recycled spending authority in fy2002 and projected combined mccfhsif yield of 1386 billion for fy2003 medical research the va engages in research as an ancillary function of the treatment of veterans and conducts independent re search projects intended to advance medical science almost oneh alf of vas research funding comes from conventional medical research funding sources the bulk of which is provided through grants from the national institutes of health nih the remaining funds supporting va research are split almost evenly between appropriations from congress specifically for such research and salaries and expenses from the va medical care budget for the va medical st aff who are producin g the studies that exhibit vas research findings about tw othirds of the research projects are initiated by the medical staff reporting their findings these projects are giving greater attention to the dis eases associated with an aging population especially in conjunction with the manageme nt of those chronic conditi ons that are growing part of the outpatient workload pl 1087

response to hepatitis c virus hcv the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimates that over 4 million americans are infected with hepatitis c and some data exist that the disease is even more prevalent among veterans compared to the general popul ation va study in 1999 found that the veterans it surveyed had prevalence ra of 66 compared to an estimated 18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs8 in the general population upon release of the study leading veterans groups and some health care professiona ls advocated an aggressive response by va to combat the contagious threat however va analysts have been concer ned that comprehensive system was in place to collect information about actual workloads and costs for the hepatitis c program because th projections for them w ere based on formulas that relied on untested assumptions and actua l performance particularly for fy2000 did not bear out projections while hepatitis c continues to be serious health issue in need of dedicated attention to its causes prevalence diagnosis treatment management and possible cure it does not appear that th dire predictions about its effect on the veteran population have b een borne out however the costs of diagnosis and treatment have risen considerably from their fy1999 levels actual costs for hcv related medi cal services during fy2001 are estimated to have been 98 million and for fy2002 were projected to reach 105 million with 111 million expected to support diagnosis and treatment during fy2003 housing benefits the va program to guarantee home loans for veterans has made significant contribution to th national goal of increasing the number of families who own their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the gu arantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans were obligations of the federal government that constituted mandatory spending administrative expenses are discretionary appropriations tran sferred from the home loan programs

new planning approach calle d capital asset realignment for enhanced services cares is the departments reaction to th criticism it has received from areas of the country in which hospital re sources have been cut back in order to redirect those resources to outpatient care usually in ot her geographical areas while va has been successful in expanding th number of patients it serves conflict continues between advocates of more efficient use of resources who advocate reducing hospital space and closing or lling superfluous inpatie nt facilities and veterans groups who see any reduction in i npatient care as threat to the medical care needs of the veteran population the cares effort is an attempt to make the planning process by which the capital assets are developed used modifie d or relinquished open to veterans groups often the fears about reductions in health care to veterans are based on an inadequate understanding of the improvements in care fo r more veterans that such realignment of resources makes possible and th cares approach may lessen those misunderstandings some veterans have expressed the belief that over time moving resources from an inpatient facility in one area to outpatient access in nother yields an unacceptable rate of deterioration in the former facility as the commitment to maintain the building is diminished as the department moves toward its

for fy2003 at 3135 billion which largely serves households with incomes below 25000 is substantially less in real terms than was spent two decades ago2 the shortage of affordable rental housing is complex matter with many dimensions including the often overlooked but important role that local governments play too often some say as part of the problem there are many statistics available for advocates who argue that more federa l assistance is needed data from huds 1999 american housing survey show 49 million worst case households those with incomes below 50 of the local area median verylow incomes who pay more than 50 of their income for housin g or live in substandard housing but who receive assistance3 these same data showed 44 of extremely lowincome renters those with incomes below 30 of the local area median about 375 million households in the worst case category to put these median incomes into more meaningful perspective on national basi s those with verylow incomes would be households with recent incomes below about 21000 those with extremely low incomes had incomes below 13000 those who support more federal efforts to help lowincome households with their housing costs generally want either more funds for housing vouchers or more funds to encourage the construction of affordable rental housing or both hud secretary martinez says he favors h ousing vouchers over subsidized housing production to address the affordability i ssue and does not support another rental housing production program he points out that there are already government programs that are being used to produce affordable rental housing the low income housing tax credit taxexempt bonds the home and hope vi programs and other smaller efforts yet the agency does not have longt erm goal of helping more worstcase families with their high housing cost burdens in fact some critics of hud programs say that because there is generally shortage of rental units available in most communities the affordability issue is not housing issue at all but an income issue however others say that regulations nd barriers prevent the private market from increasing the supply of less expensive apar tments they argue that better way to respond to worsecase renters is through government efforts to help lowincome households become more productive maki ng it possible for them to earn higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs16 4 us department of housin g and urban development housing in the seventies report of the national housing policy review 1974incomes presumably this would mean th ey would not need federal rental housing assistance or not as much of it the administration seems to favor th is approach the fy2003 budget says hud would fail in its missi on if families were not moving towards eventual self sufficiency an important measure of huds success s hould be the number of families that longer need to reside in assisted housing because they have moved to safe decent and affordable private housing however this raises serious contradictions in federa l housing policy since over 32 million homeowners including 11 million with incomes bove 100000 receive large amounts of housing assistance many of these households longer need housing assistance brief history of federal housing assistance in the housing act of 1949 congress established national goal of providing decent home and suitable living environment for every american family much progress was made in the next two decades in eliminating substandard housing as many of the nations worst slums were torn down but against the b ackdrop of the inner city riots of the 1960s and the recommendations of the 1967 douglas commission the 1968 kaiser committee and the 1968 kerner commission on civil disorders congress adopted the housing act of 1968 which set speci fic 10year goal of building 6 million housing units for low nd moderateincome families federallysubsidized housing production increased from 91000 in 1967 to 166000 in 1968 200000 in 1969 430000 in each of 1970 and 1971 and 339000 in 1972 during the 4 years from 19681972 there was also total of about 200000 units rehabilitated with fe deral subsidies and 2200000 mob ile homes built the latter considered an important source of affo rdable housing for lowerincome households4 during the 1970s attention on housing issues changed from its previous focus on the problem of too many substandard housing units to the problem of housing being too expensive for lowerincome families to afford in effect the 1949 housing act paved the way for the more elusive goal of making it possible for all families to have decent and affordable home and suitable living environment the problem of substandard housing s not been entirely eliminated data from huds just released american h ousing survey for 2001 shows that 706000 occupied rental units lack some or ll plumbing facilities 157000 have hot piped water 171000 are without flush toilet 235000 have exposed ectrical wiring 2 million have broken windows and 598000 have holes in the floor there are similar numbers for homeowners yet the quality of the housing built in the past 25 years and the level of amenities provided or required such as ffstreet parking wide sidewalks and roads air conditioning ndscaping health and safety standards requirements for the handica pped and environmental prot ections have so upgraded housing and neighborhoods that many lower in come families can not afford it the policy objective of improving the minimum standard for

sharing singlefamily home or apartment sometimes tw or three households in unit meant for one during the latter half of the 1970s hud began phasing out its involvement in subsidizing new housing construction by the early 1980s this withdrawal was nearly complete and the shift towards subsidizing existing units with housing vouchers was well underway since the 1980s there has been obvious consensus as to what should be done to improve housing opportunities for thos with difficulties finding affordable housing beginning in 1982 the number of additional rental units receiving assistance under hud dropped sharply in 1986 congress replaced number of existing rental housing tax provisions that were thought to be poorly targeted with the low income housing tax credit program tax

rehabilitated aver aged about 50000 to 60000 year during most of the 1990s according to some estimates ther are now as many as one million rental units that have been subsidized under this program while this program can help lowincome households it cannot help th poorest of the poor without additional subsidies such as section 8 vouchers for the tenants during the 1990s and continuing there was also small number of apartments built or rehabilitated under hud s section 202 program for the elderly and under the home and community development bloc k grant programs but it is also important to remember that during each of the last three decades hundreds of thousands of older or obsol ete rentals many shabby but affordable including trailer parks in urban ar eas and most of the remaining innercity singleroom occupancy hotel units including many ymcaywca facilities that provided shelter to the nearhom eless were torn down after number of years in which new housing vouchers were added

increased appropriations for the home program the national low income housing coalitions research shows that in most majo r cities and counties it is highly unlikely that households earning near the minimum wage of 515 an hour or even 6 8 or 10 an hour can find an affordable apartment waiting lists for rental assistance in most major cities are so long that others are allowed to be added the national housing conference nhc examined recent american housing survey data and concluded that afford able housing problems had moved up the income ladder police teachers fire fi ghters and other public municipal employees have been increasingly cited in the dia as having problems affording housing although twoearner families for example police officer and teacher can often reach securely into

using housing vouchers or subsidizing the construction or reha bilitation of rental buildings knowing when each type of assistance is most appr opriate requires knowledg of local housing market conditions the discussion that follo ws reviews this ongoing debate voucher utilization rates in the past few years there has been growing concern that not all of the housing vouc hers awarded to local public housing authorities have been put to use so households with vouchers have found it difficult or impossible to find an apartment within the time limits allowed an increasing number of vouchers have been returned unused although these vouchers are sometimes given to so meone else who does succeed in finding appropriate housing in recent years arguments have surfaced in congress that because not all vouchers are used there is less reason to appropriate funds fo r more vouchers as discussed earlier there has been frustration in the vahud appropriation committees over the amounts of unspent section 8 voucher funds that have accumulated in reserve accounts both hud and the appropriation committees are now trying to address the matter of unspent funds by directing new money for vouc hers only to public housing authorities with voucher utiliz ation rate of 97 or great er some phas who have tried to increase their voucher utilization ve had noted success by better informing landlords about the voucher program and couraging more to participate in it by offering various incentives6 some voucher holders have been provided transportation to assist them with their search and help with security deposits nevertheless where vacancy rates are very low or rent levels very high it may have become prohibitively expensive on perunit basis for phas to try to locate additional units for voucher holders some landlords are unwilling to accept vouche rs because they want to avoid the bureaucratic red tape of the program or because they believe rightly or not that lowincome families will cause problems few local governments have recently adopted laws requiring landlords to accep t renters with vouche rs although landlords may be able to reject voucher holder because of bad credit lack of references and for other reasons reports also continue to show that discrimination in rental housing on the basis of race and against househol ds with children is still common which makes the use of vouchers more difficult increasing the number receiving assistance by adding vouchers the hud secretary is on record as not bein g in support of current bills that wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs20 create new national affordable housing tr ust fund to subsidize the construction of affordable rental housing he says he instead favors housing vouchers because of the freedom of mobility they offer to lowincome renters in theory at least family with voucher can m ove out of poorly maintained building or dangerous neighborhood and go to safer one with better schools and mo re job opportunities however the hud secretary has not proposed any significant increase in the number of vouchers and as th above discussion has indicated his stated goal is to reduce the number of those households needing or r eceiving rental assistan ce it is not clear how this would be accomplished he supports helping more lowerincome households become homeowners but some housing analysts doubt the financial ability of households with incomes below certain realistic leve l to maintain and benefit from homeownership it is unclear what the hud goals are for many of the worst case renters who are unrealistic ca ndidates for homeownership at recent congre ssional hearing on the fy2003 budget concern was expressed at the increasing cost of the section 8 pr ogram as the cost of housing lowincome families in section 8 units increases either fewer households can be assisted with level budget or larger budget is needed ju st to maintain the sa number of assisted units the proposed 175 billion for the sec tion 8 will account for over half of the total hud budget the main reason why secti on 8 costs continue to increase rapidly is that market rents have increased signif icantly the cost of an average voucher the governments share of the rent is now about 500 month or 6000 per year one million additional vouchers would cost 6 billion year increasing rental housing production the difficulty of using vouchers in some areas has led to legislative proposals for new hud program devoted largely to the development of rental hous ing for extremely lowincome households referring to the limited value of vouchers in many tight rental markets the senate appropriations committee expressed its concerns in 2001 that families with vouchers often have little

subject to appropria tions details on these legi slative proposals can be found in crs report rl30916 housing issues in the 107th congress are there other options for funding more affordable rental housing some point to the congressional budget office report of february 2001 budget options restrict itemized deductions credits and exclusions under the income tax one of the options identified by cbo to increase federal revenues is limit the mortgage principal on which interest can be ducted to 300000 taxpay ers may now deduct interest on up to 1 million of mortgage debt used to buy and improve first and second home cbo says that reducing the eligible amount of debt for the mortgage interest deduction from 1 million to 300000 would trim deductions for 12 million taxpayers with large mortgages and in crease revenues by 558 billion over the 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs21 2011 period some argue that this would be less regressive option the cost would be born by higherincome taxpayers to fund rental housing production program for extremely lowincome families limiting deductions to the interest on not more than 300000 of mortgage debt would affect high cost areas such as san francisco angeles new york and boston however it is probably coincidence that these are the areas that have some of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country and the most severe shortages of affordable rental housing another option for addressing the shorta ge of affordable rental housing is to encourage more local governments to us inclusionary zoning which requires home builders to construct and setaside minimum percentage of new units in specific residential developm ent that are affordable to lowerincome households see inclusionary zoning viable solution to the affordable housing crisis the center for housing policy october 2000 for the pros and cons of this approach and how it has worked in montgomery county maryland with the increasing recognition of the impact of restrictions and barriers inadvertent and deliberate to increasing th supply of affordable housing at the local level of government has co the view that unless or until local governments accept more responsibility for the problem little pr ogress will be made some analysts believe that metr opolitan wide regional housing au thorities similar to existing regional transportation author ities are needed both because some local jurisdictions are less financially able to address the issue than others and to assure that all jurisdictions accept fair share of afford able housing to avoid

mechanism through wh ich hud provides funding to local entities responsible for administering projectbased and tenantbased vouchers lowincome rental housing subsidies each year the hcf total budget is comprised of direct appropriation from congress as well as an recaptured funds from previous years the administration requested 175 billion in direct appropriation for the housing certificate fund in fy2003 an almost 2 billion increase over the fy2002 direct appropriation of 156 billion in addition the hud fy2003 budget justification estimated an available carryover balan ce of 640 million in section 8 reserve funds from previous years which would bring the hcf budget total including the hud estimate of carryover f unds and the direct appropriation to 181 billion hr 5605 the committeepassed vers ion of the fy2003 hud appropriations bill from the 107th congress recommended direct appropriation of 166 billion for the hcf for fy2003 900 million less than the administrations request the committee estimated huds carry over balances at 18 billion almost 12 billion higher than huds estimate the reduced direct appropria tion added to the increased estimate in carryover balances would have brought the total hcf budget level to 184 billion in fy2003 200 million higher than the hud estimate the senatepassed version of hjre s 2 the fy2003 consolidated omnibus appropriations legisl ation recommended direct ppropriation of 169 billion for the housing certificate fund in fy2003 approximately 600 milli on less than the administrations request the bill did not specify an amount of carryover balances available to hud for the hcf however the fy 2004 hud budget appendix indicates that hud has approximately 1738 billion available in carryover funds from previous years in addition to the 11 billion hud estimated that it had available for rescission in fy2003 in addition to the provision of direct appropriation the senate passed version of hjres 2 included language specifying that the secretary of hud would have the authority to draw down such sums as necessary from the treasury to fully renew all authorized vouchers if reserved and recaptured funds have been exhausted cb scored this provision as having cost because given the direct appropriation as well as the higherthanexpected amount in carryover balances unde r the senatepassed versi on of hjres 2 hud would have more than sufficient funds to meet its obligations the final version of hjres 2 the c onsolidated appropriations resolution of 2003 pl 1087 provided hud with 172 billi on in direct appropriations for the hcf this amount is over 300 llion less than the administration requested for the hcf in fy2003 again in addition to this amount hud has access to carryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs24 over balances available from previous years now estimated at 1738 billion pl 1087 did not provide the secretary with th authority to draw down additional funds from the treasury note about advance appropriations for the past several years the hcf appropriation has consiste d of two parts an appr opriation available in the named fiscal year and an advance appropr iation of 42 billion which is not available until the next fiscal year for example in fy2003 pl 1087 provides 172 billion for the hcf of that amount 13 billion is available in fy2003 and 42 billion does not become available until fy 2004 however the total for the hcf in fy2003 includes 42 billion in advance appropr iation that was provided in the fy2002 appropriation but did not become availa ble until the beginning of fy2003 thus the total hcf budget not including recaptu red funds is comprised of the 13 billion in appropriations for fy2003 that is av ailable in fy2003 added to the 42 billion from fy2002 that was not available until fy2003 totaling 172 billion but does not include the 42 billion that was ppropriated in fy2003 but will not become available until fy2004 section 8 expiring contract renewals the hcf finances provisions of section 8 of the housing act of 1937 as am ended broadly refe rred to as section 8 programs these hud programs subsidiz rental housing for lowincome families using several avenues for administering such assistance the two main forms of section 8 assistance are nantbased rental assistan ce or vouchers which are portable subsidies that are tied to families and projectbased rental assistance which is form of rental subsidies tied to specific housing units approximately 3 million families will be assisted under section 8 in fy2003 the largest portion of the administr ations request for the hcf was 169 billion in new budget authority for funds to renew expiring secti on 8 rental contracts in fy2003 this amount would be used for the renewal of approximately 817000 existing projectbased units and the renewal and associated administrative costs of 21 million existing tenantbased units in fy2003 total of almost 3 million vouchers that have been authorized over the years in addition to these contract renewals 52 million of the 169 billion appropriated under this heading would be used to fund family selfsufficiency coordinators for renewal term of 1 year the house bill from the 107th recommended 14615 billion for section 8 contract renewals in fy2003 of this amount 10278 billion was to be used for the renewal of section 8 tena ntbased vouchers and mode rate rehabilita tion renewals including movingtowork vouchers and the remaining 4337 billion was to be used for the renewals of projectbased units this estimate was based on the cost of fully funding all authorized projectbased units but only funding the percentage of authorized tenantbased vouchers that were under lease as of local public housing authorities pha last financial statem ent this amount does not include the administrative costs of the tenantbased rental assistance program since phas budget for renewal cost s under the house proposal would have been based on the number of units the pha was leasing as of its last year end financial statement which can be 115 year s old it is possible that if the phashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs25 leasing rate had improved since that statement the funds provided would be insufficient to meet actual renewal costs in such case the house proposal assumed that phas could use section 8 program reserves which the committee estimated at 938 million to cover the rene wal costs of any additiona l vouchers not reflected on their most recent financial statements s hould phas reserve be inadequate to cover these additional vouche r renewals new central reserve fund was authorized in the bill which could have provided funding to phas at the discretion of the secretary of hud the bill would have provided 280 million for the central reserve fund in addition the house bill hr 5605 would have provided 46 million for family selfsufficiency coordinators this is separate funding and is not part of funding under c ontract renewals the senatepassed version of hjres 2 proposed to fully fund the renewal of all reserved vouchers both projectbased and tenantbased the bill specified 11676 billion for the renewal and associated administrative costs of tenantbased vouchers and authorized central fund of 400 million similar to the central fund proposed by the house to be used by the secretary for voucher c ontract renewals and changes the senate bill also provided the secretary with the authority to draw down such sums as necessary from the treasury to renew all expiring voucher contracts the senate proposal directed hud to fu lly fund all vouchers pha is authorized to lease but to contract with phas onl for the amount of vouchers that they can reasonably be expected to use in the next year based on current utilization and administrative practices rather than on prior years utilization as in the house bill in order to prevent building up into unob ligated balances of the difference between the amount needed to fully fund all vouc hers pha is authorized to lease and the amount the pha is actually using the sena bill included lang uage directing the secretary to fully implement an existin g process for recapturing unused vouchers from phas with low utilization rates and reallocating those vouchers to phas with high utilization rates the bill sets out statutory guidance for doing so the senatepassed version of hjres 2 did not provi separate funding for family selfsufficiency coordinators f unding for fss coordi nators under this b ill is considered part of f unding under contract renewals the final version of hjres 2 p l 1087 provided 153 billion in direct appropriations for the hcf of this amount 109 billion is to be used for the renewal costs but not administrative co sts which are provi ded separately of expiring tenantbased vouchers and the re mainder is to be used for projectbased vouchers in addition the law provide s 392 million central reserve this combined amount is sufficient according to the conference report to fund all authorized vouchers as in the house b ill pha budgets will be determined based on their last financial statement however in this proposal that number is to be adjusted to reflect any pertinent information that would indicate an increase in utilization in addition phas will still ve the authority to lease up to their authorized number of vouchers under pl 1087 funding for family self sufficiency coordinators is set at 48 million and is provided separately from contract renewalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs26 section 8 incremental vouchers the term incremental is used to describe new vouchers the presiden ts budget request included 204 million to fund approximately 34000 incr emental vouchers in fy2003 these vouchers were to be provided to phas that have demonstrated their ability to use their existing vouchers having utilization rate of at least 97 of the requested amount for incremental vouchers 164 million was target ed for specific us vouchers such as assistance for homeless veterans assistance for families on the road to self sufficiency and as down payment assistance for homeownership the bush administration strongly supports the use of section 8 vouchers as down payment assistance for homeownership by lowincome families and encourages phas to strengthen their ability to assist such families in becoming homeowners the presidents budget request earmarked 6 million of the 164 million for incremental vouchers to f und 1000 vouchers to be used for persons with mental disabilities to assist states in meeting federal court requirement that mentally disabled individuals be housed in comm unity settings with services whenever possible the remaining 40 million was to be used to provide rental vouchers for non elderly disabled individuals who are now residing in public housing projects that have been designated for occupancy by the elderly the am ount was expected to fund approximately 6000 vouchers which would help in tegrate nonelderly disabled individuals into mainstream privatelyowned housing the house bill hr 5605 provided 36 million for incremen tal rental vouchers to be used for nonelderly disabled i ndividuals who are now residing in public housing projects that are being designated as elderly only developments the house committee believes that the section 8 vouchers are necessary to integrate disabled individuals into the community in addition to the 36 million provided under hr 5605 the secretary could also use funds from the central reserve account to provide phas who have 97 utilization rate or above with dditional assistance for section 8 vouchers if the pha can demonstrate that the funds could be used for an assistance payment contract within 90 da ys of their being received if additional funds were given to pha and additiona l vouchers were not put under lease within 180 days the secretary would recapture the unused vouchers for reallocation to other eligible phas language in the bill would have limited the additional voucher assistance provided to an individual pha to not more than 10 of the total funds available neither the senatepassed ve rsion of hjres 2 or the final version pl 1087 provided any new incremental vouchers tenant protection vouchers the presidents budget requested 260 million for tenant protection vouchers and their associated administrative costs in fy2003 hud estimated that this amount would finance approximately 43000 vouchers for individuals who are currently receiving rental assi stance but who are in danger of losing the subsidy because their units are being demolished the owner of their development is opting out of the program or for some other reason the house bill hr 5605 provided 234 million for tenant protection vouchers funds provided under this account were only to be used for rental subsidieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs27 and not for administrative expenses asso ciated with the vouchers these vouchers were designated to be used to replace projectbased assistance with tenantbased assistance for the conversi on of section 202 and section 23 projects to section 8 assistance and for the family unification and witness protection program the tenant protection vouchers were not to be used to provide vouchers under the hope vi program as funds for this purpose ar provided within the hope vi account the senatepassed version of hjres 2 did not pr ovide specific amount for tenant protection vouchers the final version of hjres 2 pl 1087 pr ovides 234 million for the relocation and replacement of housing units that have been demolished or disposed of the conversion of section 23 project s the family unification program the relocation of witnesses in the witness pr otection program enhanced vouchers and tenant protection assistance including re placement and relocation assistance this amount does not include associated adminis trative costs which are provided for elsewhere in the bill section 8 administrative costs the administrations budget request provided 196 million for section 8 contr act administration these contract administration funds would be provided to the many stat and local housing agencies that act as huds agent in administering th section 8 projectbased program these agencies are responsible for the oversight of the physical and financial condition of projects funded under nearly 20000 contr acts between hud and individual project owners funding to cover administrative costs for tenantbased rental assistance incremental vouchers and nant protection vouchers wa s included in the funding requests for those programs the house bill hr 5605 provided 196 million for administrative costs associated with the section 8 proj ectbased program and 1177 billion for administrative costs associated with the s ection 8 tenantbased voucher program of that 1177 billion the bill states that 50 million is for the administrative costs of incremental vouchers for the disabled ne w tenant protection vouchers and vouchers funded from the newlyestablis hed central reserve fund for the last several years the house appropriations committee has attempted to limit the increase in administrative costs and other expenses of the section 8 tenantbased voucher program it has b een estimated that administrative costs now account for almost 10 of the cost of voucher furthermore concern has been raised over the amount of unspent administr ative fees that phas have accumulated in reserves in order to curb rising administrative costs as well as prevent the build up of unspent administrative fee reserves by phas the committee included language in the bill which would have limited administrative fees and other expenses associated with the section 8 voucher program to more than 10 of the rental subsidy paid and also restricted the use of funds in the reserv to activities related to the provision of rental assistance unde r the section 8 program the committee also included language in the bill requiring hud to provide report to the house appropriations committee later than ma

regarding fee reserves if as of january 31 2003 cal public housing authority has more than 105 of the amount it earned in administrativ fees for 2002 in its administrative fee reserves it will have to appl that excess to pay for its 2003 administrative fee thus reducing the amount it receives from hud fu rthermore the bill states that from fy2003 on the secretary must recapture any administrative fees which are in excess of the amount spent by the agency on secti on 8 tenantbased rental assistance and not needed to maintain an administrative fee reserve account balance of up to 5 agencies with less than 100000 in earned administrative fees for 2003 were exempted from these provisions rescissions the administrations request assumed rescission of 11 billion from the section 8 fund in fy2003

crimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs30 rates and drug use this perception of public housing has been accurate for small number of the largest inner city proj ects where the worst problems have been concentrated however many projects are well run and in rela tively good condition legislation passed during the past half dozen years has begun to target problems in the worst public housing sites the hope vi program has been somewhat successful in achieving its goal of tear ing down the worst 100000 units largely high rise complexes in inner city areas and replacing them with lower density garden

maintenance utilities and tenant and protective services supplement the rent collected by phas and enable them to maintain the property while keeping rents affordable for lowincome families in 12

shortfall from fy2002 in fy2002 hud did not have sufficient operating funds to provide full subsidies to all public housing authorities this shortfall of 250 million resulted from an ongoinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs31 miscalculation on huds part of the oper ating fund needs huds practice for dealing with these miscalculations had been to automatically dip into future years appropriations to compensate for any shor tfalls this year hud was unable to dip into its fy2003 appropriation to cover its fy2002 shortfa ll because of continuing resolution in order to cover the shortf all hud asked permi ssion and was granted that permission to use 250 million from the fy2003 operating fund appropriation to fully fund all phas for fy2002 in order to deal with the reduced

grants to phas for capital and management activities includi ng modernization and deve lopment of public housing hud estimates that capital needs accrue at 22 billion annually additionally there is an estimated 20 billion backlog of re habilitation and modernization needs faced by phas the rehabilitation of this housing is important to help ensure that these developments are not unsafe for residents and do not beco so obsolete that they must be demolished the justification for this cut in the f ace of large backlog is the introduction of what the administration terms the public housing investment and financial reform initiative this proposal would have allowed up to 120 million of public housing capital funds and 130 million of operating funds to be used to convert some public housing units to section 8 projectbased assi stance on propertybyproperty basis hud would consider requests from public h ousing authorities to participate in this initiative hud proposes that this change would allow phas to secure private financing to rehab ilitate or replace aging propertie s by pledging projectbased revenue section 8 rents are of ten higher than public housin g rents as collateral for private loans for capital improvements the agency believes that lenders will view the stream of section 8 renewals as more predictable than capital fund appropriations therefore making p has seem more creditworthy the administration hoped that at least some of the proposed cut of 417 million in capital funding could be replaced by private sector loans some housing organizations expressed c oncern about this proposed experiment asking that hud wait for evidence on how well this new idea might work before cutting capital funds in response to this concern hud secretary martinez told thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs32 senate banking committee on february 1 3 2002 that if this program did not generate at least 400 million worth of cap ital improvements hud would seek to restore the reduction of capital funds to the previous years level in fy2004 the house appropriations committee bill pr oposed to fund the public housing capital fund at the fy2002 appropriati on level 2843 billion over 400 million above the administrations request th committee chose not to authorize the administrations public housing reinvestment initiative instead they directed the department to submit report to th committee by march 1 2003 on those phas that have entered into private financing partnerships for capital modernization and the results of those partnerships further the house appropriation committees bill included language requiring the secretary to issue regulations re quired under the quality housing and work reconciliation act of 1998 by may 1 2003 these regulations would provide procedures for recapturing funds from phas who have been unable to obligate their funds within 24 months or spend them w ithin 48 months and would reallocate them to phas who have demonstrated an ab ility to spend funds in timely manner the senatepassed version of hjres 2 proposed to fund the public housing capital fund at 2683 billion which is more than 257 million above the administrations request the bill also directed hud to implement the quality housing and work reconcilia tion act of 1998 regulations the senate bill did not adopt the administrations public h ousing reinvestment initiative proposal although it did include an administr ative provision to allow public housing authorities the flexibility to use public hous ing funds to leverage private capital to rehabilitate distresse d units and develop public hous ing units in mixedincome housing developments the final version of hjres 2 pl 1087 appr opriated 273 billion for the public housing capital fund over 300 million more than the administrations proposal the bill in cludes language requiring the secretary to issue regulations required under the quality housing and wo rk

above hud is transforming public housing through the use of hope vi grants by rehabilitating or demolishing severely distressed public housing units and replacing them with lowdensity gardenstyle apar

usually been the case with public housing the new housing has more mixedincome tenancy the poor the not quite so poor and some moderatei ncome households in an effort to change the culture and

reducing mortgage delinquencies 2 the demand for housing counseling services exceeds the funding availability 3 it would complement the administrations homeownership initiative 4 the availability of counseling is central to meeting the goal of increasing minority homeownership rates 5 counseling is an element of communitybased efforts to combat predat ory lending 6 it would further the goal of

concentrate on the number of homeless persons who have attained permanent housing one of huds stra tegic objectives is to end chronic homelessness 20 of the homeless in 10 ears one of the indicators of progress to this goal is that at least 25000 formerly homeless persons move into hud mckinneyvento funded perm anent housing through fy2003 another strategic objective is to help homeless individuals and families move to permanent housing some of the indi cators of successfully moving toward that goal is that through fy2003 at least 29000 homeless persons move from hud transitional housing to permanent housing that at least 115000 homeless people move into hudfunded transitional hous ing and that at least 19000 homeless persons become employed while in huds homeless assistance project another indicator of moving toward that goal is that the number of communities with homeless management info rmation systems increase from 12 in fy2001 to 25 in fy2002 to 75 in fy2003 hud has

these programs referred to as the section 202 program for the elderly and th section 811 program for the disabled provide capital grants for the development of additional new subsidized housing for these populations the president proposed new funding of 774 million for total of 783 million including the reprogramming of 97 million in unobligated funds from previous years for housing assist ance for the elderly in fy2003 the same amount as provided in the previous year hud points out that an increasing number of the elderly living in section 202 apartment s have become frail nd less able to live in rental facilities without so additional services th erefore the administration proposed that 30 million of the appropria ted amount be made available for construction grants to convert existing s ection 202 units to assisted living facilities this would allow individual elderly residents to remain in their units and maintain their independence as they age the president proposed that another 53 million ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs44 the appropriation be used to fund service coordinators who help elderly residents obtain needed supportive services from the community the house appropriations committee r ecommended direct appropriation of 841 million for the section 202 program i n addition to the assumed 97 million in recaptured funds for fy2003 this figure was 67 million above the administrations request nd included 50 million for service coordinators and 30 million for the conversion of section 202 housin g to assisted living the house also proposed to make 50 million of the requested amount available for demonstration grant program to facilitate planning design and development activities for section 202 projects in the hope of finding ways to shorten the time between the award of grants to communities and the completion of projects the senatepassed version of hjre s 2 recommended 783 million for section 202 in addition to recaptured funds 53 milli on of which was to be set aside for service coordinators and 50 million of which was to be t aside for the conversion of units to assisted living the final version of hjres 2 p l 1087 approved 783 million for section 202 in addition to recaptured funds 50 milli on of which was set aside for service coordinators and 25 million of which was set aside for the conversion of units to assisted living the final bill like the h ouse bill set aside funds for demonstration grant program to facilitate planning design and development activities for section 202 projects the final bill set aside 25 million for this activity rather than 50 million as proposed by the house the administration also requested 251 million for housing for the disabled section 811 10 million increase over the 241 million provided in fy2002 like last year up to 25 of the funds for the disabled could be used for vouchers to give disabled individuals more flexibility and choice so they could live in mainstream rental housing howe ver these vouchers must then be renewed each year and in fy2003 32 million of the 251 million secti on 811 budget would be required to renew vouchers in addition 40 million fro m the housing certificate fund would be allocated under the administration s proposal for appr oximately 6000 vouchers for nonelderly disabled individuals who are currently living in public housing units that are now being converted to elderly only projects the house appropriations committee approved 259 million for the section 811 program for fy 2003 over 8 million more than the administrations request including an allowance for up to 25 to be spent on tenantbased rental assistance for the disabled in addition hr 5605 provided 36 million for incremental rental vouchers to be used for nonelderly disabl ed individuals who are now residing in public housing projects that are being desi gnated as elderly only developments the senatepassed version of hjres 2 recommended 251 million for the section 811 program in fy2003 of this am ount 25 would be available for tenant based rental assistance for the nonel derly disabled under this proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs45 the final

law federal housing ad ministration fha for fy2003 the administration requested and the senatepa ssed version of hjres 2 recommended an insurance commitment limitation of 160 billion for the fha mutual mortgage insurance and cooperative housing mortgage insuran ce mmichmi fund the same level as appropriated for fy2002 hr 5605 r ecommended commitment level of 165 billion the conference agreement au thorized commitment limitation of 165 billion both the administration and the senate bill requested 21 billion insurance commitment limitation for the general insurance and special risk insurance gisri fund the same level as pproved for fy2002 hr 5605 recommended commitment limitation of 23 billion the c onference agreement authorized commitment limitation of 23 billion since fy2002 the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget office cbo have determined that fha receipts under the mmi account should be classified within th discretionary rather than the mandatory part of huds budget according to cbo the reclassification has effect on the amount of budgetary resources availabl to hud and the mmi program will continue operating as it did prior to the reclassification mandatory spending must comply with the payasyougo rules of the budget enforcement act bea while discretionary spending must comply with the beas discretionary spending caps spending for the mmi program is dete rmined by annual appropriations acts the budget and hr 5605 requested loan limitation of 50 million for direct loans under the mmichhi fund 200 million reduction from the fy2002 level the budget states that the 250 million limitation in fy2002 was in anticipation of increased demand for disposition of single family properties and the demand did not materialize because of the av ailability of alternative fi nancing the senate bill recommended direct loan limitation of 250 million the same as enacted in fy2002 the conference agreement aut horized loan limitation of 100 million the administration hr 5605 and the senatepassed om nibus bill proposed direct loan limitation of 50 million fo r the gisri fund the same limit as in fy2002 the conference agreement author ized 50 million for the program the direct loans are used to facilitate the sa to municipalities nd nonprofit corporations of single family and multifamily properties that have been acquired by the fha insurance funds through defaults and foreclosures by borrowers the budget and the senate bill reque sted administration expenses of 3367 million for the mmichmi accounts the sena would have provided that to the extent guaranteed loan commitments ex ceed 655 billion on or before april 1 2003 an additional 1400 in administrative contr act expenses would be available for each additional 1 million in loan commitments but the additional funds could total more than 16 million hr 5605 requested 3478 million for administrative expenses the conference agreement authorized 3478 million for administrativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs46 expenses and adopted the senate language regardin g loan commitments exceeding 655 billion on or before april 1 2003 as in fy2002 the fy2003 budget hr 5605 and the senate omnibus bill requested an appropriation of 15 million for credit subsidies to support loan guarantees under the gisri programs the conference agreement appropriated 15 million as requested the credit subsidy is based on the net cost to the government exclusive of administrative expenses of di rect loan or loan guarantee over its full term discounted to the present value at the treasurys borrowing cost fha proposed to reduce the annual mortgage insurance premium from 80 basis points to 57 basis points on new construction loan s insured under the section 221d4 program that program is the largest multifamily insurance program in the gisri fund interestingly the insurance premiu ms were raised from 50 to 80 basis points in fy2002 and that was used as partial ju stification for the need of only 15 million in credit subsidies instead of 101 million th at had been appropriated in the prior year the proposed fy2003 budget noted however that prior estima tes were based on historic performance over the past 40 ears including tax law changes in the 1980s that adversely affected the performan ce of loans in the portfolio at the time the budget argued that the new credit subsidy estimates are based on econometric models that incorporate the improvements in recent years in underwriting program monitoring and sset management the senate committee noted that it rema ins concerned that hud has failed to calculate adequately the amount of cred it subsidy needed to support its multifamily mortgage insurance programs the committee said that it expects hud to institute computer program that accurately identifies the risk of default and financial risk to the insurance fund the co mmittee also directed hud to issue any changes in insurance premiums through notice and co mment rule making as required by law section 601 of pl 105276 the fy1999 hud appropriations act amended section 204 of the national housing act to give hud more flexibility in choosing the most costeffective way of paying in surance claims and disposing of acquired notes or homes under the fha single fa mily programs the amendment provided new claims payment procedure that permits hud to pay claim upon assignment of the mortgage rather than upon conveyan ce of the property authorized hud to take assignment of the notes and transfer them to private parties for servicing foreclosure avoidance foreclosure property manage ment and asset dis position allowed fha to be an equity participant in private entities and allowed structured financing for asset disposition in which fha retains an equity interest thereby increasing the value of the asset over simple asset sales in fy2003 hud proposed to use its section 601 authority to transfer defaulted notes to joint venture partners in the priv ate sector the partners would make upfront payments to fha at the time of transfer fha would retain an equity interest in the notes until their disposition and fha woul d receive additional payments for that interest the proposal was expected to reduce foreclosures eliminate much of the acquisition of property by fha and increase ne t recoveries to fha this is regardedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs47 as big step towards getting fha out of the property management business altogether the senate committee noted its cern about the accelerated claims disposition demonstration program under which hud bundles delinquent loans and partners with private bank to mitigate or foreclose on delinquent loans the committee pointed out that hud has not monstrated how this program would benefit very lowincome communities especially those with high incidences of predatory lending the committee noted its concern that in those communities foreclosures would occur more frequently than they do under the current system and this would contribute to the deterioration of those communities the committee directed hud to implement system by wh ich revitalization areas can be exempted from the accelerated claims disposition process should they choose to be the fy2002 vahud appropriations act included language authorizing huds credit watch program this prog ram allows hud to identify fha lenders that originate large number of loans that default quickly which can be key indicator of underwriting problems or fraud and take corrective actions by eliminating unqualified or unscrupulous lenders the conferees hoped that hud would reduce the number of foreclosed properties the senate committee noted that credit watch is an excellent tool for uncovering lenders after they have originated bad loan s by eliminating fraudulent or unqualified lenders the committee nd hud hoped to reduce the number of foreclosed properties in the future the committee noted however that the credit watch model is only effective after problem loans default the senate committee noted that thoug h fha continues to contribute to homeownership by low income minority and first time homebuyers in some cases and in certain neighborhoods fha has been misused to underwrite bad loans that have led to defaults and foreclosed homes and that this has contributed to neighborhood decline and dest abilization the committee concluded that faulty appraisals have contributed to this problem that hud cancelled its appraisal oversight program and that hud has yet to implement its pr oposed alternative which is based on th credit watch model thus the senate committee directed hud to report to the appropriate congressional committees on further actions that could be taken to protect homebuyers and communities in census tracts that experience high rates of fha defaults and foreclosures the committee directed hud to consider making fha lenders responsible for the appraisals on loans in these census tracts the committee further directed that hud consider seve ral other options 1 requiring first time homebuyers to receive counseling prior to the closing of an fha loan 2 requiring home inspections on fhainsured homes boug ht by first time homebuyers and 3 requiring the use of specially certified fha appraisers for the purchase of homes the committee urged hud to consider thes and other options while avoiding proposals that create additional burdens for the fha program or fha homebuyers as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31304crs48 the senate committee noted the receipt of complaints that in areas affected by large numbers of fha foreclosures and property flipping some investors are repeatedly involved in buying fha foreclosed properties making superficial repairs and then reselling or flipping them at inflated prices the committee asked hud to explore strategies to identify invest ors who are involved in such schemes and prevent their purchasing fha properties while recognizing that hud continues to address the problems created by fha property flipping the committee suggested that hud must become more aggressive in adopting the kind of preventive measures suggested by the committee hud was directed to submit report that res ponds directly to the issues raised by the committee the budget reiterates huds commitment to eliminating predatory lending and comprehensively reforming and simplifying the homebuying process the budget stated that new regulations under the real estate settlement procedures act will require full disclosure of all fees that borrowers will pay at settlement and make it clear to borrowers that othe r finance options are availabl proposed rule on the subject was published in the federal register on july 29 2002 proposed rule was published in 2001 which would prevent the issuance of fha insurance on properties that have been transferred by previous sale within 6 months the budget noted that the rule will be implemented in 2003 fha also proposed to publish rule in 2003 which woul d restrict excessive points and fees on fhainsured loans rule will be pr oposed in 2002 and if implemented would hold lenders accountable for the selection and performance of appraisers for fha insured mortgages office of federal housing terprise oversight ofheo ofheo is the safety and

eliminate lead paint hazards with funds targeted to the 18 million homes that are at risk of not being modified through normal renovation or demolition activities the house committee recommended 126 million for the program in fy2003 the same 16 m illion increase requested by the administrati on citing lead poisoning from leadbased paint as the high est public health threat to children under the age of 6 the senate committee r ecommended 201 million for the program for fy2003 75 million more than requested by the administration and 91 million more than enacted for fy2002 while the committee

research as noted fy2003 funding for the space station may be affected by the space shuttle columbia tragedy because space station construction is suspended while the shuttle fleet is grounded the space station is under construction in orbit and the facility has been permanently occupied by successive crew s on 46 month shifts since november 2000 much remains to be built how ever and in early 2001 nasa revealed significant cost growth for completing the station the new estimate would exceed congressionally imposed cap of 25 billion in response the bush administration directed nasa to stop cons truction at phase it calls core complete in fy2004 at that point the us hardware now awaiting launch would be in orbit the bush administration then plans to proceed with launch of european and
