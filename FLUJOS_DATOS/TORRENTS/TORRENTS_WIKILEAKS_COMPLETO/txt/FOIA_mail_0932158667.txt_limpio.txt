from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to edward r cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu subject re vagonov et nature paper date fri jul 16 165747 1999 ed to be really honest i dont see how this was ever accepted for publication in nature it is confusing paper that leaves asking what actually have they done and what is the socalled testable hypothesis of which they speak why didnt they do the testing yes sob river is the polar urals site and i dont know why they get the results they do for it thei precip trends are dubious and our detailed regional response functions do not show significant effect of high precip in winter i really have not had time to fully digest their message but i cant see why either they or nature did not ask my opinion of it my instinctive first reaction is that i doubt it is the answer but we do get results that support recent loss of lowfrequency spring temperature reponse in our data that may be consistent with their hypothesis of prolonged snow lie in recent decades i have not spoken to iain yet about the isotope data but i will if you get any detaied thoughts on the nature paper please let know as i dont know how to respond if at all best wishes keith at 0411 pm 71499 edt you wrote hi keith what is your take on the vagonov et paper concerning the influence of snowfall and melt timing on tree growth in siberia frankly i cant believe it was published as is it is amazinglly thin on details isnt sob the same site as your polar urals site if so why is the sob response window so radically shorter then the ones you identified in your nature paper for both density and ring width i notice that they used berezovo instead of salekhard which is much closer according to the map is that because daily data were only available for the berezovo also there is evidence for decline or loss of temperature response in your data in the post1950s i assume that you didnt apply bodge here this fully contradicts their claims although i do admit that such an effect might be happening in some places cheers ed
