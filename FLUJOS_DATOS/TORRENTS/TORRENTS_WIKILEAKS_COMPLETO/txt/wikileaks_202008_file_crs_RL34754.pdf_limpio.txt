israel stated that it was satisfied that the clauses full of hate and incitement against it and the jewish nation were removed from the conferences final outcome document serge schmemann new york times september 9 2001 also see israels reaction to the conc lusion of the conference against racism continuedspecifically some members of the 110th congress proposed that the united states withhold proportionate share of its assessed contributions approximately 22 from the regular budget which is used to fund the conference withholding funds in this manner would not affect the conference because assessed contributions finance the regular budget in its entirety and not specific parts of it the us decision to withhold proportiona share of funding from the human rights council for fy2008126 would not affect funding for the durban review conference or its prepar atory process because funding for both mechanisms falls under separa parts of the budget of the office of the high commissioner for human rights127 as of november 17 2008 the secretaryge neral estimates that the cost of the review conference and its pr eparatory process will be 3754800128 however the secretarygeneral will seek only 570400 in additional funding because he anticipates that the balance of 3184400 will be absorbed by other related parts of the regular budget129 wcar outcome documents and us participation some suggest that the united states s hould participate in and provide funding for the durban review conference in part because the final text that addresses the situation in israel and palestine in the durban declaration and program of action was significantly toned down from drafts that led to the us withdrawal130 some argue that the us and israeli withdrawals from wcar were turning point in negotiations and sent powerful diploma tic message to conference participants they contend that the withdrawals pre ssured other governments to adopt more moderate language on the middle east in the final outcome documents131httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34754crs24 131 continued in durban and the conclusion of the durb an conference comments by israeli leaders and officials israel ministry of fore ign

29th session of the general assembly former us ambassador to the united nations john scali stated each time that this assembly makes decision which significantly minority of members regard as unfair or onesided it further erodes vital support for the united nations among the minority he stated that at the time the general assembly demonstrated sharply increased tendency to disregard its normal pro cedures to benefit the side which enjoys the favor of the majority and to silence and even exclude the representatives of member states whose policies the majority condemns see us position at the 29th general assembly us department of state pub lication 8800 13 international organization and conference series 119 february 1975 134 for discussion of the possible implicati ons of the united stat withholding funding from the united nations see crs report rl33848 united nations reform us policy and international perspective us policy and international perspectives by luisa blanchfieldconversely some contend that the lang uage in the declaration and program of action remains unacceptable to the united states to support this view opponents point to the bush administrations policy of consistently voting against resolutions supporting the review conference in fora they maintain that the declaration and program of action unfairly single out one regional conf lict and refer to the plight of only one party the palestinia ns with mention of israel132 political and diplomatic impact of us engagement for some the question of us particip ation or nonparticip ation in the durban review conference touches on the broader issue of us engagement in the system supporters contend that us par ticipation in efforts such as the review conference is important to the success and credibility of the united nations as whole they argue that instead of withdrawing from conferences that have processes or outcomes it opposes the united states should fully participate and work from within to build member state coalitions in support of us policies if the united states does not fully participate in fora some argue member state actions might be determined by gr oups of member states dvocating agendas that are contrary to us interests they maintain that us absence from such efforts could create vacuum in which views oppos ed by the united states hold supreme133 supporters contend that piecemeal and sel ective approach to pa rticipation in the united nations damages the us negotiating position and its influence both within and outside of the system134 moreover some argue that us engagement in human rights efforts such as the review conference provides valuable international tool for groups and indivi duals battling racism in countries where human rights is not priorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34754crs25 opponents of us particip ation in the review conference maintain that us engagement would give undeserved legitimacy to mechanisms that provide platform for member states to target israel they also argue that it would imply that the united states supports the antisemitism demonstrated at wcar as well as what many perceive as unbalanced language in the durban declaration and program of action according to some us nonpar ticipation in the review conference sends clear message to member states th at repeatedly targeting one country and regional conflict in fora is unacceptable to the united states they contend that the longterm political impact of such message outweighs the shortterm diplomatic impact of us nonparticip ation or withdrawal these opponents therefore agree with the bush administrations decision not to participate in the preparatory process until as us officials say it is proven that the review conference will not become platform for antisemitism they argue that holding out the possibility of us participation as well as the participa tion of other likeminded governments who have made similar statements may persuade member states to take more balanced approach when drafting nd negotiating review conference outcome documents in preparation for the april 2009 conference
