the child left behind act of 2001 n clb contains veral requirements related to pupil assessments for states and local educational agencies leas participating in elementary and sec ondary education act esea title ia education for the disadvantaged u nder the nclb in addition to previous requirements for standards and assessments in reading and mathematics at three grade levels all states participating in title ia were required to implement standardsbased assessments for pupils in each of grades 38 in reading and mathematics by the end of the 20052006 sc hool year states must also implement assessments at three grade levels in science by the end of the 20072008 school year pupils who have been in us schools for at least three years must be tested for reading in english and states must annua lly assess the english language proficiency of their limited english proficient lep pup ils grants to states for assessment development are authorized and 4087 million was appropriated for fy2008 in addition the nclb requires all stat receiving grants under title ia to participate in national assessment of ducational progress naep tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics to be administered every two years with all costs to be paid by the federal government naep is series of ongoing assessments of the academic performance of representative sa mples of pupils primarily in grades 4 8 and 12 beginning in 1990 naep has c onducted limited number of statelevel assessments wherein the sample of pupils tested in each participating state is increased in order to provide reliable timates of achievement scores for pupils in the state previously all participation in state naep was voluntary and additional costs associated with state naep were borne by participating states the statutory provisions authorizing naep are amended by the nclb to maximize consistency with the nclb requirements and prohibit the use of naep assessments by agents of the federal government to influence state or lea instructional programs or assessments the authorization for esea programs expired at the end of fy2008 and the 111th congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the esea issues regarding expanded esea title i pupil assessment requi rements that are being addressed by the 111th congress include the following are states meeting the expanded assessment requirements on schedule will federal grants be sufficient to pay the costs of meeting the assessment requirements what might be the impact on naep of requiring state participation as well as the impact of naep on state standards and assessments what are the likely major benefits and costs of the expanded esea title ia pupil assessm ent requirements and s hould the assessment

disadvantaged of the elementary and secondary education act esea these assessment require ments expand upon an earlier series of requirements for partic ipating states to adopt curriculum content standards academic achievement standards and ssessments linked to these at three grade levels which were adopted under the improving ameri cas schools act iasa of 1994 pl 103 382 the authorization for esea programs expired at the end of fy2008 and the 111th congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the esea on january 24 2007 the bush administration released building on results

implementation status of these requirements and an analysis of related issues likely to be addressed by the 111th congress this report will be updated regularly to reflect major legislative developments and av ailable information prenclb state testing policies and practices the academic achievement of pupils in public elementa ry and sec ondary schools is assessed using many types of tests pupils may take tests developed by individual teachers or schools commercially publishe d tests selected by their lea or assessments selected or developed by their state educational agency sea this report will focus almost entirely on statemandated assessments tests which must be administered to virtually all pupils in selected grades who attend states

and development center at the univer sity of pittsburgh another is consortium for assessment development formed by three new england states new hampshire rhode island and vermontk12 schools because such tests are the pr imary focus of federa l policies regarding pupil assessment according to published surveys2 every state except one iowa now requires its leas to administer specified assessments to all pupils attending public schools in one or more grades3 the number of grades and s ubjects in which statemandated assessments are administered varies wide ly from only one grade and subject eg the only statemandated assessm ent in nebraska currently is writing test for pupils in grade 4 to tests in multiple subjects and most k12 grades eg alabama requires pupils in each of grades 311 to take stateselected tests in english mathematics science and history fe w statemandated tests are administered to pupils below grade 3 because of variety of concerns about administering standardized tests to very young pupils or in grade 12 in part because most assessment activity for these pupils is focused on college entrance tests with respect to grades 38 in particular 15 states plus the district of columbia currently administer assessments in mathematics and reading to pupils in each of these grades however it is unclear how many of these assessments are linked to state content and ach ievement standards statemandated assessments ve been developed in one of three basic patterns they are either developed by the states themselves usually with technical assistance from commercial firms employing assessment specialists b developed almost completely by commercial test publishers either as generic tests sold in the same form throughout the nation4 or special versions of such tests which are customized to be more consistent with the curriculum content and achievement standards of state or c developed through multistate consortia5 some statemandated assessments whethe r developed by the states themselves or in cooperation with other states or commercial firms are criterionreferenced tests or crts see glossary designed to determine the extent to which pupils have mastered specific curriculum content and skills other statemandated tests are eitherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs3 6 for example in order to clarify distinc tions between high and lowachieving pupils normreferenced test will typically include so very difficult questions that only few pupils can answer and some very easy questions that almost all pupils can answer correctly test content and questions are selected larg ely on the basis of how efficiently they rank pupils in contrast crt would be focused so lely on the relevant content standards with direct emphasis on distinguishing the hi ghest from the lowestachieving pupils 7 direct expenditures include those for such activities and services as development and field testing of assessments purchase of test mate rials scoring or dissemination of results indirect expenditures might include those for time spent by teachers and other staff preparing pupils for or administering assessments or overhead costs for review of related

the costs associated with statemandated pupil testing programs is not available there are many potential sources of such costs both direct and indi rect at the state lea and school levels and there are unresolved debates over how to estimate and whether to consider certain types of costs especially indirect ones7 survey of direct statelevel expenditures for stat emandated assessment programs was conducted in early 2001 by the pew center on the states8 these data combine statelevel expenditures for both test development and administration for fy2001 fy2000 for north dakota and vermont the figures do not include any lealevel expenditures either direct or indirect nor possible indirect statelevel expenditures for statemandated testing programs according to this survey stateleve l direct expenditures for k12 pupil assessment programs in fy2001 totaled 4228 million the expenditures per state varied from zero for iowa and 02 million for north dakota to 440 million for california and 267

study of the costs of developing and initially implementing assessments aligned with curriculum standards in two states kentucky and north carolina according to this study10 the total fiveyear statelevel costs of developing and implementing new assessment aligned with state st andards for kentucky were 955 million 19 million per year for test developmen t and 333 million 667 million per year in total including development administrati on etc for north carolina the total threeyear statelevel costs were f ound to be 40 million 134 million per year for test development and 275 milli on 55 million per year in total the costs for these two states are not necessarily representative of the costs for all states for example costs might be lowe r for states which develop tests jointly with group of other states or which contract with commercial test publisher for customized version of test which is market ed nationwide in generic form federal policies or activities regarding pupil assessments under the child left behind act the following section of this report describes the major pupil assessmentrelated provisions of the esea as amended by the nclb esea title ia requirements for standards and assessments the provisions of esea title ia as amended by the nclb regarding standards and assessments reinforce nd expand upon provisions initially adopted in the improving americas schools act of 1994 iasa whether under the iasa or the nclb these standards and assessment provisions are linked to receipt of financial assistance under esea t itle ia that is they apply only to states wishing to maintain eligibility for title ia grants however since title ia is the largest federal k12 education pr ogram funded at 139 billion for fy2008 it is generally considered unlikely that many states would decline to participate in the program in order to avoid implementing the expanded assessmen t requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs5 11 see crs report rl32495 adequate yearly progress ayp implementation of the child left behind act by wayne c riddlethe iasa of 1994 attempted to raise the instructional standards of t itle ia programs and the academic expectations fo r participating pupils by tying title ia instruction to stateselected curriculum content and academic achievement standards these provisions were adopted in response to concerns that title ia programs had not been sufficiently challenging academically had not been well integrated with the regular instructional programs of par ticipants and had required extensive pupil testing that was of little instructional or diagnostic value and was not linked to the curriculum to which pupils were exposed further the legislation attempted to make title ia tests more meaningful by using state assessments to determine whether schools and leas are making adequate early progress ayp toward meeting state achievement standards11 states were given several years to meet the iasa requirements in particular the full system of standards and assessments was not requi red to be in place until the 20002001 school year and as is discussed in detail below only minority of states met that deadline thus in its debates on the nclb in 2001 the congress considered not only the expanded assessm ent requirements proposed by the bush administration but also the implementati on status of requirements adopted in 1994 under the esea as amended first by the iasa of 1994 and later by the nclb of 2001 states wishing to remain eligible fo r title ia grants are required to develop or adopt curriculum content standards as well as academic achievement standards and assessments tied to the standards in gene ral these standards and assessments are to be applicable to all leas schools and pupils statewide one major exception to this general policy is that if agency or entity in state has the authority to establish statewide standards or assessm ents as is generally assumed to be the case for iowa and nebraska then the state may adopt either statewide standards and assessments applicable onl to title ia pupils and programs or b policy providing that each lea receiving title ia grants will adopt standards and assessments which meet the re quirements of title ia and are applicable to all pupils served by each such lea another possi ble exception which is discussed further below is that ed regulations would allow local variation in the assessments used for at least some grade levels thus it shoul d be kept in mind that state systems of standards and assessmen ts as referred to frequently below may not in some cases be uniform statewide in order to comply with the provisions of esea title ia state systems of standards and assessments ar required to meet numbe r of specific statutory requirements as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs6 12 as is discussed later in this report most st ates did not meet this deadline established in the 1994 iasa 13 there is explicit authority for oneyear dela of this requirement in cases of exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances 14 there is some obvious overlap in these requirements eg states meeting the requirement for assessments in reading and ma th at three grade levels already meet the requirements for one or two of grades 38 15 separately the provisions regarding ayp provide that at least 95 of the pupils in each demographic group within each school must be included in the assessments in order for the school to meet ayp requirements pupils may be excluded from schoollevel score reporting and accountability if they have attended specific school for less than one year 16 leas may continue to administer assessmen ts to pupils in nonenglish languages for up to five years if on casebycase basis they determine that this would likely yield more accurate information on what the students know and can do1 standards and assessments at 3 grade levels were to be developed or adopted at least in the subjects of mathematics and readinglanguage arts by the 2000 2001 school year12 standards were to be adopted in science by the end of the 20052006 school year and assessments in science by the end of the 20072008 school year 2 the standards and assessments us ed to meet the title ia eligibility requirements must be the same as those applied to all public school pupils in the state with the two possible exceptions discussed above 3 the content standards are to specify what pupils are expected to know and be able to do and are to be coherent and rigorous 4 achievement standards must establish at least three performance levels for all pupils advanced proficient and partially proficient or basic 5 assessments must be aligned with state content and achievement standards 6 assessments in mathematics reading and beginning in 20072008 science must be administered annually to students in at least one grade in each of three grade ranges grades 35 grades 69 and grades 1012 in addition assessments in mathematics and reading were to be administered to pupils in each of grades 38 by the end of the 2005200613 school year14 7 all pupils in the relevant grades w ho have attended schools in the lea for at least one year must participate in the assessments15 8 lep pupils are to be assessed in valid and reliable manner and provided with reasonable accommodations to th extent practicable lep pupils are to be assessed in the language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what they know and can do in academic content areas in subjects other than english itself however pupils who have attended schools in the united states excluding puerto rico fo r three or more consecutive school years are to be assessed in english16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs7 17 oneyear waiver of this requirement is sp ecifically authorized in cases of exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances9 reasonable adaptations and accommodations are to be provided for students with disabilities consistent with the provisions of the individuals with disabilities education act idea where such adaptations or accommodations are necessary to measure the achievement of those students relative to state standards 10 the assessment system must involve multiple approaches with uptodate measures of student performance includi ng measures that assess higher order thinking skills and understanding 11 assessments must be used for purposes for which they are valid and reliable and they must meet relevant nationa lly recognized professional and technical standards in particular the state educational agency sea must provide evidence from test publisher or other relevant source that the assessments are of adequate technical quality for the purposes required under title ia 12 the assessment system must produce individual student interpretive and diagnostic reports that are provided to pa rents teachers and principals as soon as is practically possible after the asse ssments are administered it must also enable itemized score analyses to be produced and reported to leas and schools so that specific academic needs may be identified 13 the assessment system must enable results for each state lea and school to be disaggregated ie reported separa tely by gender major racial and ethnic groups english proficiency status migran t status students with disabilities as compared to students without disab ilities and economically disadvantaged students as compared to students w ho are not economically disadvantaged however such disaggregation is not required in cases where the number of pupils in group would be too small to yi eld statistically reliable information or where personally identifiable information would be revealed 14 assessments must objectively measure academic achievement knowledge and skills and not assess personal or family beliefs and attitudes or disclose personally identifiable information 15 assessment results must be provided to leas schools and teachers before the beginning of the subsequent school year 16 in addition to the general assessment system described in 115 above states are to provide that their leas will annually assess the english language proficiency of their lep pupils including pupils oral reading and writing skills17 finally as is discussed further below states receiving grants under esea title ia must participate in biennial statelevel administrations of the national assessment of educa tional progress in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics beginning in the 20022003 school year the timing of several of the key requirements listed above is summarized in the following schedulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs8 18 similar although somewhat less specific language may be found in esea section 9526b1 and section 9527aschedule for implementation of all assessment requirements school year 20002001 states were to have adopted content and performance standards plus assessments linked to these at three grade levels in mathematics and reading these requirements were included in the 1994 reauthorization of the esea as of the date of this report 21 states fully met these requirements school year 20022003 states were required to begin to annually assess the english language proficiency of lep pupils possibl oneyear waiver for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances states were first required to partic ipate in biennial administration of naep annual report cards on state and lea school systems and schools were required to be published with possibl one year waiver authorized for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances states were required to begin reporting annually to ed on progress towardmeeting new assessment and related requirements under the nclb school year 20052006 standardsbased assessments in reading and mathematics were to be administered to pupils in each of grades 38 by the end of this year states were required to adopt conten t and achievement standards at three grade levels in science by the end of this year school year 20072008 states must begin to administer assessments at three grade levels inscience by the end of this year limits on ed influence over state standards and assessments several statutory constraints have been placed on the authority of the secretary of education to enforce these standard and assessment requirements first the esea contains provision similar to others found in the department of education organization act and the ge neral education provisions act stating that nothing in esea title i shall be construed to authorize any federal official or agency to mandate direct or control state local educational agency or schools specific instructional content academic achieveme nt standards and assessments curriculum or program of instru ction section 190518 second states may not be required to submit their standards to the us secr etary of education section 1111b1a or to have their content or ach ievement standards approved or certifie d by the federal government section 9527c in order to receive funds under the esea other than the limited review necessary in order to determine whether the state meets the title ia requirements finally state plan may be disapproved by ed on the basis ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs9 specific content or achievement standard s or assessment items or instruments section 1111e1f state assessment grants the esea authorizes in title via1 annual grants to the states to help pay the costs of meeting the title ia standard and assessment requirement s added by the nclb ie the newly required assessments in science at three grade levels and at grades 38 in mathematics and reading these grants may be used by states for devel opment of standards nd assessments or if these have been developed for assessment administration and such related activities as developing or improving assessments of the english nguage proficiency of lep pupils the amount authorized to be appr opriated for these state assessment grants plus grants for development of enhanced assessment instruments see below is 490 million for fy2002 and such sums as ma be necessary for each of fy2003 fy2008 the state assessment requirements that were newly adopted under the nclb are contingent upon the appropriation of minimum annual amounts for these state assessment grants the administration but not the development of grade 38 and science assessments may be delayed by one year for each year that the following minimum amounts are not appropriated fy2002 370 million fy2003 380 million fy2004 390 million and each of fy 2005fy 2008 400 million for example if an amount less than 400 million had been appropriated for state assessment grants for fy2005 the deadline for state administration of tests in reading and mathematics for each of gr ades 38 would have moved from 20052006 to 20062007 for each of fy2002fy2008 at least the minimum amounts have been appropriated for these grants the state assessment grants are to be allocated as follows after reservation of 05 of the total for the outlying areas nd 05 for the bureau of indian affairs each state will first receive 3 million rema ining funds will be allocated among the states in proportion to their number of ch ildren and youth aged 517 years this allocation formula reflects an implicit assumption that costs of assessment development are partially similar for all states regardless of their size and partially related to the size of th states school age population the esea also authorizes competitive grants to states for the development of enhanced assessment instruments aided activities may include efforts to improve the quality validity and reliab ility of assessments beyond th levels required by title ia to track student progress over time or to develop performance or technology based assessments funds ppropriated each year for state assessment grants which are in excess of the trigger amounts fo r assessment development grants listed above are to be used for enhanced asse ssment grants the amounts available for assessment enhancement grants thus far are 17 million for fy2002 45 million for fy2003 none for fy2004 117 million for fy2005 76 million for each of fy2006 and fy2007 and 87 million for fy2008 finally the nclb authorizes study of the impact of the expanded title ia assessment requirements the secretary of education is authorized to use the lesser of 15 of total appropriations for title i part national assessment of title i or 15 million per year to contract for an inde pendent study of assessments used forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs10 19 for additional information on naep see crs report 98348

assessments national assessment of educational progress19 the national assessment of educational progress naep is federally funded series of assessments of the academic performance of elementary and secondary students in the united states naep tests generally are administered to public and private school pupils in grades 4 8 and 12 in variety of subject s including reading mathematics science writin g and less frequently geography history civics social studies and the arts naep assessm ents have been conducted since 1969 naep is administered by the national center for education statistics nces with oversight and several aspects of policy set by the national assessment governing board nagb both within the us department of education since 1983 the assessment has been developed primarily under cooperative agreement with the educational testing service ets private nonprofit organization which also develops and administers such assessments as the sat private business firm westat inc carries out much of the test administration activities two other private firms national computer systems and american institutes for research distribute and score the assessments and develop the background stionnaires respectively naep consists of two separate groups of tests one is the main assessment in which test items questions are revised over time in both content and structure to reflect more current views and practices the main ssessment also reports pupil scores in relation to performance levels standards for pupil achievement that are based on score thresholds t by nagb the performance levels are considered to be developmental and are intended to place naep scores into context they are based on determinations by nagb of what pupils should know and be able to do at basic partial mastery proficient solid academic performance and advanced superior performance level with respect to challenging subject matter the second group of naep tests form th longterm trend assessment which monitors trends in math and reading achievement20 the tests in each subject area have not changed in content or structure since they were orig inally developed in 1969 purportedly making it possi ble to reliably compare results from year to year however many have expr essed concerns that the longterm trend assessment questions may be increasingly disconnected from what pupils are actually taught withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs11 21 an nagb policy adopted in may 2002 addresses this concern with respect to the science assessment and changes were to be made to the content of the science assessment before its next administration 22 the voluntary national test proposal of the clinton administration was to develop individual versions of the naep 4th grade reading and 8th grade math tests see crs report 97774 national tests administration initiative by wayne c riddle archived available from the author 77382 activity related to this proposal has been terminatedthe passage of decades of time21 since the longterm trend assessment is not involved with the esea title ia assessmen t requirements it w ill not be discussed further all naep tests are administered to only sample of pupils and the tests are designed so that pupil takes an entire naep test the use of sampling is intended to minimize both the costs of naep and test burdens on pupils it also makes it possible to include broad range of items in each test since individual pupil takes an entire naep test it is impossi ble for naep to report individual pupil scores22 it is intended that naep tests be administered to representative sample of all pupils in public and private schools although ther has been ongoing debate over whether lep pupils or those with disabilities are adequately represented and whether appropriate accommodations or adaptations are being provided for them the frameworks for naep tests provide broad outline of the content on which pupils are to be tested frameworks are developed by nagb through national consensus approach involving teachers curriculum specialists policymakers business representatives and the general public in deve loping the test frameworks national and various standard s are taken into considera tion but the frameworks are not intended to specifically reflect any partic ular set of standard s in addition pupils and school staff fill out background ques tionnaires the naep statute limits the range of background information that may be co llected to data dir ectly related to the appraisal of academic achievement

only with respect to state naep tests other than those required for title ia purposes there are conflicting statutory and regulatory provisions regarding participation in naep tests by leas and

provisions regarding voluntary participation by leas the naep authorization statute redesignated in 2002 as section 303 of the education scien ces reform act by pl 107279 states that participation is

inclusion of the group in ayp calculations and scores of formerly lep pupils may not be include d in state lea or school report cards both these options if exercised should increase average test

that the secretary of education had formed working group to consider better ways to assess the achievement of lep pupils for purposes of accountability under the nclb39 pupils with disabilities regulations addressing the application of the title ia standards and assessment requirements to certain pupils with disabilities were published in the federal register on december 9 2003 pp 6869868708 the purpose of these regulations is to clarify th application of sta ndard assessment and accountability provisions to pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities under the regulations states and leas may adopt alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards aligned with the states academic content standards and reflecting professional judgme nt of the highest achievement standards possible for limited percentage of pupils with disabilities40 the number of pupils whose proficient or higher scor on these alternate assessments may be considered as proficient or above for ayp purposes is limited to maximum of 10 of all tested pupils approximately 9 of ll pupils with disabilities at the state and lea level there is limit for individual schools seas may request from the us secretary of education an exception allowi ng them to exceed the 10 cap statewide and seas may grant such exceptions to leas within their state according to edhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs20 41 under current regulations the shortterm policy cannot be extended beyond the 20082009 school year 42 this would be calculated based on statewide demographic data with the resulting percentage applied to each affected school and lea in the state in making the ayp determination using the adjusted data further use may be made of confidence intervals or other statistical techniques the actual not just the adjusted percentage of pupils who are proficient must also be reported to parents and the publicstaff three states in 20032004 montana oh io and virginia and four states in 20042005 the preceding three states plus south dakota received waivers to go marginally above the 10 limit statewide in the absence of waiver the number of pupils scoring at the prof icient or higher level on lternate assessments based on alternate achievement standard s in excess of the 10 limit is to be added to those scoring below proficient in lea or state leve l ayp determinations ed policy affecting an additional group of pupils with disabilities was announced initially in april 2005 with final regulations based on it published in the federal register on april 9 2007 the new policy is divided into shortterm and longterm phases it is focused on pupils with disabilities whose ability to perform academically is assumed to be greater than that of the pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities discusse d in the above paragraph and who are capable of achieving high standards but may not reach grade level within the same time period as their peers in eds termi nology these pupils would be assessed using alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards the shortterm policy may apply with the approval of the secretary to states until they develop and adminis ter alternative assessments under the longterm policy described below41 under this shortterm policy in eligible states that have not yet adopted modified achievement standards schools may add to th eir proficient pupil group number of pupils with disabilities qual to 20 of all pupils assessed in effect deeming the scores of all of thes pupils to be at the proficient level42 this policy would be applicable only to schools and leas that would otherwise fail meet ayp standards due solely to their pupils with disabilities group according to ed staff as of the date of this report 28 states are currently exercising this flexibility alternatively in eligible states that ve adopted modified achievement standards currently six states schools and leas ma count proficient sc ores for pupils with disabilities on these assessments subject to 20 of all assessed pupils cap at the lea and state levels the longterm policy is embodied in final regu lations published in the federal register on april 9 2007 these regulations affect standards assessments and ayp for group of pupils with disabilities who are unlikely to achieve grade level proficiency within the current school year but who are not among those pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities whose situation was addressed by an earlier set of regulations discussed above for this second group of pupils with disabilities states would be authorized to develop modified academic achievement standards and alternate ssessments linked to these the modified achievement standards must be aligned with gradeleve l content standards but may reflect reduced breadth or depth of gradele vel content in comparison to the achievement standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs21 43 the 30 limit might be exceeded for leas but only if and to the extent that the sea waives the 10 cap applicable to scores on alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards 44 in such cases the former pupils with disabilities would not have to be counted in determining whether the minimum group size was met for the disability subgroupapplicable to the majority of pupils the standards must provide access to grade level curriculum and not preclude affected pupils from earning regular high school diploma as with the previous regulations regarding pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities there would be direct limit on the number of pupils who take alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards however in ayp determinations pupil scor of proficient or adva nced on alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards may be counted only as long as they do not exceed number equal to 20 of all pupils sted at the state or lea level ie an estimated 20 of pupils with disabilities such scores in excess of the limit would be considered nonproficient as w ith the 10 cap for pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities this 20 cap does not apply to individual schools in general leas or states could exceed the 20 cap only if they did not reach the 10 limit with respect to pupils with th most significant cognitive disabilities thus in general scores of proficient or above on lternate assessments based on alternate and modified achievement standards ma not exceed total of 30 of all pupils tested at state or lea level43 in particular states are longer allowed to request waiver of the 10 cap regarding pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities the april 9 2007 proposed regulations also include provisions that are widely applicable to ayp determinations first states are longer allowed to use varying minimum group sizes n for different demographic groups of pupils this prohibits the previously common practice of setting higher n sizes for pupils with disabilities or lep pupils than for other pup il groups second when pupils take state assessments multiple times states and as may use the highest score for pupils who take tests more than once finally as with lep pupils states and leas may include the test scores of former pupils w ith disabilities in the disability subgroup for up to two years after such pupils have exited special education44 thus eligible states and leas will be llowed to count as proficient or above in ayp determinations the proficient or higher scores of up to 10 of all tested pupils on alternate assessments based on lternate achievement standards and of up to an additional 20 of all tested pupils on alte rnate assessments based on modified achievement standards for both groups there is limit for individual schools on the percentage of pupils in either of these categories and there is limit on the number or percentage of pupils to w hom either type of alternate assessment may be administered regulations published in october 2008 on title ia assessments and accountability several new final regulations affecting the title ia assessment ayp and accountability

group size policies in addition the regulations codify provisi ons for the national technical advisory council that was established in august 2008 to advise the secr etary on variety of technical aspects of stat standards assessments ayp and accountability policies each state is required to submit its accountability workbook modified in accordance with the proposed regulations to ed for new

administration of state naep tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics ever two years beginning with the 2002 2003 school year spring 2003 initial naep 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics results for all states were released in november 2003 subsequent rounds of naep tests was ad ministered in all states in 2005 and 2007 further as is discussed in later section of this report the nagb has published report using the national assessment of educational progress to confirm state test results which examines issues related to the possible use of state naep results to confirm trends in state assessment results several changes to naep policies and practices have been implemented that are supportive of or were adopted primarily in response to the expanded role for naep under the nclb47 in recognition of the increased emphasis on measurement of performance gaps among diffe rent demographic groups of pupils in the nclb more questions are being added at the upper and wer ends of the difficulty range so that achievement gaps among pupil groups can be more reliably measured in addition studies are being conducted of possible ways to adjust sampling strategy in order to assure adequate numbers of pupils in the various demographic groups referenced in the nclb at the same time number of administrative adjustments are being implemented that are intended to reduce required pupil sample sizes in the aggregate eg the main naep state and national pupil samples will be combined for the first time although samples of pup ils will likely be increased in small andor sparsely populated states in order to enhance the pr ecision of results efforts are being made to minimize time demands with goal of reporting results of reading and mathematics assessments within six months of test administration special issues arise with respect to puer to rico which is treated as state under esea title ia but did not participate in state naep tests prior to the enactment of the nclb questions have been raised bout the comparability of tests administered in different languages especially in reading naep tests in mathematics were administered to 4th and 8thgrade pupils in puerto ri co in 2003 and 2005 and results from both test administrations have been recently released48 finally state naep tests are now administe red by contractors rather than as in the past local teachers there is fulltime naep coordinator in every state and state service center has been establis hed to support these coordinators and nagb has established procedures for limited public access to naep test items and for submission review and resolution of comp laints about naep sts by parents and other members of the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs25 bush administration reauthorization proposals the bush administrations reauthoriza tion blueprint contains two proposals regarding the esea title ia assessment provisions first participating states would be required to develop content and pe rformance standards in english and math covering 2 additional years of high school by 20102011 and ssessments linked to these standards by 20122013 the assessments would include pair of 11th grade assessments of college readiness in read ing and math however states would be required only to report the results of these assessments not to use them for adequate yearly progress terminations in addition states receiving title ia gr ants would be required to include naep results along with results on state assessments on state report cards to facilitate crossstate comparisons of achievement levels finally the administration has requested an increased fy2008 appropria tion of 1166 million for naep in order to support expansion of biennial statele vel naep assessments in reading and math to the 12th grade in 2009 issues regarding the esea title ia pupil assessment requirements what types of assessments meet the expanded assessment requirements as described above the nclb include s explicit reference to number of criteria that state assessments must meet in order to comply with the esea title ia requirements however the statute does not appear to directly or explicitly address two major issues with respect to the assessments whether qualifying state assessment systems must include only crts or whether they may include mix of crts and nrts as long as the latter are m odified to provide the required linkage to state content and achievement standards and b whethe r qualifying state assessment systems must include only assessments that are the same statewide except in states that lack authority to require statewide assessments or whether they may include mixture of statewide and locally varying assessments as long as the latter are deemed to be equivalent and adequa tely linked to state conten t and achievement standards it is stated that assessments must be the same academic assessments used to measure the achievement of all child ren section 1111b3ci but the implications of this provision are ambiguous in cases where state has assessment to measure the achievement of all children in certain grades arguably criterionreferenced assessments which are administered to all public school pupils statewide in the relevant grad are most fully consistent with the requirements which are explicitly stated in title ia only crts are designed comprehensively and from the ground up to measure pupil achievement with respect to specific content and academic achievement standards while certain nrts may be somewhat related to state standards in their generic form with substantial overlap in test items with crts and more closely related if modified specifically for this purpose as would be required under the regulations they are neverthelesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs26 49 however ed has approved the assessment systems of three other states delaware indiana missouri where statespecific test s were reportedly designed from the beginning to produce both criterionreferenced and normreferenced results 50 national research council uncommon measures equivalence and linkage among educational tests washington national ac ademies press 1998 p 54initially designed primarily for the purpose of ranking and sorting pupils not for the purpose of determining whether pupils meet statedetermined achievement levels in fact it is not yet clear whether modifi ed versions of assessments designed initially as nrts can indeed meet the title ia requirements for linkage with state content and performance standards some states such as california have attempted to meet the 1994 assessment requirements through use of modified nrts but such assessments have yet been fully approved by ed49 similarly assessments that are the same statewide would seem to most fully meet the purposes of title ia especially with respect to the use of assessment results to determine whether schools or leas meet state st andards of adequate yearly progress ayp the best way to assure that assessments of the extent to which pupils meet state achievement standards ar equivalent and cons istent statewide is to use the same assessments throughout the state this is especially important in view of the use of assessment results to determine whether schools or leas meet ayp standards and the need to aggregate local results to determine whether states overall meet such requirements establishi ng equivalence among varying local tests might be possible but is likely to be very difficult according to national research council report under limited c onditions it may be possible to calculate linkage between two tests but multiple factors aff ect the validity of inferences that may be drawn from the linked scores these factor s include the context format and margin of error of the tests the intended and actua l uses of the tests and the consequences attached to the results of the tests50 further there is precedent for allowing states to meet title ia assessment requirements through use of different assessments in different leas except for the two states that may lack authority to establish statewide assessments states have been allowed to meet the 1994 standard and assessment requirements through the us of locally varying assessments articulation between the tests used in different grades and coherence of the overall assessment system are also important concerns if for example statewide tests are used in some grades but locally varying tests in other grades or if crts are used in some grades and modified nrts in others this would likely create significant articulation difficulties with variations from grade to grade in the proportion of pupils meeting state standards which result solely from the assessment instrument used separate from any underlying di fferences in achievement levels criteria established in the regulations published by ed for mixed state assessment systems are relatively demanding any nrts used must be augmented to measure accurately the depth and breadth of the states academic content standards 34 cfr 2003a2iia and have results ex pressed in terms of the states achievement standards and an leaselected assessments used to meet the title ia requirements must be of equivalent to one another in their content coverage difficulty and quality

it is likely to be very difficult for mixed state assessm ent systems to be approved however opponents of proposals to allow states to meet the title ia requirements through mixed assessment systems are concerned that eds review process may not be very strict and that in some states systems may be approved which are not well aligned with state standards or are not consistent among leas statewide at least in certain grades with the result that the standards for determining whether schools are meeting ayp standards would significantly vary among leas in contrast proponents of relatively high degree of state flexibility in meeting the title ia requirements through mixed assessment systems argue that this will minimize federal influence and intrusion recognize state prim acy in selecting assessment systems which meet their needs minimize costs and still meet the purposes of title ia because of the criteri which such systems would have to meet proponents of allowing the use of modified nrts to meet the re quirements at least for some grades argue that the differences between nrts and crts have more to do with how test results are analyzed and presented than with the test items themselves the fact that several states currently use mix of statewide crts in some grades and nrts in others or statewide tests of either type in some grades and locally varying tests in others may indicate that such mixed assessment systems meet important educational needs and goals as perceived by the states themselves how strict is eds review of state assessment systems as indicated by the relevant policy guidance and the published communications to states peer reviewers and ed staff appear to have been conducting relatively rigorous and detailed reviews of the evidence submitted by states regarding whether their assessment systems meet the eseas requirements the features which the title ia statute requires state assessment systems to exhibit are themselves numerous and relatively deta iled and substantial implementation of them is likely to involve somewhat exha ustive review the assessment reviews have focused especially on issues regarding sting score reporting and inclusion in accountability systems for lep pupils and thos with disabilities while there are complex issues and considerations in these areas they are not being raised solely and possibly not even primarily because of the t itle ia requirements for example while there are general guidelines applicab under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 to any lea receiving federal grants regarding the use of an appropriate language andor other accommodati ons for assessment of lep pupils51 and requirements under the idea for alternat assessments where necessary for pupils with disabilities it is largely in the context of title ia that such requirements are having an impact because of the scrutiny currently being given to whether state assessments meet the title ia requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs28 52 there are two basic types of title ia programs schoolwide programs are authorized when 40 or more of the pupils in school are from lowincome families in these programs title ia funds may be used to improve the performance of all pupils in school and there is requirement to focus services on only the most disadvantaged pupils the other major type of title ia service model is the targeted assistance school program under which services are generally limited to the lowest achieving pupils in the school 53 us government ccountability ffice gao title i education needs to monitor states scoring of assessments gao02393 april 2002 p 13although it may be questioned whethe r ed should be reviewing state assessment systems in such detail this scrutiny may be necessary to enforce title i as statutory requirements and might so be necessary to establish outcome accountability for all major groups of di sadvantaged pupils if for example significant numbers of lep pupils or those with disabilities were excluded from state assessments or were not provided with appropriate accommodations then it would be impossible to determine whether they along with the pupil population in general are adequately meeting state performance goals such inclusive assessment combined with disaggregated score reporting becomes increasingly important as focus shifts toward outcome measures to assure accountability for use of federal aid funds and title ia programs are increas ingly conducted in schoolwide program format in which services are not targ eted on the individual pupils with lowest achievement in pa rticipating school52 although detailed review by ed of stat assessment systems may raise concerns about undue federal influence over this fundamental aspect of state and local public education systems there are many statutory limitations on the review process as noted earlier the federal government is prohibited from manda ting directing or controlling states leas or schools st andards assessments or curriculum states may not be required to submit their standards to ed and state plan may be disapproved by ed on the basis of specifi c content or achieve ment standards or assessment items or instruments neverthe less the degree of federal influence over at least the broad parameters of state pupil assessment systems such as grades and subject areas tested inclus ion of special needs pupil groups disaggregated reporting of results has increased under the nclb the rigor of eds assessment review process and the flexibility of the assessment regulations will also likely influence the extent to which states meet the expanded requirements on sc hedule government accountability office report published in 2002 identified four additional factors which have influenced the pace of state compliance with title ia assessment requirements 1 the efforts of state leaders to make title i compliance priority 2 coordination between staff of different agencies and levels of g overnment 3 obtaining buyin from local administrators educators and parents and 4 the availability of state level expertise53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs29 54 earlier two organizations attempted during 20012002 to estimate costs for states of meeting assessment requirements similar to those of the nclb in 2001 the national association of state boards of education nasbe estimated that the new grade 38 assessments only would cost states betw een 27 and 70 billion in the aggregate over sevenyear period httpwwwnasbeorgarchivesc osthtml on an annual basis if costs were equally distributed across the seven years this would represent range of 386 million to 1 billion per year in contrast accountability works private consulting firm estimated that the annual cost of meeting ll of the new assessment requirements in the continuedwhat is the cost of developing and implementing the required assessments and to what extent will federal grants be available to pay for them the addition of requirements to c onduct annual reading and mathematics assessments in at least four more grades than required previously and to include standards and assessments at three grade vels in science has required most states to significantly increase their expenditures for standard and test development and administration as indicated earlier it is ve ry difficult if not impossible to specify all of these potential costs with precision the nclb conference report directed the government accountability office to conduct study of the costs to each state of developing and administering the assessments required under t itle ia both overall and for each of fiscal years 2002 2008 in 2003 gao published report title i characteristics of tests will influence expenses information sharing ma help states realize efficiencies gao03389 that discussed i ssues related to potential costs of meeting the nclb assessment requirements and provided range of alte rnative cost projections gao based its conclusions on surv ey of assessment practices in all states and detailed examination of the costs of assessment development and administration in seven states according to the gao the level of stat costs for assessment development and administration as well as the relationship between those costs and funding provided by the nclbs assessment development gr ants depends primarily on the kinds of test questions states choose to utilize multiple choice opene nded essay questions or combination of these tests with questions that elicit openended responses which require people who can evaluate pup ils responses are much more expensive to administer and score than multiplechoice questions that can be scored by computers over the period of fy2002fy2008 in comparison to total of the annual minimum assessment velopment grant appropriations of 27 billion gao estimated that it would cost states 19 bi llion to meet the nclb assessment requirements using only multiple choice tests 53 billion using mixture of multiple choice and open ended test items in all states and 39 billion if states use the same mixture of multiple choice and openended test items as in the recent past it should be noted that this study consid ered only the projected statelevel costs of developing standard assessmen ts on reading mathematics and science and not costs for developing alternate assessments for pupils with disabilities or english language proficiency assessments fo r lep pupils or possible increased costs for leas54httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs30 54 continued nclb would range from approximately 312 million to 388 million for each of 20022003 through 20072008 http wwwschool reportcomawnclbtestingcostsstudypdf 55 the 400 million trigger amount and actual appropriation for fy2007 is 95 of the estimated aggregate expenditure level for fy 2001 discussed earlier in this report of 4228 million 56 estimates of the statelevel costs of deve loping and administering assessments required by the nclb are becoming available for limited number of individual states for example study published in september 2005 for virginia httpwwwpenk12vaus vdoenclbcoststudyreportstate pdf concluded that estimat ed assessment costs for this state ranged from 7382 million for each of the 20042005 through 20072008 school years these amounts are somewhat less than the assessment grants to virginia of 8588 million for fy2004fy2005the nclb authorizes 400 million for fy2002 and such sums as may be necessary through fy2008 for state asse ssment development and administration grants the administration although not the development of assessments newly required by the nclb grades three th rough eight reading and mathematics assessments plus science ssessments at three grade vels may be delayed by one year for each year that the minimum amounts eg 400 million for fy2007 are not appropriated thus far the minimum amount has been appropriated for each of fy2002fy2008 the available information on direct statelevel expenditures for testing programs indicates that the trigger appropriation levels for state assessment grants are in the aggregate similar to these estimates55 they are also either similar to or substantially below the test velopment and administration costs projected by gao above depending on assumptions regarding types of test items used56 it is probable that the costs of mee ting the expanded asse ssment requirements have varied widely from state to state not only because of differences in state size but also particularly because of substantial differences in the extent to which state mandated tests in reading and mathematics were already being administered to all pupils in grades three through eight or tests in science for pupils in selected grade ranges and whether the tests met the title ia technical requirements of alignment with state standards inclusion of all pupil groups etc assessment development costs may also be reduced through coopera tive arrangements among some states to jointly develop certain assessments such as the new england common assessment program involving new hampshir rhode island and vermont with respect to the distribution among th states of funds fo r test development and administration the nclb provides for llocation of substantial share of these funds in equal amounts to each state with the remainder allocated in proportion to children and youth aged five to 17 years the allocation formula does not recognize the substantial variation in the extent to which states may already administer the required assessments and therefore face va rying levels of additional assessment program costs the allocation of funds by formula to all states regardless of the current status of their state assessment policies and programs might recognize that all states face ongoing costs and might possibly reward states which have already adopted relatively extensive assessment pr ograms at the same time the formula does not target funds on the st ates with the greatest needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs31 57 see national research council improving schooling for languageminority children research agenda washington national ac ademies press 1997 pp 115116 58 see http wwwedgovabou tofficeslistocrdocslaumemoshtmlwhat might be the impact of the requirement for annual assessment of english language proficiency of lep pupils as noted earlier the nclb requires states to provide that their leas will annually assess the english language proficiency of their lep pupils this is separate from the requirements regarding treatment of lep pupils in states general assessment systems that is the requireme nt that lep pupils be included in such assessments in which they are to be assessed in valid and reliable manner and provided with reasonable accommodations in the language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable informati on on what they know and can do in academic content areas in subjects other than eng lish itself with pupils who have attended schools in the united states excluding pu erto rico for three or more consecutive school years to be assessed in english in contrast to such requirements regarding treatment of lep pupils in states general assessment systems the separate requirement for annual assessments of english language proficiency lacks speci ficity there are statutory details regarding technical characteristics of the tests except that the assessment must consider the pupils oral reading and writing skills and thus far policy guidance from ed it is also somewhat am biguous regarding whether states or leas are ultimately or pr imarily responsible for imple menting this requirement depending on possible future regulations or policy guidance from ed this new requirement may lead to relatively little change in current activities in leas although comprehensive and detailed survey s of such assessment practices are not currently available there is substantial ev idence that leas in general already assess the english language proficiency of lep pupils for purposes of placement in instructional programs determination of needed accommodations in general assessment programs evaluati on of programs targeted on lep pupils and movement of pupils from special programs to mainstream instruction while variety of assessment methods are used including teacher observation and home language surveys recent surveys indicate that large majority of leas administer formal english language proficiency tests to their lep or potentially lep pupils57 policy guidance from eds office for civil rights indicates that such assessments should be undertaken especially but not only for purposes of assigning pupils to instructional programs targeted at lep pupils determining the timing of transition to regular or mainstream instruction for such pupils and evaluating the effectiveness of special programs for lep pupils althoug h this guidance is unspecific regarding the type of assessment leas should use58 in addition leas participating in the new english language acquisition program authorized under esea title iii part must report nnually the number and percentage of participa ting pupils who attain english proficiency as determined by valid and reliable ssessment of english proficie ncy section 3121a3 ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs32 eds future policy guidance is consistent with the statutes lack of specificity regarding the new title ia requirement there may be little required change in lea activities as result of the requirement what might be the impact of requiring state participation in naep possible influence on state standards and assessments arising from marginally increased stakes two key characteristics of the naep program since its inception have been 1 the content frameworks upon which test items are based have been i ndependent of the content sta ndards adopted by any state or national organization and 2 the sta kes associated with performance on the tests have been extremely low the nclbs requirement for states to participate in naep in order to retain eligibility for esea title ia grants with the implicit purpose of using the results to confirm performance trends on stateselected assessments has potential implications fo r both of these characteristics of naep previously the only stakes associated with state participation in naep have been the symbolic ones arising from public dissemination of naep results for states that chose to participate and which allowed their assessment results to be published public attention to these results among persons other than selected policymakers researchers and policy analysts seems to have been limited the naep scores have had impact on state finances or eligibility for federal programs or services while state involvement with naep will change significantly under the nclb the stakes for states will remain relatively low state results will be published as an implicit confirmation of test score trends on state assessments but these naep scores will still have direct impact on state elig ibility for fede ral assistance provisions of the house nd senatepassed versions of the nclb for state bonuses and sanctions based in part on naep score trends were eliminated from the conference version under the nclb as acted ed is required to establish peer review process to evaluate whether states have met their statewide ayp goals states which fail to meet them are to be listed in an annual report to congress and technical assistance is to be provided to states that fail to meet their goals for two consecutive years state naep scores will likely be considered in this review process however there is provision for state bonuses or sanctions under this procedure only publicity and technical assistance this increases the stakes associated with state naep performance but only to very modest degree nevertheless even small increase in the stakes associated with state performance on naep tests attracts attention to the possibility that naep frameworks and test items might influence state standards and assessments to the extent that the required participation in naep increases attention to state performance on these tests there might be basis for concern that states would have an incentive to modify their curriculum content standards to more closely resemble the naep test frameworks to counter act this potential problem the nclb prohibits the use of naep assessments by agents of the federal government to influence state or lea instructional prog rams or assessments however subtle indirect andor unintended forms of in fluence may be impossible to detect orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs33 59 in 2000 48 states all except alaska and sout h dakota initially stated

pupils m i g h t conflict arise between the requirement for naep participation by states participating in esea title ia and the provision that participation in naep tests is voluntary for all pupils schools and possibly leas wh ile participation by states leas schools and pupils was voluntary under previous federal law and policy states or leas were not prohibited from requiring participation by leas sc hools or pupils under their own laws or policies however as noted earlier see the section of this report titled naep provisions in the child left be hind act there are conflicting statutory and regulatory provisions rega rding participation in naep tests by leas and schools which may be selected for naep test administration some have expressed concern that the new provisions regarding voluntary participation in naep might lead to two types of difficulties in time of likely increased assessment activity for pupils nationwide resistance to participation in naep might grow to an extent that it threatens the quality of the national sample of tested pupils and makes it difficult to maintain trend lines and b more specifically states might be stuck between requirement to participate in naep and an inability to recruit sufficiently large sample of leas schools and pupils to participate in order to produce valid and relia ble assessment results in the past some states have attempted to participate in naep but found themselves unable to induce sufficient numbers of leas or schools to do so59 the primary counter to this concern is that the policies regarding voluntary participation in naep have changed only modestly as far as federal policies are concerned participati on has already been voluntary at all levels while states or leas previously could have mandated particip ation by leas schools or pupils apparently they generally attempted to avoid doing so thus in practice little may have changed there may nevertheless be some cause for concern with the expansion of naep to states that have not previously chosen to participate can naep results be used to confirm state test score trends an unstated but clearly implicit purpos of the state naep participation requirement is to confirm trends in pupil achievement as measured by state selected assessments by comparing them with trends in naep results some have questioned whether it is possible or appropr iate to use results on one assessment to confirm results on another assessment which may have b een developed very differently and what form th is confirmation might

foundation february 2002 p 14 61 see the report for details available at httpwwwnagborgstate assessments vary widely in terms of several important characteristics such as the content and skills which they are designed to assess their format and modes of response they are likely to conti nue to vary widely especially as the final assessment regulations allow the use of both crts and modified nrts as well as locally varying assessments as result some state assessments will be much more similar to naep in these important respects than others and there will be consequent variation in the significance of similarities or differences when comparing trends in naep versus state assessmen t score trends for pupils if for example state test is closely aligned to state curriculum content standards which are substantially diffe rent from the content embodied in naep assessment frameworks and if instruction is modified to better match the state standards then it is possible that scores on the state assessment will rise while those on naep will be flat or even decline naep frameworks are designed with the intention that they substantially reflect state standards on average according to recent analysis states vary in the amount that their assessment domains ie the content and skills covered by the assessments overlap with naep for some there is almost complete overlap for others the overlap is modest60 other major differences between naep and state assessments include the time of year when tests are administered b relative placement of cut scores for achievement levels c the often high but varying stakes associated with state assessments versus the low stakes associated with naep and d test format and modes of response as for the form which comparison of naep and state test scores might take two obvious candidates are average raw scores and the percentages of pupils at different achievement levels basic proficient etc while these are key benchmarks either alone or even both might overlook important changes or differences in the distribution of pupil scor for example the scores of several pupils might improve but not by enough to ra ise them above the cut score for the next highest achievement level as noted above the nagb has published report using the national assessment of edu cational progress to confirm state test results whose authors argue that state naep scores can be used as evidence to confirm the general trends in scores on individual stat assessments although such confirmation should not be viewed as or take the form of strict statistical validation of state test results they address the question of whether comparisons should be based on raw scores or percentages of pupils at various achievement levels by recommending new method of comp arison which considers changes and differences in the overall achievement sc ore distribution not focusing solely on overall averages or cut scores61httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs35 62 these

ountabilityayptestingforresultshtmlwhat are the likely benefits and costs of the expanded title ia assessment requirements this report concludes with review of major potential benefits and costs of the expanded pupil assessment requirements of esea title ia the primary benefit from annual administration of consistent series of st andardsbased tests would be the provision of timely information on the performance of pupils schools and leas throughout most of the elementary and ddle school grades while majority of pupils have already been taking assessments in many of grades 38 these have been typically mix of crts and nrts statemandated and locally selected tests with provision that most of these are either equivalent statewide or aligned to state content and achievement sta ndards even under the broa dest interpretation of eds draft policy guidance which would allow states to use modified nrts in addition to crts and locally varying tests which are deemed to be equivalent the resulting state assessment systems would be mo re coherent consistent nd well articulated than the current systems in most states the availa bility of such consis tent annual assessment results would be of value for both di agnostic and accountability purposes the resulting assessment systems would also continuously emphasize the importance of meeting state standards as embodied by the assessments these expanded requirements regardin g pupil assessments and school lea and state accountability based on perform ance on the assessments have been enacted in the context of broader strategy also initiated in the 1994 esea amendments and expanded by the nclb which involves increased state and local flexibility in the use of federal education assistance funds62 under this strategy accountability for appropriate us of federal aid funds is to be established more on the basis of pupil performance outcomes and less on prescribed procedures or targeting of resources than in the past such strategy implicitly relies heavily on high quality current deta iled and widely disseminated information on pupil achievement as basis for outcome account ability policies and procedures it is desirable that achievement da ta be as comparable and current as possible while not compromising the primacy of states and leas in setting k12 education policy according to the ed publication testing for results helping families schools and communities u nderstand and improve st udent achievement63 annual standardsbased assessments will empower parents citizens educators administrators and policymakers with data in annual report cards on school performance and on statewide progress further the tests will give teachers and principals information about how each child is performing and help them to diagnose and meet the needs of each student they will also give policymakers and leaders at the state and local levels critical information about which schools and school districts are succeeding and why so this success may be expanded and any failures addressed good evaluation system provides invaluable informa tion that can inform instruction andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs36

it can change the way schools operate at the same time the expanded title ia assessment requirements might lead to variety of costs or unintended cons equences in both fina ncial and other forms one such cost is expanded federal influence on state and local education policies assuming that states will continue to impleme nt them in order to maintain title ia eligibility then assessment requirements attached to an aid program focused on disadvantaged pupils are broadly influencing po licies regarding standards assessments and acc ountability affecting all pupils in the participating states this represents substantial increase in federal influence in the assessment and accountability aspects of k12 education policy in the majority of states that did not previously manda standardsbased assessments in each of grades 38 their policies may have resulted primarily from cost or time constraints or the states may have determined that annual testing of this sort is not educationally appr opriate or at least that its benefits are not equal to the relevant costs these costs may include not only the direct costs of test development administration scoring reportin g etc not all of which ma be paid through federal assessment grants but also an increased ri sk of overemphasis on preparation for the tests especially if the tests do not adequately assess the full range of knowledge and skills which schools are expected to impar t the authors of recent study of the effects of highstakes asse ssment policies in 18 states have posited an uncertainty principle which may be rele vant to such concerns t he more important that any quantitative social indicator becomes in social decisionmaking the more likely it will be to distort and corrupt the social process it is intended to monitor64 at the least annual testing of pupils in grades 38 would increase the importance of having tests that are well designed and closely linked to state content and achievement standards which are truly challenging nevertheless even within the specifi c realm of standard s and assessments federal influence remains limited in several important respects with the exception of the limited role of state naep tests the standards and assessments are totally selected by the states ed is not authorized by the nclb to review the substance of any state standards and state plan may be disapproved by ed on the basis of specific content or achievement standa rds or test items or instruments ultimately whether increased federal influence in certain respects combined with less federal control over certain other as pects of state and local use of federal aid funds is balanced tradeoff is subjective political j udgment the key analytical point is that the increase in federal influe nce is constrained and is balanced by decrease of federal influence in certain other respectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31407crs37 glossary of selected terms used in this report criterionreferen

test question normreferencedttest nrt the primary distinguishing characteristic of norm referenced tests is that pupil performance is measured against that of other pupils rather than against some fixed standard of performance normre ferenced test results are usually expressed in terms of population percentiles along bellshaped distribution of tested pupils typical normreferenced test result is that 4th grade pupils achievement in mathematics is at the 55th percentile meaning that her or his performance is better than that of 55 of nationally representative sample of 4th grade pupils who have taken the test under the same conditions but worse than that of the other 45 of tested pupils in the sample most of the widely administered commercially published k12 achievement tests such as the iowa test of basic skills terranova or the stanford series are normreferenced tests at least in their standard forms standardized test any test for which the test ite ms as well as the conditions under which the test is administered are c onstant thus both crts and nrts may be standardized tests
