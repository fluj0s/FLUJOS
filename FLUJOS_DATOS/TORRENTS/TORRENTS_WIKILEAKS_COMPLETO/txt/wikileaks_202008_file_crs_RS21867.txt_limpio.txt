relations committee held nomination hearing for him on february 15 2007 and he was confirmed on march 7 2007 appropriations for the new us mission in iraq have come from variety of sources to date funds for either the interim buildings or new embassy construction have come from the regular appropriations process according to the department of state the initial phase of establishing the us post in baghdad involved the administration finding funds without specific appropriations for the embassy subsequently much of the total required funding appeared in emergency supplemental requests cpa funds and dod appropriations rather than in the regular budget many have had difficulty in discerning exactly what the administration has already received and what is still needed what has been spent and what is in the pipeline what is available for operational activities of the mission versus activities related to construction of the new compound oversight includes congressional monitoring of how the embassy represents american foreign policy and cultural and commercial interests the 108th and 109th congresses were criticized in the media for doing too little oversight in general and specifically for transferring supplemental funds from afghanistan to iraq the 110th httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21867 congress asked administration officials questions about the embassy in appropriation hearings and held an oversight hearing on first kuwaitis labor issue and its quality of construction of the us embassy in iraq only since early october 2007 have cost overruns and delays in opening the embassy come to light
