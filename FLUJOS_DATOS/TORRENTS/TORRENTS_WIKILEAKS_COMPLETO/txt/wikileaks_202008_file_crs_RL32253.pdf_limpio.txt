aff ect these consequences for tax purposes it does not matter whet her the payment is made pursuant to judgment or binding settlement agreement furthermore payment made in lump sum has the same consequences as payment made in periodic installments although the timing of the inclusion andor duction will differ in this report the terms award and damages are used interchangeably and intended to include all such payments portions of payment may face different treatment depending on what each represents eg replacement for lost wages reimbursement of medical expenses or punitive damages the different parts ma be designated by the court in the judgment or by the parties in the settlement agreement the parties must generally follow these allocations for tax purposes if the judgment or agreement is silent then the taxpayer must make the appropriate allocations in any case the internal revenue service irs or judicial authority may reallocate the payment to properly reflect the actual substance of the award1 in order to determine the appropriate allocation the irs and reviewing author ities will look at such things as the complaint other pleadings evidence presented at trial and settlement agreement tax consequences to the recipient for awards received pursuant to judgme nt or settlement for claims involving personal physical injury or sickness the r ecipients tax consequences are determined under section 104 of the internal revenue c ode irc for all other claims ie nonpersonal injury and persona l nonphysical injury claims general tax principleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32253crs2 2 section 104 also excludes amounts received as disability income by certain individuals injured as result of terrorist or military ac tion and amounts

see hr conf rep 104737 at 301 footnote 56 4 see priv ltr rul 200041022 july 17 2000 5 the line between personal and professiona l can be faint for example in roemer v commr 716 f2d 693 1983 damages for injury to professional reputation were excluded from income because the court found that such injuries were personal under state tort law 6 for example the supreme court held that an employment discrimination claim arising under title vii of the civil rights act which only allowed back pay as remedy was not tortlike because the legal basis for the claim di d not allow the breadth of remedies available in tort actions united states v burke 504 us 229 1992 7 for example prior to burke 504 us 229 the third and si xth circuits allowed awards of back pay for claims of employment di scrimination to be excluded under irc 104 while the tax court and the fourth fifth tenth nd dc circuits included such awards in income see rickel v commr 900 f2d 655 3rd cir 1990 burke v united states

payment is meant to replace awards received for personal physical injury or sickness under irc 104a2 the amount of any damages other than pun itive damages received on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness is excluded from the recipients gross income2 this includes all nonpunitive damages including economic ones eg lost wages that are received because of the personal physical injury or sickness however an amount that is attributable to medical expenses that have already b een deducted may not be excluded physical injury and sickness irc 104a2 does not define physical injury or sickness beyond excepting emotiona l distress congress did not intend the physical symptoms of emotional distress to be considered physical injury or sickness3 the irs appears to take the position that physical injuries stem from direct unwanted or uninvited physical cont acts resulting in observable bodily harms such as bruises cuts swelling and bleeding or causing pain4 prior to 1996 the injury or sickness did not have to be physical in order for the award to be excluded under irc 104a2 when deciding if the exclusion applied courts looked solely at whether 1 the injury or sickness was personal as opposed to professional5 and 2 the claim was tort or tortlike as opposed to contractual6 this led to inconsistent results particularly about whether damages received for various claims of di scrimination qualified for exclusion7 in the small business job protection act of 1996 sbj pa pl 104188 congress amended thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32253crs3 8 see hr conf

distress are included in the recipients income unless the emotional distress had its origin in physical injury or sickness8 emotional distress is intended to include the symptoms eg insomnia headaches stomach disorder s which may result from such distress9 if medical care for the emotional distress was sought then damages equal to those medical costs may qualify for exclusion10 punitive damages under irc 104a2 as amended by sbjpa punitive damages that are received on account of pe rsonal physical injury or sickness are included in the recipients gross income limited exception exists under irc 104c for punitive damages awarded in wrongful death action if state law as existing on september 13 1995 only allows the recovery of punitive damages interest on award courts have repeatedly he ld that if an award includes prejudgment interest the in terest may not be excluded from gross income under irc 104a211 legal expenses an award may include an explicit amount that represents the recipients attorneys fees and other legal costs this may occur because the court awards the expenses under feeshifting st atute the settlement agreement includes the expenses or there is contingency f ee agreement that grants specified portion of any award to the attorney if an award is excluded from the recipients income under irc 104a2 then any amount that represents attorneys fees and other legal costs is also excluded from the recipients income the amount will be included as compensation in the attorneys income deductibility plaintiff with physical pers onal injury or sickness claim may not deduct the legal expenses incurred in the suit this is because expenses incurred in the production of taxexempt income are not deductible12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32253crs4 13 see commr v

for claims of nonpersonal injury and nonphysical personal injury statutory exclusion exists for payments received pursuant to judgment or settlement in nonpers onal injury and nonphysical personal injury cases the treatment of an award is determined by general tax principles that include the award in the recipients income unless it is properly designated as return of capital or there is statutory exclusion for the item of income that the payment is intended to replace this is determined by the nature of the underlying claim for example an employment suit is breach of contract claim and any award for back pay is meant to substitute for the payment of wages since there is not an exclusion for wages from gross income the award is included in gross income if an award is included in the recipients gross income it must be characterized as ordinary income or capital gain this is important because it determines such things as the appropriate tax rate the ch aracterization is made by looking at the nature of the underlying claim for exam ple if payment is meant to replace lost profits then the award is treated as ordinary income however if the payment is to redress an injury to capital asset then the amount should be treated as capital gain punitive damages punitive damages that are awarded for claim of non personal injury or nonphysical personal in jury are included in the recipients income13 irc 186 deduction in suits claiming patent infringement breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty or th violation of antitrust laws the award recipient may be allowed deduction under irc 186 if the compensatory portion of the award is included in income the amount that may be ducted is the lesser of the compensatory payment less the costs of securing it or the amount of unrecovered net operating loss attributable to the injury legal expenses as mentioned above an aw ard may include an explicit amount that represents the reci pients attorneys fees and other legal costs prior to supreme court decision in 2005 discussed below14 it was unclear whether this amount was included in the recipients inco when it was received as part of an award in nonpersonal injury or nonphysical personal injury case with contingency fee agreement courts generally required it be included in the recipients income15 this approach was consistent with three fundamental tax principles 1 payments are included in income unless specifically excluded by statute 2 ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32253crs5 16 see cotnam v commr 263 f2d 119 5th cir 1959 cited as controlling in srivastava v commr

assign ing income to another party and 3 taxpayer receives taxable benefit when another party pays his or her debt however some courts llowed the amount to be excluded from the recipients income16 this position had several bases 1 the attorneys right to the income under state lien law 2 the recognition that contingency fee agreements are not made with taxavoidance purpose and that inclus ion of the fees in the clients income results in the amount being subject to double taxation and 3 equitable reasons due to the fact that the recipient may not be able to fully deduct the legal expenses as explained below in 2005 the supreme court resolved the c onflict by holding that the recipient is required to include the amount repr esenting attorneys fees in income17 the court appeared to answer the question with relative ease based on settled law it began by stating that in situations involving anticipatory assignment of income like contingency fee agreements the test for determining if the assignor received the income for tax purpose is if he or she retains control over the incomegenerating asset18 the court then reasoned that because the cause of action resulting from the injury is the incomegenerating asset and the injured party retains control over it throughout the litigation the injured party receives all of the award for purposes of taxation19 the court rejected the argument that the attorney had an ownership interest in the asset because he or she so contributed an incomegenerating asset ie effort and expertise or was granted it under state lien law20 deductibility plaintiff with claim of nonpersonal injury or nonphysical personal injury may be able to deduct the legal expenses incurred in the suit business plaintiffs may gene rally deduct the entire amount of attorneys fees and other litigation costs as business expenses under irc 162 however if the award was treated as capital gain then the legal expenses should be capitalized rather than currently deducted21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32253crs6 22 see irc 62a20 this provision was adde d by the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 it is effective for fees and costs paid after october 22

to characteriz awards of attorneys fees as reimbursed employee business expenses which give rise to an abovetheline deduction under irc 62 continuedthe deductibility of nonbusiness plaintiffs attorneys fees will depend on the type of claim individuals with certain claims may deduct attorney fees and court costs as an abovetheline deduction22 this means that they will be able to deduct the entire amount so long as it does not exceed the amount of the judgment or settlement that was included in income the claims to which this treatment applies are claims of unlawful discrimination cla
