of committee markup the chair of committee usually exercises control over the committees markup schedule as well as the agenda for markups specific senate rules governing meeting times are designed to minimize interruptions of deliberations and scheduling conflicts standing committees in the senate are authorized to meet when the senate is in session as well as when it has recessed or adjourned rule xxvi paragraph 1 however committee meetings except of appropriations and budget are restricted when the senate is also meeting rule xxvi paragraph 5a committee may not meet on any day after the senate has been in session for 2 hours or after 200 pm when the senate is in session whichever is earlier in practice the rule is routinely waived by unanimous consent it also may be waived by joint agreement of the party leaders senate rules also restrict committees to meeting during specified time periods committees do not always adhere rigorously to these restrictions rule xxvi paragraph 6 each senate committee is further required to notify the office of the daily digest of the congressional record when any markup is scheduled pursuant to senate standing order title iv of sres 4 95 th congress including the time place and purpose of the markup and any changes or cancellations as they occur the daily digest office enters this information into the senates computerized scheduling system and this information is published in the record additional notification requirements may be contained in individual committee rules for example some committees require that each committee member receive an advance written notice of markup along with an agenda for the session senate rule xxvi paragraph 3 sets forth certain requirements for the frequency of committee meetings each standing committee except appropriations is required to adopt regular meeting day which must be at least monthly for purposes including the markup of legislation committee chair may schedule additional markup meetings as necessary majority of committee also can call markup but this rarely occurs rule xxvi paragraph 3 before scheduling markup committee might first seek to determine that quorum is likely to be present although the minimum quorum to conduct markup is at least onethird of committee rule xxvi paragraph 7a1 at least one committee has required majority to mark up several committees have adopted rules requiring that quorums for conducting routine business including markups must include at least one member of the minority 1 this report was written by thomas p carr who
