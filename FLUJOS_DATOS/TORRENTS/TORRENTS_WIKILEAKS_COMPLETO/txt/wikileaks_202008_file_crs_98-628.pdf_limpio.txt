including corporate bodies individuals sometimes request relief through private law when administrative or legal remedies are exhausted but congress seems more often to view private legislation as appropriate when other remedy is available and when enactment would in broad sense afford equity from 1817 through 1971 most cong resses enacted hundreds of private laws but since then the number has declined to below 30 as congress has expanded administrative discretion to deal with many of the situations that tended to give rise to private bills private provisions also are occasionally included

are commonly introduced by the member who represents the indi vidual to be benefitted seldom are companion bills introduced in both chambers although house rule xii clauses 3 and 7 permits cosponsors on private bills cosponsors have occasionally appeared on private bills that attract broad interest g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 immigration and claims matters have long remained the most common subjects of private bills the committee on the judiciary refers these to its subcommittee on immigration border security and claims which handles them routinely under established rules it generally takes

documentation and requests hearing the sponsor is generally the only witness at this hearing the subcommittee makes available to member offices information on what documentation it requires and the kinds of bills on which it is likely to take favorable action it usually declines to report bill if its records show few precedents for favorable house action in similar cases panels that handle other kinds of private legislation have similarly institutionalized procedures g8g149g152g152g155g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 house rule xv clause 5 establishes special procedures for the consideration of private bills when reported private bills go on special calendar the private calendar house rule xiii clause 1 consideration of bills on this calendar is in order on the first and at the discretion of the speaker third tuesday of each month though the house often dispenses with the call by unanimous consent each bill is called up automatically in the order in which it was reported and placed on the calendar the bills are considered in the house as in committee of the whole meaning that there is period of general debate but debate and amendment may occur under the fiveminute rule usually little debate occurs and measures are disposed of by voice vote during the call of the private calendar if two members object to the consideration of any bill it is automatically recommitted each party appoints official objectors who are responsible for examining bills on the private calendar and objecting to those they deem inappropriate sometimes member of subcommittee dealing with immigration or claims has served simultaneously as an official objector in practice instead of objecting objectors will often ask that bill be passed over without prejudice which gives sponsors an opportunity to discuss concerns with them informally before the next calendar call if private bill is recommitted the committee may rereport it as paragraph of an omnibus private bill which has priority for consideration on third tuesdays at this stage the substance of each original private bill may be defeated by majority vote by means of motion to strike the paragraph out of the omnibus bill otherwise each paragraph may be amended only by reducing amounts of money or providing limitations after an omnibus private bill is passed it is broken up again into separate bills for further action in current practice committees seldom rereport private measures once recommitted g8g158g155g157g145g142g155g561g18g155g152g140g142g142g141g146g151g144g156g561 further proceedings on private bills follow the general lawmaking process presidents have sometimes vetoed private bills often by pocket veto otherwise congress may override the veto in the same way as for public measures either house of congress may also by resolution refer private claims bill to the court of claims for recommendation from trial commissioner these recommendations are requested occasionally but often followed when requested httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98628g18g155g146g159g138g157g142g561g4g146g149g149g156g497g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g561g146g151g561g157g145g142
