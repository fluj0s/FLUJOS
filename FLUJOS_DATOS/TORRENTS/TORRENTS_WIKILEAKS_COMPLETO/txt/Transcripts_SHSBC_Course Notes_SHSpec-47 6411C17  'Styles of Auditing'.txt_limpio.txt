6411c17 shspec47 styles of auditing reference hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing getting the different auditing styles clarified and formalized will make learning to audit easier over the years many auditing styles have developed to deliver different processes repetitive commands came in in 195556 along with trs muzzled auditing followed to handle auditors who messed up pcs with interruptions comments etc more recently with lrhs work on the comm cycle and the discovery that auditors werent really listening listen style was developed for prepchecking and sec checking where you steer the pc around another style was developed guiding style now that we have all the processes all the styles are there in order of developing an auditors skill as he goes up the levels the higher you go the more precise your auditing is but also the higher you go the more sloppy your auditing may look at the level of r6 the pc is going through so much and changing so fast that the auditor has to be able to shift and change rapidly in order to keep up with the pc and his mind and in order to do just what is necessary to keep the pc running down the bank pc has to be up aways to be able to have allstyle auditing for the pc to be up to standing allstyle auditing would require high level of confidence in auditors and acquaintance with different styles of auditing so the unpredictability of allstyle auditing would throw the pc off if this was the first style he had encountered auditing the pc at lower levels would give him more certainty if you ran r6 on raw meat you might get away with it but the first mess you got into would be the end of the pc hes got confidence in auditing and reliance on scientologys ability to handle ptps to fix him or rescue him etc there is case factor also preventing new pc from being audited on r6 the worse off someone is the more important he is and the more exaggerated his ideas of his ability are hes got hidden standards outconfront etc etc there isnt much you could do if you put the pc on r6 and he spun so dont do it you are making yourself the effect of his bank most people start their auditing in total desperation in fear of going out the bottom getting up to the point where they know that they wont get any worse release is major improvement it doesnt necessarily take long time to do this you might tend to overrun the pc unless you observe well and note the acceleration of gain that occurs dont cut off pc cogs furthermore you are handling level of case that is voluntarily trying to improve which means that there is some spark of responsibility for selfimprovement and some idea that the person can do something about it people can go so far downscale that they think nothing can be done about anything then you get socialist or communist state to take care of them one reason why governments call scientology fake is that they have the opinion that nothing can be done and scientology is claiming that it can do something through pcs course of auditing we must keep the pc winning so that self at cause keeps coming up it is easier to make someone better than to make him worse he resists getting worse but doesnt resist getting better when he realizes that he can and must do something to get better and that he will not get worse be will be release the auditing styles can be plotted against the most likely win for the pc at given stage of his auditing how you audit pc is at least as important as what you audit just the mechanics of auditing are therapeutic regardless of the process they are applied to first the pc discovers that he can talk to someone then he discovers that he can answer question when he is asked one there is some 8c in this that is beneficial as well as duplication which he has fallen away from he cant be anything because he cant duplicate anything unless you have gotten someone out of this kind of condition he cant confront existence thetan can only be what he can see he can only see what he can duplicate it is hard to get duplication of an accident or crime because person cant be it therefore he cant see it this leads to slight occupational liability as an auditor you are looking at pc all the time that you dont particularly want to be youre trying to improve him arent you fortunately it isnt necessary for you to be willing to be aberrated to get well because we have the whole anatomy of the reactive bank and there is sense in it if the pc hadnt made the reactive mind and the gpms he would be virtually unaberratable there would be dwindling spiral because the thetan would have to determine to have something wrong with him thetan had to decide to be aberrated he did it but almost accidentally having done it he was too stupid to get out of his trap there are different degrees of aberration based on the locks and the tendency of the reactive mind to group bunch up and get into restimulation there are some basic things that can go wrong with thetan which are above the level of the bank and gpms these include duplication and communication duplication and communication can be aberrated regardless of endwords there are endwords there too but these are highlevel ideas common to all thetans with or without banks pc should be able to communicate and duplicate pretty well they do improve up to the point where he can confront his bank at level 0 the pc knows that he has communicated because the auditor received the communication at level i the pc knows he has received communication because he has answered it and the auditor is satisfied with the fact that he has answered the communication if the auditor lets the pc receive communication or question that he doesnt answer the pc is unsatisfied because knowing that he didnt answer the question he starts doubting his ability to receive communication at this level he finds that not only can he answer question but also he can answer it repetitively this is big change for many people when pc can answer question repetitively that is even better than just being able to answer question that is why we say i will repeat the auditing command see abridged style below guiding style at this level we are handling the pcs finding out that there is something there to the pc the whole world is reasonless he is starting out at lower harmonic of the truth namely that there is nothing there and that he has reason to be upset about anything he says i feel nervous today and sees cause for it the biggest cog here is that there are causes for things for one thing he will realize that he is not just natively stupid or that life doesnt have to be mess something could be causing the condition he is in the pc needs to get the idea that conditions dont just happen but are caused by things and that be is longer just pawn if things cause things you might be able to predict if things cause things you might be able to do something about something if things cause things you might be able to do something about yourself guiding secondary style this comes out of guiding style auditing steer plus itsa is the process that goes with it you find it and bleed it remedy and b level ii locates causes without knowing the cause person is dispersed all over the universe finding the cause and then doing something about it is terrific abridged style when he has learned all that it is safe to run him on an abridged style we can look and see what is going on the reason why at levels i and ii you always say ill repeat the auditing question when the pc hasnt answered it is that you are teaching the pc that he can receive and answer an auditing question at level iii this is not necessary anymore and it may be irritating to the pc he already knows that he can get the command so you have abridged style in which the auditor and the pc can look and see what is going on this is an abridgement of lower not upper styles the pc says he has ptp you dont guide him into it you just ask what is it it usually blows so you then drop it the pc can asis things more easily now you audit purely against finite result to the point of getting to happen what you want to have happen and further the pc learns that when he gets audited something happens direct style now weve got direct style auditing getting the exact result applies even more here you go direct to the result
