the last time the user failed to login if the current state is l ogin failed ignore this value the first time ever the user successfully logged in typically the same as the creation date the ip address from where the user tried to login but failed the timestamp of the last login attempt please ignore this ip address refer to ip address in failure row or success row the last time the user successfully logged in if the current state is login failed else ignore this value the ip address from where the user last logged in shows the first time of the last days successful logins to new microsoft site or from new client machine the number of times the user has failed to login this value is reset to zero once the user is successful in logging in the last time the user successfully

m n t u s n l page 12 additional tips 1 in create credential row 2 in the current state row the ip address does not denote the ip address of the machine of the last attempt if the last login was failure then the ip address is present in the ip address column of the login failure row while if it was success then the ip address is present in siteiptime history row b if the state is login failed then refer the last modified timestamp in the login f ailure row to find the last time the user tried to login and failed if the state is login successful then refer to the last modified timestamp in the login success row to find the last time the user signed in successfully 3 in login failure row the value number of failure tries is cleared once the user is able to successfully login hence if user failed to login on several tries but eventually logs in successfully there is record of the previous failures 4 in site iptimehistory row the site iptimehistory table is not updated if the user logs in again from the same ip address to the same microsoft site it only shows the first login of the last day for the user from the same ip and to the same machine b there are many cases where end u ser ip address is hidden by isp proxy server sis shows the ip address of isp proxy server instead of real end user ip address so for the individual user information you can approach the isp c the table is limited to only the last 10 ms site and ip comb inations 5 signin summary records are restricted to initial authentication so subsequent auth entication to other m icrosoft sites are not logged 6 all times are utc and the time stamps come from windows live id passport servers and not the users computer 7 ignore rows ip address history and datetime history these are present for some older accounts and have now been replaced by site iptimehistory row one way to understand the table is to draw the timeline and plot the individual events in it it gives quick view of the activities
