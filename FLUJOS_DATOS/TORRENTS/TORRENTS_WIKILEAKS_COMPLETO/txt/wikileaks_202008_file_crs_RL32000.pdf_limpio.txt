universal life insurance and variable life insurance this discussion illustrates how cash value life insurance can operate as an investment vehicle that combines life insurance protection with financial instrument that operates similarly to bank certificates of deposit and mutual fund investments next the income tax provisions that appl to the owners of life insurance are analyzed under the internal revenue code income measurement rules cause portion of the investment income to not be taxed in addition the remaining investment income is not taxed contempor aneously and may be totally exempt from taxation this report provide s brief overview of intern revenue code provisions that create these tax results and the provisions that limit the favorable tax treatment the report then considers the current tax treatment justifications from tax policy perspective in this analysis the report examines the principal arguments of supporters of the current tax treatment of the investment income credited to life insurance contracts and compares life insurance to other taxpreferred investment vehicles the report also considers the limits on investment oriented uses of life insurance in

background and issues1 introduction this report examines the tax treatment of life insurance under the internal revenue code owners and beneficiarie s of life insurance contracts receive preferential treatment under th federal income tax laws significantly an owner of cash value life insurance generally avoids taxation on the entire amount of interest or other returns on the investment that is credited to the contracts cash value if the life insurance contract remains in effect until the insureds death the beneficiaries generally exclude from income the death be nefits paid under the contract including the previously untaxed interest the second section introduces different type s of life insurance and the financial and economic framework upon which these pr oducts are constructe d this section begins with discussion of the concept of pure life insurance protection and the types of life insurance products that provi primarily pure life insurance protection the remainder of the section examines life insurance products that combine investment features with pure life in surance protection including whole life insurance universal life insura nce and variable life insurance the third section examines the tax provisi ons of the internal revenue code that apply to the owners of life insurance first this section discusses the application of internal revenue code sec tions 101 and 72 which establis h the basic tax treatment second it provides brief ove rview of internal revenue code sections 7702 and 7702a which contain highly technical limita tions on the favorable tax treatment accorded certain life insurance arrangements section iv considers the justifications for the favorable tax treatment from tax policy perspective finally sections v and vi examine tw types of life insurance arrangements and their tax implications corporateowned life insurance and split dollar life insurance that have received attention in recent years in both types of arrangements some businesses and corporate executives have utilized life insurance to obtain significant economic benefits th is section provides an overview of these arrangements and brief analysis of the tax issues that they raisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs2 description of life insurance products pure insuran ce protection all life insurance contracts have two defining characteristics first an insurance company agrees to pay specified sum fo llowing the death of an insured second premiums are paid to the life insurance company to secure the benefits specified in the life insurance contract although all life insurance contracts incorporate these elements the economic terms of life insuran ce contracts vary widely in broad terms life insurance companies market two broad categories of life insurance term life insurance and cash value life insurance individuals often recognize that their deaths may leave their families with inadequate financial resources the purchase of life insurance contract enables an individual to shift this financial risk to life insurance company if the insured dies while the contract is in effect the policys beneficiaries receive specified dollar amount the death benefit following th insureds death investment of the insurance proceeds may generate income to replace portion of the income that the insured earned prior to death the simpler form of life insurance is term arrangement when life insurance company issues term contract it commits itself to pay specified sum if the insured individual dies during the period of time or term that the contract covers upon the expiration of the term ne ither the owner of the policy nor the life insurance company has further obligations under the contract the premium paid with respect to term life insurance cont ract reflects the likelihood that the insured will die during the year of coverage flight life insurance perhaps the simplest form of term insurance protection is flight insurance under f light insurance contract an individual pays premium of few dollars to insure her life for the duration of flight on an airplane the premium doe s not depend upon the age or health of the insured rather it depends upon the likelihood of pl ane crash if the insured reaches her destination alive then the contract rminates if however the insured does not survive until the end of the flight then the insurance company becomes obligated to pay the death benefit specified in the contract these policies are typically limited to accidental deaths and accordingly woul d not cover healthrelated deaths during flight given the short term of c overage there is meaningful investment incorporated into flight insurance individual term insurance term life insurance pr ovides current insurance protection for limited time the most common term of coverage is one year although term contracts freque ntly allow the policy owner to renew the policy for additional years of coverage as with all forms of life insurance the insurance company pays the specified death benefit if the insured dies during the period of coverage if the insured remains alive at the end of the policy term the owner of the policy or the designated beneficiaries has further economic claims against the life insurance company httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs3 the premium that the life insurance company establishes for term life insurance depends upon the actuarial probability that the insured will die during the period of coverage for example the premium for oneyear term insurance contract with death benefit of 100000 issued to 35y earold individual might be 200 among the most significant factors used in deter mining the probability of the insureds death are the insureds age current health and the insureds personal and family history of lifethreatening medical conditions in addition the life insurance premium incorporates amounts reflectin g the expenses that the lif insurance company expects to incur such as commissions payable to the life insurance agent and anticipated profit the linkage between the probability of the insureds death and the premium charged causes term insurance premiums to increase as the age of the insured increases employmentbased group term life insurance many individuals acquire term life insurance as an employme ntbased fringe benefit most often groupterm policy provides term insurance protection for all or large portion of the employees of an enterprise the employer may pay the entire premium for the employees coverage it is common re quirement however for the employees to pay portion of the premium to obtain life insurance protection the premium for life insurance prot ection provided under group policy is likely to differ from that charged for term life insurance policy issued to an individual for two reasons first the expe nses allocable to each insured are likely to be smaller in group policy second gr oup premiums generally do not reflect the insureds individual medical history rath er actuarial expecta tions of the groups mortality are used to establish the premiums for the group mortgage life insurance mortgage life insurance is form of term insurance in which the benefit payable upon the death of the insured decreases over time this type of insurance is used primarily to pay off mortgage loan secured by the residence of the insured in typical selfamortizing mortgage loan the initial monthly payments consist primarily of interest w ith relatively small amounts consisting of principal repaym ents in later years the amount of interest decreases and the principal repayments increase therefore in mortgage life insurance policy the decline in the death benefit matches the decline in the principal balance payable on the mortgage loan key person life insurance and business buysell agreements businesses purchase life insurance contract s for several different purposes first certain small businesses purchase key person life insurance to provide source of funds to pay for the services of replacement employees fo llowing the death of key employee for example member of family may provide important and perhaps unpaid services for the family business the proceeds of the key person life insurance enable the family business to continue in operation second businesses may purchase life insurance to provide sour ce of funds that will be used to purchase or buyout the ownership interest of deceased owner this type of life insurance is purchased when the owners of busine ss reach an agreement that the surviving owners of the business will purchase the inte rest of any deceased owner at specified price httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs4 cash value life insurance pure insurance protection combined with savings elements cash value life insurance is more co mplicated form of life insurance as with term insurance the life insurance co mpany becomes obligated to pay specified sum following the death of the insured also referred to as whole life insurance cash value life insurance remains in effect for many years the distinguishing feature of cash value life insurance is the presence of the contracts cash value which is the amount that the policy owner receives if th individual terminates the policy the accumulation of cash value reflects the existence of savings feature in this form of insurance the premium paid with respect to newly issued cash value life insurance contract exceeds the term insurance pre mium for given insured individual in effect the premium consists of the followi ng two components 1 charge equal to the cost of the insureds term insurance pr otection and 2 an amount that is added to the contracts cash value that can be analogized to deposit into an individuals savings account or mutual f und acc ount as shown in table 1 the life insurance company credits interest or other forms of investment income to the cash value in subsequent years although the amount credited to the cash value represents an economic form of income it is taxed in favorable manner as discussed below variations in th basic cash value life insurance design include universal life insurance variable life insurance single premium life insurance and secondtodie life insura nce in addition key person life insurance corporateowned life insurance coli and split dollar life insurance incorporate cash value life insurance into other financial arrangements traditional levelpremium and single premium policies level premium whole life insurance is the most traditional form of cash value life insurance in whole life insurance cont ract the life insurance company establishes fixed premium that remains in effect for the remainder of the insureds life the premium remains consta nt notwithstanding the increas ing actuarial likelihood of the insureds death consequently the nnual premium exceeds the cost of current insurance protection during the early years of the contract this excess serves as the basis for computing the policys cash value to illustrate the generation of cash value under level premium contract consider simplified hypothetical contr act with death benefit of 100000 issued to 35yearold individual the annual pr emium for this contract is 1300 during the first year the premium of 1300 is applie d to pay the cost of the current years insurance protec tion which is 200 the remaining 1100 might earn interest at 4 rate or 44 during the first year thereby building the cash value to 1144 the 44 of interest credited is commonly called the inside interest buildup of life insurance policy this oneyear illustration sets out the basic com ponents of all cash value life insurance policies the premium the charges imposed for current insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs5 2 life insurance companies also impose loading charges in connection with most cash value life insurance policies these charge s are designed to allow the life insurance company to recover its expenses incurred in connection with the contract including the selling agents commissions and to build in pr ofit factor the loading charges reduce the contracts cash value protection the interest cr edited and the cash value2 the precise relationship among these components depends however on the vel of current insurance charges the rate at which interest is credited and the pattern and magnitude of the premium payments for example decreases in th charges for current insurance protection cause the cash value and the interest credited thereon to increase similarly an increase in the rate of interest credited causes the cash value to increase at faster rate thereby decreasing the amount of and charges for current insurance protection at more rapid rate however the inter action of these factors particularly when more than one of them change makes it quite difficult to predict the net effect of the changes the investment orientation of life insurance contract depends on the amount of investment income credited to policys cash value relative to the cost of insurance protection during the years that the policy remains in effect the level premium policy represents one of the least investmentoriented cash value life insurance designs single premium life insurance represents the most investment oriented design in sing premium contract the cont ract owner pays one premium when the life insurance company issues th contract because further premiums are paid with respect to this contract the single premium is much larger than the level premiums discussed above to illustrate consid er 100000 singlepremium life insurance contract issued to the same 35 yearold individual di scussed above the single premium for this contract mig ht be 25000 the death benefit is 100000 in comparison to the levelpremium contract discussed previously in every year the singlepremium contract generates higher levels of cash value and credits more interest the larger cash values reduce th amount and the cost of current insurance protection the differences between the levelpremium contract and the singlepremium contract both having 100000 death benef it during the first year are illustrated as follows table 1 premium contracts level single premium premium contract contract yr 1 premium 1300 25000 cost of insurance protectiona 200 150 interest earned 44 994 closing cash value 1144 25834 yr 2 current insurance protection 98856 74166 as illustrated the cost of insurance protection under the single premium contract is less that than under the level premium contract since the current insurance protection of roughly 75000 is proportionately less than that under the level premium contracthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs6 universal life insurance universal life insurance is modern variant of the traditional cash value life insurance contract from marketing perspective universal life insurance incorporates two significant innovations greater flexibility and transparency in traditional cash value contract the financial terms are extraordinarily inflexible specifically the size and the timing of the premium payments are fixed and specified in the contract for many contracts traditional nonparticipating contracts the implicit rate of return on the cash value and the charges for current insurance protection are also fixed and the policy owner cannot change the contracts death benefit after the contract is issued the economic relationships implicit in traditional cash value life insurance are also incomprehensible to most consumers typically these contracts do not disclose in an understandable manner the amount of inte rest that the insurance company credits to the cash value and the level of charges for current insurance protection moreover the rate of interest implicitly credited in traditional cash value contracts credited was low in comparison to the rates available from competing investments during the late 1970s and 1980s universal life insurance was designed to overcome these shortcomings first it allows far greater degree of flexib ility than is permitte d under traditional cash value contracts initially the owner of universal life policy sets the size of the initial premium and the initial death benefit subsequently the policy owner has complete discretion to determine the timing and size of subsequent premium payments the policy owner also has the discretion to increase or decrease the death benefit as the need for insurance changes second universal life insurance provides much greater degree of transparency and disclosure the interrelationships existing between the financial components that were always inherent in traditional cash value life insurance contract are made explicit in universal life insurance contract specifically premium payments are added to the contracts cash value which in turn is reduced by charges for current insurance protection the re maining cash value earns interest unless additional premium payments are made insurance protection continues until the cash value is depleted universal life policy owner receives periodic statements summarizing these developments moreover the rate of interest credited is clearly stated and the charges for current insurance protection are made explicit additional investment choices variable life insurance and variable universal life variable life insurance was developed to expand the range of investment options fo r investments made in cash value life insurance in the traditional design the inves tment component of the cash value contract is analogous to certificate of deposit that bank issues the life insurance company credits interest to the cash value either at fixe d rate in nonparticipating contracts or athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs7 rates that vary based upon the discreti on of the life insurance company in participating contracts alternatively in variable life insu rance contract the investment component is analogous to an investment in one or more mutual funds when the owner of variable life insurance contract pays premium the life insurance company imposes charges for the current insurance protecti on and expenses the remaining amount is invested in pool of assets that are parate from the insure rs general investment assets as with shares of mutual f und the cash value will increase or decrease in proportion to changes in the value of the assets in the separate account consequently the cash value of variable life insurance contract can decrease if the value of the underlying pool of assets dec lines most life insurance companies offer investment options relating to range of funds including money market funds common stock funds and bond funds variable universal life insurance combines the investment flexibility of variable life insurance with the premium payment flexibility of universal life insurance overview of current tax treatment introduction the owners and beneficiaries of life insurance contracts are accorded favorable treatment under the internal revenue code specifically during the life of the insured the tax treatment of the interest or other investment income credited to the cash value of life insurance contracts diffe rs from the tax treatment of many other forms of interest in the following significant respects the income measurement rules cause portion of the interest credited to avoid taxation the interest is not taxed currently at minimum taxation isdeferred irc section 101 generally exclude s the remaining interest from gross income if the policy remain s in force until the death of the insured and unlike other taxpreferred forms of investment such as pension plans and iras dollar limits are imposed with respect to investments made in cash value life insurance each of these benefits is discussed below congress has enacted restrictions on the arrangements that receive this preferential tax treatment first contracts must satisfy the definition of life insurance contained in irc section 7702 s econd contracts that are classified under irc section 7702a as modified endowment c ontracts are taxed in less preferential fashion these limitations are also discussed below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs8 3 american council of life insurers 1999 life insurers fact book 1999 and acli product line report

committee on taxations web site httpfrwebgateaccessgpogovcgibingetdoccgidbname 2002_joint_committee_on_tax ationdocidf83132pdf compared to the impact of other tax ex penditures the exclusion of investment income on life insurance and annuity contracts is the 11th largest in terms of forgone revenue over the estimating period as re ported by the joint committee on taxation furthermore according to th american council of life insurers acli the number of permanent individual whole life polic ies has increased by 20 over the past four years from 109 million in 1998 to 131 million in 20013 irc section 72 cash value li fe insurance and the taxation of investment income during the insureds life one of the most significant benefits arising from the ownership of cash value life insurance relates to the timing of taxa tion if the policy owner allows the cash value to accumulate portion of the investment income credited to the cash value is included in gross income at minimum taxation is deferred unless and until the owner of the contract withdraws the cas h value by comparison interest credited to bank certificate of deposit or dividends reinvested with resp ect to either stock or mutual fund shares is taxed at the time it is credited on the other hand certain investments instruments such as pens ions 401ks and savings bonds do have investment buildup free of tax as disc ussed in section iv some question whether this favorable tax treatment of life insurance is justifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs9 4 irc section 163 authorizes deduction for ce rtain interest expenses taxpayers are allowed to deduct interest allocable to trad or business in addition interest paid in connection with the taxpayers investments or the taxpayers home mortgage are also deductible although subject to statutory limita tions other antiabuse provisions may limit these deductions irc section 72 governs the tax treatment of distributions made with respect to life insurance contracts under this provision further deferral results from the operation of stacking rule when policy owner receives cash from life insurance contract other th an modified endowment cont ract discussed below this stacking rule characterizes the distributi on as nontaxable return of the policy owners capital until the aggregate am ount received exceeds the policy owners investment in the contract as result taxation of the interest credited under cash value life insurance contract is defe rred until the policy owner converts their investment portion of the cash value into cash policy owner can extend the period of deferral and receive cash in excess of her investment without realizing any income by borrowing the cash value of the policy from the life insurance company all cash value policies include provision that gives the policy owner the right to borrow most of the policys cash value loans secured by life insurance contracts ther than modified endowment contracts are not treated as taxable di stributions for purposes of irc section 72 although the policy owner pays interest on policy loans the aftertax costs incurred are minimal in connection with this type of indebte dness for two reasons first the policy owners pretax cost of borrowing equals the difference between the interest payable on the loan and the interest credited to the allocable amount of cash value this difference typically is small second interest paid on the policy loan may be deductible4 however it should be noted that the pro ceeds of many other types of loans are generally not taxable one example to the contrary is loan taken from qualified retirement plan with certain exemptions relating to timing and use of the proceeds the proceeds from these loans may be considered distribution and included in an individuals taxable gross income the combined effect of the income deferral allowed under irc section 72 and the availability of nontaxable policy loans can often result in the interest credited under cash value life insurance other than modified endowment contracts not being taxed until the policy terminates irc section 101 exclusi on of the death benefit under irc section 101 life insurance c ontracts beneficiary may exclude from income amounts received under life insuran ce contract that are paid by reason of death of the insured this exclusion is extremely broad in sc ope it applies to amounts paid with respect to term life insurance amounts paid with respect to cash va lue life insurance including the accumulated and untaxed investment income credited to the contracts cash value andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs10 beneficiaries that are corporations partnerships trusts and the estate of the insured in addition to members of the insureds family from tax policy perspective the most significant consequence of this exclusion relates to the investment income previously credited to the cash value during the insureds life absent secti on 101 taxation of the investment income is deferred if the contract remains in force until the insureds death it becomes evident that taxation of the investment income is forgiven in response to the aids crisis congre ss expanded the scope of irc section 101 so that certain accelerated death benefits paid during the life of the insured are also excluded from income to qualify for this treatment the insured must be either terminally ill or chronically ill moreover the payments must be used to pay for longterm care of the insured that otherwis would not be covered by insurance irc section 79 provision of group term life insurance for employees many employees acquire life insurance protection as fringe benefit provided by their employers until 1964 the value of this employerp rovided benefit was treated as taxfree fringe benefit irc section 79 now limits the extent to which employerprovided group term life is tax free fringe benefit for an employee first the value of the first 50000 of employerprovided group term life insurance coverage is excluded from an employees income the value of this exclusion is quite modest for most em ployees the value of 50000 of term life insurance protection for most employees younger than age 50 is less than 100 per year the entire value of the life insuran ce protection provided to disabled retired employee is excluded from the exemployees income second the value of any add itional employerprovided gr oupterm life insurance protection is included in the em ployees income in general the amount included in income does not depend upon the actual value or cost of the insurance protection rather the taxabl benefit is computed using the rates specified in table i contained in section 1793d2 of the income tax regulations because these rates do not reflect the medical condition or gender of the employee the amount included in income may differ from the act ual value of the insurance protection irc section 7702 definition of life insurance for tax purposes the owner of life insurance contract is taxed in accordance with the provisions discussed above only if the contract comp lies with the statutory definition of life insurance contained in irc section 7702 th is provision denies the preferential tax treatment to arrangements that are overly investment oriented specifically the owner of contract that does not satisfy the requirements of irc section 7702 must include in gross income the sum of 1 the increase in the net surrender value during the year and 2 the cost of insurance pr otection provided during the year reduced by 3 the premiums paid during the year this approximates the amount of investmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs11 5 the guideline premium limitation is generally termined at the time the contract is issued and is computed under the provisions of i rc section 7702c includi ng the specified irs regulations of reasonable mortality chargesincome credited unde r the policy the amount paid on account of the insureds death in excess of the cash value is treated as proceeds of term life insurance policy and is therefore excluded from income irc section 7702 adopts two alternative actuarial sts to identify overly investmentoriented contracts 1 the cash value accumulation test and 2 the guideline premiumcash value corridor test these tests were designed to accommodate the principal models of life insurance sold in the market the cash value accumulation test reflects the stru cture of the traditional cash value life insurance contract which specifies fixed pattern of premium payments and fixed death benefit or death benefit determinable based on the accumulated cash value the guideline premium test reflects the distinguishing characteristics of the universal life insurance policy design life insurance contract satisfies the cash value accumulation test if under the terms of the contract the contracts cash value can never exceed the current net single premium for any specified age of the insured the net single premium is defined as the amount needed in present valu terms to generate the cash values and pay the mortality charges for the death benefit specified in the contract the cash value accumulation test denies life insurance status to contract that by its terms permits accumulation of any additional cash value the alternative test that contract may satisfy to qualify as life insurance for tax purposes is the guideline premiumcash value corridor test this alternative test incorporates two requirements first the cumulative dollar amount of premiums actually paid under the contract can ne ver exceed the guideline premium limitation5 second the ratio of the death benefit to the cash value of the policy cannot at any time fall below specified percentages the minimum amount of current insurance protection for given death benefit constitutes the cash value corridor irc section 7702a modified endowment contracts congress enacted irc section 7702a out of concern that investors were purchasing single premium life insurance as taxsheltered investment rather than for life insurance protection under this provision adverse tax consequences apply to life insurance contracts characterized as modified endowment contracts this characterization applies if the contract fails to satisfy the sevenpaytest under this test the premiums paid during the first seven years that the contract is in effect are compared to the premiums that would be required under hypothetical contract with the same death benefit in the hypotheti cal contract premiums would be payable on level basis for only seven years the cont ract is modified endowment contract if the premiums actually paid exceed the premiums that would be paid with respect to the hypothetical contract httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs12 if contract is characterized as m odified endowment contract withdrawals of cash from the contract are not taxed in the manner discussed above rather the distributions are taxed under irc section 72 in the same manner as distributions from deferred annuity c ontract consequently the stacking rule app licable to distributions is reversed amounts withdrawn from modified ndowment contract are first characterized as income rather th an as nontaxable return of the taxpayers investment in the contract policy loan is treated as taxable distribution rather than as anontaxable loan the portion of any distribution included in income is subject to anadditional 10 tax general tax policy issues exclusion of the death bene fit from income taxation the death benefits paid following the d eath of an insured have been excluded from taxation since the enactment of the income tax in 1913 economically the death benefit is attributable to the following three sources the portion of the premiums paid that exceeds charges for current insurance protection and other expe nses and was added to the cash value during the insureds life the investment income credited to the cash value during theinsureds life and the term insurance protection provi ded under the contract at the time of the insureds death following is an evaluation of the inco tax exclusion of the death benefit considering each of these three sources of the death benefit to the extent that the death benefit is attributable to the premiums paid during the insureds life the death benefit represents transfer of property that takes effect upon the insureds death consequently th is portion of the death benefit is quite similar to property passing to the beneficiar ies of deceased individuals will under the internal revenue code property received as bequests is not subject to the income tax in terms of the investment income credited to the cash value during the insureds life the taxfree treatment to beneficiarie s has some similarities with the transfer of other assets if the life insurance contr act is surrendered prior to death amounts in excess of the premiums paid for the insurance are included in gross income if the contract is held until the death of the insured the investment buildup is not included in gross income for the beneficiary cons istent with this trea tment under current law through 2009 the basis for an assets value tr ansferred to beneficiary is the assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs13 6 this stepup basis for inherited assets will be replaced with modified carryover basis in 2010 as result of the repeal of the estate tax included in pl 10716 egtrra for more information on the taxation of estates see crs report rl31061 estate and gift tax law changes under the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 by nonna notofair market value at the time of death not the value at the time the asset was acquired6 the portion of the death benefit attribut able to the term insurance protection provided at the time of the insureds death represents an accretion to wealth the internal revenue code treats similar types of income in somewhat inconsistent manner for instance amounts that an individual receives under an accident or health insurance policy purchased by the insured is excluded from income one rationale for this result is that in aggregate income is generated with respect to term insurance the economic gain that the beneficiaries of life or health insurance realize is offset by the economic loss incurred by policy owners who purchase insurance and receive nothing as an example to the contrary gambling winnings are treated as income for purposes of the income tax despite that fact that in aggregate gambling winnings are offset by gambling losses on the individual level however taxpayer is allowed to subtract any wagering losses from any gains to determine her tax liability two additional universal ju stifications for excluding the death benefit may be historic one plausible rationale might ve been that it was undesirable to impose tax on widows and orphans who received lif insurance proceeds which were often modest in magnitude and represented the principal financial asset available to the insureds survivors another possible ra tionale might originate from the view that the accumulation of wealth and its passage to heirs is viewed by some as benefit to society taxation of investment earnings credited to cash value life insurance the tax treatment of investments made in the form of cash value life insurance stands in contrast to the treatment of some other financial investments the interest or other investment income credited to life insurance contracts is not taxed until and unless cash or other property is dist ributed to the policy owner prior to the death of the insured current interest income however generally is included in income for taxation purposes presently although congress has enacted tax preferred savings vehicles ch as qualified pension plans 401 k plans iras and section 529 plans to encourage savings to pay for retirement and college tuition as discussed below these arrangements ar subject to numerous requirements and limitations consequently some question the justification for treating interest credited under life insurance contract differently from both taxable and tax preferred forms of income from savings alternatively investment gains from other forms of appreciating assets are not taxed until those gains are realized examples of this tax treatment include capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs14 7 us senate committee on the budget united states senate tax expenditures compendium of background mate rial on indivi dual provisions 107th cong 2nd sess washington dec 2002 8 interest income paid with respect to state and local bonds is exempt from federal income taxation this exemption is designed to reduc the borrowing cost of the bond issuers rather than benefit the investors who purchase the bonds for this reason it may not be comparable to the tax provisions that primarily benefit investorsgains from the investment in equities or real property further even at the time these investment gains are realized they are subject to lower tax rates than other forms of income the nontaxable status of the investment earnings or inside buildup dates back to 1913 although this provision wa s not explicitly included in law floor discussions of the bill made it clear that the investment earnings were not taxable7 supporters of the current income tax tr eatment of investme nt income credited to life insurance contracts have advanced several rationales the first two focus on the fundamental tax policy issue whether the current exclusion of this investment income is justified the third considers subsidiary tax policy issue the limits on investment oriented uses of life insu rance contained in irc sections 7702 and 7702a treatment of life insurance compared to other taxpreferred forms of savings the broadest exceptions to the general tax treatment of interest income involve inte rest income credited to qualif ied pension plans including 401k plans individual retirement accounts iras deferred nnuities and section 529 educational savings plans8 some who endorse the pr eferential tax treatment of investment income generated in cash value life insurance assert that this income should be taxed in the same manner as these other tax preferred savings vehicles there are significant differences howev er between inves tments made using cash value life insurance and the other taxpr eferred forms of investment first the favorable tax rules applicable to other sa vings vehicles were enacted to encourage individuals to save to meet specific financial goals for example the tax rules governing qualified pension plans and iras are designed to encourage savings to meet the needs of individuals during their retirement years similarly the section 529 plans encourage individuals to save in order to pay for their childrens higher education expenses in both of these rrangements laws limit the dollar amounts that can be invested to meet these needs unlike these identified investment vehicles individuals invest in cash value life insurance for many different purposes fo r example many indi viduals purchase cash value life insurance to provide replacement for the insureds wage income to support the insureds spouse and young childre n in the event of the insureds death others purchase cash value life insurance as means of transferring assets out of their estates to reduce estate tax liability similarly corporations purchase cash value life insurance to generate funds to protect against the financial loss associated withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs15 9 beginning in 2002 the maximum annual benefit under qualified pension plan was 160000

compensation packages for executives term insurance on the other hand offe rs tax benefits although providing tax preferences to life insurance products may encourage parents to purchase life insurance protection for their dependents or companies to effectively plan for future liabilities the existing tax incentives may not always achieve these results if this individual replaces term life insurance contract with cash value life insurance the individual may obtain less insurance protec tion the premium charged for level premium cash value life insurance contract is generally much larger than the initial premium for term contract with an identi cal death benefit unless the individual increases the amount spent for life insuran ce the amount of insurance protection will decline thus in terms of tax incentives current law may encourage some families to reduce rather than increase the fina ncial protection of th eir dependent children further the largest tax benefits are availa ble to taxpayers who can afford to purchase the more investmentoriented cash value life insurance contracts although they arguably may have less need for life insuran ce protection this of course is true for many other taxpreferre d forms of investment some argue that cash value life insurance is used to generate funds that serve as source of retirement income for the policy owner the perceived need to encourage savings for retirement also unde rlies the preferentia l tax treatment of qualified pension plans however if an individual covered by qualified pension plan seeks to save additional amounts for retirement these benefits are subject to very strict limitations9 to the extent that the current tax treatment of cash value life insurance is viewed as source for and is integrated with postretirement savings critics might argue the premiums payable should be subject to limitations comparable to and integrated with those im posed on individual retirement accounts10 taxation of interest credited u nder life insurance contract tax on unrealized appreciation supporters of the cu rrent tax treatment of cash value life insurance argue that th increase in the cash value represents unrealized appreciation and the interest credited should not be subject to tax until the gain is realized unrealized appreciation generally represents changes in the value of an asset caused by market forces in an economic sense appreciation in an assets value constitutes income whether or not the asset is sold under the current income tax however changes in the market value of assets are not taxed until realized through sale or other taxable disposition for example an investor owning real estate or stock is not taxed on any appreciation in value of these assets until the gain is realized httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs16 amounts that represent compensation paid for the use of an asset such as interest are generally taxed when credited to the taxpayers account an individual who invests in certificate of deposit is taxed when interest is credited notwithstanding the fact that the intere st may remain on depos it with the bank in other situations property owners are taxed on investment income that is not received partners in partnership and shareholders of s corporations are taxed currently on their shares of income earned and retained by the business entity similarly interest accruing on debt instruments having origin issue discount is included in income despite the absence of sa of the instrument the cash value of life insurance contract is financial asset the owner of the contract receives compensation for the life insurance companys use of the policys cash value when the company credits interest to the cash value as presented above the lack of actual receipt of the interest may or may not justify postponement of the interest credited to cash value of life insurance contracts congress has deemed that the interest income should not be consid ered the policyholders income since the owner would have to forgo insuran ce protection to obtain the interest current limits on the use of life insurance as an investment vehicle supporters of the status quo with re gard to the taxation of cash value life insurance state that congress dealt with inappropriate uses of life insurance when it enacted irc sections 7702 nd 7702a as disc ussed below these two statutory provisions create actuarial limitations on the use of cash value life insurance in general these provisions comp are the amount of term life insurance protection to the investment components of life insurance cont ract if in relative terms the term life insurance protection is too small these provisions limit or eliminate the tax preference critics argue that unlike the limitations applicable to iras and pension plans however irc sections 7702 and 7702a do not limit the amounts that can be invested in cash value life insurance nor say opponents do these provisions limit the uses to which the investment returns can be expended unlike the limitations applicable to section 529 plans the following discussion of irc s ections 7702 and 7702a evaluates the limitations currently imposed by congress the section 7702 limitations congress enacted irc sections 7702 and 7702a in response to the marketing of life insurance contracts that provided minimal amounts of current insurance protection irc section 7702s definition of life insurance was designed to deny life insurance status to overly investmentoriented products without altering the preferential tax treatment for traditional uses of cash value life insurance to achieve this result irc section 7702 uses the single premium contract design as the maximum limit of investment orientation life insurance performs unique risk shifting function most directly it can provide resources to replace the insureds income following the death of the insured parents of dependent childre n are often concerned that the death of one or both parents would leave their children without adequate means of support many argue that society should encourage parents to pr ovide the resources to take care of their dependent children in the event of their death httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs17 11 portion of preretiremen t distribution from qualified pension plan is included in income and is subject to the 10 additional tax in general loans from qualified pension plans are also included in income when rece ived irc section 72p2 however treats certain loans totaling not more than 50000 as nontaxable loans given this specific rationale for favorable tax treatment these limitations seem appropriate if the tax re venue forgone generates an adequate amount of pure insurance protection from this perspec tive the tax revenue that the treasury forgoes as result of not taxing the inte rest income credited should not exceed the cost of current insurance protection pr ovided otherwise it arguably would be cheaper for the government to provide th insurance without charge to families with young dependent children consider the 100000 singlepremium life in surance contract discussed above the single premium for this contract is 25000 as explained previously during the first year that the contract is in effect the life insurance company credits interest of 994 and the charge for pure insurance prot ection totals 150 for many subsequent years the interest credited will greatly exceed the charges imposed for current insurance protection for number of year s the tax revenue forgone due not taxing the interest credited under single premium policy exceeds the cost that the government would incur if it purchased the insurance protection and provided it to the policy owner without charge this suggests that irc section 7702 tr eats arrangements that generate substantial amount of investment income relative to the insurance protection obtained as life insurance this illustration ma raise questions about limitations contained in irc section 7702 and suggest broader analysis of the benefits and costs of providing life insurance pr otection would be useful the irc section 7702a limitati ons modified endowment contracts as discussed previously i rc section 7702a characterizes life insurance contracts as modified endowment contracts if the premiums paid exceed the premiums that would have been pa id under hypothetical seven premium contract the tax treatment of distribu tions from modified endowment contracts differs from the treatment of distributi ons from other life insurance contracts specifically 1 amounts withdrawn from m odified endowment c ontract are first characterized as income rather than as nontaxable return of the taxpayers investment 2 policy loans are treated as taxable distributions rather than as nontaxable loans and 3 the amount included in income is subject to an additional 10 tax in effect distributions from modifi ed endowment contracts are treated identically to distributions from other tax preferred savings vehicles such as iras and annuities the distribution rules are also similar to the rules applicable to pre retirement distributions fro m qualified pension plans11 when taxpayer withdraws money from these taxpreferred savings vehicles prior to retirement some argue it demonstrates that the policy justification for the preferential tax treatment longer exists to the extent that the distributions represent previously untaxed income congress has decided to require immediate taxation in addition it imposed the

coli is an arrangement in which business purchases life insurance contracts on the life of one or more of its employees traditionally life insurance utilized as pa rt of coli arrangement was purchased on the life of the business top executives and owners also known as key person insurance these life insurance arrangements generally insured the life of small number of employees in recent years however large corporations have purchased life insurance contracts that insure the lives of large num bers of their employees reports in the wall street journal and other newspapers referred to these arrangements as janitors insurance according to these reports some employees were not notified that their employer had purchased life insurance on their lives13 when the insured employees died the employers did not pay the proceeds from the life insurance to the employees surviving family members or other designated beneficiaries rather consistent with the typical coli arrangement the employer is the beneficiary of the contract consequently the employers receive the proceeds of the policies for their use it is frequently claimed that the employers use the life insurance proceeds to pay for employee benefits including health insurance for retired employees of the company14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs19 15 recently the wall street journal reported that large corporations are purchasing cash value life insurance contracts w ith the intent of donating the proceeds of the contracts to charity it is claimed that the tax benefits are sufficient to generate the contributions to charity at net cost to the corporations t francis and schultz dying to donate charities invest in death benefits the wall street journal feb 6 2003 two distinct tax policy issues arise in connection with coli arrangements under current law the investment income that corporation earns in connection with coli arrangement is not taxed if it is pa id to the employer on account of the death of the insured the first tax policy question is whether it is appropriate that corporation can benefit from these arrangements one of the main justifications for the exclusion of investment income from taxation is to provide the insureds family with life insurance proceeds to replace the income that the insured would have earned if she had survived some would argue therefore that the life insurance proceeds that corporation receives should be free of tax only if the employer distributes the proceeds to the employees family or other designated beneficiar others would point out that corporations have been allowed to shelter income in insurance policies for years in many circumstances however corporations purchase life insurance to obtain taxfree investment return rather than making the proceeds available to the employees family to replace the employ ees income the corporations use the proceeds to meet their general business needs including the payment of benefits to other employees15 in these circumstances the policy justification for exempting the life insurance proceeds from taxation is unclear the second and distinct tax policy issue arises in connection with what has been termed leveraged coli arrangements in leveraged coli arrangement the corporate owner of the life insurance contr act borrows to pay substantial portion of the insurance premiums this is form of tax arbitrage in which taxpayer incurs tax deductible interest while earning taxfree investment returns the combined effect of this arrangement is similar to many other corporate tax shelters the tax savings may exceed the costs incurred in paying for the life insurance the economics of leveraged coli arrangement can be illustrated by examining the facts of winndixie stores inc v commissioner 113 tc 254 1999 affd 254 f3d 1313 11th cir 2001 in this case it was projected that the taxpayer would purchase life insurance on the lives of 38000 of its employees in the first year of this arrangement it was projected that the taxpayer would pay aggregate premiums of 114 million the cash values fo r the life insurance policies would total approximately 120 million at the end of the fi rst year the taxpayer would take out loans from the policies in the aggreg ate amount of almost 108 million and the taxpayer would pay interest of approx imately 12 million on these loans after taking into account the projected net 2 million payable to the company as result of deaths of its employees the taxpayer was projected to incur pretax loss of more than 4 million after taking into account the purported tax benefits arising from these transactions however the taxpayer was projected to realize slight aftertax profithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs20 the difference between the pretax loss and the after tax profit was attributable to the following two factors 1 the tax savings arising from the deduction of the interest and fees and 2 the nontaxable nature of the loan proceeds and the death benefits in subsequent years the taxpayer was projected to realize much larger pretax losses and aftertax profits during the peri od from 19932 052 it wa s projected that the taxpayer would realize aftertax earning s in excess of 22 billion while incurring pretax losses aggregating more than 750 million the tax court concluded that this arra ngement was sham transaction under the sham transaction doctrine tax benefits are disallowed if the transaction lacks economic effects or substance other than the generation of tax benefits as consequence the court determined that the taxpayer was not entitled to the claimed tax benefits the life insurance industry asserts that any unjustified tax be nefits arising from the use of corporateowned life insurance were fully addressed in legislative changes enacted in 1996 and 1997 these changes limited the interest deduction allowed in connection with certain coli arrangements first irc section 264e establishes limits on the amount of deductible interest paid with respect to life insurance contracts insuring the lives of corporate employees this provision limits the deductible interest in an indirect mannerit specifies that deductions are allowed only on interest paid on limited amount of indebtedness incurred with respect to life insurance contracts specifically the maximum amount of indebtedness that may give rise to deductible interest is limited to 50000 per insured key person and at most 20 insured individuals ar characterized as key persons under this provision at most 1000000 of indebtedness could give rise to deductible interest payments this limitation would eliminate most of the tax benefits claimed in connection with transactions structured in the same manner as the transaction in the winndixie stores case discussed above specifically this provision limits tax benefits arising under those coli arrangements in which the corporate owner of the life insurance contract s uses the contracts as security for the loans this limitation however appears limited to interest arising under life insurance policy loans if taxpayer borrows from other unrelated sources it is possible that this limitation would not apply in 1997 congress expanded the limitations contained in irc section 264e the popular press reported that the federa l national mortgage association fannie mae planned to enter into coli arrangement covering the lives of the individuals who had borrowed money to purchase homes to address this situation congress enacted irc section 264f this provision disallows portion of corporations interest deduction the ma gnitude of the disallowance depends upon the aggregate cash value of the corporations life insurance contracts and the aggregate adjusted basis of its other assets for example consider bank that owns life insurance contracts with an aggregate cash value of 1 billion and assets with an aggregatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs21 16 rollcall vote 175 leg to amendment numbered 662 congressional record may 15 2003 p s6441 basis of 10 billion the unborrowed cash valu represents 10 of the banks assets consequently irc section 264f disallows 10 of the banks interest expense it is likely that this provision achieves its goal to eliminate the tax benefits of bankowned life insurance boli arrangements in which financial institutions purchase life insurance contracts on the lives of individuals who borrow from the bank by its terms however this intere st disallowance provision does not apply to coli arrangements that involve individual life insurance contracts on the lives of corporations officers direct ors employees and certain sh areholders consequently unless the interest is treated as incurred with respect to life insurance contracts corporation would not lose its interest deduction when it continues to borrow funds other than policy loans at the same time that it pays the life insurance premiums on the lives of its employees in the 108th congress there have been number of attempts to impose restrictions on corporateowned life insurance or remove tax advantages representative gene green introduced hr 414 life insurance employee notification act which would require that employers who purchase corporateowned life insurance notify the covered employee of the policy representative rahm emanuel introduced hr 2127 which would re peal the taxfree treatment of death benefits for certain coli policies as well as require disclosure to and provide objection rights for employees upon whom insu rance contracts are purchased in the senate senator john edwards offered an amendment to the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation ac t of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 that would have similarly eliminated the exclusions of death benefits from income tax for many coli policies the amendment was ruled not germane pursu ant to the congressional budget act of 197416httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs22 17 the term

employee will become entitled to receive the money or property years later most often these arrangements benefit senior executives and other highly compensated employees there are two essential characteristics of nonqualified deferred compensati on first these arrangements do not satisfy the requirements of qualified retirement plans s uch as pension plans 401k salary reduction plans 403b plans for employees of nonpr ofit organizations or individual retirement accounts second taxation of the employees is deferred until some future year 18 tracie rozhon and joseph b treaster insur ance

compensatory arrangements for corporate executives and other tax planning goals introduction the structure of split dollar arrangements recently split dollar life insurance has received great deal of attention corporations and highly compensated executives have utilized this arrangement as form of nonqualified deferred compensation17 according to the press the cash value on split dollar life insurance arrangement for one corporate executive will total 18 million while anothe r corporation reportedly paid 3 million per year on premiums under split dollar arrangement18 parents or grandparents have used split dollar life insurance to transfer wealth to their children or grandchilren the press has reported arrangements in which wealthy individuals have utilized split dollar life insurance to transfer wealth to their children and grandchildren while purporting to avoid both the gi ft tax and the estate tax19 split dollar life insurance is not speci type of life insurance contract rather it describes an arrangement in which several parties split the beneficial interest in the economic rights arising under cash value life insurance contract when an employer uses split dollar life in surance as form of compensation it will pay most or all of the premiums in addition the employer is titled to r eceive portion of the death benefit paid fo llowing the death of the insured in traditional split dollar arrangement the employer is not obligated to pay the entire premium rather its obligation is limited to the anticipated increase in the life insurance contracts cash value the employee is obligated to pay the remaining portion of the premium under the economic s of typical cash value life insurance contract used in split dollar arrangements the employees share of the premiums declines rapidly and frequently disappears within few years in this traditional arrangement the employer is entitled to receive the greater of 1 the cash value of the contract or 2 the aggregate amount of premiums that it paid the remainder of the death benefit is paid to the beneficiary that the executive designates in effect the employee enjoys the benefit of term insura nce protection for the remainder of his lifehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs23 for example the annual premium on po licy with death benefit of 1 million may be 20000 per year if the executive dies during the 10th year in which the policy is in effect the employer would receive 200000 and the executives beneficiary would receive the remain ing portion of the death benefit 800000 the employer receives payment such as interest to compensate it for the premium payments the economic rights and obligations in split dollar arrangement are incorporated into an agreement between the parties the agreement will specify which party is designated as the legal owner of the life insurance contract if the agreement designates the employer as the owner of the life insurance contract the life insurance contract will contain provisi on called an endorsement which specifies the rights of the employee to proceeds from the contract this type of split dollar arrangement is called an endorse ment method arrangement alternatively the parties may agr ee that the employee will own the life insurance contract in this case the life in surance contract is used as collateral for the employers right to recei ve an amount equal to the aggregate amount of premiums paid this type of split dollar arrangement is called collateral assignment arrangement under many of the contemporary or equity split dollar arrangements employers or wealthy older relatives pay all of the premiums and the executives or younger relatives become titled to substantial portion of the contracts cash values in cases reported in the press certain executives become entitled to millions of dollars of cash value because the ex ecutives rights with respect to the cash values are attributable exclusively to premium payments made by their employers the arrangements have the same effect as other deferred compensation arrangements similarly under split dollar arrangements utilized by families younger relatives become entitled to millions of dollars of cash value that is attributable to premiums that their wealthier relatives paid consequently these arrangements produce the same economic results as intervivos gifts the remainder of this report discusses the tax treatment of split dollar arrangements first the tax treatment of the classic or traditional split dollar arrangement is summarized second the deve lopments that led the internal revenue service and the department of the treasury to reconsider the early analysis is reviewed third recent internal revenue service irs guidance on the taxation of these arrangements is discussed the tax treatment of split dollar arrangements early irs analysis of traditional or classic arrangements t h internal revenue service pub lished revenue rulings that for many years governed the tax treatment of split dollar arrangements initially the irs characterized the employers premium payments as interest free loans from the employer to the employee at that time an interestfree an from an employer to an employee did not create any taxable compensation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs24 in 1964 the service revoked this interp retation and issued revenue ruling 64 328 which governed the treatment of split dollar arrangements for the next three decades in this ruling the service reasoned that the employer provided the funds n eeded to generate the cash value of the life insurance contract in an arms length arrangement the employer would enjoy thebenefit of the earnings on the cash value the investment earnings that the cash value generates are applied toprovide current life insurance pr otection without cost to the employee the net effect of this arrangement was that the investment earnings or portion of the employers premium payment wa s used to provide term life insurance protection for the employee the irs c oncluded that the use of the employers investment income or premium payments to provide the insurance protection created additional compensation each year the amount of income equals the value of the current life insurance protection provided under the split dollar arrangement during the year reduced by any amount that the employee paid for this insurance in addition the service stated that taxpay ers could use the insurance rates set out in published table of term insurance rates the ps 58 rate tabl to determine the value of the life insurance protection in later ruling the service determined that taxpayers could value the cost of current life insurance protection using the actual cost of 1year term life insurance charged by the issuer of the split dollar life insurance contract if these rates were available to all standard risks under revenue ruling 64 328 the em ployees received only one economic benefit the executives enjoyed term life in surance protection without paying the full cost of this protection also under the sa ruling the executives had to treat the value of this benefit as additional ta xable compensation moreover the methods used to value this benefit incorporat ed an objective methodology that in most instances reached reasonable results concerns leading to reconsideration in 2001 and 2002 the department of the treasury and the irs rec onsidered the tax treatment of split dollar life insurance arrangements to reflect at least four significant developments that either occurred or became more significant in the years subsequent to the issuance of the original revenue rulings development of equity split dollar arrangements the first and most significant development was that split dollar arrangements were marketed incorporating significantly different economic terms unlike the traditional split dollar arrangement in which an employee enjo ys only the benefit of current term life insurance protection an equity split dollar arrangement ge nerates additional economic benefits for the employee specifically under an equity split dollar arrangement the cash value of the life insurance contract is also split between the employer and the employee when the rrangement terminates either on account of the death of the employee or by agreemen t the employer receives an amount equal to the aggregate amount of premiums that it has paid when the life insurance contracts cash value exceeds the aggregate premiums paid this equity in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs25 contract belongs to the employee this quity represents vested economic benefit accruing to the employee which was generated by the employers premium payments the following example illustrates the ec onomic benefits arising from an equity split dollar arrangement corporation and its chief executive officer p enter into the following agreement p will own the life insu rance contract with death benefit of 1 million each year corporation will pay premium of 20000 executive p does not make any premium payment upon the death of executive p corporation is entitled to receive the cumulative amount of premiums th at it paid with respect to this contract executive p or the beneficiary that executive p designates receivesthe remainder of the 1 million death benefit if the life insurance contract terminates or is transferred to executivep corporation is also entitled to receive the aggregate amount of premiums that it paid with respect to this contract executive p keeps the remaining cash value if the contract is terminated as with the other types of split dollar life insurance arrangements executive p receives the benefit of the current life in surance protection and the value of this protection is included in ps income for ta x purposes in addition to the extent that the life insurance contracts cash value exceeds the cumulative premiums paid executive p enjoys an additional economic benefit to illustrate assume that the cash value of the contract at the end of the first year equals 21000 because corporation is entitled to receive the 20000 that it paid as the premium executive p has vested ownership rights w ith respect to the remaining 1000 of cash value assume further that the cash va lue equals 45000 at the end of the second year again corporation is entitled to receive the 40000 that it paid as premiums during the two years that the contract is in effect consequently executive ps has vested ownership rights with respect to 5000 of the cash value enactment of irc sections 83 and 7872 and their application to equity split dollar arrangements subsequent to the issuance of revenue ruling 64328 congress enacted irc sections 83 and 7872 these provisions establish statutory rules that apply to deferred compensation arrangements and interestfree loans as discussed below application of these statutory provisions result in an employee having more income arising from her interest in an equity split dollar arrangement than under trad itional split dollar arrangement irc section 83 applies when cash or prope rty is transferred by an employer in connection with the performance of services by an employee the property need not be transferred to the employee if it is tr ansferred to third party the employee has income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the such property minus the amount if any that the em ployee pays for such propertyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs26 under irc section 83 the employee has inco when and only to the extent that the employee acquires nonforfeitabl rights to the property irc section 83 applies in different manner to traditional and equity split dollar arrangements the only nonforfeitable ri ght that an employee acquires in traditional split dollar arrangement is the right to term insurance protection consequently under irc section 83 an em ployee would be required to include in income the fair market value of this prot ection this is also the tax treatment that revenue ruling 64328 ma ndates in an equity split dollar arrangement however the employee also acquires nonforfeitable right to an increased portion of the life insurance contracts cash value under section 83 the employee could be required to include both the value of the term insurance protection and the increase in the employees share of the cash value congress enacted comprehensive statutory rules governing the federal income tax consequences resulting from the creati on of interestfree loans when it enacted irc section 7872 in 1984 prior to the actment of irc section 7872 taxpayers utilized interestfree loans to transfer economic benefits to employees or family members while avoiding in come and transfer taxes under irc section 7872 taxpayer who lends money on an interestfr ee basis may be treated as having paid compensation or having made gift the following two examples illustrate how irc section 7872 operates example 1 corporation lends 1 million to an executive which is repayable in 10 years assume furt her that the present value of the amount that the executive must repay equals 600000 if interest is payable on this loan under irc section 7872 the executive is treated as having 400000 of compen sation when this interest free loan is created example 2 corporation lends 2 million to an executive that is repayable whenever corporation requests repayment ie the loan is repayable on demand assu further that interest is payable on this loan under irc section 7872 the executive is treated as having income from compensation each year the amount of income equals the amount of fo rgone interest on this loan which in this case would equal the outstanding balance on the loan 2 million multiplied by the applicable federal rate for irc section 7872 to apply to split dolla r arrangements there has to be loan and forgone interest in certain split dollar arrangements 1 the employee is treated as the owner of the life insurance contract 2 the employer pays the premiums and 3 under the terms of the arrangement th total amount of premiums paid must be repaid to the employer one characterization of the arrangement that comports with the economic terms is that the employers payment of each premium constitutes loan to the employee under irc s ection 7872 the forgone interest would be taxed as compensation paid to the employee in the traditional split dollar arrangement the employer is entitled to all increases in the life insurance contracts cash value portion of the interest that the cash value generates is credited to andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs27 20 us department of the treasury internal revenue service internal revenue bulletin bulletin 20015 jan 29 2001 p 461 21 us department of the treasury internal revenue service internal revenue bulletin bulletin 20015 jan 29 2001 p 460increases the life insurance contracts cash value the remainder of the interest earned is used to pay for the co st of term insurance protection the portion of the interest that increases the cash value accrues to the benefit of the employerlender consequently irc section 7872 would not treat this portion as forgone interest the remaining interest ie that portion that is used to pay for the cost of current insurance protection would be characterized as forgone interest for purposes of irc section 7872 and theref ore treated as taxable compensation as is evident the amount of income ge nerated under revenue ruling 64328 and irc section 7872 is approximately equal in both cases the amount of compensation approximates the cost of the annua l term life insurance protection once again different tax consequences result when equity split dollar arrangements are analyzed in an equity split dollar arrangement the employer is not entitled to receive the entire cash value ra ther it has the right to receive lesser amount the aggregate amount of premiums th at it paid with respect to the contract in this case all of the interest credited to the cash value accrues to the benefit of the employee under irc section 7872 this larger amount of interest is characterized as forgone interest as result the employee realizes more income than is generated under revenue ruling 64328 in sum in equity split dollar rrangements under revenue ruling 64328 employees have economic income arising from their employment relationship that avoids tax if section 83 and sec tion 7872 properly apply to these newer arrangements then the employee woul d have additional taxable income use of improper valuation methods two concerns with the methodology used to value current insurance protection also led the irs to reconsider the tax treatment of split dollar arrangements first taxpayers could value life insurance protection using the actual cost of oneyear term life insurance charged by the issuer of the life insurance contract if these rates were available to all applicants for life insurance who qualified as standard risks in recent years the irs learned that some life insurance companies claimed that low term insurance rates were available when in fact these rates were not available to all standard risks20 consequently some taxpayers may have unde rstated the value of the current insurance protection provided to employees under split dollar arrangements second the mortality tables upon which th term insurance charges within ps 58 are based longer relate to the present market for term insurance21 as result the term insurance charges set forth in the ps 58 rate table overstate the actual value of term insurance protection for most taxp ayers consequently taxpayers who used this table to value the current life insu rance protection provi ded under split dollar arrangement generally included an excessive amount in income httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs28 further product development reverse split dollar arrangements the fourth development results from the use of the ps 58 term insurance rate table to create problematic taxavoidance vehicle the socalled reverse split dollar arrangement in reverse split dollar arrangement the parties reverse the traditional allocation of interests in cash value life insurance contract as with conventional sp lit dollar arrangement the employer pays the premium unlike the conventional arrangements th employee becomes entitled to the cash value of the life insurance contract the employer receives the remainder of the death benefit employers computed the employ ees compensatory economic benefit in an indirect manner the employer compared the employers premium payment to the value of current life insurance protection that it retained in making this comparison taxpayers utilized the ps 58 rate table thereby overstating the value of the benefits allocable to the employer as result taxpayers have claimed that the premium payment produces little or benefit to the employee the following example illustrates the claimed benefits arising from reverse equity split dollar arrangement corporation c and its chief executive officer enter into the following agreement executive will own the life insurance contract with death benefit of 10 million each year corporation c will pay premium of 200000executive does not make any premium payment if the life insurance contract terminates or is transferred to executivee or his designate executive is entitled to receive the aggregate amount of premiums that corpora tion c paid with respect to this contract upon the death of executive ex ecutive or the beneficiary that executive designates is entitled to receive the cumulative amount of premiums that the employer paid with respect to this contract corporation c receives the re mainder of the 10 million death benefit the actual cost of term insurance protection charged by the life insurance company in connection with this arrangement mig ht be 60000 using the rates specified in the ps 58 rate table however the valu of the term insurance protection may exceed the 200 000 nnual premium taxpayers claimed that corporation c received an economic benefit at least equal to the premium that it paid based on this conclusion taxpayers claimed that executive did not have any income despite the fact that executive had vested rights to the cash value plus all interest credited to the cash value taxpayers also utilized reverse split dollar arrangements as device to transfer wealth from parents or gra ndparents to children or gr andchildren while purporting to avoid estate and gift tax the parent pays the entire premium the child becomes entitled to the life insurance contracts cash value the parent is entitled to the remainder of the death benefit in this transaction the parent makes gift to the child for gift tax purposes there is gift to the extent that the parent receives value as result of making the premium payment again some taxpayers computed the value of the current life insurance prot ection utilizing the ps 58 rates becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs29 22 us department of the treasury internal revenue service splitdollar life insurance arrangements federal register vol 67 131 july 9 2002 p 45414 23 these proposed regulations would also gove rn the tax consequences arising from split dollar arrangements involving corporations and their shareholders and wealthy individuals and their relations in these arrangements the ownership of the life insurance contract determines which approach to taxation will apply these rates overstate the fair market value of the current life insurance protection taxpayers have understated th magnitude of the gift recent irs guidance on taxation of split dollar arrangements in 2001 and 2002 the irs issued proposed regulati ons and several notices that address the tax treatment of split dollar life insura nce in these proposed regulations and notices the irs addressed the developmen ts discussed above under the proposed regulations22 the tax treatment of split dolla r arrangements will depend on the identity of the owner of the life insurance contract if the employer is the owner of split dollar life insurance contract then the employee is taxed on all of the economic benefits provi ded to her under the arrangement if however the employee is the owner of the contract the employers premium payments are characterized under irc section 7872 which governs the tax treatment of interestfree loans23 the following examples illustrate how the proposed regulations would apply in several basic types of split dollar arrangements each example discusses split dollar arrangement that incorporates the follow common terms corporation c and executive enter into an agreement that specifies their rights with respect to life insurance contract the death benefit of the life insurance contract is 3000000 corporation c pays the tire annual premium of 100000 executive does not make any premium payment corporation c will receive an am ount equal to the total amount of premiums paid thus if executive dies at the end of his life expectancy of 15 years corporation will receive 1500000 if the life insurance contract terminates or is transferred to executivee or his designate corporation c is also entitled to r eceive the aggregate amount of premiums that it paid with respect to this contract the remainder of the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiariesthat executive designates example 1 employee ownership of life insurance contract in addition to the common terms discussed above executive is designated as the owner of the life insurance contract the proposed regulations characterize each premium payment as an interestfree loan made from corporation c to executive in effect irc section 7872 would bifur cate this 100000 loan into two components first the present value of executive s obligation to repay 100000 at the end of the 15year period is treated as bona fi loan second the remainder of the 100000 payment is treated as compensation paid by corporation c to executive ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs30 assuming that the computation of present value utilizes 6 interest rate the present value of executive obligati on to repay the first 100000 payment equals 41726 under irc section 7872 and the proposed regu lations executive is treated as having received compensa tion for the remainder of the 100000 or 58274 example 2 employer owners hip equity arrangement i n contrast to example 1 corporation c rather than executive is designated as the owner of the life insurance contract in formal terms loan has been made from the corporation to the executive so that irc section 7872 does not apply to this arrangement consequently the proposed regulations specify that executive has income to the extent of the fair market value of all economic benefits provided under the arrangement under the proposed regulations the acquis ition of this equity interest arising from corporation cs premium payments is characterized as taxable economic benefit consequently the increase in executive vested right with respect to the cash value is included in executive income for federal income tax purposes the proposed regulations do not specify how this vested interest shoul d be valued the irs has requested comments from the public concerning the proper valuation of this equity interest under the proposed regulations execu tive enjoys an additiona l economic benefit the value of the current life insu rance protection in determining the value of the current life insurance protection executive may use the rates contained in table 2001 this table of term life insuran ce rates reflects the decline in term life insurance rates that has occurred in recen t decades alternatively executive may determine the value of the current life insurance protection using the insurers lower published premium rates to use these lower rates however the insurer must make these rates known to individuals who apply for term insurance and the insurer must sell term insurance at those rates example 3 employer ownershi p nonequity arrangement as in example 2 corporation c is designated as the owner of the life insurance contract in addition corporation c s entitlement to receive cash is not limited to the aggregate amount of premiums paid rath er it is entitled to receive the entire cash value of the contract upon the death of executive or upon the surrender of the life insurance contract in formal terms loan has been made from the corporation c to executive in this arrangement so that irc s ection 7872 does not apply consequently executive has income to the extent of the fair market value of the economic benefit provided to him in this transaction th only economic benefit provided to executive is the value of the current life insuran ce protection thus the proposed regulations prescribe the same tax treatment as exis ted under the earlier irs revenue rulings in determining the value of the current life insurance protection executive may use the rates contained in table 2001 this table of term life insurance rates reflects the decline in term life insurance rates that has occurred in recent decades alternatively executive may determine the value of the current life insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32000crs31 protection using the insurers lower published premium rates to use these lower rates however the insurer must make thes rates known to individuals who apply for term insurance and the insurer must sell term insurance at those rates reverse split dollar arrangements the irs has announced special limita tions to restrict the abusive use of reverse split dollar arrangement as discussed above in reverse split dolla r arrangement the employer or donor utilized ps 58 rates to determine the value of current life insurance protection that it retained because these taxpayers overstated the value of the benefits allocable to the employer or donor they claimed that the premium payment produces little or benefit to the employee or donee in notice 200259 and in the proposed regulations the irs announced that taxpayer s may not use either the ps 58 rates or the table 2001 rates in reverse split dollar rrangement to calculate the
