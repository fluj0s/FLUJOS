report will not be updated justice oconnor has taken part in ever ada case presented to the supreme court and her influence on ada jurisprudence has be significant if not always easy to categorize2

that is appropriate within the mean ing of section 5 of the fourteenth amendment congress must identify conduct that violates the fourteenth amendment and must tailor its legislation to remedying or preventing such conduct 9 528 us 62 2000one of the most discussed aspects of justice oconnors legacy is her role in the courts federalism decisions and key question is to what extent her retirement will tip the delicate balance in these decisions5 justice oconnors vote in tennessee v lane 541 us 509 2004 finding that the ada guar antees the access to court for individuals with disabilities was critical to forging majority opinion limiting the often referred to federalism revolution in her absence the re sults of subsequent cases relating to the ada especially those involving federalism are uncertain application of the eleven th amendment to the ada the impact of justice oconnors views has been critical in the area of federalism she voted with the majority in several d ecisions that placed limitations on federal power6 but in the recent decision of tennessee v lane she was the swing vote in case that found congress had validly exercised its authority in the ada context federalism issues have arisen regarding the circumstances where section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used to abrogate the eleventh amendment the eleventh amendment states the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another stat or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state the supreme court has found that th eleventh amendment cannot be abrogated by the use of article i powers but that secti on 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used for abrogation in certain circumstances section 5 of the fourteenth amendment states the congress shall have the power to enfor ce by appropriate gislation the provisions of this article recent supreme court decisions in college savings bank v florida prepaid postsecondary educ expense board7 florida prepaid postsecondary educ expense board v college savings bank 8 and kimel v florida board of regents9 reiterated the principle that the congress may abrogate state immunity from suit under the fourteenthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22225crs3 10 42 usc 12101b4 the commerce clause w ould not be sufficient authority on

against qualified individual with disability in employment 42 usc 12111 et seq 13 title ii of th ada prohibits di scrimination by state or cal government 42 usc 12131 et seq 14 it should be noted that the eleventh amendmen t applies only to states not municipalities see eg ability center of greater toledo v city of sandusky 385 f3d 901 6th cir 2004 15 id at 374 amendment and found that there were th ree conditions necessary for successful abrogation congressional power is limited to the enactment of appropriate legislation to enforce the substa ntive provisions of the fourteenth amendment the legislation must be remedial in nature there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted to that end the ada uses both the fourteenth amendm ent and the commerce clause of the constitution as its constitutional basis10 it also specifically abrogates state immunity under the eleventh amendment11 the ada then is clear regarding its attempt to abrogate state immunity the issue is whether the other elements of successful abrogation are present the supreme court in garrett v university of alabama 531 us 356 2001 found that they were not with regard to title i12 while in tennessee v lane the court upheld title ii13 as it applies to the access to courts14 in garrett v university of alabama 54 decision where justice oconnor was the swing vote the court held that the eleventh amendment bars suits to recover monetary damages by state employees under title i of the americans with disabilities act ada garrett involved two consolidated cases brought by separate alabama employees one of the employees patricia ga rrett had been undergoing treatment for breast cancer when she alleged she was transferre d to lesser position after having been told that her supervisor did not like sick people the s econd plaintiff milton ash alleged that the alabama department of human services did not enforce its nonsmoking policy and that therefore he was not able to control his asthma the eleventh circuit held that the state was not immune from suits for damages the supreme court reversed stating that congress is the final authority as to desira ble public policy but in order to authorize private individuals to recove r money damages against the states there must be pattern of discrimination by the states which violates the fourteenth amendment and the remedy imposed by congress must be congruent and pr oportional to the targeted violation those requirements are not met here15 in tennessee v lane another 54 decision where ju stice oconnor was the swing vote the supreme court retreated somewhat fro m its recent approaches to the applicationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22225crs4 16 the court has upheld the family and medical leave act 29 usc 2601 et seq as valid exercise of congressional power pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment nevada department of human resources v hibbs 538 us 721 2003 the majority opinion for this 63 decision was written by chief justice re hnquist and joined by justice oconnor 17 42 usc 12202 18 521 us 507 1997 19 id at 520 of the eleventh amendment holding that title ii of the ada as it applies to the fundamental right of access to the courts c onstitutes valid exerci of congressional authority under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment16 lane was an action brought by george lane and beverly jones both paraplegics who use wheelchairs for mobility against the state of tennessee mr lane allege d that he was compelle d to appear in court to answer criminal charges and had to crawl up two flights of stairs to get to the court room ms jones certified court reporter alleged that she was been unable to gain access to number of county courthouses t hus losing employment opportunities the court noted that when analyzing an eleventh amendment immunity issue first the issue of whether congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate must be resolved the ada specifically provides for abrogation17 so the court then applied the test set out in city of boerne v flores 18 which found that legislation enacted pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment is valid if it had congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedi ed and the means adopted to that end19 justice stevens opinion found that title ii of the ada like title i sought to prohibit irrational discrimination but noted that title ii also sought to enforce variety of basic constitutional guarantees including the right of access to the courts noting the pattern of disability discrimina tion that led to the enactment of the ada and the sheer volume of evidence demonstrating the nature and extent of unconstitutional discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of public services the court held that the inadequate provisions of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for remedial prophylac tic legislation the final i ssue was whether title ii was an appropriate response to this hi story and pattern of discrimination although the court had been urged to consider the entire sweep of title ii justice stevens declined to broaden the ruling beyond the issue of the accessibility of j udicial services the court held that the remedies were congruent and proportional to the goal of enforcing the right of access to the courts and emphasized that title ii of the ada requires only reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided and that do not impose an undue financial or ad ministrative burden or threaten historic preservation interests thus the court concluded title ii as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of acce ss to the courts constitutes valid exercise of congress section 5 authority to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment tennessee v lane did not settle all the issues regarding when congress may use section 5 of the fourteenth to abrogate the eleventh amendment on its face it limited its holding to access to courts currently pendi ng before the court and scheduled for oral

united parcel service inc 527 us 516 1999 where the mitigating measure at issue was high blood pressure medication justice oconnor also author ed this decision 23 see national council on disability righting the ada dec 1 2004 which called for legislation to change the result of this definitional interpretation goodman v georgia20 which raise the issue of whethe r congress has validly abrogated state immunity from damage suits under title ii of the ada in situations involving accommodations for prisoners with disa bilities whether the reasoning of tennessee v lane will be found to be applicable in the c ontext of prisons or whether the court will continue its previous trend of deference to states is unclear but what is certain is the fact that the loss of justice oconnors pivotal vote makes the courts direction even less certain21 other ada decisions in sutton v united airlines 527 us 471 1999 justice oconnor wrote the decision for the court which limited the definition of disability since being defined as person with disability is threshold issue in any ada complaint the sutton holding that the determination of whether an i ndividual is disabled should be made with reference to measures that mitig ate the individuals impairment22 was an interpretation with important ramifications this decision limited who would be considered to be person with disability thus decreasing the number of potentially successful suits23 similarly in toyota motor manufacturing v williams 534 us 184 2002 justice oconnor penned the courts nimous decision holding that to be an individual with disability under the ada an individual must have substan tial limitations that are central to daily life not just limited to particular job in us airways v barnett 535 us 391 2002 justice oconnor was again with the majority in 54 decision concerning reasonable accommodations under the ada in barnett the court held that an employers showing that requested accommodation by an employee with disability conflicts with th rules of seniority system is ordinarily sufficient to establish that the requested accommodation is not reasonable within the meaning of the ada thus the times when an employer must provide reasonable accommodation were limited in he r separate concurrence ju stice oconnor stated that she would prefer to say that the effect of seniority system on the ada depends on whether the seniority system is legally enforceable but that since the result would be the same in most cases as under the majoritys reasoning she joined with the majority to prevent stalemate however in the landmark case of olmstead v georgia justice oconnor voted with the majority in 63 decision widely heralded as an important expansion of the rights of individuals with disabilities olmstead held that title ii of the ada requires states to place individuals with mental disabilities in community settings rather than institutionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22225crs6 24 see longterm care implications of supreme courts olmstead decision are still unfolding gao011167t september 24 2001however there were certain limitations imposed on this right the states treatment professionals have to determine that community placement is appropriate community placement cannot be opposed by the individua l with disability and the placement must be reasonably accommodated nonetheless the olmstead decision has been significant factor in the movement toward commun ity based services for individuals with disabilities24
