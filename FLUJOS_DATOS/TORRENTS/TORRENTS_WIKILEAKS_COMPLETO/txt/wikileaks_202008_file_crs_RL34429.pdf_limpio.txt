mining industry is much improved compared to the early decades of the twentieth century time when hundreds of miners could lose their lives in single accident and more than 1000 fatalities could occur in single year fatal injuries associated with coal mine accidents fell almost continually between 1925 and 2005 when they reached an alltime low of 23 in 2006 however the number of fatalities more than doubled to 47 fatalities declined year later to 33 which is comparable to levels achieved during the late 1990s coal miners also suffer from occupationally caused diseases prime among them is black lung coal workers pne umoconiosis cwp wh ich still claims about 1000 fatalities annually improved dust control requireme nts have led to decrease in the prevalence of cwp but there is recent evidence of advanced cases among miners who began their careers after the stronger standards went into effect in the early 1970s in addition disagreement pers ists over the current respirable dust limits and the degree of compliance with them by mine operators in the wake of the january 2006 sago mine accident the us department of labors mine safety and health administration msha was criticized for its slow pace of rulemaking earlier in the decade msha standardsetting activity quickened starting later that year however after actment in june of the mine improvement and new emergency response act miner pl 109236 the miner act emphasized factors thought to have played role in the sago disaster and imposed several rulemaking deadlines on msha lthough the agency has not met all of the acts deadlines it has published the requi site final standards on emergency mine evacuation civil penalties re scue teams and mine seals some policymakers remain dissatisfied with mshas performance these sentiments led to house passage in january 2008 of the supplemental mine improvement and new em ergency response act sminer hr 2768 it incorporates language from the miner health enhancement act hr 2769 such as requiring msha to adopt as mandato ry exposure limits the voluntary limits to chemical hazards for example recommended by the national institute for occupational safety and health sminer also re quires msha to more closely review and monitor operator plans that include retreat mining the practice used at utahs crandall canyon mine where six miner s and three rescuers lost their lives

issued its accident report on july 24 2008 it assessed fine totaling 1636664 on the mine operator for such violations as failing to revise and follow its roof control plan and failing to notify msha of coal bursts that preceded the deadly bur st on august 6 2007 msha also fined the engineering consulting firm that provided the operator with flawed analyses that resulted in an inadequate roof control plan in early september 2008 msha announced that it has asked the us attorn eys office in utah to consider filing criminal charges in connection with the crandall canyon mine

at the nations coal min the partial collapse in 2007 at utahs crandall canyon mine further dr ew attention to the plight of coal miners these among other incidents during the current decade have prompted congress to step up its legislative and oversight activities with respect to the safety and health of those who toil in the countrys coal mines this report begins by reviewing the record of working conditions in the coal mining industry it then describes the regulatory regime and recent funding of the us department of labors mine safety and health administration the report closes with an analysis of current regulatory and legislative initiatives working conditions in the coal mining industry safety safety in the coal mining industry is much improved compared to the early decades of the twentieth century peri od in which hundreds of miners could lose their lives in single accident and more than 1000 fatalities could occur in single year fatalities associated with coal min accidents fell almost steadily between 1925 and 2005 when they reached an alltime low of 231 nevertheless coal mining remains one of the most dangerous employment sectors as measured by fatal work injuries the fatality rate among persons employed in the private sector was 43 per 100000 work ers in 2006 the latest year for which data are available from the us bureau of labor statistics compared to 495 fatalities per 100000 workers in coal mining2 in terms of nonfatal accidents mining does not diverge greatly from the allindustry average3 in what follows then the concentration is on fatal accidents variety of factors may have contri buted to the longterm improvement in safety at the nations coal mines eg decreased employment shift from undergroundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34429crs2 4 for an overview of safety trends see rama raja and jan mutmansky mine health and safety at the turn of the millennium mining engineering september 1999 5 in prior decades congress initiated and gradually expanded safety and health regulation of coal and other mining industries w ithin the department of the interior 6 the united mine workers umw union wants msha to be more active it asserts that there are not enough inspectors and that pena lties proposed and negotiated are not large enough in general the umw would make enfo rcement of standards the highest priority the mining industry generally supports the current regulatory approach but it urges that inspections be focused on mines with evident problems rather than on all mines as currently required by law 7 ironically one of the lessons learned fro m september 2001 accident at alabamas jim continuedto surface mining and increased productivity new machinery such as longwall systems not only reduced the total number of workers needed but also did so at the most dangerous spots eg the active cuttin g face other measures that likely have prevented many largescale accidents in clude controlling coal dust monitoring methane gas which is both explosive nd poisonous adequately supporting roofs and avoiding spark producing equipment4 it would be very difficult to determine conclusively how much of the progress in safety has been due to the activities of the mine safety and health administration msha much of the industry might have voluntarily adopted the safety requirements in msha standa rds regulations without that inducement and indeed safety increased for long time before congress passed the federal mine safety and health ame ndments act of 1977 pl 95164 in which msha was established within the department of labor5 despite the progress that has been made in worker safety and their disagreement on the specific course of action to be followed6 labor and manage ment concur that there is still room for improvement especially in light of incidents that occurred in the current decade for example the flooding of the quecreek mine in pennsylvania in july 2002 raised questi ons about the accuracy of underground mine maps and their availability to operators of nearby mines the quecreek accident might have been avoided if the mine operator had access to the final map of nearby abandoned mine that had si nce filled with water in january 2006 methane explosion at we st virginias sago mine which was precipitated by lightning that penetr ated underground killed one miner initially twelve of the 16 miners who survived the explosion became trapped and succumbed ultimately to carbon monoxide from the ensuin g fire the episode raised number of safety issues that we re discussed at hearing of the senate appropriations subcommittee on labor health and huma n services educa tion and related agencies in january 2006 including the po ssibility that different communication and tracking devices might have enabled the trapped miners to escape or find better refuge or rescuers to reach them more quickly in addition emergency breathing apparatus issued to the miners were ra ted for only one hour and number of the apparatus reportedly did not work well there also was criticism of the fact that it took 11 hours from the explosion until rescuers entered the mine7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34429crs3 7 continued walter 5 mine appears to have led to the delay at sago because most of the victims in the earlier accident were responding to relatively small explosion when larger one occurred considerable time was taken to verify the state of the atmosphere in the sago mine before rescue teams were sent inaccidents at sago and other coal min in 2006 more than doubled the number of fatalities from the record low of 23 in 2005 to 47 in 2006 level last reached in 1995 see table 1 in 2007 however fatal work in juries declined to 33 level comparable to

advanced pneumoconiosis among work ing underground coal miners eastern kentucky and southwestern virginia 2006 mmwr weekly july 6 2007health accidental injuries can be quantified much more reliably than the extent of occupationally caused disease it is cl ear though that coal mining causes disability much more by way of longlatency diseas than by traumatic injury prime among these diseases is black lung coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp which still claims some 1000 fatalities per year despite being down by about half since 19908 deaths tend to occur after long progression resultin g in one year of life expectancy being lost on average for these cases however many years of impaired breathing and debilitating weakness often precede death wh ich may not be counted as mining related fatality because the ill miner dies from other immediate causes improved dust control require ments have led to decrease in the prevalence of cwp among miners with 2024 years of work experience for example the proportion of examined miners who had pos itive xrays decreased from 232 in the mid1970s to 22 in the late 1990s9 interestingly sharp drops in rates occurred at certain times for workers with 2529 years of mining experience the rate fell from 202 in the 19871991 survey to 54 in the 19921996 survey the former cohort began their careers around 1962 the latter around 1967 under the federal coal mine health and safety ac t of 1969 pl 91173 commonly referred to as the coal act tighter dust standards were phased in from 1970 to 1973 during the current decade however the us department of health and human services centers for dis ease control and prevention cdc found advanced cases of cwp among underground miners younger th an 50 to be particularly troubling because they were exposed to coal dust afte r the preventive measures in the coal act went into effect the cdc suggested four explanations for the continuing development of adva nced pneumoconiosis 1 inadequacies in the mandated coalmin dust regulations 2 failure to comply with or adequately enforce those regulations 3 lack of disease prevention innovations to accommodate changes in mining practices eg thinseam mining brought about by depletion of richer coal reserves and 4 missed opportunities by miners to be screened for early disease and take action to reduce dust

workers while osha is responsible for most of the more than 100 million employees in the remainder of the workforce thus while osha targets its inspections mostly on firms with the worst accident records in few sectors msha is able to cover its whole industry indeed it is mandated to inspect each underground mine at least four times year and each surface mine twice year both agencies can

incident in may 2008 msha released its accident report on july 24 2008 like the university of utahs seismological report on the 6 aug 2007 crandall canyon mine collapse in utah issued august 2007 msha concluded that th seismic activity associated with the mine collapse was not due to naturally occu rring earthquake rather the extensive pillar failure and subsequent inundation of the section by oxygen deficient air occurred on august 6 because of inadequacies in the mine design faulty pillar recovery methods and failure to adequately revise mining plans following coal burst accidents about which msha was not notified within 15 minutes as required by 30 cfr 5010 this failure on the operators part denied msha the opportunity to investigate these accidents and ensure corrective actions were taken before mining resumed in the affected area15 the august 16 accident occurred because rescue of the entrapped miners required removal of compacted coal debris from an entry affected by the august 6 accident entry cleanup reduced confining pressure on the failed pillars and increased the potential for additional bursts methods for installing ground control systems required rescue workers to travel near areas with high burst potential on august 16 the coal burst intensity exceeded the capacity of the support system16 in addition to failing to provide msha the requisite notification of prior bursts the mine operator genwal resources in c gri conducted bottom and barrier mining that were not included in the approved roof control plan nd that intensified stress on the pillars gri also mined in an area that was not part of the approved roof control plan according to mshas report thereby making conditions more unstable further gri did not propose revisions to th roof control plan

technical study panel on the utilization of belt air belt air is air directed underground to ventilate active work areas via the same tunnels in which conveyor belts remove coal from mines because these tunnels consequently contain great deal of highly flammable coal dust some think that using them for ventilation increases the risk of directing fires toward the work areas of miners and toward their evacuation routesentitled regulatory regime the miner act set deadline of december 2006 for msha to issue final rule raising certain civil penalties the rule which raises penalties beyond those specified in the st atute was not rel eased until marc h 2007 similarly the act required msha to finalize rule on mine rescue teams and on mine seals by december 2007 the first standard did not appear

the coal pillars that have been holding up that area of the mines roof ar pulled to obtain their coal in the opposite direction from which mining originally occurredon the health front section 8 of the bill would require niosh within 30 days of enactment to transmit to msha its recommended exposure limits rels for chemicals and other substances hazardous to miners msha would then have up to 30 days from receipt of the rels to adopt them as permissable exposure limits pels niosh to submit each year new or revised rels and dol to adoptthem within 30 days as pels 25 and msha to apply oshas asbestos standard to the mining industrywithin 30 days of the bills enactment 26 an amendment to the bill also requires the secretary of labor to study and report on miner substance abuse issues that pose safe ty risks another amendment authorizes 10 million for the secretary in consultation with the secretary of health and human services to award grants for provision of rehabilitation services to current and former miners suffering from mental health impairments section 7 addresses nother health issue namely respirable dust hr 2768 would effective on the date of enactment have mine ope rators adopt nioshs rels of 1 milligram of respirable coal dust and 005 milligrams of respirable silica dust per cubic meter of air to ensure that the coal dust standard is being met msha and mine operators would have to sample the amount of dust in the mine atmosphere using personal dust monitors pdms that provide realtime information to the miners equipped with the devices an amendment to the bill appropriates 30 million to the secretary to buy pdms for this purpose in light of the use of retreat mining in the 2007 crandall canyon tragedy the bill contains provisions that address the practice27 for example mine operators would be required to have current pillar extraction or barrier reduction plan approved by msha before performing such activities the secretary must establish special internal review process for plans involving miners working at depths of more than 1500 feet and the agency must more cl osely monitor implementation of these practices the national academy of scien ces in consultation with niosh would be required to make recomme ndations within one year of enactment about ways to better protect miners during retreat minin g and when working at great depthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34429crs13 28 in may 2007 msha issued an emergency tempor ary standard to increase protections for those working in underground mines with sealed off abandoned areas after extending the comment three times once to hold hearings in f our states and twice to give individuals time to review reports by niosh and the us army corps of engineers msha published final standard in april 2008in addition to the retreat mining provi sions in section 4 of sminer the section revisits and supplements the em ergency response provisions in the miner act among other things msha would ve to issue regulations in 2008 or 2009 concerning such safety issues as resc ue chambers or other refuge designs recommended by niosh survivable mine ventilation controls flame resistant conveyor belts and ventilati on of active working places hr 2768 similarly sets deadlines on mine operators related to such safety issues as postaccident communication and electronic tracking syst ems preshift communication program and atmospheric monitoring of carbon monoxide levels section 4 also would rep eal section 10 of the miner act which imposed deadline december 2007 for final rule on sealing of abandoned mine areas in its stead sminer would require msha to issue final rule on the matter not later than three months after enactment28 section 4 would as well have the national academy of sciences not later than one year from enactment report on ways to protect miners from the risk of lightning strikes near mines this was factor in the sago mine accident section 5 of sminer focuses on enforcement authority to ensure the agency has sufficient qualified and trained inspection personne l on board before current inspectors retire the bill would abolish for five years any ceilings on the number of persons in the position in addition an office of miner ombudsman would be created in the labor departments office of inspect or general smine r also would permit in instances where pattern of violations is found 1 assessmen t of penalty beyond those already authorized and 2 withdrawal of all miners from an entire mine the bill would raise the amount of so currently authorized pena lties and establish procedure for dealing with operators who fa il to pay final assessments the secretary would be required to establish an advisory committee to recommend whether the government should license mines their opera tors and related pe rsonnel to guarantee they are not frequent viol ators of the 1977 statute section 6 of hr 2768 addr esses rescue recovery nd incident investigating authority it includes requirement that within 30 days of enactment communications emergency call center be created for coal and other mine operations it must be staffed nd operated 24 hours day 7 days week by at least one employee of msha within six months of smi ners enactment guidelines for rescue operations would have to be developed and disseminat ed the guidelines must delineate lines of authority within msha and between the agency the private sector and state responders so each can pe rform their respective responsibilities in addition to msha conducting all acci dent and incident investigations section 6 would authorize an independent investigation for incidents involving multiple injuries or deaths or multiple entrapments niosh would appoint teamhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34429crs14 29 the chemical safety and hazard investigations board is an independent agency of the federal government that among other things investigates and identifies the causes of chemical accidents 30 in addition the employer group reportedly is concerned that this requirement would set precedent that congress subsequently could apply to osha house committee approves sminer bill amendment adds retreat mining provisions daily labor report november 1 2007members not less than 30 days after its enactment rulemaking would have to commence on the procedures to be fo llowed in the conduct of independent investigations rulemaking must be completed by oct ober 1 2008 however the bill would not have these other investigations limit the investigative authority of the chemical safety and hazard investigati ons board or the departments inspector general29 section 6 of hr 2768 also would strike section 7 of the miner act concerning family liaisons in its pl ace sminer would have the secretary designate fulltime permanent employee of msha to serve as family liaison who will at least in incidents involving multiple miners serve as the primary communicator with the families of those miners third amendment to hr 2768 created section 9 which establishes mine safety program fund into this account in the treasury would be deposited mine safety civil penalties and private donations sums in the account would be available for mine safety inspections and investigations only the administrations position the president has said he will not sign the bill if it arrives at his desk in its current form when the house education and labor committee was marking up sminer in late october 2007 the osha fairness coalition wrote the committee to express its opposition to the legislation it specifically was concerned that requiri ng msha to adopt nioshs voluntary rels as mandatory pels would circumvent the participatory rulemaking process because rels do not go through comparable public review30 in statement of administration policy issued when the house was preparing to vote on hr 2768 the office of management and budget omb similarly noted that this provision would mandate the adoption of potentially hundreds of pels without any input from stakeholders and without p rior determination of whet her the pel is economically and technologically feasible the omb further said in the statement of administration policy that rulemaking already is underway as result of other b ills the president previously signed hr 2768 would overturn regulatory processes that were re quired by the miner act and would impose burdensome and unrealistic time requirements moreover by allowing entities in addition to msha i nvestigate certain accidents sminer would according to the omb undermine the governments ability to hold accountable mine operators who violate mine safety and health regulations since multiple investigations potentially using different methodologie s and reaching different conclusionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34429crs15 31 see the following for additional information httpwwwcdcgovnioshmining continuedcould prejudice the governments ability to prosecute civil or criminal violations of mine safety and health standards that contributed to or exacerbated an accident related legislation sminer was referred to the senate in january

1655 does not contain the retreat mining provisions included in the substitute to hr 2768 that the education and labor committee considered in november 2007 after the cr andall canyon incident had occurred in addition s 1655 does not include the provisions in hr 2768 about study of substance abuse and relate d rehabilitation grants at section 8 mine safety program fund at section 9 and the appropriation for msha to purchase pdms sminer also joins in the senate hr 3877s 2263 the mine communications technology innovation act which the house passed on october 29 2007 hr 3877 would have the director of the national ins titute of standards and technology nist establish rese arch development and demonstration program to develop best practices ad apt existing technology and accelerate development of next generation tec hnology and tracking systems for mine communications the department of comme rces nist also w ould coordinate with industry and relevant federal agencies to develop consensus standards for communications in underground mines previously the miner act section 6 created within niosh an office of mine safety and health to enha nce the development of new mine safety technology and technological applications and to expe dite the commercial availability and implementation of such technology in mining environments the 2006 statute further states that the nios h office is responsible for research development and testing of new technologies and equipment designed to enhance mine safety and health and to carry out this responsib ility has the authority to award grants to encourage the development and manufacture of mine safety equipment and to award contracts to perform product testing separately the emer gency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 pl 109234 awarded 10 million to niosh to target research into safety technologies specifica lly related to communications and tracking among other things that would be availa ble for use in mines within 2436 months niosh which is part of the cdc has organized mine emergency communications partnership to facilita the development evaluation and implementation of postaccident communica tion and tracking technologies the partnership initially has focused on applications suited for coal mines its members who include mining associations unions state and federal regulatory agencies equipment manufacturers and researchers are expected to share their knowledge of and experiences with communication and tracking systems and provide mine sites where tests and demons trations of communication
