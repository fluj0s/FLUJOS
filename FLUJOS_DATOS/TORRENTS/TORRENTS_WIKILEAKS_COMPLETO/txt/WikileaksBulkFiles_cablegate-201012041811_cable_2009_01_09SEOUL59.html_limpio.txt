dialogue classified by pol mc joseph yun reasons 14bd 1 c summary as presidential candidate lee myoungbak called for creative reconstruction of koreas foreign policy in his february 2008 inaugural address lee criticized his two predecessors saying at times over the last ten years we found ourselves faltering and confused he vowed to trade ideology for pragmatism as koreas surest means of improving ties with its neighbors and hes had some successes especially with china and russia where lee was able to expand substantially economic and political ties lees efforts on japan and north korea are more mixed with japan the south korean public was not quite ready to accept fully lees attempts to compartmentalize history issues still much progress was made in seoultokyo consultations on variety of issues ranging from north korea to economic to even security issues on north korea lees conservative agenda was predictably rebuffed by pyongyang however all signs are that president lee is quite comfortable in sticking to denuclearization and reciprocity as the basis of his north korea policy especially as it enjoys considerable support end summary dprk 2 c in february 2007 speech that has widely come to be known as the mb doctrine presidential candidate lee myungbank firmed up his vision of his administrations north korea policy lee said his first priority would be to abolish what he described as his predecessors unprincipled and unilateral policy of appeasement toward the dprk and replace it with policy that offered generous assistance in exchange for north koreas complete nuclear dismantlement and pyongyangs accommodation of south koreas desire for family reunion accounting of welfare and whereabouts of pows from the korean war and several hundred abductees after the war immediately upon taking office the lee administration also made it clear that it would review all commitments from the two southnorth summits june 2000 and october 2007 senior lee administration officials complained publicly that the october 2007 summit between kim jongil and president roh moohyun was arranged by roh to favor the progressive candidate in the presidential election two months later and that therefore president lee was not bound to fulfill promises amounting to billions of dollars of aid to the north 3 c the response from pyongyang was predictably swift and severe using threatening language not heard since the kim youngsam days north korea has moved step by step to cut off interkorean relations initially all interkorean meetings were cancelled with the north loudly proclaiming that food aid from the south was neither needed nor wanted thereafter pyongyang implemented draconian restriction in december of northsouth crossborder traffic stopping kaesong tourism and severely limiting traffic to the kaesong industrial complex as the kumgang tourism had been stopped by the south over the july shooting death of southern tourist the net result has been crippling blow to the kic and kumgang tourism the two proudest results of the sunshine policy 4 c with both sides dug in the outlook for any quick improvement in interkorean relations is slim to none much more likely is the continued psychological war as characterized by foreign minister yu myunghwan in his recent meeting with the ambassador president lee is determined not to give in to north korean pressure our blue house contacts have told us on several occasions that president lee remained quite comfortable with his north korea policy and that he is prepared leave the interkorean relations frozen until the end of his term in office if necessary it is also our assessment that lees more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the north even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship also favoring the lee administrations stance is the the korean public which is calm to the point of apathy about the interkorean situation japan 5 c president lee has made concerted efforts to improve relations with tokyo which were significantly strained during the roh moohyun era over history and territory issues lee sought to compartmentalize what he called disputes over the past stating in an early policy address that south korea and japan shouldtry to foster futureoriented relationship with pragmatic attitude historical truth must not be ignored but we can longer afford to give up our future relations due to disputes over the past lees vision was to look beyond the historybound bilateral issues and create koreajapan partnership active in the regional and global arena on issues like the denuclearization of the dprk strengthening of multilateral relationships trade and economics and cooperation on projects like alternative energy communicable diseases and poverty alleviation 6 c so far lees efforts have yielded some success although blue house officials would argue that results would have been far better had tokyo shown more courage especially in dealing with the takeshimadokdo issue for example lee pressed ahead with his plan to engage japan on more strategic regional and global level lee made the decision that korea would participate in the october usjapankorea trilateral policy planning talks ref in tokyo he then agreed to the usjapankorea defense trilateral talks ref b in washington in november the first trilateral defense talks in six years lee also initiated the first ever standalone chinajapankorea trilateral summit ref c in fukuoka in december critics will of course point out that there were substantive results from these meetings but the fact that the meetings were held at all is significant result china 7 c president lee has openly courted the chinese and he has chalked up some noteworthy successes less than one year into his term lee has already met with prc president hu jintao three times quite unprecedented in the history of rokprc relations ref d typically in the past the rok could expect only one visit in prc presidents tenyear term lee paid his first state visit to beijing in may 2008 and met hu again in august when lee traveled to beijing for the olympics hu paid state visit to seoul august 2526 president lee made the relations seem twoway desire chinese embassy contact told us that beijing had been concerned that chinakorea relations would suffer because of the emphasis lee wanted to put on improving uskorea relations therefore china was pleasantly surprised that lee was able to improve both bilateral relationships simultaneously kim heungkyu professor of chinese security and foreign policy at the institute of foreign affairs and national security said lee had effectively leveraged the uskorea relationship to improve relations with china which is eager for closer ties with korea to check us and japanese interests in the region 8 c during lees first visit to beijing he and hu issued joint statement which upgraded the koreachina relationship to strategic cooperative partnership our chinese embassy contact gave the clearest explanation of what was now strategic about the rokprc relationship that chinas nomenclature to describe its relations with korea was upgraded according to roughly fiveyear schedule in 1992 relations were normalized in 1998 the first year of kim daejungs term as president the chinese upgraded the relationship to cooperative partnership in 2002 it was upgraded again to comprehensive cooperative partnership and now it is strategic cooperative partnership 9 c despite the name koreans have found substantive strategic discussions with the chinese frustratingly difficult for example lee unlike his immediate predecessors kim daejung and roh moohyun added north korean human rights to the koreachina summit agenda in august asking hu not to repatriate north korean refugees against their will hu did not respond to lees request ref also we understand lee asked hu what china thought about the north korean domestic political situation and whether beijing had any contingency plans this time hu apparently pretended not to hear lee still the rok did not come away empty because despite initial chinese objections lee was successful in including in the summit joint statement commitment to promote dialogue and cooperation in the field of international human rights russia 10 c lee has largely continued the trend of his predecessors in upgrading economic ties with russia rokrussia economic ties have grown more than 40 annually for the past three years with twoway trade exceeding usd 15 billion in 2007 much of the growth is due to russias natural resources for example lee paid state visit to moscow in september and agreed to contract for russia to supply korea with 75 million tons of natural gas annually for thirty years beginning from 2015 amounting to an estimated 20 of koreas annual natural gas consumption and despite doubts about north koreas cooperation lee agreed in principle to russia exploring plans for pipeline through north korea to deliver the gas the two countries also agreed to investigate the possibilities for linking the interkorean railway to the transsiberian railway system ref f 11 c on his state visit lee also signed an agreement to upgrade the rokrussia relationship to strategic cooperative partnership the same term used by china to describe this years upgrade to the rokprc relationship ko jaenam of mofats institute of foreign affairs and national security said korea proposed using the term strategic cooperative partnership after china used the term to describe the rokprc relationship ko said koreas objective in using the same terminology to describe the rokrussia relationship was to balance the rokprc relationship comment 12 c during year in which president lee faced considerable difficulty advancing his domestic agenda his foreign policy efforts if not wildly successful at least did not get him into trouble to considerable degree relations with south koreas neighbors are driven by economic realities increased regional trade investment and tourism that mesh with lees pragmatic nonideological approach relations with north korea were the outlier as the dprk took pains in 2008 to demonstrate that it could live without rok assistance stephens
