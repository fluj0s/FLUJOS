resources and rural development policy resources science and industry division rural development provisions of the 2008 farm bill summary congress has expressed its concern with rural communities most directly through periodic omnibus farm bill legislation most recently in the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 congress uses periodic farm bills to address emerging rural issues as well as to reauthorize andor amend wide range of rural programs administered by usdas three rural development mission agencies rural housing service rural businesscooperative service and rural utilities service title vi addresses wide range of policy issues concerning rural america in the 2002 farm bill these issues included provisions such as equity capital development in rural areas regional economic planning and development essential community facilities infrastructure needs valueadded agricultural development and broadband telecommunications development the 2008 farm bill considers similar issues and addresses several new ones the new farm bill expands broadband access in rural areas creates new microentrepreneurial assistance program and new rural collaborative investment program and authorizes three new regional economic development commissions the bill also authorizes 120 million for onetime funding of pending water and wastewater infrastructure projects several programs authorized with mandatory spending in the 2002 farm bill are reauthorized with discretionary funding in the new farm bill rural firefighters and emergency personnel rural strategic investment program rural business investment program and the access to broadband services in rural areas the valueadded grants program similarly authorized in the 2002 farm bill is also reauthorized

end of the report in the appendix the 2008 farm bill also modifies the 2002 definition of rural to include areas rural in character this modification in the definition of rural establishes criteria for defining rural areas contiguous to urban areas the bill further directs the secretary of agriculture to produce report within two years on the various definitions of rural used by usda in providing assistance the report will also assess the impacts these various definitions have on the delivery of rural development programs with the objective of better targeting assistance where it is most needed the 2008 farm bill also reauthorizes andor amends through fy2012 many long standing programs funded through annual appropriations water and waste disposal grants technical assistance for

farm bill policy background and overview while farm commodity issues may occupy center stage in policy discussions of the periodic omnibus farm bills rural community and economic development are also topics of congressional concern and separate title within the farm bill since 1973 omnibus farm bills have included rural development title the most recent is title vi of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 positioning rural areas to better compete in global economic environment is one of the key issues framing the current debate about the future of rural america when agricultural production and related businesses dominated rural economies policies that strengthened and improved agriculture tended to strengthen and improve the wellbeing of most of americas small communities and rural residents as the strength of this linkage has declined the need for new sources of rural economic development has become more apparent to policymakers and rural development practitioners congressional interest in rural policy encompasses wide range of issues including agriculture forestry and mining community infrastructure natural resource conservation and management medical care bioenergy and economic development current challenges to and reform of existing federal rural policies are evolving in an environment of increasing concern about economic competitiveness shift away from agriculture toward manufacturing and services new federal political strategies and the emergence of new political interests in farm bill deliberations changing rural america is also producing pressures for different policies and raising new questions about what congresss role should be in shaping rural policy both agriculture and manufacturing issues are increasingly seen as elements of global and regional restructuring which have significant implications for rural areas especially those areas where these production sectors remain dominant today nearly 90 of total farm household income comes from offfarm sources1 manufacturing now accounts for about 25 of rural private sector earnings and about 12 of all rural jobs the service sector as with the us domestic economy as whole now dominates the rural labor market although the rural service sector differs from the metropolitan service sector in terms of job categories skills and wages 1 this figure reflects the significant proportion of small lifestyle farms whose owners are not primarily involved in production agriculture for those farms where agricultural production is central to the households income the proportion of offfarm income is less crs2 the rural development title of farm bills generally supports 1 the infrastructure of rural areas with traditional assistance for housing electrical generation and transmission water and wastewater and community capacity 2 agricultural development and 3 rural business creation and expansion more recently policymakers have pushed for programs that support innovative and alternative business development and innovative mechanisms to finance it pressure for such alternative approaches is expected to continue as policymakers recognize the changing structure of agriculture and the great diversity among rural communities with some rural areas growing and prospering and others falling further behind as their primary industries including agriculture either decline or adapt to global economy such adaptation and dislocation over the past decade has often meant fewer rural employment opportunities and significant population outmigration for many rural communities to emphasize the importance of agricultural production in the local economies that still characterize many rural areas legislative support for technologies to help farmers with planting decisions and local investments in industries that will add value to their products have become important aspects of rural development policy research is also increasingly focused on improvements in agricultural waste management and environmental protections traditional strategies notably value added agriculture eg regional food processing plants cooperatives organic farming biofuels are being promoted by many in the farm sector while holding promise for agriculture and surrounding communities there remain limits on the extent to which agriculture and other mature industries can become significant engine for renewed rural economic prosperity while commodity policy dominates much of the debate and most of the funding production agriculture remains comparatively small and shrinking part of the rural economy with less than 8 of the rural population employed in agriculture there is growing recognition that farmers in many rural areas depend more on healthy rural economy than the rural economy is dependent on farmers for its vitality the need to strengthen the capacity of rural areas more generally to compete in global economy is becoming more widely appreciated as the limitations of commodity subsidies peripheral manufacturing and physical infrastructure as mainstays of rural development policy become more obvious issues influencing the rural development title emerging policy issues surround the question of whether current farm policies which rely heavily on commodity support payments and subsidies to few production sectors help hinder or have little impact on the future development of economically viable rural communities rural manufacturing which tends to be lowerskilled and lowerwaged is also undergoing restructuring with the loss of manufacturing to foreign competition while transformation to service economy continues in rural america service employment in many rural areas tends to be in lowerwage personal services rather than business and producer services continuing population and economic decline in many farming and rural areas is compelling policymakers and rural areas to create new sources of competitive advantage innovative ways of providing public services to sparse populations and new ways of integrating agriculture into changing rural economies crs3 more recently economic development efforts in some areas have targeted various entrepreneurial strategies and microenterprise development these approaches attempt to capitalize on particular areas distinctive social economic and environmental assets and advantages to build endogenously on existing local and regional strengths developing local and regional entrepreneurial culture seems to be an important approach in these efforts successes linking public and private sources to build business incubators is common strategy as is developing new commercial ties with area colleges and universities communities are also applying such entrepreneurial energy to making their local governments schools and hospitals more efficient through for example telecommunication innovations the trends noted above suggest range of issues that are important in shaping the provisions of the rural development title of the 2008 conservation and environmental restoration as rural employment opportunities stemming rural population outmigration vertical integration and coordination of agriculture into supply networks and their implication for rural areas developing rural entrepreneurial capacity rebuilding an aging rural physical infrastructure public service delivery innovations in sparsely populated areas increasing suburbanization and the conflicts between agriculture and suburban development human capital deficiencies in rural areas regionalbased efforts for economic development connecting businesses and rural communities with broadband telecommunications infrastructure the rural development title of the 2008 farm bill has taken shape against this backdrop of shifts in the rural economy widespread and longterm poverty in some rural areas outmigration in other rural areas dwindling economic opportunity in rural areas gaps in critical infrastructure and growing appreciation in many quarters of the limits of existing rural development programs to respond to the great diversity of rural places and socioeconomic circumstances such issues give rise to several policy relevant questions how effective are current federal programs in improving the competitive position of rural areas can broadbased federal rural programs be better targeted to the critical needs of particular rural areas how might regional funding approaches be better integrated into federal policy for rural areas how can federal policies better assist entrepreneurial efforts in rural communities how might the biofuels emphasis in the upcoming farm bill be connected to rural development programs crs4 federal rural development programs more than 88 programs administered by 16 different federal agencies target rural economic development the rural development policy act of 1980 pl 96355 however named usda as the lead federal agency for rural development usda administers most of the existing rural development programs and has the highest average of program funds going directly to rural counties approximately 502 three agencies are responsible for usdas rural development mission area the rural housing service rhs the rural businesscooperative service rbs and the rural utilities service rus an office of community development provides community development support through rural developments field offices it is important to note that most loan and grant programs administered by usda rural development are funded through annual discretionary appropriations the rural development title of omnibus farm bills does not address every program administered by the three usda mission agencies these various programs are permanently authorized often through amendments to the consolidated farm and rural development act of 1972 the conact pl 87128 or the rural electrification act of 1936 and are funded through annual appropriations the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 authorized the first provision in the rural development title funded by mandatory spending the fund for rural america which expired in 2002 the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 authorized six new programs supported through mandatory spending mandatory funding for most of these programs however was largely blocked by appropriators between 2002 and 2007 several of the programs were funded instead through discretionary appropriations although in amounts less than the original authorization the 2008 farm bill has provisions supported by mandatory spending although in lesser amounts than were proposed in the house and senatepassed versions of the farm bill title vi of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 new provisions several programs authorized in the 2002 farm bill are reauthorized in the two bills the appendix provides complete sidebyside comparison of current law with the provisions in the house and senate bills and the enacted bill unlike the 2002 farm bill the rural development provisions of pl 110 246 contain only three programs with mandatory funding valueadded product grants 15 million the microenterprise assistance program 15 million and onetime funding of pending water and waste water projects 120 million several programs that were authorized to receive mandatory funding in the 2002 farm bill were reauthorized in pl 110246 with discretionary funding eg the rural strategic investment program and the rural firefighters and emergency medical personnel program concerns about how effectively usda targets its rural development loan and grant assistance have been recurring consideration by policymakers and rural 2 more information on individual usda rural development programs can be found in crs report rl31837 an overview of usda rural development programs crs5 development practitioners the general concern is that rural development funding may not be targeted to the neediest rural communities

rural development programs the provision directs the secretary to make recommendations for ways to better target rural development funds section 6018 further establishes new definition of areas rural
