york times parcializado the washington post seguidas anexo amigo freddy baptista pat robertsons gift regalo pat roberson thursday august 25 2005 we wont even pretend to have given television evangelist pat robertsons latest obnoxious utterance much thought considering his long history of pious bloviations that have made him come across to most americans as well witless were it not for the widespread attention being given in latin america to mr robertsons call on monday for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez we would have preferred to allow the christian coalitions founder to continue his slide from americas mainstream into the obscurity he has so richly earned but his latest bit of foolery is worth comment or two if for other reason than mr robertson in an act of stupidity only he could outdo has handed fidel castros acolyte propaganda gift of immeasurable value mr chavez who like mr robertson is infatuated with the absurd fancies that the united states is out to kill him it so happens that mr chavez when not meddling in the affairs of his neighbors and spawning antidemocratic movements seems to enjoy portraying himself as target of us assassins charge that he makes without evidence and that has been strongly denied by the bush administration enter mr robertson its pity venezuelans dont know that the 700 club broadcaster is fading shadow of the republican party figure he once was that mr robertson once ran for his partys nomination built conservative religious advocacy group that had aspiring officeseekers quaking in their boots and entrepreneur that he is befriended every subsaharan kleptomaniac he managed to meet but mr robertsons slide from the mountain peak of evangelical pontification was not because of his politics but because of his mouth when his words were not illadvised they were moronic when not callow downright loopy as in predicting god would curse orlando with hurricane if gaypride events were celebrated at disney world wishing nuclear bomb would be dropped on the state department and suggesting that america had it coming on sept 11 because god had been insulted at the highest level of our government venezuelans just may not know the pat robertson that america knows yesterday mr robertson apologized we are used to that too still it is curious how some of mr robertsons fellow travelers have not been able to locate their tongues over this latest robertsoninspired international disturbance the family research council and traditional values coalition spare moments in rushing forth to denounce irresponsibility on the part of those they dislike not so with mr robertson who only called for the united states to murder foreign head of state even the bush administration cant bring itself to censure fellow conservative who publicly calls for his country to break the law inappropriate the state department managed to say the white house embarrassed by mr robertson yet again but too afraid to mix it up with his narrow but loyal base of support simply averts its gaze for all that mr chavez owes mr robertson thankyou note fin freddy baptista followups read tambien editorializa the
