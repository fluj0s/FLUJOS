cc mhughesltrrarizonaedu hi keith sorryyes i think the nature idea would be great definitely give it try thanks mike at 0653 pm 10302003 0000 keith briffa wrote things obviously moving over there this result looks goodjust thought id send this first bit up to dotted line of edited version to illustrate possible toning down have to go now and feed daughter will wait til see your joint version first thing tomorrow rest assured that am entirely with you on this and still appalled by the mm stuff but keeping your distance and calm stance is still urged all the best to all any objections if i talk to nature tomorrow keith at 0131 pm 103003 0500 michael mann wrote guys so the verification re for the censored nh mean reconstruction 664 the verification re for the original mbh98 nh mean reconstruction 042 i think the case is really strong now what if were to eliminate the discussion of all the other technical details and just say they exist and state more nicely that these series were effectively censored by their substitutions and that by removing those series which they censored i get similar result with dismal re and most people would keep the re of 042 over the re of 6 right so this would make that point i think we also need to say something about the process etc the intro was based on something that malcolmray had originally crafted thoughts comments thanks mike im thinking of note saying basically this and attaching this figure could everybody sign on to something like this thanks for all your help mike at 0511 pm 10302003 0000 keith briffa wrote ray et i agree with this idea in principle whatever scientific differences and fascination with the nuances of techniques we may may not share this whole process represents the most despicable example of slander and down right deliberate perversion of the scientific process and bias unverified work being used to influence public perception and due political process it is however essential that you we do not get caught up in the frenzy that these people are trying to generate and that will more than likely lead to error on our part or some premature remarks that we might regret i do think the statement re mikes results needs making but only after it can be based on repeated work and in full collaboration of us all i am happy to push tim to take the lead and collaborate in this and i feel we could get sanction very quickly from the defra if needed but this must be done calmly and in the meantime restrained statement but out saying we have full confidence in mikes objectivity and independence which we can not say of the sceptics in fact i am moved tomorrow to contact nature and urge them to do an editorial on this the political machinations in washington should not dictate the agenda or scheduling of the work but some cool statement can be made saying we believe the prats have really fucked up someway and that the premature publication of their paper is reprehensible much of the detail in mikes response though is not sensible sorry mike and is rising to their bate keith at 1155 am 103003 0500 raymond s bradley wrote tim phil keef i suggest way out of this mess because of the complexity of the arguments involved to an uniformed observer it all might be viewed as just scientific nitpicking by for and against global warming proponents however if an independent group such as you guys at cru could make statement as to whether the mm effort is truly an audit and if they did it right i think that would go long way to defusing the issue its clear from the figure that reno knuti sent yesterday that something pretty whacky happened in their analysis prior to ad1600 and this led mike to figure out the problem see 1fileceudoraattachnh_temp_recjpg if you are willing quick and forceful statement from the distinguished cru boys would help quash further arguments although here at least it is already quite out of controlyesterday in the us senate the debate opened on the mccainlieberman bill to control co2 emissions from power plants sen inhofe stood up showed the m m figure and stated that mann et the ipcc assessment was now disproven and so there was reason to control co2 emissionsi wonder how many times scientific paper gets reported on in the senate 3 days after it is published ray professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia
