vietnams accession to the wto congressional approval of the bilateral agreement was not required for it to go into effect the agreement itself does not establish any new obligations on the part of the

imposing unilateral measures such as quotas on textile imports that have not been sanctioned by the wto on the other hand the congress had an indi rect role to play as has been the case with us trade relations with most of the other communist and former communist states us trade relations with vietnam had been governed by title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended whic h includes the socalled

whom have granted vietna m unconditional mfn status vietnams membership in the wto requi res it to conduct trade with the united states under system of multilateral accepted rules vietnams trading practices can be subject to challenges by the unite d states and other wto members under the accepted dispute settlement mechanism httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33490crs3 this report provides brief overview of the usvietnam economic relationship an examination of the wto accession process and vietnams status an overview of the jacksonvanik amendment nd pntr and an analysis of the issues that were raised during c ongressional consideration of pntr for vietnam this report will not be updated overview of us vietnam economic relations usvietnam diplomatic and economic relations remained essentially frozen for more than decade after communist north vietnams victory over usbacked south vietnam in 1975 relations took major steps forward in the mid1990s particularly in 1995 when the two sides re established formal di plomatic relations since then the normalization process has accelerated and bilateral ties have expanded particularly on the economic side of the relati onship the most important step toward normalization since 1995 was th signing of sweeping bilateral trade agreement bta which was approved by congress and signed by president bush in 2001 pl 107052 under the bta the united states and vietnam extended mutual mfn ntr to one another that went into effect on december 10 2001 in return hanoi agreed to range of trade liberalization measures and marketoriented reforms the climate in trade relations between hanoi and washington has sobered considerably since the heady days after the bta was signed in part because of difficult bilateral negotiations over the terms of vietnams accession to the world trade organization wto and antidumping duties the united states has leveled against imports of vietna mese shrimp and catfish implementation of the 2001 bila teral trade agreement bta in general since the bta was signed in 2001 us trade officials have praised vietnams implementation of the agreement as discussed below in retrospect vietnams contentious and prolonged deba over whether to sign the bta was watershed event that helped break the logjam that for years had stalled economic policymaking the decision to sign th bta appears to have fashioned new consensus in favor of new economic refor mist push in short order after signing the bta the government enacted series of measures including passing new enterprise law passing constitutional amendment giving legal status to the private sector reducing red tape creating unpreced ented transparency rules for prior publication of new rules and regulations and for the firs t time giving party members the green light to engage in private business adhering to the btas implementation deadlines and achieving the governments goal of joining the wto have helped galvanize the vietnamese bureaucracy toward enacting many of these and other steps some us industry officials have expr essed concern that the government has not met deadlines to implement in law ndor in practice some of concessions particularly in the services sector many of these critics however tend to accept the argument that the slippages often are due more to weak capacity than to protectionist intentions and in 2005 vietnam passed mo re than 20 laws and regulations that belatedly address some of these concerns the belief that hanoi generally is attempting to comply with its bta obligations may explain why the

exports to vietnam have fallen ce 2003 largely because shipments of aircraft and aircraft parts have decreased trade in apparel imports of clothing from vietnam have been major issue for us apparel manufacturers before during and afte r the negotiations over vietnams wto accession nearly half of the increase in usvietnam trade since 2001 has come from sharp rise in clothing imports from vietnam which totale d 27 billion in 2005 this contrasts with less than 50 million in 2000 and 2001 by dollar value apparel excluding footwear now represen ts about 40 of total us imports from vietnam which accounted for 43 of tota l us clothing imports in 2005 compared with 01 in 2001 before the 2001 bta went into effect and 14 in 2002 increases in us imports of vietna mese apparel tinued well into 2006 since 2001 vietnams apparel exports to the united states have increased more rapidly than us clothing imports from china the latter have grown faster after import quotas on textile s and apparel for wto memb ers expired on january 1 2005 the continued rise in vietnamese exports of pparel however suggests continuing competitiveness of vietnameseproduced clothing although the dollar amount of its clothing exports to the unite d states is far less than that of china vietnam is the sixth largest exporter of appa rel to the united states at about the same order of magnitude of such exporters as india indonesia and bangladesh whose clothing exports to the united states also ve been rising rapidly mexicos apparel exports to the united states almost equa l to those of china in 2001 actually have decreased since then and apparel exports to the united states by hong kong honduras the dominican republic and the philippines also have fallen or risen slowly see appendix the growth in us imports of viet namese apparel fro m 2001 to 2002 nd in subsequent years has been fairly wide spread among product groups but with outer garments rather than undergarments and tshirts for example accounting for much of the totals thus trousers coats j ackets and other lightweight outer garments accounted for more than half of vietnamese exports of clothing to the united states in 2005 see appendix b in contrast to textile and apparel trade with number of other countries the united states imports very small quantities of nonapparel textile endproducts from vietnam also us pparel exports to vietnam are relatively minimal equal to less than 1 of imports of appare l from vietnam in 2004 and 2005 on dollar basis the post2001 surge in clothing imports from vietnam followed the granting by the united states of c onditional normal trade relations ntr status to vietnam in december 2001 as per the july 2001 bta such status greatly reduced us tariffs on most imports from vietnam and led to the very large increase in exports of apparel to the united states many members of congress had urged the administration to negotiate special bilateral textile agreement to address this threat an april 2003 agreement between the united states and vietnam maintains quotas on 38 categories of vietnams clothing exports with the quotalevels increasing annuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33490crs6 2

except yugoslavia since 1951 as required by the trade agreement extension act of 1951 mfn stat us for poland was restored in 1960 this authority was superceded first by the trade expansion act of 1962 and then title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended the jacksonvanik amendment and vietnams ntr status normal trade relations ntr or mos tfavorednation m fn trade status is used to denote nondiscrimin atory treatment of trading partner compared to that of other countries in practice duties on the imports from country that has been granted ntr status are set at lower rates than those from countri that do not receive such treatment thus imports from non ntr country can be at large price disadvantage compared with impor ts from ntrstatus countries the jacksonvanik amendment section 401 of title iv of the trad act of 1974 requires the president to continue to deny nondiscriminat ory status to any country that was not receiving such treatment at the time of the laws enac tment on january 3 1975 but established procedure the jacksonvanik amendment to restore mfn status in effect this meant all communist countries including vietnam except poland and yugoslavia7 section 402 of title iv the socalled jacksonvanik amendment denies the countries eligibility for ntr status as we ll as access to us government financial facilities such as the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation opic as long as the country denies its citizens the right of freedom of emigration these restrictions can be re moved if the president termines that the country is in full compliance with the freedomofemigrati on conditions set out under the jacksonvanik amendment for country to maintain that status the president must reconfirm his deter mination of full compliance in semiannual reports due by june 30 and december 31 to congress his termination can be overturned by the enactment of joint resolution of disa pproval concerning the december 31st report the jacksonvanik amendment also permits the president to waive full compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements if he determines that such waiver would promote the objectives of th amendment that is encourage freedom of emigration this waiver authority is subject to annual renewal by the president and to possible congressiona l disapproval via joint resolution before country can receive ntr tr eatment under either the presidential determination of full compliance or the presidential waiver it must have concluded bilateral agreement that provides for among other things reciprocal extension of ntr or mfn treatment the agreement nd presidential pr oclamation extending ntr status cannot go into effect unless joint resolution approving the agreement is enacted that legislation is to be gi

antidumping duty ad cases against vietnam ad margins are used using methodology that invariably leads to higher ad duties than is the case with market economies the nonmarketmarket economy status is determined by the inte rnational trade administration at the us department of commerce after reviewing severa l criteria the extent to which countrys currency is convertible its wage rates are determined by free bargaining between management and labor joint ventures or foreign investment are permitted the government owns the means of production and the government determines pricesvietnams ntr status president clinton first granted vietnam waiver of the jacksonvanik requirements in 1998 that waiver has been upheld since that time from 1998 to 2002 resolutions disapproving the waiver s failed in the house disapproval resolutions were not introduced in 2003 2004 or 2005 the presidential waiver gave vietnam access to exportimport bank credits and opic programs but vietnam was ineligible to receive ntr status until the united states and vietnam entered into bilateral agreement per the requirements under title iv in july 2000 the two countries signed bilateral trade agreement bta the agreement went into effect after the congress and vietnams nati onal assembly appr oved it in 2001 the president signed it into law pl 107052 on october 16 2001 on december 10 2001

pntr for vietnam on december 29 2006 implications of pntr on the usvietnam relationship pntr for vietnam does not have any direct impact on usvietnam trade relations because vietnam had conditional

vietnams status as nonmarket economy as regards to us antidumping laws vietnam had soug ht but failed to get us removal of the nonmarket economy designation as part of the agreement on wto accession8 for vietnam and for us businesses that want to conduct bus iness with and in vietnam pntr provides sense of predictability longer is vietnams trade status with the united states be subject to annual reviews and possible terminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33490crs9 in addition to the practical commercial effects pntr has politically symbolic implications it places us relations on higher plane the jacksonvanik requirements are viewed by many of the c ountries that are subj ect to them as an outdated legacy of the cold war when us foreign policy was designed to limit soviet influence and trade policy was subs ervient to those foreign policy objectives us policy now is to expand relations with many of the those countries and reflects the changing climate in us relations with former cold war adversaries the wto accession process and vietnams status vietnam applied to join the wto on ja nuary 1 1995 vietnam is scheduled to officially join the wto on january 11 2007 the following sections provide an overview of the process that vietnam went through in order to accede join the accession process the wtos membership of 149 countries and customs areas spans all levels of economic development from the least deve loped to the most highly developed economies the wto came into existence in january 1995 as part of the agreements reached by the signatories to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the wtos primary purpose is to administer the roughly 60 agreements and separate commitments made by its members as part of the gatt for trade in goods the general agreement on trade in services gats for trade in services and the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual prope rty rights trips the membership in the gattwto has grown exponentially the gatt was originally founded in 1947 by 23 countri and the wto now has 149 members accounting for around 90 of world trade among the most recent entrants are china and taiwan which joined on december 11 2001 and january 1 2002 respectively armenia which joined on february 5 2003 the former yugoslav republic of macedonia which joined on april 4 2003 cambodi and nepal which joined in 2004 the most recent entrant is saudi arabia which joined on december 11 2005 vietnam will join on january 11 2007 ukraine is also near completion of its accession process membership in the wto commits its mbers to fundamental principles in trade with other members including mostfavored nation mfn treatment the imports of goods and services originating from one memb er country will be treated less favorably than imports of goods and services from any other member country mfn is to be unconditional in practical terms this means that in most cases country cannot apply higher import tariff to good from one member country than it applies to like goods from any other member country national treatment imports of goods and services are treated less favorably than like goods nd services produced domesticallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33490crs10 9 based on wto background informati on located at h ttpwwwwt oorg in practical terms this means th at governments cannot discriminate against imports in

be published and available for anyone to see procedures to implement the laws and regulations are to be open lowering trade barriers through negotiations since the gatts creation its members have conducted eight rounds of negotiations to lower trade barriers at first these negotiations focused on lowering tariffs over time the rounds ve broadened gattwto coverage to include nontariff barriers such as discriminatory government procur ement practices discriminatory standards and tradedistorting g overnment subsidies the last completed round the uruguay r ound 19861994 resulted in the most ambitious expansion of rules to cover for the first time trade in agricultural products and servi ces and government policies and practices pertaining to intellect ual property rights protection and

mechanism that is in effect for the first 12 months afte r vietnams accession under this mechanism if the united states or any other wto member has reason to believe that vietnam has not fulfilled this commitment it could seek consultations with vietnam if the consultations do not reso lve the issue then the united states or other wto member could seek the authority of third party in the form of neutral wto arbitrator who would then determine whether vietnam is in compliance if the arbitrator determines that vietnam is not in compliance then the united states would be authorized to reimpose thos quotas on textile and wearing apparel imports from vietnam before vietnam ente red the wto those quotas could be in force up to 12 months if the arbitrator does not render decision within 120 days of the filing of the complaint then the united states would automatically be authorized to impose the quotas11 among other concessions regarding manufactured goods according to the

protocol of accession for vietnam in addition to the bilateral agreements vietnam had to complete the negotiations with the 63member wto working party intellectual property rights protection was concern of the united states and some other working party members vietnam recently passed new ipr law and the working party members are waiting to see the regulations on how the law will be implemented number of contentious issues arose during these ne gotiations for example vietnam had insisted that it be granted period of time within which its obligations under the wto agreement on subsidies and counter vailing measures ascm are phased in rather than imposed immediately upon ccession vietnam argued that as developing country it was ent itled to this special and differential treatment the working party members resisted this demand working party members also raised issue with the vietnam governments policy of discriminating against companies in vi etnam that have foreignownership and domesticallyowned enterprises in extending importing rights vietnam allows locallyowned firms to import products that are part of their product line and does not require them to obtain an import license foreignowned firms can only import goods that are used as inputs in final produc tion or that would be used in establishing an enterprise under the 2001 usvie tnam bilateral trade agreement bta vietnam granted usowned firms special trading rights not accorded to other foreignowned firms however as wto member vietnam can longer discriminate among wto members nor between foreign and domesticallyowned firms some working party members also raised the issue of vietnams ban on certain types of printed matter that contain culturally reactionary and superstitious material

likely mean chan ges in how the two countries conduct their trade relations the two countries are now bound by wto rules in practice this will mean for example that the united states will not be able to impose unilateral restrictions on im ports from vietnam such as quotas on apparel imports unless they have been sanctioned by the wto in addition the two countries will be ab to use the dispute settlement body to challenge one anothers the trade practices if they suspect those practices violate wto rules for example vietnam might challenge us antidumping measures against vietnamese imports or the us might challenge vietnams tradedistorting subsidies overall significance of the issues for vietnam and the united states vietnams accession to the wto arguably has been the focal point for the general improvement and deepening of usvietnam relations that has occurred over the past three to five years this tre nd was symbolized in june 2005 when president bush hosted vietnamese prime minister phan van khai at the white house the first trip to the united states by vietna mese head of state and the two spoke of their desire to move bilateral relations to higher plane president bush also publicly backed vietnams bid to join the wto variety of economic strategic and historical factors have motivated th two countries to improve relations and obtain vietnams membership in the wto us interests economically pntr and wto accession fo r vietnam obviously has much less significance for the united states than it does for vietnam given the small share in us trade 03 that vietnam

the bush administration and the clinton administration before it to normalize trade relations with former adversaries most prominently china but also cambodia laos and the former communist states in eastern europe and the former soviet union vietnams accession to the wto could help the united states manage its trading relationship with vietnam in that vietnam would be ob ligated to wto rules thus

expected to come to vietnamese stateowned enterprises and private firms facing reduced state subsidies and increased competition from abroad hanois decision to sign the bta in 2000 appears to have been cathartic mo ment for domestic debates about economic policy prior to the signing of the bta the reformist momentum was widely observed to have dissi pated in large measure due to perhaps the worst infighting and political deadlock vietnam had experienced since reuni fication the deadlock can be simplified as disagreements between re formers and conservatives over how far to continue the economic reforms and concomitant integration into the international community many conservatives feared that economic rationalization would increase unemployment in particular by forcing the government to curtail subsidies to stateowned enterprises conservativ also felt that economic reform would affect vietnams sovereig nty and undermine the soc ialist foundations of the countrys economic and political systems and thereby erode the vcps monopoly on power vietnams consensusbased decisi onmaking style combined with the absence of any paramount l eader only exacerbated the eff ect of these divisions these arguments were brought to head during the debate over whether to sign the bta with the united states decisi on that took more than year after an agreement in principle had been reached the bta broke the policymaking logjam new political consensus emerged in favor of reform that new leaders endorsed at vcps 9th party congress in 2001 in s hort order after signing the bta the government enacted series of measures including passing new enterprise law to give boost to privatelyowned busin esses passing c onstitutional amendment giving legal status to the private sect or

apparel subsidy programs us textile groups had pushed for either the extension of current import quotas on vietnams textile and apparel exports not subject to wto disciplines or the creation of safeguard mechanism similar to the one included in chinas accession agreement among the major elements of that agreement were the united states and other wto members retain the right to impose safeguard measures specifically applying to textiles and pparel through the end of 2008 allowing continuation of some quotas in cases where surge in ch inese exports cause or threaten to cause market disruption to domestic producers and b china will significantly lower its tariffs on wide range of textile and pparel products and not impose new nontariff barriers17 the industry wanted the acce

would be lifted once vietnam eliminated its export subsidies us officials reportedly have insisted that such an issue must be addressed in the multilateral working party negotiations without making
