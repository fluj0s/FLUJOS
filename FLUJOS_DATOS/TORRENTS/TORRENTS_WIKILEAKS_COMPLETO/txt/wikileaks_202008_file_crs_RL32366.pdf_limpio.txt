oldest of these are executive orders and proclamations both of which today are usually published in the federal register for example president george w bush established the office of homeland security

issues associated with the establishment of consolidated tsdb it is not intended to serve as an indepth legal analysis of the issues related to national security privacy and the governments need for information to combat terrorism rather it is systematic examination of the terrorist screening centers mission and functions in relation to other entities like the terrorist threat integration center it identifies and describes key watch lists residing in several computer ized systems and databases2 that likely will be consolidated at the tsc it is significant that the 911 commission concluded that disrupting terrorist travel was as powerful weapon as targe ting their money and recommended that the united states expand terrorist trav intelligence and countermeasures3 it is not happenstance that many of the commi ssions recommendations endorse and build upon efforts already initiated under hspd 6 congress include d several provisions in the national intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 that are aimed at intercepting terrorists and constraining their mobility4 this act includes several terrorist watch list and screening requirements particularly in regard to advanced airline

attorney general john ashcroft secretary of homeland security thomas ridge and director of central intelligence dci george tenet on september 16 2003 the measures outlined in hspd6 and the mou can be viewed as an outgrowth of the administrations national strategy for homeland security which reported in july 2002 that the fbi would be establishing consolidated terrorism watch list that would be fully accessible to all law enforcement officers and the intelligence community8 according to the administrations timetable the tsc was to be operational on december 1 20039 the administration however informed representative jim turner the ranking member of the select committee on homeland security that the tsc was not fully operational as of the end of december 2003 and that the nations multiple terrorist watch lists had yet to be consolidated10 on march 25 2004 tsc director donna bu cella testified that th tsc had established an unclassified but law enforcement sens itive tsdb in addition the tsc was assisting federal screening agencies in id entifying terrorists and their supporters with greater certainty and tsdb lookout record s had been made available to nearly 750000 state and

related data available to the us government will be stored in single repository15 an oversight issue for congress some may maintain the most critical issue is whether the intelligence community16 is sharing the information with the ttic that is necessary to effectively identif known and suspected terrorists and their supporters while outside the scope of this report the 911 commission recommended establishing procedures for the intelligence community that provide incentives for information sharing restoring better balance between security and shared knowledge and called upon the presid ent to

limits set out in statutes and presidential directives agencies have discretion to define sbu in ways that serve their needs to safeguard information that is unclassified but should be withheld from the public for variet of reasons the reasons for safeguarding such information are likely to include maintain ing the privacy rights of individuals and the integrity of ongoing inquiries and

is building consolidated international terrorist watch list which will be merged with domestic terrorist watch list records in the tsdb moreover under hspd6 the use of watch lists has been expanded to include data taken from ongoing criminal and national security investigations that are related to terrorism in addition the administration plans to widen access to and use of watch list records by making them available in sensitive but unclassified18 format to authorized federal state local territorial and tribal authorities to certainprivate sector entities and to certain foreign governments hence hspd6 elevated and expanded the terrorist identification and watchlist functions which were previously performed by the doss inr for immigration screening purposes the purpose of these m easures is to better identify watchlist and screen known and suspected terrorists at us consulates abroad and international ports of entry such measures could also better enable the us government to track terrorists within the united states if they manage to enter the country along these lines the 911 commission endor sed the integration of us border security systems with other systems to expand the network of screening points to include the nations transportation system and access to vital faci lities 19 the establishment of the tsc and tsdb can be viewed as the first phase of an integrating border security systems with other law enforcement and transportation security systems another oversight issue for congress is the extent to which the tsdb should be integrated with other sc reening systems to expand the network of screening points in regard to aviation security the national intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 includes several provisions that w ould expand and integrate

safeguard the privacy of the individuals about whom the information is being shared and establish board within the executive branch to oversee adherence to these guidelines as recommended by the 911 commission should congress consider requiring statutory authorization for the tsc the consolidated tsdb and related activities as means of assuring greater accountability are there cultural or tradecraft issues related to information sharingthat the fbi and other agencies will need to overcome in order to more effectively share inform ation and properly manage lookout records for other agencies would the database nd watch list functions be better located and consolidated in single executive branch agency with clearer lines of authority and responsibility finally are the tsc and tsdb and by extension the ttictemporary or permanent solutions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32366crs48 conclusion there is an emerging consensus that the us intelligence and law enforcement community missed several v ital opportunities to watch list and screen several conspirators involved in the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks under hspd6 the bush administration has taken steps to elevate and expand terrorist identification and watchlist functions an oversight issue for congress some may maintain one of the most critical issues is whether the intelligence community is providing the terrorist threat integration center with the necessary information to identify effectively known and suspected terrorists and their supporters endorsing and underscoring measures taken under hspd6 the 911 commission has recommended establishing national counterterrorism center on the foundation of the ttic in add ition the commission has recommended the further integration of us border security systems with other systems to expand the network of screening points to include th nations transportation system and access to vital facilities the establishment of the terrorist screening center and terrorist screening database is in part an integra tion of border security systems with other screening systems these measures if effectively implemented will better equip the us government to screen and monitor the whereabouts of known and suspected terrorists and their supporters furthermore working from common terrorist identities and watch list databases could be an effective mechanism to break down institutional and cultural fire walls and promote greater interagency cooperation and data sharing conversely as the us government pursues more aggressive policy in identifying and watchlistin g known and suspected terrorists and their supporters there is significant potential for corres ponding loss of privacy and an erosion of civil liberties while the administrati on asserts that such information will be collected according to preexisting author ities and individual agency policies and procedures it is inevitable that individuals will be misidentified in such cases most would agree that it will be incumbent upon the us government to act swiftly to correct such mistakes and some argue compensate those individuals for their inconveniences or possible damages in the interest of protecting civil liberties among other things the 911 commission has recommended that the president promulgate information sharing guidelines to safeguard the privacy of th individuals about whom the information is being shared and establish board within the executive branch to oversee adherence to these guidelines establishing tsdb by merging watch lists will not likely require integrating entire systems nonetheless there are likely to be technological impediments to merging watch list records from system to system and watch list to watch list there remains standardization of data elemen ts such as name date of birth place of birth or nationality in the past decade moreover digitized biometrics principally fingerprints have been developed to iden tify individuals with greater certainty buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32366crs49 most biometric systems have been veloped separately from other systems integrating data from biometric systems into either the tid or the tsdb could be technologically difficult and costly under hspd6 the administration has tablished the tsc as multiagency effort at the same time establishing consolidated tsdb and effectively disseminating lookout records to screening agencies including state and local law enforcement is not likely to be sma ll or shortterm endeavor at this time congressional input into this process is confined to overs ight by several congressional committees and appropriating funding to several participating agencies nevertheless in the na tional intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 congress has included severa l provisions that are based in part on the 911 commissions recommendations related to expanding intelligence and law enforcement operations aimed at intercepting terrorists and constraining their mobility several of these provisions endorse and build upon measures already taken under hspd6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32366crs50 appendix frequently used abbreviations to aid the reader the
