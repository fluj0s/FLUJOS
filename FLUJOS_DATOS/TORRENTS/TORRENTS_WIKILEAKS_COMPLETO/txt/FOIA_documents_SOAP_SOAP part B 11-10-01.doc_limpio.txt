the fact that this project was conceived to address the overall requirements of key action 21 to understand detect assess and predict global change processes the requirements for which include to fully assess the implications of and distinguish between the natural and anthropogenic change recognising the need for better quantification of natural climate variability and anthropogenic change as the basis to assess and predict their extent and consequences the calls for proposals under key action 21 divided these objectives between separate calls to 213 and 214 the former mostly concerned with climate model aspects and the latter with the use of palaeoclimate data we have designed programme that will provide the best available palaeoclimatic and observational evidence of the climate changes that have occurred in the northern hemisphere over recent centuries and we will use this information to test the capability of stateoftheart general circulation models gcms to simulate this variability when driven with realistic natural forcings we will use joint analyses of palaeoclimate observations and model simulations to identify the extent to which observed variability of recent centuries may be attributed to natural andor anthropogenic changes we will combine palaeoclimatic observations and model simulations to improve our knowledge of natural climate variability and quantify the uncertainty in climate change detection that is attributable to model uncertainty and that arising out of the underlying influence of nonanthropogenic climate variability the objectives of our proposal therefore encompass priorities from both calls 213 and 214 please see sections b3 and b4 the proposal was first submitted under 213 climate change prediction and scenarios which explicitly identifies verification of model capability for simulation of climate changes over past decades and centuries modelling of climate variability and assessment of climate predictability and detection and attribution of climate change however we were subsequently directed to submit this proposal to 214 climate variability and abrupt climate changes on the grounds that it was of greater relevance presumably to the specified priorities to better identify and model the important processes in the climate system including natural variability and to assess the risk of abrupt changes including the reconstruction and analysis of palaeoclimaticrecords so as directed by the dgxii scientific officer we stress that the proposal should be assessed with equal regard to the requirements of 214 and 213 in recognition that its overall objectives encompass their combined priorities b3 objectives this project aims to provide stateoftheart quantitative description of the variability and causes of variability of northern hemisphere climate over the last five centuries it will investigate the behaviour of important regional systems as well as hemisphericallyintegrated changes and quantify the changing influences of natural and anthropogenic climate forcings using an integrated study of palaeoclimate proxies and carefully prescribed general circulation model gcm experiments another major objective is to establish the reliability of gcm simulations of natural climate variability and hence gain additional insights into the uncertainty of modelbased anthropogenic climate change detection studies this will provide more secure basis from which to assess the likelihood of future abrupt and unusual climate changes we will also undertake this assessment in reaching these overarching aims the project will achieve many individual measurable objectives the most important of these are the simulation of climate variations for the period ad 15002000 using two stateoftheart gcm climate models forced with very similar natural forcing histories including volcanic aerosol loading total solar irradiance changes and orbital changes and separate simulations for the period ad 17502000 forced by combined natural and anthropogenic forcings greenhouse gases ozone and sulphate aerosols detailed statistical intercomparison of the simulations with one another and with already available millenniallength control simulations with constant external forcings to enable the identification of robust climate responses to external forcing on global and regional scales and the quantification of the relative importance of forced and internallygenerated climate variability the production of an enhanced and integrated database of annuallyresolved climate proxy records by assembling many existing records tree rings ice cores corals etc and lower resolution records such as those from lake sediment peat records and borehole temperature estimates the construction of homogeneous sets of climate data representing seasonal temperature precipitation and atmospheric circulation variability over the last 500 years involving the amalgamation via appropriate calibration of instrumental observations documentary climate archival data and existing and the newly amalgamated palaeoclimate proxy evidence to allow detailed analysis multiple variables for all seasons or even at monthly resolution for the european region possible because of the dense network of natural and documentary proxies available the improved definition of the characteristics and magnitude of natural climate variability during the last five centuries across the full northern hemisphere and the improved reconstruction of past variations in important atmospheric and oceanatmosphere modes of climate variability including the north atlantic oscillation nao and the related arctic oscillation and the niñosouthern oscillation enso evaluation of the simulated climate variability and the simulated climate response to external forcing by quantitative comparison with the extended observedreconstructed climate data the use of the model simulations to aid in the interpretation of the real world climate variability specifically the use of signal detection techniques to test the extent to which the model response to external forcings is detectable in the observedreconstructed climate data the generation of improved estimates of natural climate variability through synthesis of the simulated and observedreconstructed data the reassessment of climate change prediction uncertainties and climate change signal detection uncertainty in the light of these new estimates of natural variability comparison of estimates of sea level variation generated from the climate model simulations with synthesised history of north atlantic sea level changes based on combination of long tide gauge records and evidence from number of ongoing tidal marsh sampling studies b4 contribution to programme key action objectives the project we propose within the energy environment and sustainable development research programme comes under key action 2 global change climate and biodiversity the project is concerned with climate change and involves large element of integration and synthesis highlighted as particular priority of key action 2 the rationale of key action 21 which seeks to understand detect assess and predict global change processes recognises the need to better understand natural climate variability and to distinguish it from changes arising out of human influences our project encompasses the whole of this concept and sets out to synthesise the evidence of climate change and variability as seen in instrumental documentary and wideranging palaeodata but then to use empirical and gcm modelbased signal detection techniques to provide quantitative evidence for the separate roles of natural and anthropogenic forcing of this variability the project therefore accords strongly with priority 214 climate variability and abrupt climate changes that seeks to better identify and model important processes in the climate system including natural variability using direct study and modelling of the processes and through the reconstruction and analysis of palaeoclimaticrecords our project will make equally significant contributions to the requirements of priority 213 climate change prediction and scenarios that specifies verification of model capability for simulation of climate changes over past decades and centuries modelling of climate variability and assessment of climate predictability and detection and attribution of climate change all of these aspects are directly addressed in this project please see the important note to reviewers included at the start of this proposal the collection partial reprocessing and synthesis of the palaeoclimate data and combining them at appropriate spatial and temporal scales and their use for model validation and their interpretation in the light of model outputs all constitute significant effort under priority 241 better exploitation of existing data and adaption of existing observing systems the proposed project will also make relevant contribution to priority 222 interactions between ecosystems and the carbon and nitrogen cycles one of the climate models that will be used incorporates dynamic vegetation model and will yield simulated responses of vegetation to internallygenerated and externallyforced climate variations over the past 500 years these simulated data will be of relevance to the objective better understanding of the spatial and temporal interannual variability of theterrestrial carbon sources and sinks the proposed project will not investigate this issue in detail but the simulated data together with treeringbased estimates of boreal forest productivity derived from our palaeodata collections will be made available to subsequent collaborative projects focussing on this research priority b5 innovation this project offers practical strategy for using stateoftheart instrumental documentary and palaeodata together with gcm simulations to explain the nature and causes of natural climate variability over the last 500 years it also offers genuinely integrated approach to quantifying the regional and hemisphericscale uncertainty in the ability of important gcms to simulate this variability when driven with realistic forcings such project incorporating the most extensive and detailed high resolution climate history and combination of complementary model simulations amounts to genuinely novel study of the character and context of recent climate variations this is therefore very timely and innovative project there are also many aspects of innovation associated with the individual workpackages that constitute the overall project these may be summarised as follows simulation of climate variability workpackage 2 the proposed simulations of climate under estimated histories of natural and naturalplusanthropogenic external forcings will provide stateofthe art information about externallyforced climate variability and change they will be analysed in combination with millennial length control integrations of the same models that are already complete1 and provide information about climate variability generated by interactions within the climate system this will be the first time that such coordinated set of complementary coupled atmosphereocean general circulation model gcm experiments has been used to simulate the climate of the last 500 years intercomparison of results from two leading coupled gcms23 will allow an estimate to be made of how sensitive such conclusions are to model uncertainty two different models runs with very similar forcings constitute good opportunity to separate the response of the climate system to the external forcing factors from the internally generated climate variability and to assess model uncertainties with respect to these responses one of the models has already successfully simulated changes in surface temperature that have been observed over the last century4 both climate models represent the stateoftheart and are more advanced than any models that have previously been applied to the question of climate variability over the past 500 years importantly both models are those that are being used to predict possible scenarios of future climate change both have finer spatial resolution than those models typically used to investigate multicentury natural variability the model2 to be used by partner 2 has relatively highresolution ocean gcm 125º of latitude and longitude coupled without flux adjustments to slightly coarser resolution atmospheric gcm while the model3 to be used by partners 3 and 4 uses atmosphere and ocean gcms coupled with flux adjustment that have very fine ocean resolution in the equatorial region to resolve enso dynamics reconstruction of climate variability workpackage 3 the compilation of observational climate variability for the last 500 years will bring together many documentary and palaeoclimate records and archives that have not been synthesised until now similarly many different proxy records will be assimilated for the first time some emphasis will be placed on treeringbased records see below but the project will also incorporate many published reconstructions and reassessments of other palaeoclimate proxies including tropical coral records from the indian and pacific oceans icecore derived series multiple proxy sources from lake sediments some speleothem data and the highest resolution palynological and peat data integrating the data or climate reconstructions from such diverse proxy sources is new and timely aspect of this work very extensive network of treeringbased palmer drought indices5 that now extend back the full 500 years will be combined with numerous local drought sensitive series in the us and europe the mediterranean and northern africa morocco several of which will be recalibrated as part of the project the temperaturesensitive treering network will also bring together for the first time several expansive networks of treering widths and densities6 separately constructed in different laboratories in the us europe and russia together these will provide virtually comprehensive extratropical land coverage and we will reprocess many of the data using very recently published7 technique that provides greater longtimescale variability in the calibrated reconstructions than has previously been preserved we will use spectral decomposition and timescaledependent calibration techniques to allow the variability expressed in different palaeoclimate proxies with different timescales of response or resolution to be combined and to provide appropriate timedependent estimates of reconstruction uncertainty the project will therefore provide stateoftheart homogeneous climate data set that is unrivalled in its representation of high seasonal resolution variability different variables temperature precipitation pressure and extensive spatial coverage analysis of these climate data will subsequently provide significant advance in our knowledge of regional and hemispheric temperature moisture and circulation changes over the last 500 years synthesis of palaeo and modelderived estimates of natural climate variability workpackage 4 the combined use of stateoftheart model simulations and palaeo reconstructions will further advance our understanding and knowledge of climate variability in particular likewithlike comparisons will be possible as the models will have been subject to the best available estimate to the same forcing that the climate proxies experienced the model simulations will aid in the interpretation of the palaeo data by estimating the signals that are due to external forcing and by providing the typical spatial patterns and coherence of climate variability on different time scales as well as between the different variables andor seasons that the proxy data represent the palaeo data will be used to evaluate the simulated magnitudes and patterns of climate variability and to draw conclusions about climate change detection studies that have used the modelbased estimates of natural variability the application of this approach is entirely original in comparing model and palaeo data we will apply innovative methods that take into account uncertainty in the climate reconstructions which will be carefully estimated for specific time scales and through time and also investigate the alternative approaches of subsampling the model data to match the palaeo records with the possibility of statistical downscaling to the proxy site or upscaling the palaeo records to scale where both model and palaeo data perform most reliably sea level variations over the past 500 years workpackage 5 the major components of soap focus on climate variations over recent centuries directed towards achieving the key action objectives nevertheless the particular climate model simulations to be undertaken provide unique opportunity to extend small part of the project to the investigation of sealevel variability this opportunity arises for two reasons firstly the coupled oceanatmosphere climate models used for simulations of the past 500 years wp2 also produce spatial estimates of sea level variation associated with thermal expansion of sea water and ocean circulation changes and secondly thanks to new methodology8 developed and tested in the past ten years ca ten highresolution 50200 year sealevel records for the past 5001000 years from sites around the north atlantic seaboards will become available our intention is to use this modest but valuable data base to make first attempt at providing quantitative estimates of the degree to which north atlantic sealevel variability is realistically hindcast by the current generation of coupled gcm climate models and icemelt models9 sea level change is forcing factor in coastal change and evolution since very little is known of sea level variability during the past 5001000 years this project will open new perspective on why coastal environments changed in the past and will continue to change in the future b6 project workplan b6a introduction rationale for our approach this project is built on the rationale that combination of modelling and observation based research represents the most productive route towards understanding climate variability and more specifically for placing the twentieth and twentyfirst century climates in the context of previous centuries the project must therefore develop significantly improved regionallyresolved palaeoclimate reconstructions and undertake externally forced climate simulations for the last five centuries and combine this information to quantitatively analyse the capability of the latest general circulation models gcms to simulate climate changes over past centuries to explore the nature of simulated and observed responses to historical natural forcing and to quantify the uncertainty associated with the detection and attribution of climate change signals on hemispheric and regional spatial scales due to anthropogenic forcing the majority of climate change signal detection and attribution studies to date assume modelbased estimate of natural climate variability10 this is major and virtually untested assumption and is potentially major source of criticism that could be used to detract from all such work this proposal has been devised to make an effective contribution towards improving our knowledge and understanding of interannual to multicentury time scale variability of the climate system and the degree to which this is realistically simulated by the best gcms climate models are clearly unrivalled in their ability to simulate broad suite of variables across the entire world but their reliability on decadal and longer time scales requires additional evaluation we propose to complement existing simulations with new simulations of historical climate variability to obtain set containing long control integrations and both naturallyforced and anthropogenicallyforced experiments all of these will be or have been run in parallel using two stateoftheart coupled atmosphereocean gcms23 both models will be forced with virtually identical external forcings11 uniquely this will allow systematic isolation and comparison of the separate responses to the same natural and anthropogenic forcings and so will provide the basis for defining modeldependent and independent regional and globalscale sensitivity to natural ie nonanthropogenic climate variability this information will define the range of uncertainty associated with anthropogenic influence on 20th century and on 21st century climate the project will also produce stateofart highresolution climate data spanning the last five centuries by amalgamation of instrumental12 documentary13 and proxybased reconstructions614 these various data will be rigorously calibrated and furnished with realistic error estimates separately calculated for specific parameters regions times and time scales from these data the project will provide the best available information on characteristic modes and magnitudes of natural climate variability for comparison with the natural forcing histories and the outputs from the gcm simulations the important questions about the nature and the significance of recent climate change can be addressed in separate modelbased and observational domains and ultimately the issue of attribution can be explored using the combined information from both approaches the project is organised within five workpackages representing the optimum balance between efficient distribution of related separate tasks and the need to ensure good integration of effort within and between the subgroups of partners workpackage 1 is concerned with overall coordination of the project workpackage 2 groups together all of the work on climate simulations and their analysis for the last 500 years undertaken by different european modelling groups workpackage 3 brings together all of the observational historical and palaeoclimatic data assembly and subsequent statistical comparisons of methods to integrate and calibrate them workpackage 4 addresses the synthesis and interpretation of both the 500 years of observationalreconstructed climate records and the appropriate simulated data the fifth workpackage addresses the separate sealevelchange aspect of the project and includes both the reconstruction of historical changes and their interpretation and reconciliation with simulated changes we now describe the background and approach to each of the workpackages coordination and dissemination wp1 to ensure efficient collaboration communication and data exchange within the project consortium specific coordination tasks have been identified and form the basis of wp1 the wp1 table gives detailed information about these tasks and their associated deliverables the project website developed under wp1 will also be used for dissemination to the scientific community of all the model simulations and all the palaeoclimate reconstructions that will be produced for soap model simulations of the climate of the last 500 years wp2 internal climate variability that generated by interactions within the climate system simulated by coupled atmosphereocean general circulation models aogcms has been used in studies that have attempted to detect recent climate change and attribute it to human influences10 in studies of potentially predictable decadal climate variations15 and to investigate the mechanisms of climate variability16 however establishing the veracity of decadal to century timescale internal variability is difficult because the real climate system is also subject to external forcings and the instrumental record is too short to reliably estimate variability on these timescales over most of the world to estimate the contribution of natural and anthropogenic forcings to climate variability we propose to carry out simulations with stateofthe art aogcms using natural and anthropogenic forcings estimates of changes in natural forcings orbital changes total solar irradiance changes and volcanic aerosol loading based on variety of proxy indicators have recently been made11 and the forcings applied to simple energy balance model11 existing data sets will be used to determine the anthropogenic forcings greenhouse gases sulphate and other aerosols ozone and land cover changes17 the simulations will be done with two different aogcms one uses flux adjustments model b while the other does not require any model and both are stable for multicentury integrations model a2 is notable for the relatively high resolution of its ocean component 125 of latitude and longitude and 20 vertical levels and radiation scheme that allows explicit representation of wellmixed greenhouse gases and aerosols model b3 is notable for the refined meridional resolution 05 of its ocean component around the equator in order to better resolve equatorial dynamics both models have ensolike behaviour and interannual variability that compares well with instrumental records on annual timescales partner 2 will carry out two simulations using model to complement the existing 1400year control integration1 one from 15002000 with natural forcings and another from 17502000 with both natural and anthropogenic all forcings these simulations with model will be undertaken during 2002 using partner 2s own resources so that they are completed and available by the start of the proposed soap project 1000year control integration of model b is already complete as is an all forcings integration from 17502000 natural forcings run for the period 10001750 has been begun by partner 4 for separate already ongoing project the additional integration of model b that will be undertaken by partner 3 for soap is an extension of the natural forcings runs for the period from 1750 to 2000 when all these simulations are complete soap will have access to 1000 year control 17502000 all forcings and 15002000 natural forcings simulations with both model and model b in fact the model b natural forcings run will cover 10002000 and this extended data will be used within soap though the focus will be on the most recent 500 years the four forced simulations will be compared with one another and with the two existing millenniallength control simulations we will examine the simulations to see on what time and space scales the variance of temperature and precipitation differs from that of the control in what epochs the forced simulations differ from the control and if various indices nao enso and statistics quantiles return periods linked to extreme events hotcold summers droughts differ the aim of these comparisons is to see what climate variables on what spatiotemporal scales are most sensitive to external forcings the results of these studies will be used to inform decisions about what should be compared between the forced simulations and proxy indicators of climate in workpackage 4 comparison of the naturally forced simulations with the control will allow us to estimate the contribution that natural forcings make to climate variability and relate that to internal climate variability by using two different models we can make some estimate of the role of model uncertainty in these comparisons and focus most of our attention on those features which are robust in the two simulations in addition to this consideration of the general impact of external forcings on magnitudes and patterns of climate variability and extremes analysis will also be focussed on diagnosing the response to each of the forcings applied within the limitations of sample size and the twomodel ensemble available we will use multivariate correlationcovariance and analysis of variance techniques to identify the patterns and seasonalities of the temperature moistureprecipitation and circulation changes simulated in response to each of the external forcings applied with uncertainty estimates obtained by reference to the internallygenerated variability simulated during the model control integrations recently devised principal component analysis techniques that first prewhiten the data to give lower weighting to patterns of internallygenerated variability may be successful here although methods that more directly utilise lagged correlations with the forcing histories will also be used the issue of the optimal lag between forcing and maximum response will be investigated especially for the solar forcing component with its multiple time scales of variability for volcanic forcing events the linearity of the response to events with different forcing magnitudes and its subsequent recovery will also be investigated amalgamation and calibration of 500years of highresolution climate data wp3 this workpackage encompasses large amount of work and major input from four institutions and their collaborators however the necessity to work closely and to employ and compare different statistical approaches to the processing of various data sets requires that the work be grouped under one heading this part of the project will combine the most recent data from separate archives of instrumental12 and archival documentary material13 and very many palaeoclimate proxy614 data different statistical approaches will be used to regionalise the data and to calibrate the different records to provide homogeneous climate estimates with realistic confidenceerror estimates highresolution global terrestrial climate data set18 will be used as the 20th century component of the amalgamated data set and as the base from which all reconstructions will be calibrated in terms of anomalies on 5 latitude by 5 longitude grid reconstructions of atmospheric circulation will use ncep reanalysis data19 and instrumental circulation indices for calibration the directly observed climate data will also incorporate many long instrumental records assembled as part of previous european community funded work these data will be enhanced by the incorporation of data from different documentary archives in switzerland and the netherlands that are discontinuous but may be directly interpreted in terms of climate this project will not collect new palaeoclimate data rather it will bring together groups with access to and experience working with numerous published and new many unpublished data from variety of proxy sources with major focus on europe where excellent data from all sources are available for example early monthlymean instrumental data20 are available back to ad 1659 in combination with other ordinal scaled temperature precipitation ranging from 3 to 3 and other palaeoenvironmental indices estimated from very highresolution documentary data such as observations of ice and snow features phenological and biological observations and other weather elements prior to ad 1659 reconstructed climatic indices mostly temperature and precipitation and the western baltic sea ice index on seasonal resolution are available to this can be added wealth of treering lacustrine and other palaeo records with various geographic distributions and climate sensitivities some have lower temporal resolution but may still provide useful longer timescale information spatial coverage and reconstruction accuracy will be better for some climate variables than for others over the last 500 years for example summer temperature variability over northern hemisphere land will be virtually complete because of the wide availability of several very large and previously unamalgamated temperaturesensitive tree ring networks plus other temperature sensitive data in contrast precipitation reconstructions will not be possible over the whole hemisphere but will be available for very large regions such as the coterminous united states5 and other large regions of europe importantly including some areas that show highsensitivity to variations in enso and the nao the overall regional coverage of multiple variables will however be easily sufficient to allow exploration of largescale and selected regional variability in range of parameters in the real world and as generated by the gcms careful consideration will be given to the ability of proxy data to represent the full spectrum of climate variability eg treering data may not fully represent century or longer time scales of variability though major improvements will be made as part of this workpackage by reprocessing7 many of these data see wp3 table and ice core data or lake sediment data eg diatoms may not accurately resolve interannual variability for this reason the different proxies will be calibrated after bandpass filtering to isolate discrete period variability interannualdecadal decadalmultidecadal multidecadalcentury this will ensure appropriate calibration and error estimation at each time scale and allow subsequent recombination of reconstructed time scale series optimum climate sensitivity will be established and transfer functions calibrated using range of regressionbased techniques simple regression principalcomponentbased approaches neuralnetwork and established analogue methods the project will generate improved highresolution seasonal data sets of temperature precipitation and precipitatedrelated variables such as palmer drought indices over much of the northern hemisphere in addition where the data permit seasonal sealevel pressure slp and geopotential height data will also be reconstructed preliminary analyses20 have already established the feasibility of skilful reconstruction of slp using principalcomponentrelated spatial regression techniques applied over the eastern north atlantic and western europe using relatively few long instrumental temperature pressure and precipitation records to estimate gridded slp fields similar techniques will be applied for reconstructing temperature and precipitation additional documentary data and high resolution proxy data will allow these grids to be extended back the full 500 years for the atlanticeuropean region and over considerable areas of the hemisphere for certain seasons besides concentrating on the specific climate parameters just described this workpackage will provide these data sets in various forms selected to represent different degrees of spatial integration these include irregularly spaced at the local scale but calibrated against local station or grid box climate data in those areas from which the specific proxy records originate these will be calibrated in terms of the specific optimal climate response identified for that data eg 2 month summer mean in north east siberian treerings or summer mean soil moisture deficit in an eastern mediterranean site optimally selected parameters expressed on large regular grids these will include eg summer halfyear mean temperature over the northern hemisphere land masses seasonal mean palmer drought severity indices across the united states seasonal mean sealevel pressure across the eastern north atlantic and all of western europe based on combined instrumental documentary and various proxy climate sources note that all of these data will be spatially detailed regionalmean climate series reconstructed to represent largescale variability through robust averaging of the local data networks these will include subcontinentalscale averages eg northwestern canadian temperature western north american drought and hemispheric mean records eg northern hemisphere annual temperature within the context of this largescale palaeoclimate reconstruction work we will have different spatial foci the first focus will be for europe and its surroundings which is of course of prime interest to the eu but also for which the very high density of long instrumental records documentary archives and natural climate proxy records will allow the most detailed climate reconstructions to be made ie for the most variables and for all seasons or even monthly the second focus will be broader considering climate variability over as much of the northern hemisphere for which reliable reconstructions can be made different domains for temperature precipitation and slp and only for the most appropriate seasons or annual means our final focus will be on the analysis and where necessarypossible the improvement of existing seasonal reconstructions of major climate indices that have been identified as important expressions of largescale circulation changes or of coupled oceanatmosphere phenomena the north atlantic oscillation nao and the related arctic oscillation are of key concern for the european region synthesis of palaeoreconstructions and model simulations of nao behaviour variability and response to external forcings will be very timely study and we will first synthesise or improve the available nao reconstructions to obtain either best estimate of its past behaviour or range spanned by individual estimates other modes of atmospheric variability that directly influence the european region such as the eurosiberian oscillation will also be considered the niñosouthern oscillation enso is one of the most important modes of climate variability it has greatest impact on the tropics but many regions of the world are susceptible to its influence and very strong events can have nearglobal impacts some model studies have suggested that enso may change in the future while some observational studies have suggested that recent enso events are unusual other research has indicated the presence of decadalmultidecadal ensolike variability perhaps related to the pacific decadal oscillation which may either arise from stochastic processes or be the result of distinct physical mechanisms operating in the climate system thus while enso represents only small part of the proposed work the soap datamodel framework provides the opportunity to make contribution to the improvement of confidence in model predictions and to assess the full range of natural variability linked to enso in the climate system quantitative proxy estimate with uncertainty estimates of enso activity will be made by augmenting existing reconstructions with data mainly coral proxies collated from across the entire tropical oceans for the period 1700 to 2000 few coral records are longer than 300 years this data will then be integrated and crossvalidated with existing instrumental data including some early records from key locations it should be stressed that not all of the palaeoclimate information to be assembled will require processing or calibration we will build upon much existing data and many published reconstructions derived from various proxies with differing spatial and temporal representation however we will assimilate these data in systematic manner and employ various approaches to reconciling the information each provides and giving specific weight to different sources according to their optimal climate responses spatial representation time scale of response and timedependent uncertainties synthesis and interpretation of observedreconstructed and simulated climates wp4 all tasks that involve the combined use of palaeoclimate reconstructions and modelsimulated climate data will be undertaken within workpackage 4 it is this part of the project that provides the added value of bringing together expertise and data from the palaeoclimate and the climate modelling communities this workpackage is therefore of key importance comparisons between palaeo and model data are hindered by the different characteristics of each data set model output is less reliable at small spatial scales while some proxy data are representative of only single sites palaeo reconstructions are not exact and have quantifiable uncertainty range associated with them the first task in wp4 will be to develop and test using existing data sets methodologies for coping with these characteristics to allow subsequent unbiased comparisons between simulated and proxy data that explicitly take account of estimated error in the proxy reconstructions climate reconstruction uncertainty will be quantified in wp3 and expressed as residual climate variability not captured by the proxy data the variance of the residuals must be included as additional variance when evaluating the level of interannual climate variability at individual locations or regions21 explicit methods will be developed however to incorporate the effects of temporal andor spatial coherence in the residual variance effects which become important when aggregating over space or time note that the signal detection and attribution techniques22 that will be used for some tasks in this workpackage already provide framework for the inclusion of proxy uncertaintyerror in those particular analyses the incompatibility of the spatial scales of palaeo and model data can be dealt with in number of ways and these will be compared and evaluated for single sites gridbox model output can be extracted but may have unrealistic variance or spectral characteristics improvements obtained by applying statistical downscaling methods23 to obtain more reliable local information from the bettersimulated largescale climate variability will be assessed for multiple sites we will compare three approaches first the model output fields can be subsampled picking out data only from the locations and seasons for which the palaeo reconstructions exist24 second upscaling the palaeodata to the scales and variables considered to be reliably simulated can be achieved through multiple regression based techniques this second possibility also includes the reconstruction of indices of enso or of the atmospheric circulation such as the nao and then comparing these with the indices simulated by the climate models the third approach lies between the first two where there is sufficient density of coverage such as will be available from the treering network large regional averages can be formed and calibrated and compared with regional averages of subsampled model output the most suitable methods for the particular comparison or synthesis tasks will be identified and the necessary algorithms developed and applied once appropriate methods of datamodel comparison have been defined they will be applied to number of specific tasks each task will where appropriate be undertaken for each of the main foci of the palaeoclimate reconstruction workpackage 3 i spatially and seasonally detailed european climate variability for multiple climate variables ii less detailed climate variability across most of the northern hemisphere and iii the variability of certain key atmospheric and atmosphereocean processes such as the nao and enso the specific datamodel comparison tasks are described next the first comparison will be to quantitatively evaluate the model simulations of climate variability and of the simulated response to external forcing comparisons will be made between the variance on variety of space and time scales of temperature and to lesser extent precipitation or moisture between the statistics of extremes for warmcold summers and drought where suitable reconstructions exist and between climate indices eg enso and the nao comparison will be made with both the natural and the all forcings simulations to assess whether the additional forcings raise the levels of multidecadal variability to similar extent in both the simulated and reconstructed climates stateof theart signal detection and attribution techniques22 will be applied to test whether the climate response to external forcings simulated by the models is detectable in the palaeoclimate reconstructions more specific comparisons will be undertaken for the periods and variables when the externallyforced signal was most statistically significant as identified in wp2 detection of 20th century climate change and attribution to specific external forcings will be attempted but using the pre1900 palaeobased estimates of natural climate variability and for the subset of locations and seasons with suitable reconstructions this will enable conclusions to be drawn about published studies that use modelbased estimates of natural climate variability and to demonstrate whether recent climate changes are outside the envelope of natural climate variability for the period 15001900 in addition to the palaeo evidence being used to evaluate model performance the model simulations will aid in the interpretation of the palaeodata the climate simulations enable separation of the externally forced climate signal from internal variability to the extent that the signal is distinguishable from the noise something that cannot be achieved using palaeodata alone the model signals will be used to interpret the palaeoclimate reconstructions in terms of the causes of the observed variations in addition the model output will be used to assess the suitability of the proxy record network and the statistical reconstruction methods at capturing the largescale climate fields by subsampling the model output with the addition of synthetic noise with various prescribed forms at the location of various proxy records the results of this assessment will be translated into independent estimates of palaeoclimate reconstruction reliability at different spatiotemporal scales quantitative synthesis of the palaeo and modelderived natural variability estimates will be undertaken using innovative methods to combine the data sets and obtain improved estimates of natural climate variability we will evaluate bayesian analysis methods where prior eg modelderived beliefs can be updated in the light of proxy data multiple regressionbased approaches that attempt to reconstruct spatiallyextensive climate fields from sparser network of climate proxies14 rely on the identification of distinct patterns of climate variability and their relationship with climate proxies at individual sitesseasons these patterns and relationships are typically identified at interannual to decadal timescales and then applied at all timescales from interannual to millennial25 and by necessity are based on instrumental observations from the 20th century that may be contaminated by an anthropogenic climate signal as part of the synthesis we will assess and improve upon such studies by deriving these patterns and relationships from the model simulations at various timescales and with and without external anthropogenic forcing of the climate system suitable relationships identified between simulated patterns of climate variability and appropriately subsampled model output will be applied to the palaeo records to obtain new estimates of natural climate variability for the last 500 years the main project results will be synthesised to provide overall assessments of the utility and veracity of the climate models and of the database of highresolution climate proxies sea level changes over the last 500 years wp5 the particular climate model simulations to be undertaken within soap provide unique opportunity to extend small part of the project to the exploration of simulated and reconstructed sea level variability with view to assessing our capability of hindcasting sea level changes over the past 500 years and therefore providing guidance about future sea level predictions this opportunity arises because the coupled oceanatmosphere climate models23 used for simulations of the past 500 years wp2 also produce spatial estimates of sea level variation associated with thermal expansion of sea water and ocean circulation changes partner 2 also has access to glaciermelt model9 that can be run offline to obtain estimates of the simulated meltwater component of sea level rise during simulations with both model and model b note that the small fresh water flux variations driven by glacier change will not be able to influence ocean salinity and circulation because the glacier melt model will be run after the climate model simulations are complete this melt water component will be combined with similar global contribution from the gradual ongoing adjustment to the last glacialinterglacial transition of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets using an existing observational estimate plus deviations estimated by massbalance variability26 and will be added to the spatial sea level estimates obtained from the ocean component of the climate model simulations these estimates of sea level variability and change under natural and all forcings and from the control integrations with unchanging external forcing will allow certain questions to be addressed for example what proportion of sea level variations over past centuries might be attributed to naturally and anthropogenicallyforced climate changes and therefore what fraction of the rise observed during the 20th century is commitment delayed response to earlier naturallyforced climate variations such as the ending of the little ice age how large is the variability in global and regional sea level driven by natural external forcings comparison of the different simulated sea level estimates against observational evidence is necessary to give an indication of our confidence in the simulations this is limited by the length of tidegauge records and so it is fortuitous that the opportunity to assemble longer records is now becoming available method based on the interpretation of salt marsh foraminifera has been developed and successfully tested8 to generate palaeo sealevel records with resolution of 50200 year application of this method has resulted so far in six 8001800 year long records of dm scale sea level variations with temporal resolution between 50 and 350 years for sites in connecticut and maine northeast usa8 preliminary comparisons with existing temperature proxy records for the past 1000 years suggests that regional north atlantic surface air temperature variations are more strongly correlated than hemispheric mean temperature variations specifically the records available suggest that the current high rates of relative sea level rise began before industrial times over the period 20022004 similar sealevel reconstructions will be produced by various nationally funded projects for sites in north carolina delaware nova scotia newfoundland the uk and northwest germany and for four more european sites under study in the ecfunded holsmeer project these proxy records will be systematically evaluated for errors related to age elevation indicative meaning completeness and regional validity where necessary effects of sediment compaction will be accounted for by comparison with compactionfree relative sealevel data the influence of longterm crustal movements will be estimated using compactionfree relative sealevel records for the past 20004000 years to be compared with values obtained from isostatic earth models these proxy records to be integrated with existing long instrumental sea level records represent an important and growing database that renders possible for the first time comparison of observational with model generated sea level variability in the north atlantic region during the past 5001000 years comparisons will use straightforward statistical techniques correlation etc given the limited resolution of the observational estimates and the limited regional focus of the study east usa and canada and north west europe comparisons with reconstructed climate variations from wp3 will also be undertaken the simulated sea level variations will be subject to various uncertainties including uncertainty related to initial conditions which will be maintained over period of time related to the response time of oceans and glaciers and uncertainty related to glacier melt sensitivity the melt model is currently tuned to reproduce presentday shortterm responses of each glacier to temperature changes but will not necessarily exhibit the correct multicentury equilibrium sensitivity these two aspects will be assessed by partners 1 and 2 by using globallyaveraged simple climate and sea level model27 integrated under ad 10002000 forcings with various initial conditions and with heuristic glacier melt model that may more accurately capture the response to the more slowly varying natural forcings this simple climate model which was used to produce future climate change scenarios in the ipcc first second and third assessment reports can also be tested over the period ad 15002000 by comparison

simulations and the existing multicentury control integrations of the models to identify the climate response to external forcings and to quantify the effect on climate variability of external forcings relative to internallygenerated variability 2 methodology work description best available estimates of forcing histories have recently11 been compiled for the natural orbital total solar

stateoftheart coupled climate models both models already have at least millenniallength control integrations partner 2 will run model from ad 1500 to 2000 under natural forcings and then repeat the period from ad 1750 onwards with both natural and anthropogenic all forcings these simulations will be funded using partner 2s own resources and will be undertaken during 2002 and completed by the start date of the proposed soap project partners 3 and 4 are currently undertaking simulations using model b with funding from current nationallyfunded project these are effectively natural forcings for ad 1000 to 1750 and all forcings for ad 1750 to 2000 and will be provided for use in the proposed soap project these will be augmented by an extension of the natural forcing simulation from ad 1750 to 2000 to be undertaken by partner 3 with funding from the proposed project as far as logistics and different model formulations allow the two models will perform identical experiments appropriate data and diagnostics will be converted to netcdf file format and transferred to the webbased project data bank for dissemination within the project and for public dissemination at the end of the project comparison of forced and control simulations and also intercomparison of the two models will be done using range of statistical approaches tailored to specific questions comparisons will be done on the means and variance of temperature precipitation and indices such as enso nao etc and on statistics quantiles return periods linked to extreme events hotcold summers droughts comparisons will be done using the whole of each simulation but also as function of time to identify periods and variables when the forced simulations are significantly different from the control simulations this will provide input to wp4 to look at proxy data during these identified periods comparisons will also take place over range of space and time scales this part of the study will answer the question how does external forcing alter the climate and its variability the natural simulations will be used to estimate the contribution of natural forcing to climate variability while the all experiments will be used to compare the simulations with proxy data in order to evaluate the veracity of the simulations there will be specific focus on diagnosing the simulated response to external forcings taking into account the seasonality of moisture circulation and temperature responses and time lags in maximum response especially important for solar forcing with its multiple time scales of

and validation of selected highquality palaeoclimate time series some specific variables and locations to be reconstructed are listed in the work description below to provide explicit uncertainty error estimates appropriate for the specific space and time scale representation of each variable series constructed to identify through combination of principalcomponent type and time series analysis techniques the characteristic modes and magnitudes of spacetime variability in the climate records over the last 500 years representing multifaceted objective and quantitative summary for comparison with different natural forcing histories and the outputs from the climate model experiments 2 methodology work description the data sets to be constructed will comprise temperature precipitation and precipitationrelated variables such as drought indices atmospheric circulation sea level pressure and geopotential height fields and important atmospheric circulation indices eg the north atlantic oscillation the eurosiberian oscillation enso covering the last 500 years they will encompass range of spatial scales from local site through subcontinental averages and for temperature hemispheric mean and different temporal integration discrete representation of interannual decadal and century time scales there is wealth of long good quality instrumental climate records documentary data and highresolution and welldated palaeoclimate data in europe particularly but also recently produced in many other northern hemisphere locations because they derive from different research projects different laboratories and different disciplines very many of these have never been brought together the opportunity is now available to do this and provide major improvement over the last published compendium of similar data produced by mann et in 199814 this workpackage will provide major enhancement of our capability to explore and redefine the nature of natural climate variability for several centuries both before and during the period of extensive observational climate records we will assemble many published and many newunpublished documentary climate records and highquality palaeoclimate records from europe and across the northern hemisphere within timeframe of the last 500 years in specific cases eg for many treeringderived variables the palaeodata will be reprocessed so as to correct variance bias associated with timedependent sample replication at individual collection sites to decompose the data into selected spectral ie period bands with their associated statistical error and to extract longer time scale multidecadal to century variance based on recently published technique not as yet applied at the small regional scale or to the vast majority of the treering data these proxy data will be climatically screened by comparison with climate data to identify appropriate climate variables with which to calibrate the palaeorecords in order to provide optimal seasonal and annual mean climate estimates combination of different regression and neural network techniques will be used the derived prediction estimates will be rigorously validated using reserved independent predictand data and reconstruction uncertainty will be calculated and expressed with regard to changes in both time and timescale where necessary the calibration will be carried out at different timescales ie annualdecadal decadalmultidecadal multidecadalcentury in order to better exploit the various sensitivities of the records and to allow cross comparison and appropriate amalgamation of the resulting data very extensive collections of highresolution treering data annual ringwidth and ringdensity measurements will be amalgamated for the first time these include many data from northern europe the alps the pyrenees north africa spain italy north america russia and china in different regions these data provide very good evidence of different climate parameters summer temperature variability summer drought winter precipitation all continuous and seasonally resolved many additional treering data including numerous strongly drought sensitive chronologies from western and eastern north america and mexico will also be available to the project in addition to the highresolution treering data selected additional records some published some uncalibrated some with lower temporal resolution will be used to derive corroborative evidence about multidecadal and longer time scale variability of climate these include icecore accumulation and chemical isotope

scales while some proxy data are representative of only single sites palaeo reconstructions are not exact and have quantifiable uncertainty range associated with them and proxy data include noise with varying spatiotemporal characteristics due to processes unrelated to largescale climate the forced model response will be evaluated by comparing simulated and proxy variability for variety of

into account uncertainties in the palaeo data and the models for this purpose we will evaluate bayesian analysis methods where prior eg modelderived beliefs can be updated in the light of new proxy data and statistical reconstruction techniques that in previous studies rely on the covariance structure of climate estimated using the relatively short and possibly anthropogenciallycontaminated instrumental records of the 20th century these new estimates of natural variability as well as the separate estimates from the palaeo and model data will be used by partners 2 and 3 in detection and attribution framework to interpret proxy data in the light of simulated climate change and to see if recent climate changes are unusual for different variables and on different spatial and time scales as dictated by the availability of different proxies in the context of natural climate variability over the last 500 years these results will be compared to earlier detection and attribution studies

sea level variations associated with oceanic temperature thermal expansion and circulation changes are simulated by model b and can be readily diagnosed from the model simulations globallydistributed reducedform glacier melt model will be run after the climate simulations have been completed taking temperature patterns simulated by the models as input to estimate mountain glacier mass balance change and hence glaciermelt contribution to sea level variations this glaciermelt term will be combined with the estimated range of background melting of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets and both will be distributed over the oceans this procedure will be applied by partner 2 to all model simulations usedgenerated by soap 1000year control integrations from models and b 15002000 and

localscale variability and variations on time scales shorter than 50 years the various simulations will be utilised to assess how large regionalscale sea level variability is relative to

simulated sea level variations will be subject to various uncertainties including uncertainty related to initial conditions which will be maintained over period of time dependent upon the response time of oceans and glaciers and uncertainty related to glacier melt sensitivity the melt model is currently tuned to reproduce presentday shortterm responses of each glacier to temperature changes but
