industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116water infrastructure needs and investment review and analysis of key issues summary policymakers are giving increased attention to issues associated with financing and investing in the nations drinking water and wastewater treatment systems which take in water treat it nd distribute it to households nd other customers and later collect treat and discharge water after us the renewed attention is due to combination of factors these include financial impacts on communities of meeting existing and anticipated regulatory requirements the need to repair and replace existing infrastructure concerns about pa ying for securityrelated projects and proposals to stimulate us economic activity by building and rebuilding the nations infrastructure the federal government has long histor of involvement with wastewater and drinking water systems with the environm ental protection agency epa having the most significant role both in terms of regulation and funding the us department of agriculture also plays an important role in rural communities through its water and wastewater loan and grant programs th programs have been popular however states local communities and others have asserted that various program gaps and limitations may be diminishing their potential effectiveness they also point to the emergence of new infrastructure needs and issues number of interest groups and coalitions have issued reports on infrastructure funding needs and related policy issues as have epa and the congressional budget office cbo they present range of estimates and scenarios of future investment costs and gaps between current spending and future costs epa and cbo in particular caution that projections of fu ture costs are highly uncertain and that funding gaps are not inevitable increased investment sought by many stakeholders is one way to shrink the spending gaps but so too are other strategies such as asset management more efficient pr icing and better technology congressional interest in these issues has grown for some time and continued in the 110th congress in each of the past four congresses house and senate committees acted on legislation to reauthorize and modify infrastructure financing programs in the clean water act and safe drinking water act but bills were enacted the bush administration has addr essed water infrastructure in number of general ways but did not offer legisla tive proposals of its own epas principal initiative has been to support strategies intended to ensure that infrastructure investment needs are met in an efficient timely and equitable manner this report identifies number of issues that have received attention in connection with water infrastructure investme nt it begins with review

are part of rger multipurpose projects for irrigation flood control power supply and recreation that typi cally are built or assisted by the bureau of reclamation and the us army corps of engineerswater infrastructure needs and investment review and analysis of key issues introduction drinking water and wastewater treatment systems treat and safeguard the nations water resources drinking water utilities have the task of supplying safe potable water to customers in both the proper quantity and quality wastewater utilities operate facilities that clean the flow of used water from community the federal government has had significant involvement with these systems for many years both through setting standards to prot ect public health and the environment and through funding to assist them in mee ting standards while funding of water infrastructure programs has been addr essed annually throug h the congressional appropriations process aut horizing legislation affecting policy and program issues was last enacted in 1996 for drinking wa ter infrastructure and 1987 for wastewater infrastructure1 more recently water infrastructure issues have been receiving increased attention by policymakers and legi slators the renewed attention is due to combination of several factors meeting regulatory requirements financial impacts of meeting regulatory requirements some ne w some longstanding are continuing issue for many communities in the case of drinking water systems the most pressing rules are new either recently issued or pending as the result of standardsetting by the environmental protection agency epa to implement the safe drinking water act amendments of 1996 many of th rulemakings were initiated under amendments passed in 1986 these rules impose new or stricter drinking water limits on numerous contaminants including arsenic radioactive contaminants and microbials and disinfection byproducts among others for wa stewater systems principal regulatory requirements mandated by the clean water act have not changed since 1972 and the majority of communities have achieved or are in the process of achieving compliance the newer issue for wastewater systems is the cost of controls and practices to manage what are termed wet weather pollution problems such as urban stormwater runoff and overflows from municipal sewers thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs2 2 american water works association dawn of the replacement era reinvesting in drinking water infrastructure may 2001 p 5 hereafter cited as awwa report 3 american water works association protecting our water drinking water security in american after 911 executive summary 2003requirements are old in the sense that most wastewater utilities have not addressed longstanding wet weat her problems but they also are new because in many communities specific measures are only now being identified financing infrastructure repair or replacement more recent focus by stakeholders is on the need to repair and replace infrastructure that has been in place for decades and will soon fail many believe according to the american water works association awwa we stand at the dawn of the replacement era replacement needs are large and on the way there will be growing conflict between the need to replace wornout infrastructure and the need to invest in compliance with new regulatory standards2 over the long term these stakeholders say higher level of investment than is occu rring today is required for both wastewater and drinking water systems key concern is that epas funding programs the largest sour ces of federal assistance do not in the main support repair and re placement their focus is upgrades and new construction needed to achieve wastewater and drinking water standards security beyond the traditional infra structure needs related to regulatory compliance and system repair and expansion the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 genera ted new investment needs for drinking water and wastewater systems the national costs of addressing water and wastewater security needs have not been quantified however the awwa estimated that municipal water systems would have to spend more than 16 billion just to ensure control of access to critical water system assets3 this estimate does not include the capital costs of upgrades to address vulnerabilities that water system managers have identified in vulnerability assessments or the costs facing wastewater systems and smaller drinking water systems although epa has identified range of security measures that are eligib for funding through traditional infrastructure assistance programs competition already is severe for these funds which are primarily used for projects needed to meet regulatory requirements problems that do not fit existing solutions for some an interest in water infrastructure legislation derives from concern that traditional federal progra ms and financing appr oaches do not fit well with some current types of needs points at issue vary but the common thread is that certain needs are not being well met by programmatic solutions that now exist in some cases metropolitanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs3 4 for background see crs report rl30478 federally supported water supply and wastewater treatment programs by betsy cody claudia copeland mary tiemann nicole t carter and jeffrey zinndrinking water systems for exam ple there is perception that epas programs are more geared to aiding small systems than large ones in other cases the concern is how to fund types of projects that include mixed elements eg developing new community water supplies and treating that water especially in rural areas that do not meet traditional program definitions or are seemingly spread across jurisdictions of multiple federal agencies still others believe that expanding program eligibility to include water conservation projects could reduce overall needs for capita l investment another concern arises in small dispersed communities where onsite treatment systems may be preferable to centralized facilities however onsite treatment generally is not eligible for federal aid at issue for congress is whether to modify ex isting programs to address such needs or to address them in gislation individually and caseby case4 other legislative models and activity legislative approaches for other types of infrastructure especially surface transportation and aviation have suggested possible models for water infrastructure financing the federal highway and mass transit and aviation programs are supported by trust f unds derived from fees and taxes paid by users of those systems and facilities some pr oponents of water infrastructure spending cerned about gap between needs and available funds believe that an initiative based on federal water trust fund would conceptually be logical followon to the surface transportation and aviation programs according to that view passage of those measures could give momentum to enacting new budget authority for water in frastructure spending as well still differences are apparent especially the fact that unlike surface transportation and aviation there is comparable dedicated trust fund for water infrastructure or easily identifiable revenue source for trust fund while surface tran sportation and aviation may offer ideas and momentum they also may be imperfect models for water unless dedicated revenue sources for water trust fund can be identified changed dynamics at the fe deral level about who should and can pay for many years focu s on federal ficit reduction restrained the federal govern ment from making major new investments in water infrastructure or other new programs early in this decade forecasts of budgetar surplus encouraged variety of interests to advocate increasing the federal commitment to water infrastructure but beginning in 2001 estimates of surplus changed to large federal deficits especially associated with spending on the nations heightened priorities of defense and homeland securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs4 following the september 11 terrorist attacks by mid2007 the congressional budget office cbo and others observed that the federal budgetary situation was improving but cbo cautioned that the united states continues to face severe longterm budgetary challenges throughout this period the nations fiscal environment has severely constraine d arguments by proponent s of greater federal investment and larger federal expenditures fo r water infrastructure by mid2008 conditions encouragin g more federal investment in infrastructure facilities water transportation and other types appeared to emerge not due to strengthened us economy but rather as result of widesp read economic slowdown which led many to advocate infrastructure spending as one component of programs to stimulate economic activity and create jobs while many academic and government st udies have found that the impact of infrastructure spending on econo mic activity is modest and long in coming pressure for economic stimulus has combined with the issues described above and discussed in this report to draw greater attention to infrastructure investment this report identifies number of issues receiving attention in connection with water infrastructure it begins with br ief review of federal involvement describes the debate about funding needs and then ex amines key issues including what is the nature of the problems to be solved who will pay and what is the federal role and questions about mechanisms for delivering federal support including statebystate allotment recent congressional and administration activity on these issues also is reviewed background history of federal involvement the federal government s lengthy history of i nvolvement with wastewater and drinking water systems the histor of financial assistance is longer for wastewater than for drinking water however epa has the most significant role both in terms of re gulation and funding wastewater the water pollution control act of 1948 pl 80845 was the first comprehensive statement of federal interest in clean water programs while it contained federally required goals limits or even guidelines it started the trickle of federal aid to municipal wastewater treatment authorities that grew in subsequent years it established grant program to assist localities with planning and design work and authorized loans for treatme nt plant construction capped at 250000 or onethird of construction costs whichever was less with each successive statute in the 1950s and 1960s federal assistance to m unicipal treatment agencies increased construction grant program replaced the loan program the amount of authorized funding went up the percenta ge of total costs covered by federal funds was raised and the types of project costs deem ed granteligible were expanded httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs5 5 for discussion of several of these factor s see water pollution control federation now the water environment federation the clean water act with amendments 1982 p 14in the federal water pollution contro l act amendments of 1972 pl 92500 popularly known as the clean water act 33 usc 1251 et seq congress totally revised the existing federal clean water law including with regard to wastewater systems at the time there was widespread recognition of water quality problems nationwide and frustration over the slow pace of industrial and municipal cleanup efforts under existing programs in the 1972 law congress strengthened the federal role in clean water and established national standards for treatment mandating that all publicly owned treatment works ach ieve minimum of secondary treatment defined in epa regulations as removing 85 of incoming wastes or more stringent treatment where necessary to meet local water quality standards and set july 1 1977 deadline for meeting secondary treatme nt number of new conditions were attached to projects constructed with gran ts in exchange federal funds increased dramatically the federal share was raised from 55 to 75 and annual authorizations were 5 billion in fy 1973 6 billion in fy1974 and 7 billion in fy1975 in 1977 the grant program was reau thorized through fy1982 annual authorizations were 5 billion for each of the last four years covered by that act pl 95217 some restrictions were imposed including requi rements that states set aside portion of funds for innovative and alternative technology projects and for projects in rural areas in addition the type s of eligible project s were limited in order to focus use of federal funds on projects w ith environmental bene fits in preference to projects aiding community growth wh the program was again reauthorized in 1981 pl 97117 congress and the admin istration agreed to significant restrictions out of concern that the prog rams wide scope was not properly focused on key goals budgetary pressures and sire to reduce federal spending also were concerns annual authoriza tions under this act were 24 billion the federal share was reduced to 55 and project eligibilities were limited further the 1972 law required needs survey ever two years to adjust the statutory allotment formula by which grant funds we re divided among the states in this survey epa compiles state data to estimate capital costs for water quality projects and other activities elig ible for support under the clean water act from an initial estimate of 63 billion in 1973 the survey figure went to high of 342 b illion in 1974 dropped to 96 billion in 1976 rose to 106 billion in 1978 120 billion in 1980 declined to 80 billion in 1990 was assessed at 1395 billion in 1996 and rose to 1812 billion in 2000 the most recent survey inconsiste ncies and variations have been ascribed to several factors including the lack of precision with which needs for some project categories could be ssessed especially in the early years and the desire of state estimators to use the needs survey as way of keeping their share of the federal allotment as high as possible5 however epa believes that recent surveys produce credible data because of the requirement that needs must be justified by projects pecific documentation by the mid1980s there was considerable policy debate between congress and the administration over the future of the construction grants program and inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs6 particular the appr opriate federal role throug h fy1984 congress d appropriated nearly 41 billion under this program representing the largest nonmilitary public works programs since the interstate highway system the grants program was target of the reagan administrations budg et cutters who sought to redirect budget priorities and establish what they viewed as the appropriate governmental roles in number of domestic policy areas including water pollution control thus for budgetary reasons and the belief that the backlog of wastewater projects identified in 1972 had largely been completed the r eagan administration sought phaseout of the acts construction grants program by 1990 many states and localities which continued to support the acts water quality goals and programs did support the idea of phasing out the grants program since ma ny were critical of what they viewed as burdensome rules and regulations that accompanied the receipt of federal grant money however they sought longer transition and ample flexibility to set up long term financing to promote stat and local selfsufficiency congresss response to this debate was contained in 1987 amendments to the act pl 1004 it authorized 18 b illion over nineyear period for sewage treatment plant constr uction through combination of the traditional grant program and new state water pollution control re volving funds srf program under the new program federal capitalization gran ts would be provided as seed money for stateadministered loans to build sewage tr eatment plants and eventually other water quality projects cities in turn would repay loans to the state enabling phaseout of federal involvement wh ile the state built up source of capital for future investments allotment of the srf capita lization grants among states continues to be governed by statutory formula wh ich congress revised in 1987 see discussion below allotment of funds under th amendments the srf program was phased in beginning in fy1989 and entirely replaced the previous grant program in fy1991 the intention was that states would have greater flexibility to set priorities and administer funding while fede ral aid would end after fy1994 municipalities have made substantial progress towards meeting the goals and requirements of the act yet state water quality reports continue to indicate that discharges from wastewater treatment plants are significant source of water quality impairments nationwide in the 2000 nationa l water quality inve ntory report states reported that municipal wastewater treatment plants contribute to water quality impairments of rivers streams and lakes and are the most widespread source of pollution affecting estuarine waters the authorizations provided in the 1987 amendments expired in fy1994 but pre ssure to extend federal funding has continued in part because estimated needs remain so high thus congress has continued to appropriate f unds and the anticipated shift to full state responsibility has not yet occurred through fy2008 congress has appropr iated 783 billion in clean water act assistance including 262 billion in srf capitalization grants drinking water public water systems are regulated under the safe dr inking water act sdwa of 1974 pl 93523 as amended 42 u sc 300f300j c ongress enacted the sdwa after nationwide

customers tncwss generally are required to comply only with regulations for contaminants that pose immediate health risks such as microbial cont aminants with the proviso that systems that use surface water sources must also comply with filtration and disinfection regulationscommunities of all sizes the 1974 law gave epa substantial di scretionary authority to regulate contaminants that occur in public drinking water supplies and authorized epa to delegate primary implementation and enforcement authority for the public water system supervision program to the states sdwa drinking water regulations pply to more than 158000 public water systems both privately and publicly owned systems that provide piped water for human consumption to at least 15 service conn ections or that regularly serve at least 25 people of these systems 52837 are community water systems cwss that serve residential populations yearround roughly 15 of community systems are investorowned all federa l regulations apply to these systems more than 19100 water systems are nontransient noncomm unity water systems ntncwss such as schools or factories that have their own water supply and rve the same people for more than six months but not yea rround most drinking water requirements apply to these systems6 in contrast to the 40plus years of federal support for financing municipal wastewater treatment fac ilities congress relatively r ecently in 1996 established program under sdwa to help public wate r systems finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations funding support for drinking water only occurred more recently for several reasons until the 1980s the number of drinking water regulations was fairly small and public water systems often did not need to make large investme nts in treatment technologies to meet those regulations relatedly good quality drinking water tr aditionally had been available to many communities at relatively low cost by comparison essentially all communities have had to construct or upgrade sewage treatment facilities to meet the requirements of the 1972 clean water act in addition when the sdwa was first enacted few expected that the number of small less economical water systems would continue to increase over time drinking water circumstances have changed as communities have grown and commercial industrial agricu ltural and residen tial landuses have become more concentrated thus resulting in more contaminants reaching drinking water sources moreover as the number of federal drinking water standards and related monitoring require ments have increased many communities have found that their water may not have been as good as once thought and that additional treatment was needed to meet the new standards nd protect public health from 1986 to 1996 for example the number of regulated dri nking water contaminants grew from 23 to 83 epa and the states began expressing gr eater concern that many of the nations community water systems 44000 or 83 of all cwss of which were small were likely to lack the financial capacity to meet the rising costs of complying with sdwa requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs8 7 for more information see crs report rs22037 drinking water state revolving fund program overview and issues by mary tiemanncongress responded to these concerns with the 1996 sdwa amendments pl 104182 which established drinking wa ter state revolving loan fund dwsrf program to help public water systems finance projects needed to comply with sdwa regulations and to further the public health protection objectives of the act this program patterned after the clean water act srf authorizes epa to make grants to states to capitalize dwsrfs which states then use to make loans to water systems states are required to match 20 of their federal capitalization grant and must make available 15 of their grant for loan assistance to small systems communities repay loans into the fund thus making resources av ailable for projects in other communities eligible project s include installation and replacement of treatment facilities distribution systems and certain storage facilities projects to replace aging infrastructure are eligible if they are needed to maintain compliance or to further public health protection goals public water systems eligible to receive dwsrf assistance include community water systems whether publicly or privately owned and notforprofit noncommunity water systems the law ge nerally prohibits states from providing dwsrf assistance to systems that lack the capacity to comply with the act or that are in significant noncompliance with sd wa requirements unless these systems meet certain conditions to return to compliance although the law authorizes assistance to privately owned community water systems some states have laws or policies that preclude privately owned utilities from receiving dwsrf assistance appropriations for the program were authorized at 599 million for fy1994 and 1 billion annually for fy1995 throug h fy2003 although the funding authority for the dwsrf program has expired cong ress continues to appropriate funds through fy2008 congress has provided 103 billion for this program congress added several new features to the dwsrf program to reflect experience gained under the clean water ac t program and differences between the drinking water and wastewat er industries key difference in the dwsrf is that privately owned as well as publicly owned systems are eligible for funding another distinction is that states may use up to 30 of their dwsrf grant to provide additional assistance such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans to help economically disadvantaged communities7 paralleling the clean water act the sdwa requires epa to assess the capital improvement needs of eligible public water systems needs surveys must be prepared every four years in contrast to the cwa which includes statutory allotment formula for srf capitalization grants epa must distribute dwsrf funds among the states based on the results of the latest survey eligible systems include roughly 55000 public and private comm unity water systems and 21400 notfor profit noncommunity water systems see table 1 for comparison of key features of the clean water and

exceeds the 2001 needs survey estimate of 1509 billion 1655 billion in 2003 dollars by more than 60 epa attribut ed this increase to several factors such as the inclusion in the latest survey of 1 billion in securityrelated needs as well as funds needed for compliance with several new and pending regula tions also water systems improved their assessment of needs for infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement in 2003 which epa determined had been underreported in previous surveys with the number of regulated drinking water contaminants now exceeding 90 and with more rules

for individual projects developed by the department of the interiors bureau of reclamation and the us army corps of engineers key practical difference between these projects and epa and usda programs is that with individual project authorizations there is predictable assistance or assurance of funding once project is au thorized for more discussi on see crs report rl 30478 federally supported water supply and wastewater treatment programs by betsy cody claudia copeland mary tiemann nicole t carter and jeffrey zinnusda assistance programs while epa administers the largest federal water infrastructure assistance programs the us department of agricu lture usda also provides funding it administers grant and loan programs av ailable to communities with populations of 10000 or less thus benef itting small communities ma ny of which have had problems obtaining assistance through th cwa and sdwa loan programs many small towns have limited financial t echnical and legal resources and have encountered difficulties in qualifying for and repaying loans they often lack opportunities for economies of scale or an industrial tax base and thus face the prospect of high per capita user fees to repay loan for the full cost of sewage treatment or drinki ng water project usdas grant and loan programs are aut horized by the rural development act of 1972 as amended 7 usc 1926 th purpose of these usda programs is to provide basic amenities alleviate health hazards and promote the orderly growth of the nations rural areas by meeting the n eed for new and improved rural water and waste disposal facilities loans and grants are made for projects needed to meet health or sanitary standards including cl ean water standards and safe drinking water act requirements in recent years usda officials have increased their coordination with state clean water and drinking water officials in administering their programs they have done this both to better meet health and envir onmental goals and to minimize program redunda ncies andor inc onsistencies for fy2008 congress appropriated 5354 million for us das water and waste disposal grant and loan programs about 16 million less than in fy20079 context for the water infrastructure debate investment needs some of the factors that have led to increased attention to water infrastructure reflect longstanding concerns for example how cities will meet regulatory requirements while others are more r ecent such as new analyses of broader funding needs including maintenance and repair of older systems number of interest groups many with longstanding involvement as well as new groups and coalitions have assisted in bringing attention to these issues among them are the water infrastructure network win coalition of 29 state municipal environmental professional and bor groups organized in 1999 and the h2o coalition organized in 2001 consisting of the national association of water companies the water and wastewater

more than 1 trillion in om spending is required second win report issued in 2001 recommended multibillion dollar investment program in water infrastructure11 epa needs surveys epas contribution to the debate over needs is primarily its wastewater and drinking water needs surveys the safe drinking water act re quires epa to assess the capital improvement needs of eligible public water systems every four years thereafter concurrently and in consultation with the indian health service and indian tribes epa must assess needs for drinking water treatment facilities to serve indian tribes similarly the clean wa ter act requires epa in cooperation with states to report biennially to congress on the cost of construction of all needed publicly owned wastewater treatment works in the united states in reality the clean water needs survey is done every four years drinking water needs the most recent drinking water needs survey conducted in 2003 and issued in june 2005 covers the period from 2003 through 2023 as noted above the survey indicates that systems need to invest 2768 billion in drinking water infrastructure improveme nts over 20 years to comply with drinking water regulations and to ensu re the provision of safe water this amount exceeds the 2001 needs survey estimate of 1655 billion in 2003 dollars by more than 60 the 2003 survey includes funds needed for compliance with several recent regulations including the revised arsenic and radium rules nd pending rules for radon and other contaminants it also id entified 1 billion in securityrelated needs also water systems made efforts to impr ove reporting of needs for infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement which ep determined had been underreported in the previous surveys of the total national need of 2768 billion 1605 billion 60 is currently needed to ensure the provision of safe drinking water epa notes that current need typically involves installing upgrading or replacing infrastructure to allow system to

possibilities that could occur according to cbo and present range of estimate s for each reflecting the limited information available about existing water infrastructur for example cbo said there is accessible inventory of the age and condition of pipes which account for the majority of both drinking water and wastewater system s assets as suc h shortage of data compounds the general analytic problem of making 20year estimates of what would happen under current and curre ntly anticipated trends cbo estimated that for the years 2000 to 2019 annual costs for investment will range between 116 billion and 201 billion for drinking water systems and between 130 billion and 209 billion for wastewater systems or between 246 billion and 410 billion for water and wa stewater combined in 2001

252 billi on for wastewater systems or between 460 and 570 billion for water and wastewater combined the principal differences in costs unde r cbos two scenarios reflect different assumptions about several fact ors 1 the rate at which drinking water pipes will be replaced 2 savings that may be associat ed with improved efficiency eg demand management to reduce peak usage conso lidation of systems to achieve economies of scale labor productivity 3 the co sts to wastewater utilities for controlling combined sewer overflows and 4 th repayment period on borrowed funds17 cbo estimated that for both types of systems the difference between current capital spending approx imately 22 billion by all levels of gove rnment in 1999 and future costs what some call an inve stment funding gap would be 30 billion annually in the lowcost scenario and 194 billion in the highcost case together the future costs under the lowcost scen ario which cbo believes is reasonable given the uncertainty

current annual spending levels wins si ngle point estimate of nnual investment needs for drinking water and wastew ater 40 billion is similar to cbos highcost case estimate in contrast cbos lowcost cas estimate is 157 billion less than that in the win report see table 2 because of differences in assumptions concerning the timeline for replacing drinking water pipes savings from efficiency and borrowing terms overall in examining the 2000 win re port cbo was critical of number of analytic aspects in particular while win includes financing costs in its analysis wins estimates of total capital investment needs do not reflect costs as financed costs as financed conveys the full costs of investments made out of funds on hand during the period analyzed and the debt servi ce principal and interest paid in those years on new and prior investments that we re financed through borrowing costs as financed are kind of moving average that smooths out yeartoyear changes in investment volume in contrast win s 2000 report includes total debt service on new investments from 2000 to 2019 regardless of when those payments occur rather than the debt service actually paid during the period on both pre2000 and new investments the difference is important according to cbo because utilities past investments financed from 1980 to 1999 nd still being paid off from 2000 to 2019 are smaller than the investments projected to be financed during the latter period wins approach to estimating investment needs capital plus financing results in approximately 20 overe stimate according

of wet weather pollutionwhat is the precise problem to be solved who will pay and what is the federal role in that process and how to deliver federal support priorities what are th problems to be solved defining the scope of the water infrast ructure problem is key issue as described previously traditionally the cwa and sdwa have assisted projects needed to upgrade and improve wastew ater and drinking water systems for compliance with federal standards there still are significant needs for those core projects for example the 2003 clean water needs survey re ports that more than one half of the 171 billion in to tal treatment needs are for projects to correct overflows from existing municipal sewers particularly sanitary sewer overflows ssos24 the epa estimates that of the 2768 billion in drinking water needs 45 billion 16 is required for water systems to comply with regulations however these needs are expected to increase as the number of sdwa standards grows relatedly 165 billion 60 of total needs is for projects that water utilities consider high priority for ensuring the continued deliv ery of safe drinking water infrastructure replacement while not disregarding needs for compliance related projects stakeholders also are fo cusing on the problem of projects that have not traditionally been eligible under fede ral aid programs major repair and replacement of existing systems currently federal funds may be used for projects that involve minor system repairs suc h as correcting leaky pipes that allow infiltration or inflow of gr oundwater into sewer lines but may not be used for major rehabilitation or extensive re pair of existing sewers that are collapsing or are structurally unsound in many cities syst ems that currently meet standards and provide adequate service are according to advocacy groups reaching the end of their servicelife and will require substantial investment in the near future the american water works associations 2001 report focuse d solely on the need to reinvest in aging drinking water infrastructure it estimates that nationally over the next 30 years 250 billion may be required to replace worn out facilities and systems the replacem ent problem is occurring not becau of neglect or failure to do routine maintenance awwa and others say but because water infrastructure facilities and pipes in stalled decades ago are now wearing out most pipes were installed and paid for by past generations in response to population growth and economic development booms of the 1890s world war i 1920s and postworld war ii the oldest cast iron pipes dating from the late 1800s have an average useful life of about 120 years while pipes installed after world war ii have an average life of 75 years the useful life of pipe varies considerably based on such factors as soil conditions materials used and character of the water flowing through it also pipe deteriorates more rapidly later in the life cycle than initially awwa says

hotly debated topic in the 1980s there was much debate among policymakers about an infrastructure funding gap and the need for federal solutions to the perceived problem that americas public facilities were wearing out faster than they were being replaced some said that because of declining public investment americas infrastructure was in ruins an alysts proposed strategies for planning financing and managing i nvestments to address decay of the nations public works infrastructure26 after period of publicity nd attention debate about an infrastructure crisis waned congress did not enact legislation creating substantially new federal approaches to infrastructure but did reauthorize funding for several existing programs including wastewater today analysts may differ over whether an infrastructure crisis did in fact exist then and whether local officials made choices sufficient to defer the issue for later day in the end this earlier infrastructur debate resulted in little obvious action and without the breakdowns some had warned of however the current concerns may reflect new situation awwa says that the replacement problem being debated today is not that utilities are faced with maki ng up for historical gap in the level of replacement funding rather it is that utilities must ramp up budgets to prevent replacement gap from developing in the near future that is to avoid getting behind security with the exception of the latest epa drinking water needs survey none of the investment needs reports discussed previously win report or those by cbo and epa accounts for increased secur ityrelated needs that utilities have begun to identify in its 2002 report cbo said because water systems are still developing estimates of the costs for increasing security in the wake of the september 11 attacks the estimates do not include those expenses but preliminary reports suggest that security costs will be relatively small compared with the other costs for investment in infrastructure27 one partial estimate for wastewater systems reported that among large wastewater utilities operators identifie d 135 million in securityrelated needs for the period 20022006 with

quantified and poten tially small relative to overall infrastructure needs the costs of addressing security concerns for drinking water systems are expected to be significant the bioterrorism preparedness act of 2002 pl 107188 required all community wa ter systems serving more than 3300 persons to assess their vulnerabilities to terrorist attack or other intentional acts to disrupt the provision of safe and reliable drinking water supplies having done so many of these systems now are taking or planning to take steps to improve the security of their facilities and to protect s ources of drinking water the awwa has estimated that the roughly 8400 commun ity water systems covered by the bioterrorism act would have to spend mo re than 16 billion just to implement the most basic steps needed to improve s ecurity such as better controlling access to facilities with fences locks perimeter lights and alarms at critical locations this estimate does not include the capital costs of upgrades to address vulnerabilities identified in vulnerability assessments such as hardening pumping stations chemical storage buildings transmission mains addi ng redundant infrastructure or relocating pipelines of facilities efforts to estimate costs have been hampered by the fact that the security measures needed for utilities are very sitespecific however the awwa estimates that nationwide community water systems will need to invest billions of dollars to address identified vulnerabilities29 the total security need estimated from the 2003 drinking water needs survey is 1 billion according to epa the survey provides only partial estimate of security needs as it was done while water systems were expanding their security evaluation and planning efforts many water systems had completed vulnerability assessments and corrective action plans but they frequently lacked cost estimates for making security improvements epa expects that such needs will be reported more thoroughly in future assessments30 to cover the costs of making security improvements some water utilities have imposed rate increases or reallocated exis ting resources however many others have been increasing rates to pay for projects needed to comply with new regulations but had not contemplated the need for additional resources to address security concerns asserting that homeland security is prima rily federal respons ibility and that the needs are large some individual communities and water associations have approached congress in search of assistance31 in the bioterrorism preparedness

eligible for assistance under the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds however these funds are used primarily to comply with safe drinking water act and clean water act requireme nts

water srfs may provide assist ance for expenditures that will facilitate compliance with national drinking water regulations or that will significantly further the health protection objectives of the safe drinking water act there are many proposals for expanding the scope of activitie s eligible for srf funding in addition to meeting major replacement and securityrelated needs raising numerous tradeoff questions for policymakers past legislative proposals such as hr 720 and s 3500 in the 110th congress and s 1400 in the 109th congress would have added number of new types of projects to those already eligible for srf assistance water conservation water reuse reclamation or recycling measures to in crease facility security and implementation of source water protection plans for exam ple the rationale for using federal assistance is that investments in some of these approaches could reduce overall needs for capital investment all arguably could benefit water quality protection and improvement as do traditional infrastru cture investments and supporting them through the popular mechanism of srfs w ould help ensure comparatively secure funding but expanding the scope of elig ibility also arguably dilutes the current focus of these programs at time when traditional needs remain high this tension already exists with the wide range of set asides authorized under the drinking

investment in managing nonpoint sources of water pollution would especially benefit public health and water quality according to state data compiled by epa polluted runoff is the major source of water quality problems in the united states water quality survey data indicate that 40 of surveyed us waterbodies are impaired by pollution meanin g that waters fail to meet applicable standards and that surface runoff from diffu areas such as farm and ranch land construction sites and mining and timber operations is the chief cause of impairments while municipal point sources contribute much smaller percentage of water quality impairments to most waters35 the possible cost of practices and measures to address the nonpoint pollution problems has not been comprehensively documented neverthe less it is conceivable that investments in nonpoint pollution abatement eg grants for nonpoint pollu tion management projects under the clean water act technical and financial ssistance to farmers through usda safe drinking water act grants to protect sour ces of drinking wate r could have equal or greater environmental benefit than investments in water infrastructure for example new york city is funding an extensiv watershed protecti on program including areas far from the metropolitan area in an effort to avoid the need to build filtration plant that would cost the city several billion dollars growing populations in many areas of the country are placing increasing demands on water supplies and wastewater treatment facilities yet even without new growth many people in existing sma ll and rural communities do not have access to public sewers or water s upply and thus are using alternative systems to help them comply with environmental laws and to solve public health problems local officials face challenge of striking balance between ensuring that water and wastewater services are affordable but also providing sufficient reve nue for system needs to deliver these services they often face ch allenges arising from economic geographic and technological impediments outside of epas and usdas traditional programs it appears that congress is increasingly being asked to authorize direct financial and technical assistance for developing or tr eating water including rural water supply projects to be built and largely funded by the bureau of reclamation of the department of the interior water recycling projects built and partially funded by the bureau and pilot programs for water s upply and wastewater treatment projects funded by the us army corps of engineer s to yet

state and local sources data compiled by epa demonstrate that federal capitalization grants are the largest but not the only source of monies in the srfs for example cumulatively from 1996 through 2005 drinking water srfs have had 113 billion in funds available for projects of the total 66 billion was provided by capitalization grants while the remainder more than 5 billion came from state match contributions leveraged bonds principal repayments and in terest earnings likewise cumulatively from 1988 through 2006 clean water srfs ve had 53 billion in funds available slightly less than half 24 billion has come from fede ral capitalization grants while the remainder similarly derived from state matching funds leveraged bonds principal repayments and interest earnings in ddition state assistance outside of the srf programs is an important source of total f unds available for water infrastructure for example from fy1991 through fy2000 stat made about 135 billion available for drinking water and wastewater proj ects under state sponsored gr ant and loan programs and by selling genera l obligation and revenue bonds36 local government officials estimate that on average

programs to support water infrastructure direct project grants and srf capitalization grants as well as credit subsidies in the form of loans loan gu arantees and tax preferences can have number of unintended consequences in february 2005 report one of regular biennial series on the budgetary implicati ons of policy choices one of the policy options that cbo presents is phaseout of federal capitalization grants for srfs over threeyear transition period cbo cites several economic rati onales for doing so for example grants may encourage ineffi cient decisions about water infrastructure by allowing states to lend money at belowmarket interest rates in turn reducing incentives for local governments to find less costly ways to control water pollution and provide safe drinking water also federal cont ributions may not result in increased total investment if they are rely replacing funding that state and local sources would otherwise have provided45 in its 2001 report win recommended initially doubling federal support for water infrastructure and increasing it by 500 after five years others including the h2o coalition doubt that increased federal s upport of that magnitude is necessary or appropriate even if policymakers agree that there is federal role significant questions remain about defining that role and agreeing on priorities delivering federal support the question of how federal financial support is delivered to water infrastructure projects involves several issues incl uding the statelevel mechanism for administering funding composition of aid loans and grants and assistance for private as well as public entities related issues are impacts of other federal requirements use of setasides nd how funds are allotted to states administrative entity financial aid provided th rough the clean water and drinking water srfs is administered by statelevel agencies designated in agreements signed by epa and individual states many evolved from the agencies that previously administered the clean water act construction grant program that preceded the srf program in many states srfs are managed by the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs26 environmental agency or branches of that agency responsible for implementing the cwa and the sdwa in other states th ey are managed by separate financing authorities or offices about 30 states currently administer the two srf programs jointly the remainder administer parallel srf programs state officials say that where administration of the two is not join ed there are good reasons for maintaining the separation section 302 of the 1996 sdwa amendments included provision allowing states to transfer portion up to 33 of capitalization grant between the two programs to give states funding flex ibility that original authority expired in fy2001 but congress has continued to exte nd it through annual appropriations acts since fy2002 since 1999 13 states and puer to rico have used this provision to transfer funds between their clean wa ter and drinking wa ter srf programs in its 2001 report win recommended that the srf concept be replaced with an alternative mechanism called state water and wastewater infrastructure financing authorities which would work with state clean water and drinking water programs but would handle the infrastructure banking aspects for both win says that this would be highly efficient enabling single state agency to determine priorities and appropriate financ ial assistance instruments most state officials now involved with the two srf programs object to this propos believing that it would deconstruct what exists and is working well now it would also substitute new organizational entity for that which individual states have determined works best for them including the 20 states that prefer separate srf programs also by giving decisionmaking authority to new entity the win concept would shift authority from existing state agencies win supporters believe that differences between their proposal and the views of state program officials are not vast but many stat officials disagree the type of assistance provided grants and loans one issue that divides the stakeholder groups is whether to provide assistance through grants as well as loans with cities and the win gr oup favoring significant place for grants and most states and the h2o coalition favoring loans in preference to grants both srf programs authorize states to make loans at or below market interest rates including zero interest loans howe ver for several years both small and large cities have urged congress to explicitly authorize water infrastructure grants in addition to loans to provide flexible assistance best suited for particular community and state needs thus the drinking water srf enacted nine years after the clean water srf program allows up to 30 of cap italization grants to be used to provide loan subsidies to disadvantaged communities grants that do not require repayment obviously are preferred by communities for example some small communities that lack an industrial tax base or means to benefit from economies of scale find it difficult to repay loan for 100 of the co st of water infrastructure projects some larger cities also seek grants on the basis that water infrastructure is just one of numerous costly capital needs that they must meet and partial subsidy in the form of grant would help make those co sts more affordable for ratepayers small and disadvantaged communities financing problems also have been addressed by permitting longer loan repayment period by spreading out repayment communities can reduce the amounts due on an annual basis thus lessening the amount of rate increases n eeded to finance the repayment although total financing costs over the life of the loan may be higher under both srfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs27 46 h2o coalition what is the water infrastruct ure problem and what are the solutions issue paper february 26 2001 pp 711programs annual principal nd interest repayments be gin one year after project completion and are to be fully amortized 20 years after project completion under the drinking water srf however stat may allow economically disadvantaged communities up to 30 years to repay loans the clean water act does not currently permit 30year repayments but house appropriations committee report language accompanying epas fy1998 appropriations bill pl 105175 encouraged epa to allow states to issue bonds allowing fo r clean water srfs with repayment terms of greater than 20 years consequen tly epa has allowed few states eg massachusetts west virginia maryland to issue 30year clean water srf loans many state officials are reluctant to use portion of the srf to award grants principally because to the extent that part of the srf is used for making grants the corpus of the loan fund and its ability to be selfsustained longterm source of funding are diminished states acknowledge that loan buy down in the form of granting forgiveness of portion of the srf an principal can be useful option for dealing with disadvantaged communities however many states prefer to limit the use of grants as much as possible and would oppose being obliged to make grants state water quality officials who previously administered the clean water acts construction grant program nd others including cbo believe that grants can undermine efficient investments by leading to substitution of federal funds for state and local funds rather than augmenting state and local investment and distort decisions about preventive maintenance treatment technology and excess capacity according to epa states are being conser vative in using the principal forgiveness authority under the drinking water srf since 1996 only 16 states have done so and assistance provided with principal forgivene ss has totaled less than 3 of all drinking water srf assistance since that time members of the h2o coalition favor limited and targeted federal assistance so that utilities are encouraged to attain and maintain businesslike operations if federal assistance is provided the coalition like ma ny state officials advocates that it should be primarily in the form of lowinte rest or zerointerest loans the coalition supports assistance for lowincome familie s to supplement their water and sewer bills where necessary either paid to the wincome families or di rectly to the utility some loan forgiveness as under the drinking water srf or grants with at least 50 local cost share are options that the coa lition supports in rare cases and only so long as assistance produces longterm solutions and ensures that federal monies are used costeffectively except in cases where virtually all of utilitys customers are impoverished assistance for lowincome hous eholds should be favored over grants this group says according to the coa lition grants or loans with substantial forgiveness subsidize all customers rates ev those that are able to afford the full cost of service and therefore are not an efficient use of scarce federal assistance46 federal funds for private infrastructure systems currently under the drinking water srf program eligible loan recipients include community water systems both publicly and privately ow ned and notforprofit noncommunity water systems eg schools with their own water supply eligible loan recipients forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs28 wastewater srfs are any municipality intermunicipal interstate or state agency but not privately owned utilities number of stakeholders advocate that srf funds be made available to privately owned wastewater systems as well this would level the playing field between the two programs it is argued and also would encourage publicprivate partnershi ps and privatization another issue involving the private s ector arises from the internal revenue code under federal tax law certain activities financed by the issuance of state and local bonds have special stat us because the interest ear ned is exempt from federal income taxation taxexempt financing enables state and local governments to borrow at lower interest rate than either private business or the federal government must pay on taxable debt in general taxexempt status applies to activities broadly defined as having public purpose some specific activities considered to have both public and private purposes are eligible for taxexempt financing however these publicprivate activities are subject to cap that limits the volume of private activity bonds pabs state and local government s may issue annually pabs for water infrastructure are subject to the volume cap and taxexempt financing can be done if the project is able to secure an allocation from the volume cap because private water bonds compete unde r this cap with other private bond uses such as housing industrial developm ent and student loans some groups favor legislation that would exempt all pabs for water and sewage facilities from the volume cap the presidents fy2009 budget request included proposal to exempt pabs used to finance drinking water nd wastewater infrastructure from the pab unified state volume cap in order to pr ovide states and co mmunities greater access to pabs to help finance water infrastructure needs bill to authorize such change hr 6194 was introduced in the 110th congress similar legislation has been introduced in the past eg hr 1708 in the 109th congress current law provides such an exemption for governmentown ed and operated solid waste disposal facilities opponents argue that restri ctions on taxexempt financing should be maintained because of the costs to the federal government in terms of income tax revenues foregone simila rly some opponents say that the bonds represent an inefficient allocation of capital favoring some projects over others and increase the cost of financing traditional governmental activities also in the 110th congress hr 1959 was in troduced to permit interest on federally guaranteed usda water wastewater and essential community facilities loans to be tax exempt for more information see crs report rl31457 private activity bonds an introduction by steven maguire other federal tax issues second federal tax issu related to the

yield on the bonds the earnings are termed arbitrage profits unchecked state and local governments could substitute arbitrage earnings for substantial portion of their own citizens tax effort thus congress has decided that such arbitrage should be limited and that ta xexempt bond pro ceeds must be used quickly to pay contractors for the construction of the capital facilities for which the bonds were issued fe deral tax law requires that bond proceeds be spent out during specified period if not the arbitr age earnings must be rebated to the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs29 47 us

srf reserves in the case of the srfs this issue can arise when governments use srf monies to borrow funds at taxexempt ra tes in order to issue municipal bonds and then invest the funds received from the issu in higher earning taxable securities the process of using fede ral capitalization grants nd state matching funds as collateral to borrow in the public bond market so as to increase the pool of available funds for project lending is termed leveraging it is used by more than onehalf of states according to epa epas environmental finance advisory board has expressed concern that the interpretation of the irs arbitrage limitations reduces the amount of funds potentially available for infrastructure projects because it requires the yield on invested reserves to be gr eater than the bond matu rity rate and it has urged epa to support amending the internal revenue code to provide that monies contributed to srfs be freed fro m arbitrage earnings restrictions47 many states urge that amounts used as reserves to secure bonds for srf projects be exempted from the arbitrage rebate rules so that any interest earnings could be used for additional investment in wate r infrastructure projects the council of infrastructure financing authorities which represents most of the srf organizations has estimated that if arbitrage restrictions were lifted srfs could earn an additional 100 to 200 million annually on their funds if these earnings were used as reserves to secure additional bonds they coul d provide an additional 200 to 400 million annual investment in infrastructure project s however others respond that without the existing arbitrage rule state and local governments could issue taxexempt bonds solely for the purpose of gaining arbitrage profits at the expense of greater revenue losses to the federal govern ment and ultimately higher interest rates on bonds whose proceeds actually are used for the acquis ition or construction of capital facilities48 the 109th congress considered this issue in pl 109115 providing fy2006 appropriations for the treasur department congress directed the secretary of the treasury to submit report to the hous and senate committees on appropriations providing legal basis for applying arb itrage bond regulations to the reserve funds held by the clean water and drinking water srfs which generally contain replacement proceeds from loan re payments but not bond proceeds49 federal crosscu tting requirements under both srf programs number of federal authorities executive orders and governmentwide policies applyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs30 to projects and activities receiving fede ral financial assistance independent of programspecific statutory requirements nd many stakeholders favor repealing their applicability to water infrastructure projects these include environmental laws eg clean air act endangered species act social legislation eg age discrimination act civil rights act and economic and miscellaneous laws davisbacon act uniform relocation and real propert acquisition policy act of 1970 and procurement prohibitions under environm ental laws and executive order 11738 these federal crosscutting re quirements apply only to proj ects funded directly by the federal capitalization grants but not to srf activity made from loan repayments interest earned or other state monies contained in the srf in addition the clean water srf attach 16 specific statut ory requirements to activities funded directly by federal capitalization gr ants that are carryover equivalency requirement s from the prior construc tion grant program eg specific project eval uation requirements under both srf programs projects financed with funds direc tly made available by federal capitalization grants are subject to environmental impact statement requirements of the national environmental policy act projects funded by other monies in the srf also must undergo an environmental review however state may select its own method for conducting envir onmental reviews if approved by epa many stakeholders believe that these other federal crosscutting requirements are burdensome and costly and in many cas only ancillary to benefits of water infrastructure projects one particularly contentious issue is compliance with the davisbacon act which require s among other things that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers empl oyed under contract on federal construction work to which the united states or the district of columbia is party critics of davisbacon say that it unnecessarily in creases public construction costs and hampers competition with respect to small and minorityowned businesses supporters say that the law helps stab ilize the local construction industry by preventing competition from firms that c ould undercut local wages and perhaps working conditions and thus compete unfairly with local contractors congress has added davisbacon prevailing wage provisions to more than 50 separate program statutes including the clean water act and generally to the safe drinking water act however the applicability of davisbacon to the clean water srf expired in fy1994 when the authorizations in pl 1004 expired further since the drinking water srf program wa s established in 1996 epa has interpreted the sdwa to not require applicability of the davisbacon act to all construction projects supported by srfs for information see crs report rl31491 davisbacon act coverage and the state r evolving fund program under the clean water act by william g whittaker inclusion of its requirements in the cwa and sdwa srf programs has been controversial and that controversy was prominent reason that water infrastructure financing legislation has been enacted recently setasides the utility of setasides that allow for using portion of srf capitalization grants for program purposes other than directly constructing infrastructure is likely to be debated under the clean water srf state must reserve the greater of 1 of its capitalization grant or 100000 each year to carry outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs31 specified planning requirements under the cw under the drinking water srf state may use up to 31 of its capitalization grant for specified sdwa programs including supervision of public water sy stems operator certification compliance capacity development and state and local source water protection initiatives some uses require 50 state match reserving large amount of funds even for related imple mentation activities necessarily limits the funds available to the state for assisting in frastructure projects also several of the setas ide activities have their own funding authority thus concern for states is that congress may rely on the srf to fund other sdwa requirements instead of providing the au thorized appropriati ons and the overall funding for drinking wate r activities may be diminishe d drinking water program officials acknowledge this problem but many believe that setasides are useful means of ensuring that monies will be available for activities that might otherwise not have secure source of funds because states have some flexibility in fact few are using the full amount that could be re served under the setasides according to epa only few states have used the full 31 that the law allows and the average amount reserved by all states since 1996 is 16 many state clean water program officials have different view of mandatory set asides based on experience administering the previous construction grant program which for time required states to reserv portion of federal funds for specified types of projects because of problems in spending those setaside funds eg finding beneficial projects on which to sp end all the required reserved funds and extensive oversight by epa many of th em now oppose the reservation of core funds especially mandatory setasides except for covering srf administrative costs separate issue re lates to setasides for admin istration under both the cwa and sdwa programs states may reserve up to 4 of their federal capitalization grants annually for the reasonable costs of administering the srf as the srfs have developed and loan portfolio s have grown many states argue that an amount equal to 4 of the allotment is insufficient for administering the program this problem is exacerbated by the fact that congressi onal appropriations of capitalization grants generally have remained steady and for the clean water srf actually have been reduced nearly 50 since fy2004 many states impose fees on borrowers which has the effect of increasing costs for the borrower thus an issue of concern to many is increasing the amount that states are allowed to reserve for administrative purposes allotment of funds and congressiona lly directed project grants another issue of interest is how federa l funds are allocated among the states capitalization grants for clean water srfs are allotted according to statebystate formula in the clean water act it is complex formulation consisting basically of two elements state population and capital n eeds for wastewater projects because the allocation formula has not been re vised since 1987 yet needs and population have changed the issue of statebystate di stribution of federal funds is likely to be an important topic when legislation is c onsidered in st capitalization grants for drinking water srfs are allotted by epa based on the proportional share of each states needs identified in the most recent national drinking water needs survey not according to statutory allotment formula for information see crs reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs32 50 hrept 108792 to accompany hr

should allocation follow from statutory or administrative formula do epas needs surveys provide an accurate basis for statebystate distribution if programs are expanded to include eligibility for new activities such as pollution prev ention and watershed protection how should they be reflected in statebystate allocations crafting an allotment formula has been one of the most controversial issues debated during past reau thorizations of the clean water act the dollars involved are significant and considerations of winner and loser states bear heavily on discussions of alte rnative formulations related issue is whether portion of federal water infrast ructure funds will continue to be allocated in the form of congressionally direct ed appropriations for specified communities projects which have become increasingly prominent and are often referred to as earmarks in recen t years congressional appropriators have dedicated significant portion of annual water infrastructur assistance as grants for specific communities both small and large the federal share of costs under these grants is 55 for example for fy 2008 pl 110161 cong ress appropriated 689 million for clean water srf capitalization grants 829 million for drinking water srf grants and 177 million in earmarked grants for 282 listed projects appropriations directed by congress for iden tified projects enable legislators to assist communities otherwise unable to fully qualify for stateadministered programs or those seeking grant rather than loan that must be repaid state officials that administer the srf programs oppose these types of grants because such congressional actions deny states the ability to determine priority for project funding for information see crs report rl32201 water infrastructure projects designated in epa appropriations trends and policy implications by claudia copeland research on new technologies the basic technologies used by commun ities to meet wastewater and drinking water needs have changed little for several decades in pa rt because utility officials often favor using conventional familiar system s and technologies this is particularly the case in the wastewater sector where regulatory requirements have been relatively static for years although this has long been true in the drinking water sector as well the situation is changing as new regulati ons are requiring many public water systems to apply new technologies epas revised drinking wate r standard for arsenic has drawn particular attention to the need for research on treatment technol ogies that are affordable and suitable for small water systems in the conference report for the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108447 congress ex pressed concern that many small communities especially rural communities in the west will not be able to afford to comply with the arsenic rule and that it could pose large financial hardship on these communities50 congress has provided funding

million annually for new institute of technology and management excellence to support the development and use of innovative technologies that would re duce the cost of meeting drinking water and clean water requirements and replacing water infrastructure52 the cbo also has noted that one opti on to increase federal support for water infrastructure would be increased federal spending on rd that could reduce water systems costs and improve efficiency such as technical rd into new pipe materials construction nd maintenance methods nd treatment technologies economic principles suggest that federal i nvolvement may be appr opriate to increase costeffectiveness when other entities such as private firms and state governments that may fund rd for water systems do not have adequate incentive to consider the spillover benefits that would accrue from na tional perspective as result of research investments increased fe deral support of technical r d could take the form of additional research projects managed by ep larger federal grants to private organizations or both53 in the past congress has attempted to advance new and innovative technologies in other ways in addition to rd activ ities beginning with the 1977 amendments to the clean water act congress authorized specific incentives for such technologies in particular by increasing the federal share under the construction grant program for innovative and alternative tec hnology pr ojects that reuse or recyclehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs34 wastewater and sludge reduce costs or save energy consumption the act also provided for 100 modificati on or replacement of innovativ or alternative systems in the event of technological failure or si gnificantly increased operating costs as safety measure to reduce the potential uncertainty of using risky or unproven wastewater treatme nt technologies the federal funding bonus and the potentia l for full replacement if wastewater system failed were seen by states and cities as significant incentives for using technologies other than conve ntional treatment systems however these incentives were funded as setasides from construction grants these setasides were not universally popular among stat officials at the time and they were not extended when the clean water srf program wa s created in 1989 epa estimated that compared with conventiona l treatment processes fo r every dollar invested in designing and constructing an innovative pr oject 40 cents was saved over the life of the facility many now be lieve however that under th clean water srf program without the incentive of bonus funds or 100 replacement grants few communities are constructing projects that u tilize unproven or unf amiliar technology the safe drinking water act has such incentives but regulatory pressures and population growth are forcing both wate r and wastewater u tilities to assess the potential of alternative treatment technologies in this regard issues for congressional consideration could include possible fina ncial incentives or regulatory incentives such as allowing some additional co mpliance flexibility for use of innovative technology as well as increased federal support for technology rd congressional and administration activity 107th to 110th congresses momentum in congress to consider the i ssues discussed in this report has grown since

levels exceed the administrations targets for federal investment in water infrastructure and do not support the presidents prior ities of defense and homeland security the debate was joined in the presentation of the pres idents annual budget request where the administration identified federal capitalization target of 68 billion for the clean water srf program for 2004 through 2011 supported by annual appropriations of 730 million the administration also said that it supports annua l appropriations of 850 million for the drinking wate r srf program through fy201856 that amount of total funding epa officials said combin ed with state matching loan repayments and other resources would enable the clean water srf to eventually revolve at 34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs37 57 us

annually and be selfsustaining in the long run57 the bush administration argued that funding needs are not solely the responsibility of the federal government and that actions on the part of local governments are also required to help cl ose the gap stakeholder groups concur at least to the extent of agreeing that the pr oblem is not solely the responsibility of any single level of government or entity and that all must act to find solutions but many stakeholders have argued that the leve l of federal investment endorsed by the administration is insufficient to maintain investment levels in water infrastructure that are needed to achieve the nations goals for safe and healthy water while saying that federal and state f unding can help water utilities meet future needs epas principal water infrastructur initiative has been to support other types of responses to these issues in partic ular since 2003 epa has promoted strategies that it terms the four pillars of sustainable infrastructure58 the four pillars are better management epa believes that be tter management practices like asset management envir onmental management systems consolidation and publicp rivate partnerships can offer significant savings for water utilities asset management is an inventorybased approach to planning based on c ondition and risk to assess future capital and operating needs regiona lization or consolidation can in some cases enable utilities to achieve savings and compliance by combining physical and institutional assets andor managerial and technical support fullcost pricing ensuring that sufficient revenues are in place to support the costs of doing business is key to constr ucting operating and maintaining infrastructure and can encourage efficient water use efficient water use the need for costly infrastructure can be reduced by better management of water use options include metering water reuse watersaving appliances watersaving landscaping techniques and public education watershed approaches to protection this pillar centers on the concept that in addressing infrast ructure needs for water supply and water quality it is important to l ook more broadly at water resources in coordinated way to ensure that actions achieve the greatest benefit on waters hedwide basishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs38 59 for example see clean water council

1999 revision this and other publications by th environmental finance advisory board are available online at httpwwwepagovefinpageepa has pursued sustainable infrastructure leadership initiative in partnership with water utilities to promote the four pillars the purpose of the initiative is to identify new and better ways of doing business in the water and wastewater industries and promote them wi dely and thus ensure sustainability of water systems for example epa has worked to encourage utility rate structures that lead to full cost pricing and will suppor t water metering and other conservation measures epa also encourages consum ers to use waterefficient products eg residential bathroom products with the intent of reducing national water and wastewater infrastructure needs by reducing projected water demand and wastewater flow thus allowing deferral or downsizing of capital projects conclusions the preceding discussion identifies number of issues that congress the administration and stakeholde rs continue to debate re garding water infrastructure needs and concerns many of the issues already are the subject of advocates recommendations and policy positions only recently however have some begun to address the long term challenge of actually paying for the larger financial commitment that many of them seek and in particular of identif ying alternatives to finance larger sustained federal role some may wish to fund larger amount of federal spending for water infrastructure tirely out of general revenues in the us treasury but that faces substantial hur dles and competition with many other government priorities thus several questions arise if substantial financing gap exists that cannot be met by improved effici encies or local reve nue enhancement and if larger federal financial role is determined to be appropriate where would that money come from are there alternative revenue sources that could be identified to support increased fe deral involvement some analytic work has already been done on these questions including research by academics and interest groups59 epa has contributed analysis in various ways including study requested by congress in the mid1990s that examined financial mechanisms to enhance the capability of governments to fund mandated environmental goals60 in addition the epas environmental finance advisory board has developed various publications including guidebook of financial tools which provides comprehensive review of financing mechan isms and related tools that may help communities pay for environmental projects and lower compliance costs61 environmental advocates generally are less engaged in bates about water infrastructure than groups representing states cities and those involved inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31116crs39 62 natural resources defense council and environmental integrity project swimming in sewage february 2004 pp 5758constructing facilities however some now argue that increased federal investment is needed to fix water quality problems caused by discharges of untreated and inadequately treated sewage and that the federal government should greatly increase its contribution to water infra structure needs through clean water trust fund which they call the best longterm sour ce of sewage treatment funding62 among the options under discussion are va rious types of wate rrelated fees that could be dedicated to water infrastructure and other water quality projects including one based on water withdrawals or use permit fees effluent fees chemical feedstock fees and environmentally green product f ees each such option has economic and equity impacts spillover effects and stions about administration that need thorough assessment in june 2005 h ouse transportation and infrastructure subcommittee held hearings on alternativ means to fund water infrastructure projects in the future at one hearing witnesses discussed creating national clean water trust fund that would conceptually be similar to trust funds that exist for highway and aviation projects witnesses and subcommittee members discussed difficulties in identifying pot ential revenue sources for such trust fund that would be deemed fair and equitable second hearing addressed othe r financing options such as expanded use of taxexempt pr ivate activity bonds and more efficient management techniques such as asset management programs and sustainable infrastructure initiatives in the 109th congress legislation was introduced to establish 75 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements this bill hr 4560 contemplated system of user fees to create the fund but the source of revenue was not specified further action occurred on this bill and finding consensus on the revenues to suppor t such large spending increase is challenge that has uded proponents so far beyond discussion of tr ust funds or similar mechanisms increased publicprivate partnerships are advocated by some and other options also may merit exploration as difficult as it may be for policymakers to resolve the many infrastructure financing issues such as t hose discussed in this report resolving how to pay for water infrastructure is less challenge
