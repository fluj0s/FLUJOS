6305c30 shspec271 programming cases part ii some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 8jun63 the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 2 handling the time track in particular p3 of this bulletin contains scale of case states that is relevant to this tape there is gradient scale of cases it is not complete there are interim points that are not shown on this scale the lowest level on the scale level 8 is that of total unconsciousness the next one up level 7 is awareness of own evaluations this is where the mental sciences are at psychiatrist listens to someone chatter and becomes aware of his own evaluation of the person as crazy what he perceives is his own evaluation of what he perceives or of what is there to be perceived its an incapability of observation because its an observation of own evaluation you see it most flagrantly in the fields of arts and aesthetics the less that is known of subject the more it has authority or evaluation as its sole reality or adjudication this is where most antiscientology wogs lie i had an uncle who said you shouldnt mess with the mind that uncle is perceiving not scientology but his evaluation or anothers evaluation of it the next level up level 6 is dubin of dubin here person has dubin of his own nightmares that is all he sees it is someone forming his opinion on newspaper articles actually that is dubin the readers of dubin the reporters of dubin the sources this level is below but approaching unconsciousness as thetan manifestation the body plus thetan can go lower scale than thetan whose unconsciousness lies just above this level of dubin of dubin body plus thetan can apparently stay conscious longer than the thetan can as far as awareness of being thetan is concerned lot of boiloff occurs above level 6 level 5 is dubin of the time track the facsimile does exist but what the person or pc sees is dubin of the facsimile that is there second facsimile above this at level 4 is nonperception where the pc gets blackness invisibility small rockets etc it is nonvisibility what used to be called the black v is at this level above this at level 3 is spotty partialperceptic glimpses of the time track with only some visio sonic or tactile etc then at level 2 there is totally visible time track with interruptions there is blackness in this track unless the blackness was really there in an incident fifty or sixtygoal clear would be in this condition he could monitor the time track the way one monitors the physical environment above this at level 1 there is time track the lowest two levels are gross lower scale harmonics of level 1 the above is scale of perception of the time track it is what makes cases different auditing time estimates should be based on pcs location on this scale you could probably use the physical universe to test where pc is on this scale for instance you could have him look at wall with picture on it close his eyes and tell you what he gets the result will be about half tone or tone higher than where he really is eg if he cant see it what wall he is at level 4 above though actually he will tend towards level 5 in running track there is tendency to slip one level the only levels that are fairly serious are levels 7 and 8 because it is very hard to get into communication with those cases but establishing communication at one level moves the person up to the next level and so on up to the top ultimately dont expect this to be done swiftly and accurately however most of the cases that you will be dealing with will have invisibility and sporadic track if you consider the amount of auditing necessary to audit sporadic track case as one unit of time invisibility would take two units dubin of track would take four units of time etc ie the time required to get given auditing result doubles at each level as you go down the scale for instance if it took one hour to audit out one engram on pc with sporadic track it would take thirtytwo hours to audit out an engram in an unconscious case actually that is optimistic at both ends the case result that we are interested in is ot we already have the fait accompli of clearing so we are going beyond it any effort to get an ultimate result in processing leads to ot that upgrades the number of hours to ot to say 500 hours to ot for the sporadic track case insanity neurosis or ability to respond to communication play part in that scale of cases because those conditions are found only at one level of the scale the own evaluations level level 7 any objective test of case state that has human observer adjudicating pass or fail works out poorly where the observer is himself at case level 7 have you ever been flunked on tr1 by coach that couldnt coach the concepts of insanity or neurosis are contained as goals in the helatrobus implants therefore they cannot be used to evaluate state of case wisdom based on the helatrobus implants is nuts other goals from that implant include to die to be sick to move to escape to get it ie to get sickness etc etc almost any one of these goals has been the source of learned treatises dramatizing them to explain all of mans ills eg treatises on escapism the history of man contains references to few implants it remains valid though and the engrams described in it did exist they just got collected together during implants what causes different people to be at different positions on this scale it could be the length of time that they have spent in this universe this implies universe that accumulated from the successive collisions of home universes with it the mest universe picks up different home universes at different points on the track older thetans are in worse shape state of case then would be monitored by number of overts different statuses of thetans at the time of entry etc the why doesnt need to be known to solve the situation how these thetans came to be there in this universe can be stated easily charge this is quantitative matter you pump charge into case when the eighteen prepcheck buttons go out ie inval eval etc if there were thought involved you could probably shortcircuit it all but there is also thought which includes volition as the universe pumps charge into thetan he pumps it into other thetans and other things then he inhibits himself from doing so the result is overts and withholds the charge gets encysted as composite picture of the number of things done to the being held in place by the number of things done by the being this produces x amount of charge on the case that in the absence of auditing just keeps on growing the thetan gets lot more or little more in given lifetime but it is always additive that is what makes the universe trap if charge didnt keep accumulating the universe would be therapeutic instead of aberrative you can have an attitude about the charge too the attitude doesnt alter the charge but it can affect how you feel about it in view of the fact that an ot has fantastic power it is funny that charge would bother him until we figure out the basic overt of the thetan any overt thetan commits is also mixed up with the energy thetan is emitting all of his overts have particles connected with them so the only way to really get him is to hit him with particles because that is the path of his overts so most implants are mainly connected with particle flows of various types people therefore have different amounts of charge one person has quantity of charge another person has quantity b etc the more charge person has the more difficult it is to release it that is why it takes so much longer to get results on the unconscious case this depends to degree on whether the case condition is chronic ie lasting more than lifetime or acute temporary one lifetime or less eg the pc may be spastic now as an acute condition relating to his body the question is whether he is always going to be that way matter what body he picks up chronic if condition is chronic it will add lot of time to auditing you could put deaf man on meter and ask him whether he was deaf last lifetime and the one before that if he was you have deaf thetan on your hands not deaf body and it will take time to fix charge is what causes case to be the way it is just because thetan plus body is low on the state of case scale the thetan itself is not necessarily low on that scale environmental factors can also make someone look downscale when they are not lrh relates an anecdote of time when he audited girl who was acting very nutty and brought her through in short space of time you have to estimate this to program someones case what you are going to program is the persons case so you have to estimate the case to determine how to get the charge off the case case is programmed in relation to the amount of charge on the case that is what determines how you are going to take the charge off the case since auditing requires the cooperation of the being you have to estimate his cooperativeness his ability etc this does affect the ease of auditing and the speed of auditing sample program the case dubs in track charge can be run off we get dialwide rocket reads on helatrobus implants if the pc can run it run it it is dicey because the case can easily go to smithereens it is better to pull overts on this lifetime and run any stretch of track on which the pc has reality be very sure that the case has withholds from the auditor especially thislifetime ones muzzle the auditing dont force this pc run rocket reading implants as long as they run easily when things get difficult fall back swiftly to patching up roughedup track return to an arctype process if the going gets too rough on ris tunning ris is dangerous that would be very extreme and daring programming for this case it is quick but dicey the safe way is using straightwire havingness withholds etc an alternate approach is if you got goal run all the charge off the goal never look for earlier goals when you have found one dont try pushing the case to get all the charge off of an implant take case with sporadic track you can run it pretty hard you can move around on the track from one gpm to another without messing things up much this level of case level 3 could even stand leaving goals without running them he may arc break but you can do it the case can be pushed hard the invisibility case level 4 can be pushed bit but not as hard as the sporadic track case with the dubin case level 5 you need lots of track repair ow running havingness you must readily cut and run if implants get rough with the dubin of dubin case dont let him near implants this isnt common case level 6 use straightwire and arc break processes run the case lightly for wins every session you are running the case too steep if you are not getting session wins unless this case is aware of having regular wins in session the cases reality is not coming up the aware of own evaluations case level 7 is suited only for havingness and cchs room processes contacting pt processes this case cant detect an overt as such he has responsibility he will tell things to you but not as overts to get daring with this case run straightwire with the unconscious case level 8 establish communication animal processing is the same sort of thing establish comm get the animal to reach always be little optimistic in estimating where someone is on the scale then program to get as much charge off as you can with the pc winning how much charge is being gotten off is measured by the ta and needle action charge is important because its what restimulates when he tries to outflow and prevents his outflow its what educates him not to reach in getting off charge processing lets him reach and do total selfdeterminism is only possible at the highest level given above level 1 there there are automaticities time track charge on the case the result is unlimited reach
