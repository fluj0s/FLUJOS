nafta on the house side title i of hr 984 caribbean and central american relief an d economic stabilization act would provide caribbean basin countries with essentially the same tariff treatment that mexico receives under nafta on the senate side so called caribbean basin initiative cbi enhancement legislation has been included in s 371 bill to provid relief to the hurricaneravaged countries of central america the senate bill is more restrictive than the house bill in the scope of tariff benefits offered particularly for textile and apparel products the clinton administration in testimon before the house ways and means subcommit tee on trade on march 23 announced its opposition to hr 984 while supporting enhan ced trade benefits for cbi countries the administration unveiled its own proposal that is more similar to s 371 as in the past the outlook in the 106 congress for passage of some sort of enhancement bill remainsth uncertain efforts to help the region recover from hurricane damage may provid impetus for passage but the legislation still lacks consensus approach in the private sector and in congress this report will be updated background ever since nafta was proposed in the early 1990s caribbean basin leaders have expressed concern that mexicos more preferential trading status would erode its ow n preferen tial access to the us market as provided by the caribbean basin economi c recovery act cbera the cbera commonly referred to as the caribbean basi n initiative or cbi was enacted in 1983 in an effort to bolster the economic and political stability of this ne ighboring region the cbera is nonreciprocal grant of dutyfree or reduced duty access for certain cbi exports to the united states legislation to enhance the cbi has been introduced in every congress since 1993 the primary change proposed centers on the tariff treatment of the regions appare l exports us garment companies have set up factories in the region to assemble clothes cut from us or

while most all similar imports from mexico under nafta come into the united states dutyfree this di screpancy has been one factor since nafta went into effect in causing mexican apparel exports to the united states to rise at much higher rate 44 than those from cbi countries 171 central americas hurricaneinduced economic and social setback in 1998 s provided added impetus to ongoing efforts to provide cbi countries with similar tarif f treatmen t its economic rival mexico receives under nafta as in the past lack f private sector consensus on the legislation as well as likely differences between house and senate proposals cloud the prospects for enactment of cbi enhancement bill conflicting approaches cbi enhancement h as been divisive issue for the us textile and apparel industry some segments of the ap parel industry oppose the legislation in any form on the grounds that it will accelerate longstanding production and job losses induced by impor t competition the largest producer associations support some form of enhancement as way to provide more leeway to use the cheapest sources of supply in their operations but disagree on the scope of cbi enhancement bill the american apparel manufacturers association for example has supported nafta equivalent treatment which would allow dutyfree benefits for some portion of apparel goods made from cbi country produced fabric as well as some goods that contained component s from other regions such as asia but the ame rican textile manufacturers institute supports form of tariff and quot exemptions that would apply largely to those goods made from fabric cut and formed in the united states and of yarn spun in the united states2 the broad differences between the two producer associations were mirrored b different approaches offered by the senate and house in the 105 congress the mai nth senate bill would have limited preferences to apparel made from fabric spun and yar n formed in the united states whereas the main house bil l would have provided freer entry for apparel made from us or cbi countr produced cloth with limited entry for apparel made in cbi countries from third country eg china or india materials thes differences are again apparent in the 106 congress s 371 introduced february 3 1999th by senator bob graham dfla is broadly similar to the cbi bill reported out of th senate finance committee in the 105 congress hr 984 introduced march 4 1999th by rep philip m crane rill provides more expansive tariff preferences without s many mandatory or discretionary eligibility requirements the clinton administration s approach which has not been introduced yet as legislation is more similar to the senate bill efforts to craft consensus approach are ongoing
