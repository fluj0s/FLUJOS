republican conference and democratic caucus rules and individual committee rules all address the subcommittee assignment process although to varying degrees under house rule x clause 5d prohibits committees from having more than five subcommittees however committee that maintains subcommittee on oversight may have not more than six subcommittees the appropriations committee may have up to 13 subcommittees 12 have been created and the committee on oversight and government reform may have up to seven subcommittees for the 110 th congress pursuant to hres 6 the armed services committee and the foreign affairs committee may each have seven subcommittees and the committee on transportation and infrastructure may have six subcommittees in addition pursuant to rule x clause 5b2a members are limited to service on more than four subcommittees although exceptions are allowed committee chair is generally prohibited from chairing subcommittee of his or her committee and all committee and subcommittee chairs are limited by house rule x clause 5c2 to more than three consecutive terms as chair beginning with the 104th congress although waivers can be granted term limits for the intelligence committee chair were abolished by hres 5 on january 7 2003 many subcommittee assignment decisions are affected by the full committee assignment process information on that process is

are often held with the minority these prerogatives remain with the majority generally subcommittee ratios reflect the same ratio as that of full committee which in turn reflects the ratio of ma jority to minority members in the full house discussions on subcommittee sizes and ratios traditionally begin soon after the november election and often are completed by the convening of the early organization meetings usually held in november or december final decisions are made after committee assignments are ratified on the house floor seat changes within congress can necessitate adjusting subcommittee sizes and ratios democratic caucus rule 26 which addresses subcommittees when the democratic party is the majority states that subcommittee can be more than 60 of the size of full committee it further states that the resident commissioner and delegates should not be counted in determining subcommittee or committee size republican conference rules are silent on subcommittee size and ratio issues g5g145g138g146g155g561g138g151g141g561g20g138g151g148g146g151g144g561g15g142g150g139g142g155g561g21g142g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g561 under republican conference rules each

disapprove the selection procedure republican conference rules changes for the 108th congress required subcommittee leaders of the appropriations committee to receive full conference approval republicans limit members to single committee or subcommittee leadership slot the leadership of the standards of official conduct committee and the house administration committee are exempt thereby allowing member to rank on either of these pane ls and an additional panel finally republican conference rules prohibit fullcommittee leader from leading subcommittee of the committee he or she heads house democrats allow each committee member to bid in order of seniority for available subcommittee leadership slots for all committees except appropriations this is done by full committee seniority for appropriations it is done by subcommittee seniority caucus rules generally limit members to rank on only one full committee or one subcommittee with legislative jurisdiction subcommittee leaders selected for the appropriations committee energy and commerce committee and ways and means committee require democratic steering and policy committee approval

exceptions house rules are silent on how subcommittee assignments are made rather subcommittee assignments are governed by respective party rules and practices republicans generally leave the decisions on the subcommittee assignment process to the committee leader to determine although most comm ittees employ bidding approach that allows members in order of seniority to select subcommittee slots committee and party leaders also try to suggest certain subcommittee configurations in order to retain more experienced members on key subcommittees democrats formally provide in their caucus rules for bidding process based on seniority whereby each member of committee selects one subcommittee before any member receives second assignment pursuant to house rule x clause 5b2b the chair and ranking minority member of full committee may serve as ex officio members of subcommittees of their committee without that service counting against the limitation of more than four subcommittees per member some committees address in their committee rules the auth ority to vote by ex officio members some panels allow voting by ex officio members others do not
