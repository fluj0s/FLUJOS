specialist on the congress government and finance division the opportunities for representatives to offer floor amendments to bill or resolution depends on the procedures by wh ich the house considers the measure in summary after general debate on bill in committee of the whole members may offer whatever amendmen ts they choose if 1 those amendments comply with applicable house rules and precedents some of which are identified below 2 members offer their amendments at the appropriate times and 3 the house has not adopted special rule that prohibits consideration of some or all amendments to the bill an amendment also can be proposed in recommittal motion that is offered in the house after the committee of the whole completes action on the bill and reports it back to the house in the house under the onehour rule an amendment can be offered only by the member who controls the floor or if that member yields to colleague for the purpose of offering an amendment if the house votes to order the previous question on bill after more than one hour of debate as it usually does the effect of that vote is to prevent any floor amendments except for an amendment that may be incorporated into motion to recommit the bill under suspension of the rules floor amendments are in order however the member offering the suspension motion may include amendments in the motion if so that member moves to suspend the rules and pass the measure as amended the house cannot vote separately on any such amendments general restrictions on amendments the houses rules and precedents impose certain restrictions that apply generally to house floor amendments regardless of th procedure under which they are offeredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98426crs2 in general for example an amendment is not in order 1 if the amendment is not in writing at the time it is offered 2 if the amendment is in the third degree that is it is an amendment to an amendment to an amendment 3 if the house already has acted on an identical amendment 4 if the ame ndment only proposes to reamend portion of the bill that already has been amended 5 if the amendment affects different parts of the bill and actually constitutes two or more amendments that can be offered bloc only by unanimous consent or 6 if the amendment is not offered at the time the committee of the whole is considering amendments only to the section or title of the bill that the amendment would affect this list is not exhaustive and there are exceptions to some of these general restrictions for instance an amendment to substitute for an amendment is not considered to be third degree am endment also an amendment may reamend something that already has been amended if it does so in the process of amending larger part of the text in question the germaneness requirement in addition to such general restrictions cl ause 7 of house rule xvi also requires that each amendment must be germane to the xt it would amend this principle can be difficult to apply in practice volumes 10 and 11 of deschlerbrown precedents of the house of representatives devote almost 2000 pages to the germaneness ru and its application to be germane it is not sufficient that the amendment be relevant to the bill the house is considering or even to the section or title of the bill that the amendment would change it is possible for an amendment to be relevant without satisfying the techni cal standards of germaneness in the commentary that follows the text of the germaneness rule in the house rules and manual the house parliamentarian identifies three tests of germaneness subject matter fundamental purpose and committee jurisdiction to be germane 1 an amendment must relate to the subject matte r under consideration 2 the fundamental purpose of an amendment must be germane to the fundamental purpose of the bill and 3 an amendment when consid ered as whole should be within the jurisdiction of the committee reporting the bill none of these tests is always conclusi ve nor is one of them necessarily more controlling than the others furthermore an amendment may satisfy all three of these tests and still not be germane to help explain this possibility the parliamentarian also elaborates several principles of germaneness including the following 1 one individual proposition may not be am ended by another individual pr oposition even though the two belong to the same class and 2 specific subject may not be amended by provision general in nature even when of the class of the specific subject but 3 general subject may be amended by sp ecific propositions of the same class
