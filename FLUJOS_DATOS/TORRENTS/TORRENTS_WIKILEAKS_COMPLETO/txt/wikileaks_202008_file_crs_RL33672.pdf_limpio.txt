an unexpected increase in revenues has led to renewed discussion of the effect of the 2001 2004 tax cuts on the economy and the possible feedback effects on revenue some proponents of the tax cuts suggest that induced economic growth was large enough that taxes on the additional income more than offset the cost of the tax cuts causing an increase rather than decrease in revenues other observers doubt that economic growth was related to the tax cuts or that it was large enough to significantly offset the cost of the cuts this report reviews available economic studies theory and empirical data to assess the possible revenue feedback from the 20012004 tax cuts at this time four sources of feedback are examined shortrun demandside stimulus effects supplyside effects on labor supply and savings shifting of income from nontaxable to taxable form and debt service effects of the potential sources of feedback none appears very large relative to the direct revenue cost and offsetting effects suggest that the effects of the tax cut on the deficit will be to magnify the direct cost rather than reduce it one source of effect is the shortrun stimulus this effect is temporary and appears likely to be small resulting at the peak about year and half following adoption of more than 14 feedback at the same time the effect of the deficit in crowding out private capital reduces tax revenues the debt also adds to the deficit directly through debt service which can increase the cost of tax by as much as 25 over the first 10 years and by larger amounts as time goes on conventional supplyside effects arising from increased work and savings are unlikely to have feedbacks of over 10 and there is some reason to believe that the shortrun feedback effect is more than 3 there are also some potential feedback effects from shifting into taxable income forms and reducing avoidance but adding these effects to the conventional supplyside effects still produces feedback effect in the neighborhood of 10 moreover some of these effects are already incorporated into conventional revenue estimates and they may be overstated for other reasons given the positive and negative effects it is likely that the feedback effect in the very short run would be positive but at the current time as the stimulus effects have faded and the effect of added debt service has grown the 20012004 tax cuts are probably costing more than their estimated revenue cost this report will not be updated

as documented by both the administration in its mid session review1 and the congressional budget office cbo in its august update 2 has led to renewed discussion of the effect of the 20012004 tax cuts on the economy and the possible feedback effects on revenue the omb midsession review also summarizes results from two treasury studies indicating that tax cuts moved the economy out of the recession more quickly than would otherwise have been the case and will encourage greater longrun economic growth some proponents of the tax cuts suggest that induced economic growth was large enough that taxes on the additional income more than offset the cost of the tax cuts causing an increase rather than decrease in revenues other observers doubt that economic growth was related to the tax cuts or that it was large enough to significantly offset the cost of the cuts 3 after reviewing the data on the revenue increase this report examines available economic studies theory and empirical data to assess the possible revenue feedback from the 20012004 tax cuts three major pieces of legislation constitute the bulk of these tax cuts pl 10716 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act referred to as egtrra passed in 2001 its most important provisions were phasedin rate reductions expansion of child credits expansion of brackets and standard deductions for joint returns and phaseout and eventual repeal of the estate tax most provisions were set to expire in 2010 and some earlier but some or all of them may be extended or made permanent the main prov ision of the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 10747 was the adoption of bonus depreciation which allowed share of investment to be deducted immediately pl 10827 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra passed in 2003 accelerated the 2001 rate reductions allowed lower tax rates for dividends and capital gains and expanded and extended bonus depreciation bonus depreciation expired at the end of 2004 but there have been extensions of some other expiring provisions the first section of this paper examines the data on revenues and growth that have given rise to these arguments the next three sections discuss the three basic types of behavioral effects that might lead to increased or decreased revenues shortrun stimulus effects and the subsequent effects on the debt supplyside effects that alter the amount of labor and capital in the economy and shifts between taxable and taxfavored activities the final section presents findings

projected revenues 99 billion higher than its march forecast according to cbo projections the deficit will fall from 26 of gdp in fy2005 to 20 of gdp in fy2006 this revenue increase arose from increases in both individual and corporate income and followed an increase in 2005 in 2005 gdp grew by 65 but revenues grew by 145 in 2006 gdp is 1 us office of management and budget fiscal year 2007

revenues by 116 in 2005 revenues from social insurance taxes grew by 83 revenues from individual income taxes by 146 and revenues from corporate taxes by 47 in 2006 cbo estimates revenues from social insurance taxes will grow by 5 revenues from individual income taxes will grow by 143 and revenues from corporate income taxes will grow by 222 this growth in revenues is not due to any extr aordinary growth of output as the economy has been growing at rates typical of those followin g recoveries from previous recessions moreover according to cbo the economy has essentially reached its full employment level rather the growth in revenues is due largely to an increase in taxes as percentage of output most of the increase in taxes as percentage of output is due to income taxes with about 60 of the effect coming from the individual income tax and the remainder from the corporate tax table 1 reports since 1990 the growth rate of real output and revenue from the corporate and individual

depreciation in 2002 its expansion in 2003 and its termination at the end of 2004 this provision is having effects on corporate tax revenue outside of economic performance bonus depreciation allowed

source crs calculations and data from the cong ressional budge t officecb0 and joint committ ee on taxation jct note that t his adjustment is mad based on t he estimated reve nu effect at t he time of t he legislati ve change ther is some evidence as discussed in the text tha t thes effects we re not as large as originally projected b projected using the revenue estimates made at the time for bonus depreciation and another small tax issue having to do with losses and assigning share to corporations equal to the share of accelerated depreciation on equipment reported in the joint committee on taxations jct tax expenditure estimates 79 we correct the corporate tax ratio to see what it would have been without this legislative change 5 this number is reported in the last column using these figures there longer appears to be significant growth in corporate tax revenues from 2005 to 2006 the effect of the depreciation change accounted for 84 of the faster growth in corporate tax revenues and without it corporate taxes would have grown by less than 9 rather than by 22 it accounts for slightly over half the 47 growth from 2004 to 2005 this adjustment probably applies too much we ight to bonus depreciation however because preliminary evidence through 2003 suggests the usage of bonus depreciation has not been as great as might have been predicted 6 thus the pattern adjusted for this legislative change probably falls between the two last columns of table 1 nevertheless adjusting even in part for this effect smooths out the general pattern of corporate taxes during the recession and recovery with the shares during the recession and slow growth years similar to those in the early 1990s and the shares now similar to the period prior to the recession in 20002001 because at least part of the growth in corporate revenues can be explained by legislative changes and because revenue from the individual income tax was greater contributor to growth in general the more important issue to focus on seems to be the growth in the individual income tax share some small part of the growth from 2005 to 2006 is also attributable to depreciation for unincorporated businesses but in this case it accounts for only 14 of the faster growth in revenues based on the original revenue estimates policymakers are interested in the question of what if any part of the increasing individual income tax share is result of economic stimulus brought about by the 20012004 tax cuts the following discussion looks at this issue from macroeconomic viewpoint 5 joint committee on taxation estimates

percentage of output rose does not necessarily mean that effect is due to growth effects arising from the tax cuts if that were the case one could also conclude that the rate increase in 1993 led to growth in effective tax rates independent from the direct effects the share of output collected in individual taxes continued to grow in the late 1990s after the tax rate increases were in place this growth in the late 1990s generally reflected both an increase in the average effective tax rate on taxable income which could arise from increasing inequality in incomes and real bracket creep and increases in taxable income relative to gdp which could reflect items such as faster growth in capital gains 7 second were there similar growth effect s following the 1993 tax cut one could not empirically attribute the recent growth to specif ic event because it is not possible to know what would have happened to the economy in the absence of the tax cut to attribute the growth to the tax cut would be to presume that because one event occurs before another the first event causes the second8 when estimating the effect of tax changes observing the aftermath really does not change our knowledge derived from observing economy wide changes except in very marginal way at best it is one more observation and in order to project economic changes we need enough observations to form an adequate statistical sample finally cbo suggests based on comparing wit hholding and other receipts that the recent growth in revenue is not due to growth in wage income which is the basic conduit through which most economic growth occurs in the short run but through other routes any change in saving and investment induced by the tax cut and it is not clear there is such change would have negligible effect on the capital stock and output this effect is longrun phenomenon not short run one to think about the potential revenue offsets due to economic or behavioral change induced by tax change it is necessary to turn to more general analysis of these effects they can be separated into three types of effects demandside stimulus effects including the eventual consequences of increased debt supplyside effects on labor and capital and changes in the allocation of consumption and other forms of taxpayer avoidance

demandside stimulus or contraction are transitory and the longrun effects are generally negative as the increased government borrowing from the tax cut is likely to crowd out private capital

cuts took place when the economy was not at full employment since the ta x cuts began in 2001 much of the demandside effect has likely faded and will continue to fade and any offsets would have been temporary and are now on the decline in any case they are not likely to explain the current increase in revenues which does not derive primarily from extraordinar growth in output but from an increase in the effective tax rate in the case of the individual tax and from the longer run consequences of bonus depreciation in the case of the corporate tax as time goes on assuming revenues are not fully recovered and as the stimulus fades the effect of the tax cuts is to reduce output by reducing the capital stock from what it otherwise would have been magnifying the deficit through growing interest payments and also reducing tax revenue from what it otherwise would have been by reducing output in the long run tax cut that results in added debt service holding behavioral responses fixed reduces output and leads to larger revenue loss depending on the timing of the tax cuts and considerably larger cost for example the cost of extending the 20012004 tax cuts and reforming the alternative minimum tax will be increased by about 14 over the first 10 years due to debt service 9 cbo reports that debt service would add 25 to the cost of an acrosstheboard tax cut over 10 years10

larger multiplier effect than is commonly presumed or found in macroeconomic models to fully or significantly offset the tax cut even on temporary basis if the marginal tax rate is 20 as suggested in recent treasury analysis 11 then tax cut would have to increase output by multiplier of 5 in order to bring in enough revenue to offset the original tax cut and even in the most optimistic of views the multiplier is not this large economic theory suggests that fiscal policy may also be limited in its effect in an open economy if capital is relatively mobile expansionary fiscal policy induces an increase in interest rates that causes an inflow of capital which in turn incr eases the exchange rate and reduces net exports one of the treasury departments studies repo rted in the midsession

professor at harvard and former chairman of the council of economic advisors in the current administration reports the tax multiplier in major macroeconomic model data resources inc or dri predecessor of driwefa and in turn predecessor of global insight is 119 if the interest rate is held constant which would require monetary expansion 026 if the money supply is held constant the interest rate would rise but output could also rise and zero if the inflation rate is held constant the interest rate rises so much that output is fixed 13 there is some disagreement among economists on what the monetary authorities tend to do in response to fiscal expansion14 currently two major private sector macroeconomic models ma and global insight tend to use taylor rule which targets the real interest rate but has it rise as inflation and output increase this policy expands the money supply to keep interest rates constant in the very short run but eventually allo ws the interest rate to rise the multiplier for lump sum tax change using this assumption over four to eight quarters is about 07 in the ma model and about 08 in the global insight model15 lump sum tax change tends to produce larger effect than change in the tax rate because none of the increased output is taxed in the ma model the effect fades to zero after about four years while in the global insight model it fades to zero after about eight years recent survey of multipliers by researchers at the international monetary fund imf found that proportional tax cut had shortrun multiplier of 06 and 07 in the two models it examines that estimate effects in the united states the oecd interlink and the imf multimodel respectively 16 the first assumed real interest rates were fixed the second that the money stock was fixed empirical estimates of multipliers also tended to find tax multipliers less than one there is apparently report or study available to determine what assumptions were made in the treasury simulation to produce their results and strictly comparable studies that cover several years all tax cuts and are confined to demandside effects 17 however several related studies either done by the forecasting

third issue is whether the shortrun stimulus is unique to tax cut it is not tax cut per that stimulates the economy but rather an increase in the deficit which alternatively could be accomplished via spending increases indeed spending multipliers are larger than tax multipliers mankiw reports spending multiplies in the dri model at 193 with fixed interest rates and 06 at fixed money supply respectively 60 and 130 larger than the tax multiplier20 in the oecd and imf models the spending multiplier was 11 in both models or 60 to 80 larger than the tax rate multiplier if revenue feedback were to be justification it would apply with greater force to spending increases than to tax cuts thus any revenue obtained from the feedback due to the stimulus effect could have also been obtained through expansionary fiscal policy via increased government spending both of these stimulative policies were in place during the recession and recovery further the economy can be stimulated via monetary policy as well as fiscal policy and monetary policy does not leave residual debt and deficit that undermines capital formation monetary policy is also likely more powerful in an open economy

responses that is increases in labor supply and in the capital stock and which are based on growth mode ls the omb midsession review included treasury department estimate of these effects and the treasury also prepared separate study 21 this section examines that modeling exercise and compares it with previous one by department of treasury analysts estimating the effects of the tax reform proposals made by the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform 22 19 note that these effects are restricted to revenue feedback not overall effects on the deficit the stimulus would also presumably have temporarily reduced spending on programs such as welfare and unemployment compensation at the same time although it would have added to the deficit through growing interest payments 20

compared to the analysis of the tax reform proposals has been changed by limiting the model type but allowing sensitivity analysis with respect to elasticities behavioral responses of labor supply to changes within that model the treasury analysis considers both short run and longrun effects macroeconomists note that the important behavioral response in the short run is the labor supply response since even significant increases in saving can do little to affect the capital stock or output in the short run if the labor supply effect is to completely offset the revenue cost in the short run output must increase by 7 with tax rate of 20 and since labor accounts for about twothirds of output the labor supply would have to increase by ov er 10 government statistics do not show change of this magnitude 23 the base case estimates in the treasury study suggest that the induced effect on output were the tax cuts to be extended would lead to revenue offset of 7 of the initial cost in the first five years and 10 in the long run g15g152g141g142g149g156g561g138g151g141g561g15g152g141g142g149g146g151g144g561g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g142g156g561 the models and modeling approaches used in th two studies differ in two important ways limiting the type of model used to single one and providing sensitivity analysis with respect to elasticities within that model24 the earlier department of the treasury study used three types of modelsa reduced form growth model solow model and two intertemporal m odels the overlapping generations model olg and the ramsey model which treats the economy as an infinitely lived individual the tax cut extension study uses only the olg this change is significant because the intertemporal models tend to yield much larger behavioral responses to changes in the tax on capital income than the reduced form growth models especially in the short run in the initial tax reform study of the consumptio n tax where there were significant changes in the capital income tax rates the solow model had the smallest result and the ramsey model had the largest result in the 10year budget horizon the solow olg and ramsey models resulted in output increases of 01 15 and 19 respectively in the longrun steady state the effects were 14 22 and 48 respectively it is difficult to determine how much of the difference between the olg and ramsey models is due to the elasticities how much is due to some specific continued reform options prepared for the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform us department of the treasury office of tax analysis may 25

is due to the time horizon of the model one can certainly make case for preferring the olg model of the intertemporal models because it does not require strict conditions to achieve an internal equilibrium where broad range of people hold assets26 at the same time one can also make case for choosing reduced form model the solow model intertemporal models present many problems they involve some fairly heroic assumptions about the abilities of individuals to make complex decisions including choosing work hours and consumption over lifetime in response to tax changes and the general equilibrium consequences of those tax changes such calculation is beyond the skill of most professional economists much less the ordinary i ndividual intertemporal models also have not been empirically tested much of the savings response reflects intertemporal substitution of labor in response to interest rate changes where virtually evidence of response is available moreover there is evidence of the savings response for time periods that are very far apart which largely drives the results in the model for savings alternative rules of thumb savings behavior may be more consistent with individual savings behavior and tend to imply zero or negative elasticity the savings rate has had tendency to change little over much of history as has the capital output ratio all observations are consistent with an extremely small savings response the second change in the treasury analysis was the introduction within the context of the olg model of different elasticities that could yield different magnitudes of response this sensitivity analysis is very useful and has been little used in previous supplyside dynamic modeling experiments 27 presented were base case low case and high case the base case elasticities were quite similar to the parameters used in the earlier study for the olg model but below those for the ramsey model in the earlier study of tax reform the static substitution effect for labor which determines the withinperiod labor supply response to changes in marginal tax rates on labor income was around 05 in the ramsey model and 03 in the olg model with the former clearly much higher than standard estimates and the latter still slightly toward the high side these estimates would probably be between 02 and 03 28 as discussed above in the new study this elasticity is set at around 03 in the base case around 02 in the low case and around 05 in the high case the income elasticities where tax cuts reduce labor supply are all high the intertemporal substitution elasticity for labor which measures how labor is shifted over time in response to wage changes over time and that also governs the response to interest rates even though this response has not been directly tested was originally around 075 in the ramsey model and around 049 in the olg model under the current analysis the estimates appear to be 25 moderating features include fixed target bequest and fixed retirement age although the latter should not matter much for the steady state 26 these conditions include asexual reproduction identical preferences for consumption bundles and progressive tax rates open economies or varying state tax rates 27 the absence of sensitivity analysis with respect to elasticities has been absent from cbo studies as well although provided to

around 075 for the high case most empirical evidence suggests that elasticity is quite small around 0229 the department of the treasury discussion implies that similar measure would have been chosen for men but that the intertemporal elasticity was increased to around 04 to reflect presumably large intertemporal substitution elasticity for women there appears to be evidence of womens responses referred to in the study although women are generally believed to have more elastic labor supply however one recent study that did estimate the intertemporal labor supply response of women found it to be not significantly different from zero 30 g20g142g156g158g149g157g156g561 since the treasury paper is studying tax cut rather than revenue neutral change some assumption must be made as to how the revenue loss would be made up otherwise one cannot solve an intertemporal model two assumptions were made cut in government spending after 10 years and an acrosstheboard increase in marginal and average tax rates after 10 years the study also divided the effects into dividend and capital gains cuts which had relatively small but positive effect the reductions of the top rates which had the largest positive effects with spending cuts reflecting the labor supply substitution effect and the remaining extensions which tended to be negative with spending cuts because of income effects the

of an intertemporal model with relatively large behavioral responses the effects are not very large in this model the fact that revenues must be made up by spending cuts clearly acknowledges that the tax cuts do not pay for themselves but what is the magnitude as noted earlier the tax cut is about 14 of gdp for the base case reported above output increases by 05 in the short run and 07 in the long run when offset by spending increases in the tax reform study treasury indicated the marginal tax rate on labor income was 24 and the marginal rate on capital income 14 using an overall rate of 20 the offsetting revenue gain from induced economic effects would be 01 of output or 7 of revenue loss in the next five years it would be about 10 of revenue loss in the steady state in the high case it would be 18 in the short run and 24 in the long run however with the lower elasticity case which seems more consistent with empirical evidence it would be less than 1 in both the short and long run

that is empirical evidence that directly examines how taxable income changes in response to tax changes this approach could in theory capture all of the feedback effects but the empirical methodology used limits it to supplyside effects discussed above labor response and adds other behavioral responses such as substituting taxable for tax exempt income ie reducing fringe benefits relative to wages or reducing charitable contributions when taxes are cut some of these latter effects are however already incorporated in conventional revenue estimates by the jct these studies use differenceindifference approach to estimating the taxable income response by comparing taxpayers who were subject to different tax rate changes and comparing their behavioral change for example if taxpayers in one group had tax change and taxpayers in another who were similar ie had income that was similar had tax change relative change in their taxable income could be ascribed to the tax difference presuming they were otherwise affected by other common economic factors note that theoretically one cannot be sure whether this effect is positive or negative because of income and substitution effects tax cuts marginal effects may increase taxable income through increased labor supply or shifting into taxable forms but the income effect may reduce labor supply or increase charitable contributions in addition tax cut can shift income between corporate and noncorporate sources as shown in the appendix the feedback share effect is et1t where is the elasticity and t is the tax rate with t at 020 the elasticity would have to be 4 to have tax cut pay for itself and study has found an elasticity of this level some of the earliest studies tended to find elasticities in excess of one and even as high as three but critics have identified some serious statistical problems with these studies that suggest their results not be considered 31 as these problems are technical

failure to account for trend in increasing inequality of income and failure to allow elasticities to vary across income classes more recent studies have produced smaller elasticities that tend to be around 04 although even these estimates are subject to serious uncertainties discussed briefly in the appendix as well so that it is difficult to rely upon these later estimates moreover while the studies are based on the marginal tax share there would in theory be very different effects for different tax revisions because behavior is affected by average tax rates for example the 1981 tax cut was an across theboard rate cut with some other changes but the 1986 tax reform act preserved distributional neutrality the 1990 and 1993 tax increases concentrated on very high incomes the 20012004 tax cut however had significant income effects with little marginal effect on tax rates as well because of the child credit and increases in standard deductions and rate brackets for married couples income effects tend to decrease taxable income nevertheless it may be useful to note that the revenue feedback effect with 04 elasticity is 10 note also that most of the evidence does not suggest significant labor supply response in the working paper version of his study feldst ein essentially found effect on labor income 32 saez and gruber33 find an elasticity of 012 for total income but 04 for taxable income suggesting that labor supply would have much smaller feedback effect at an elasticity of 012 the feedback arising from an overall income increase would be only 3 this feedback effect is similar to the lower elasticity measures from the treasury study although this taxable income methodology has some advantages it is also fraught with variety of difficulties and with number of factors that make it likely elasticities are overstated due to transitory effects in addition one of the most serious problems is that each tax revision has different mix of income and substitution effects this issue is particularly important with the 20012004 tax cut which has many important provisions that affect income without altering marginal tax rates and should increase taxable income meaning that feedback effects could be negative eventually when data become available it might be possible to use this method as another way of assessing the 20012004 tax cuts revenue feedback g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the analysis presented above based on currently available data and studies suggests that short term stimulus effects that produce feedback are fleeting and small and are unlikely to have played an important role in the recent increase in revenues the permanent revenue feedback effect for the 20012004 tax cuts is also likely to be relatively small more than 10 and the magnitude is not entirely clear in any case these effects are increasingly offset by the effects of the accumulating debt in the case of effects on the deficit these offsetting effects probably occur within the first few years and thereafter the accumulation of debt and interest payments adds increasingly to the deficit beyond the conventional revenue costs the studies and information presented in this report suggest that at this time there is not convincing evidence that the positive 32 martin feldstein the effect of marginal tax rates on taxable income panel study

share 1 minus the tax rate and examine how their changes in taxable income related thus if an individual with large percentage increase in after tax share had larger percentage increase in taxable income that would be evidence of response the first estimates of taxable income elasticity were by lindsey 34 feldstein35 and auten and carroll36 all of these estimates tended to be relatively high

examining the 1986 reform obtained estimates similar to feldsteins navratil presented some important critiques of these two studies37 first the lindsey study did not actually have panel data so that the same person could be followed over time and people thus shifted across groups navratil was able to obtain panel data and estimated an elasticity of 08 navratil also has more general critique of these studies reflecting problems with exogenous income shifts the increasing inequality of inco and with the assumption that the elasticities are the same across income classes he illustrates with an example from feldsteins study where he obtains the estimate of 104 to derive the estimating equation consider the two equations for the high group and the low group in this section of the appendix refers to the average percentage change in taxable income of group and 1t refers to the average percentage change in aftertax share of that group the subscript h refers to high and l to low 4 h h b h1t h 5 l l b l1t l where is term that captures all of the change outside the tax share variable and b is the elasticity the methodology of these studies is called difference in differences and it assumes that h l and bh b l in that case by subtracting 5 from 4 you obtain an estimate of b 6 b hyl1t h1t l in feldsteins data that yielded the 104 estimate the percentage change in taxable income of the high group was 203 and the percentage change in after tax share was 256 for the low group the percentage change in taxable income was 64 and the percentage change in after tax share was 122 thus b would be calculated as 203064256122 which is 104 the peculiar aspect of this change is that the percentage change in taxable income divided by the percentage change in after tax share in each case is smaller than this elasticity079 for the high group and 052 for the low group this implies that the value of is negativeand in fact negative 63 if interpreted literally it means th at the taxable income would have declined by this amount if tax changes had occurred since income normally grows this is an unreasonable expectation the more likely explanation is that the as are different for the two groups or that the bs are different there is reason to expect the as to be larger for the high income group because of the trend in inequality of income that had been going on for some time navratil reestimated allowing different values for different income groups and comparing each group in different time periods he obtains elasticities that are much smaller than feldsteins 37 john f

he suggests these estimates are still probably too high because of other factors including shifting of income across time cbo study38 reviews the remaining studies which have attempted to counter some of the difficulties in the earlier studies and while the author notes that most of these studies tend to be around 04 he also suggests that because of the many methodological issues remaining any numbers should be used with caution among the problems are the exogenous income changes mentioned above which cannot be entirely controlled for mean reversion when incomes fluctuate highincome taxpayers are more likely to have incomes decline and low income ones are more likely to have incomes rise the possibility of shifting across time or business form to avoid taxes which means the estimates may be measuring transitory rather than permanent responses endogeneity of the tax rate and the problem of controlling for all tax changes the transitory effects can be quite significant for highincome individuals who can more easily time income source such as bonuses and deductions such as charitable contributions to have low taxable income when tax rates are high an example of shifting across income sources and contemporaneous tax policy changes was the shift in income from corporate source to subchapter s income which may have been affected by both the changes in relative tax rates and the increase in the number of shareholders allowed for s corporations g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jane g gravelle senior
