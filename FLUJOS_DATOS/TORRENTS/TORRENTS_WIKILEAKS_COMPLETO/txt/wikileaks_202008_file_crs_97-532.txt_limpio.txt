the 105th congress updated may 24 1999 william g whittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress abstract legislation to modify the overtime pay requirements of the fair labor standards act to permit more flexible work scheduling for private sector workplaces has been under consideration through the 104th and 105th congresses this report summarizes hearings floor debates and related documents produced during those two congresses it will not be updated further federal regulation of working hours consideration of the issues through the 105th congress summary the 104th and 105th congresses actively considered legislation to alter the 40 hour workweek under the fair labor standards act flsa and to modify the acts overtime pay requirements these initiatives proposed alternative work scheduling options for the private sector such as compensatory time off compressed scheduling and flexible credit hours in the 104th congress hearings on workhours regulation were conducted in the house of representatives and in the senate respectively on hr 2391 ballenger and s 1129 ashcroft on july 30 1996 the house passed hr 2391 comp time the measure was not considered by the senate in mid1996 president clinton proposed flexible workhours legislation going beyond the flsa by urging expansion of the family and medical leave act 1993 sent to congress in the fall of 1996 the clinton proposal was not acted upon modification of the 40hour workweek standard was urged by the industry oriented labor policy association and the flexible employment compensation and scheduling coalition flecs among other groups and individuals it was opposed by the aflcio by certain womens advocacy groups with other individuals the initiative died at the close of the 104th congress but it sparked considerable interest within congress and spirited public debate early in the 105th congress alternative work scheduling legislation was again introduced s 4 ashcroft and hr 1 ballenger the bills were almost immediately the subject of hearings in the senate and the house on march 5 1997 the committee on education and the workforce reported hr 1 on march 19 1997 it was passed by the house in early april 1997 the senate committee on labor and human resources voted to report s 4 but when floor consideration was attempted the measure was blocked when series of cloture votes failed the legislation died at the close of the 105th congress these proposals were technical and contentious hearings continuing intermittently through two congresses march 1995 to early 1997 produced sharply differing opinions was such legislation needed if so what form should it take and would the proposed measures have the effect of setting aside the 40hour pre overtime pay standards of the flsa and in the process vitiate worker protections central to the debate was worker choice would participation in an alternative workhours program and use of earned comp time or credit hours etc be at the discretion of the worker or at the direction of the employer conversely how much worker protection with regulatory and reporting requirements could be built into the legislation without rendering it unattractive to employers evolution of these proposals through the 104th and into the 105th congresses is dealt with in crs report 96570 federal regulation of working hours an overview this report focuses upon comp time and related issues through the close of the 105th congress contents introductory

consideration of the issues through the 105th congress during the 104th and into the 105th congress there was an initiative to permit modification of the 40hour workweek standard under the fair labor standards act and the acts overtime pay requirements this report examines workhours issues raised in recent congressional hearings floor debates and related documents to the extent feasible it uses the actual language of proponents and critics of alternative scheduling concepts it is intended to serve as supplement to crs report 96570 federal regulation of working hours an overview which traces the evolution of federal workhours regulation with the legislative history of the several bills workhours legislation received committee and floor consideration during both the 104th and 105th congresses for the most current information about pending legislation please consult the legislative information system lis at httpwwwcongressgov introductory comment speaking generally the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 as amended through the years requires that worker receive not less than oneandonehalf times his or her regular rate of pay timeandahalf for hours worked in excess of 40 per week within 40hour workweek taking into account the terms of any collective bargaining agreement that might be in place the employer is allowed reasonable flexibility any configuration of hours is permitted within the 40hour weekly pattern eg 5 days of 8 hours 4 days of 10 hours 2 days of 20 hours so long as the total hours worked do not exceed 40 in single week within that context flexible hours of work compressed scheduling and comp time are permitted by the early 1990s just over 76 million nonsupervisory employees were covered by the overtime pay provisions of the act1 beginning in the late 1960s various initiatives were proposed that would have altered workhours regulation with respect to federal employees permitting wider flexibility ie alternative work scheduling in 1978 congress adopted legislation setting in motion period of experimentation with flexible and compressed work scheduling for federal employees an initiative that became permanent after 1985 that same year the us supreme court ruled that employees of state and local 1 us department of labor employment standards administration minimum wage and maximum hours standards under the fair labor standards act section 4d1 report washington 1993 p 25 for the fair labor standards act see 29 usc 201 ff crs2 governments were protected by the fair labor standards act following public discussion and hearings congress amended the flsa to allow state and local government employers to offer compensatory time off instead of cash overtime pay to their workers given these public sector precedents some suggested similar arrangement for private sector employers in march of 1985 and for number of years thereafter senator malcolm wallop rwyo proposed legislation setting aside the 40hour workweek requirement of the flsa to allow employers with worker consent to trade overtime hours worked for subsequent paid timeoff comp time the workers would have accrued comp time on straight time basis one hour of overtime worked ie hours worked in excess of 40 per week for one hour of paid comp time this would have freed employers from the overtime pay timeandahalf requirements of the flsa thus reducing their labor costs the workers would have lost the added cash value of overtime pay timeandahalf while the income earned through working extra hours in excess of 40 per week would have been deferred that is taken as paid time off when it would not disrupt the employers business the legislation was not enacted but interest in changing the flsa 40hour workweek standard for the private sector remained by the mid1990s such legislation was again under active consideration in the 104th congress senator ashcroft introduced s 1129 providing inter alia for comp time compressed scheduling and flexible credit hours hr 2391 was introduced by representative ballenger more limited proposal that would have extended the comp time option available to state and local government employers to those of the private sector the house subcommittee on workforce protections conducted series of hearings dealing with broad spectrum of workhours issues march june october and november 1995 hr 2391 was passed by the house on july 30 1996 hearing on s 1129 was conducted by the committee on labor and human resources february 1996 in the 105th congress senator ashcroft introduced s 4 somewhat modified version of his earlier proposal representative ballenger introduced hr 1 bill similar to that approved by the prior congress in february 1997 hearings were conducted both in the house and senate the language of these proposals evolved as the bills have moved through the legislative process their purpose however seems to have remained constant here after brief introduction we follow sequentially consideration of alternative scheduling through the hearings of the 104th and 105th congresses the concepts set forth in the house report on hr 2391 1996 and the house floor debates of the 104th congress some arguments appear to have remained unchanged throughout the period others were modified crs3 overtime pay and comp time the 104th congress in the 104th congress more than two dozen bills urged amendment of the flsa2 several dealt specifically with alternative workhours structures notably s 1129 ashcroft with similar measure in the house hr 2723 doolittle and hr 2391 ballenger the ballenger proposal early in the 104th congress the house subcommittee on workforce protections chaired by representative ballenger conducted oversight hearings on aspects of the flsa including comp time and compressed scheduling on september 21 1995 mr ballenger introduced hr 2391 the compensatory time for all workers act of 1995 the early house hearings of 1995 the house hearings were divided into two sets march and june 1995 prior to introduction of hr 2391 and november 1995 when hr 2391 was before the subcommittee the early hearings addressed general issues of overtime and workhours flexibility the november hearing focused more nearly upon hr 2391 to refine its concepts and add worker protections3 march 30 1995 the central issues emerged early chairman ballenger began the flsa was developed for manufacturingbased economy composed of largely male workforce since them he stated the functions of the workplace and the demographics of the workforce have changed dramatically in order to remain competitive mr ballenger said every us firm is looking for ways to increase flexibility and productivity meanwhile employees are looking for ways to juggle work family and personal needs all too often the flsa serves as an impediment to these goals4 conversely representative owens the subcommittees ranking minority member affirmed that the flsa already allows flexible work schedules 2 early in the 104th congress the flsa was extended to legislative branch employees pl 1041 signed january 23 1995 later congress exempted state and local official court reporters under certain conditions from the overtime pay provisions of the act pl 10426 signed september 6 1995 modified child labor practice under the act with respect to certain hazardous types of work pl 104174 signed august 6 1996 and approved general flsa amendments dealing with the federal minimum wage and related issues pl 104188 signed august 20 1996 3 s 1129 ashcroft was introduced on august 7 1995 but hearings were held until february 1996 the house subcommittee on workforce protections conducted hearing on overtime pay issues generally unrelated to hr 2391 on october 25 1995 4 us congress house subcommittee on workforce protection committee on economic and educational opportunities hearings on the fair labor standards act hearings 104th cong 1st sess march 30 june 8 october 25 and november 1 1995 washington us govt print off 1995 p 12 crs4 adding the real issue is not flexibility the real issue is fairness and paying americans for the work they do5 consideration of flexible hours options began with testimony from the industry oriented labor policy association lpa6 an lpa report reinventing the fair labor standards act to support the reengineered workplace october 7 1994 part of the hearings record seemed largely to set the tone for what would follow the lpa analysis argued that the flsa with its workforce protections was old and outofdate in the realm of labor laws holding position nearly comparable to that of the dead sea scrolls the flsa it charged discourages progressive employment practices such as allowing employees to deviate from the standard 40 hour workweek and paying employees for overtime with timeandahalf compensatory time rather than cash7 industry demand for employee time the lpa noted may be somewhat unpredictable one week may involve considerably less than 40 hours and the next week may involve considerable more and thus an employee who works 50 hours one week must be paid overtime even if he or she only works 30 the next an alternative had occurred to the lpa if the act were to operate with monthly or quarterly focus this wouldnt occur thus an employer could allow an employee to only work 10 hours one week and then make up for that time later in the month by for example working three 50hour weeks in addition to this concept compressed scheduling the lpa urged comp time option presented as worker friendly it observed the lack of flexibility imposed by the flsa when compensating employees for overtime work adds to the employers burden by making it difficult to keep costs down factor it noted in establishment of comp time option for local government employees to assume that businesses struggling to compete in todays global marketplace do not also bear substantial financial responsibilities makes sense8 maggi coil testifying both for motorola inc where she was compensation director and for the labor policy association asserted that the flsa was dated she served she noted on the lpas flsa reform task force searching for ways to bring more than 50yearold piece of labor law into the 20th century the act 5 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 2 6 the washingtonbased labor policy association is public policy advocacy organization of the senior human resource executives of americans major corporations whose purpose is to ensure that us employment policy supports the competitive goals of its member companies and their employees see lpa homepage on the internet httpwwwlpaorg lpaabouthtml january 22 1997 lpa member companies are typically represented in lpa by their principal employee relations executive see lpa annual report 1988 washington 1988 p 1 7 house subcommittee on workplace protections hearings 1995 p 3031 8 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 3335 crs5 she suggested was crafted during an employers market the great depression jobs today she pointed out are significantly different than they were in 1938 and the flsa as currently written is one of the things that has outlived its usefulness and demands renovation9 with similar focus j thomas higginbotham of the american institute of certified public accountants had written to chairman goodling of the full committee urging enactment of comp time legislation employees would be able to receive one and onehalf hours of compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay we believe that employees should have this option to ensure that there is mutual acceptance on the part of both employer and employee there should be an agreement between the employer and employee prior to the performance of the work higginbotham urged that comp time should be used by the employee within one year in order to prevent excessive accumulation of such hours10 june 8 1995 chairman ballenger opened the june hearing by affirming that flexible schedules are high on the list of issues of major concern to most employees and that the flsa in its current form works against flexibility in the workplace the act he said stands in the way of companies who attempt to utilize flexible human resource strategies in order to allow workers to pursue more fulfilling combinations of work family life and other interests11 representative owens viewed the issue differently today we begin full press attack on the 40 hour work week and overtime he queried what is the motive for attacking the 40 hour week and for attacking overtime we can only conclude that it is monstrous employer greed tell mr chairman mr owens asked rhetorically how will we justify giving employers sole custody over the employees work schedule by allowing them greater flexibility beyond the 40 hour work week we cannot justify any of these actions he argued for they are blatant exploitation of the american worker mr owens explained overtime provisions are under attack and we will be told that it is too much to ask employers to pay employees one and half times their hourly rate for overtime we will be told that private sector workers want to receive compensatory time off rather than money for their overtime the questions are will the employees be given an opportunity to choose will they have discretion as to when they take the time and who will ensure that the employees in the private sector receive the compensatory time they are entitled to if the company goes out of business 9 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 1619 ms coil explained that the lpas task force included more than 50 lpa member companies 10 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 160 the american institute of certified public accountants is identified as member of the flecs flexible employment compensation and scheduling coalition group largely of industry members including the labor policy association see ibid p 185 11 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 169170 crs6 these issues the focus of the hearings mr owens asserted all add up to an unprecedented assault on the income and the quality of life of working americans12 witnesses generally supportive of amending the flsa the lead witness was arlyce robinson administrative support coordinator for computer sciences corporation of falls church virginia ms robinson urged increased workhours flexibility the flsa she noted was intended to protect us maybe 50 years ago it did but in the modern workplace it prevents flexibility13 kathleen m fairall senior human resource representative the timken company manufacturer of roller bearings and specialty alloy steel expressed similar views she spoke for the society for human resource management shrm and for the flexible employment compensation and scheduling coalition flecs the latter group of businesses and organizations representing wide variety of industries which are here seeking to bring the flsa into the 1990s14 she observed the fair labor standards act is depressionera legislation created in the 1930s to protect american workers from uncaring employers but times have changed and the act has not ironically many of the provisions of the act now serve as an obstruction rather than protection of employee interests comp time she suggested was an option obstructed by the flsa my experience has been ms fairall observed that most people would prefer to have the time off with pay rather than receiving the overtime check for many people the time spent with family or friends or outside interests is more important than the cash15 others expressed similar views robert j niedzielski director of human resources development for tighe industries inc of york pennsylvania like ms fairall spoke for shrm he argued that the flsa had become convoluted and arcane as the work force and employee needs have changed too often he concluded the act now serves as an impediment rather than an instrument for employee protection16 statement submitted for the national federation of independent business nfib echoing the report of the lpa cited above pointed to the depressionera origins of the act and noted the great depression has long since vanished and the widespread rates of high unemployment are an afterthought paraphrasing the lpa report the nfib statement argued that small businesses struggling to survive in todays volatile marketplace deserve relief from the rigidities of overtime pay requirements as much as do state and local governmental 12 house

house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 199201 crs7 employers17 statement by the national society of professional engineers also affirmed that the flsa impedes rather than protects the rights of american workers18 some witnesses generally skeptical of flsa amendment two witnesses at the june hearing expressed concern about the alleged family friendliness of the projected comp timecompressed workhours initiative edith rasell an economist with the economic policy institute19 washingtonbased research and policy group argued that employers already have incredible flexibility ie flexibility within 40 hour workweek and in excess of 40 hours per week if they pay timeandahalf she added that imposing long hours of work is hardship on employees hardship that the flsa was intended to reduce in her prepared statement ms rasell noted if the overtime pay requirement is relaxed variability in scheduling is likely to become more common at their employers discretion some hourly workers may gain greater flexibility in taking time off from work but at the cost of losing the regularity and predictability of their work schedules ms rasell presented survey data which she observed indicated that putative worker support for comp timecompressed work hours option in place of traditional overtime pay might be overstated20 michael leibig21 an attorney specializing in flsarelated cases argued that many of the complaints of inflexible workhours requirements have resulted from lack of understanding of the provisions of the act it may also result he suggested from desire of flexible hours advocates to circumvent the essential purposes of the flsa some of the witnesses leibig noted have talked about problems of women and families and men and families parents and families and said that if they could use compensatory time they could spend more time with their family but he 17 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 236238 and 3035 the national federation of independent business like the labor policy association is part of the flecs coalition the nfib statement also urged modification of the flsa to exempt small businesses from payment of the federal minimum wage 18 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 238239 19 the economic policy institute epi describes itself as nonprofit nonpartisan think tank that seeks to broaden the public debate about strategies to achieve prosperous and fair economy again epi is supported by grants from foundations corporations labor unions and individuals see the epi home page january 23 1997 at httepinetorgabout epi has also been described as close to the trade union movement see for example the wall street journal march 12 1993 p a4 20 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 201207 21 leibig with the washington firm of zwerdling paul leibig kahn thompson wolly teaches at the georgetown university law center and regularly litigates flsarelated cases he has had an extensive involvement as an attorney with public employee groups and as lecturer on employmentrelated issues see ibid p 219220 crs8 maintained the real problem is that americans are working more than 40 hours week and therefore dont have time to spend with their families the goal of family oriented people should be to get the work week back under control so that people have sufficient time in his opinion weakening the requirement that the work week stay short is not likely to cause more time off22 in his prepared text he affirmed constant pressure for increasing hours of work is damaging and disruptive it ought to be and is against the law of the federal fair labor standards act23 leibig pointed out that the flsa has since its inception disallowed payment in comp time in lieu of cash24 arguing that institution of comp time option would fundamentally undercut the act system which allows work to be paid for by the adjustment of hours obviously undermines the forty hours of work standard of the act it allows the individual employer to make an arrangement with an individual employee which results in avoidance of the cash overtime rights of all other employees were comp time to be allowed without very clear restrictions on it the forty hours of work standard of the act would become dead letter when in 1985 the comp time option was legislated for state and local government employers he recalled it was recognized that extension of the comp time rule to the private sector would make enforcement of the hours of work standard next to impossible25 italics added aside from matters of compliance leibig expressed concern about extending to private sector employees the concept of deferred compensation allowed in comp time format for state and local government employees the main reason that compensatory time can work in the public sector but not in the private sector however is that every year thousands of private sector companies go out of business and if you allow compensatory time they will have an additional liability for the compensatory time banks that are built up for their employees if you allow compensatory time you are undermining the provisions of the fair labor standards act in the private sector that require that pay be done on timely basis you are basically allowing the postponement of pay you are not reducing the cost of employment at all you are just allowing it to be postponed and in the private sector that raises particular problems26 but leibig suggested weakening of the flsa might be the point of the comp timecompressed scheduling campaign he charged 22 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 208209 23 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 213 24 comp time is allowed within 40hour workweek but this could be considered flexibility rather than comp time within the meaning of the proposed legislation 25 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 215 26 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 209210 crs9 the strategy is one which has selected key provisions of the flsa without which general enforcement would be difficult attacked each of those provisions in isolation attempted to establish the irrationality of the provision taken in isolation and thereby gain series of amendments to the act which taken together would gut enforcement and effectively undermine the forty hour work week each of the provisions under challenge was originally placed in the flsa regulatory scheme in response to specific employer tactics by which the basic overtime provisions of the act might overwise be easily avoided moving on leibig contended number of american employers the flexible work coalition are engaged in mounting argument favoring five reforms to the flsa to make the act more flexible and more modern in fact he concluded those reforms reflect exactly the strategies which employers seeking to avoid the forty hour work week standard have used since the 1930s these reforms would so weaken the national hours of work standard as to make it unenforceable27 questioning from the subcommittee questioning of the witnesses was deferred till all had testified since number of flsarelated issues were before the subcommittee questioning moved in different directions representative ballenger addressed several questions to ms rasell concerning the quality of the polling data she had presented and which suggested that flexible scheduling may not be priority or even popular issue for workers but the dialogue turned away from polling techniques to choice and to control ms rasell the question i think would be if there was an option who would exercise the option if i chairman ballenger i think youd have to have an agreement between the employer and employee ms rasell exactly exactly chairman ballenger i think thats the way we intend to talk about the law ms rasell but if the employer wanted to take compensatory time instead of overtime pay just because i wanted overtime pay i might not get it and so chairman ballenger but its got to be an agreement between the employer and the employee otherwise you are going to end up with plant thats not going to work ms rasell sure i think the feeling was that the employers have more power than the employees do and the choice would be more likely to be theirs than the employees28 representative fawell directing his comment to mr leibig and speaking as lawyer declared the act arcane though someone who may specialize in it and 27 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 213218 28 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 222223 crs10 teach it and live it may find the flsa relatively simple he asserted that the average hardworking administrator and workers are really befuddled by it and confused there is he stated an awful lot of confusion out there29 representative miller of california interjected not being familiar with the law should not be reason to repeal the law30 representative woolsey raised number of technical issues that seemed to suggest that the comp time option might not to entirely attractive to employers in her experience as human resources professional she stated it was way more costly to have people take time off rather than pay them for their time and half because they took an hour and half for every hour they worked and we needed that productive work force she noted the use of comp time made scheduling very difficult31 advocates of flexibility had consistently urged the shift of policy in terms of choice but choice for whom ms woolsey queried we have to look at the choices for the employees to make it work for them and if we give them those choices im going to question whether it will work for the employer at all because if we give the employee the choice of cash or banking their time and banking time and not knowing when they are going to use it you have control over your scheduling who has the final say on when that compensatory time can be taken beyond choice per representative woolsey found that the biggest challenge that my employees had was notice of overtime they didnt mind working overtime but they needed prior notice of overtime she explained the employer is going to have to be responsible for notifying so people can have their child care if they are students they can know when they get to go to school so theres lot thats going to fall on the employers shoulders that i dont think anybody thats recommending this is even thinking about it is not going to be simple she acknowledged that the option could work for the employees just fine it could work for the employer but she expected that it would be complicated32 here mr romerobarcelo of puerto rico turned to ms fairall of the timken company and the flecs coalition he reviewed the concept of banked hours ie working up front and deferring leave and pay until later and asked if the employer would be expected to pay interest on these deferred earnings ms fairall i dont know ill have to defer that question to 29 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 225226 30 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 226230 representative ballenger indicated that repeal of the law was not his intent 31 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 231 32 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 231232 crs11 mr romerobarcelo it hasnt been considered has it ms fairall continuing i dont know sir mr romerobarcelo because if they dont pay interest for that half of an hour mr leibig in the public sector they dont mr romerobarcelo when they are talking about compensatory time they are not talking about paying interest to the workers on the compensatory time i havent heard about it so immediately the employer is already making some money out of the compensatory time that it wasnt making before33 still engaged with ms fairall mr romerobarcelo raised the issue of choice was it her contention he asked that the employee would have the right to use accrued comp time when he wants it or is it that the employer would have something to say about when the comp time is used ms fairall sir i think they would have to it would be mutually agreeable scheduling i mean they couldnt come up tomorrow and say i want to take tomorrow off as my compensatory time but on mutually agreeable time i think that there would be an agreeable time the employer and the employee together would agree mr romerobarcelo when he gets paid the time and half does the employer have anything to say about when he should spend this money ms fairall sir mr romerobarcelo so in other words thats another limitation to the employee where he has something that belongs to him but he cannot dispose of it somebody else has to agree with how hes going to dispose of it so hes got another limitation its like mortgage on his time34 at that juncture mr romerobarcelo returned to an issue raised in testimony by mr leibig mr romerobarcelo supposing the employer closes shop and liquidates he says oh hes lost money or hes just skimmed off the profits but he just says he lost money he even files for bankruptcy that happens very often what happens then to that compensatory time who pays for it ms fairall im going to have to refer to the coalition counsel sir i dont know chairman ballenger mr leibig35 im sure knows mr leibig let ask you the question is that part of in the bankruptcy case is that one of the first claims on this or not 33 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 232233 34 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 233 35 mr leibig an attorney was not associated with the coalition crs12 mr romerobarcelo oh yes it is i can answer that it is one of the first mr leibig salary is first chairman ballenger well im not sure i was just going to ask but mr romerobarcelo observed sometimes theres not even money for wages very often that happens so theres another danger for the employees36 harkening back to the opening observations of representative ballenger about what workers want ie flexibility and to the polling data from ms rasell mr romerobarcelo summed up when you talk about many employees preferring that option they dont always know all of the economic effects of what they are saying or what they are accepting he continued for the employee its better to have that time and half pay he can be cajoled and fooled into believing its better for him but its not better for him and this is something that we should realize we are not doing favor to the employees37 the ballenger bill hr 2391 as introduced on september 21 1995 representative ballenger introduced hr 2391 the compensatory time for all workers act of 1995 section 7 of the flsa deals with overtime pay section 7o with the application of overtime pay standards to employees of state and local governments hr 2391 as introduced would have broadened section 7o of the flsa to make its comp time option available with some technical modification to the entire workforce hr 2391 would permit the substitution of compensatory time off at rate not less than 1 12 hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation normally required ie timeandahalf private sector employees could not accrue more than 240 hours of compensatory time38 comp time under hr 2391 could not be carried over from one 12month period not necessarily calendar year to another but rather if unused had to be cashedout paid for by the employer at timeandahalf rate such cash payment must be made for unused compensatory leave later than 31 days after the end of the 12month period hr 2391 required the employer to allow the employee to draw down compensatory hours within reasonable period after making the request to do so if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer the bill did not define reasonable period nor did it offer guidance for defining unduly disrupt under current dol implementing regulations designed for state and local government employment reasonable period rests largely upon the customary 36 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 233234 37 house subcommittee on workplace protections hearings 1995 p 234 38 hr 2391 would continue the 1985 flsa amendments cap on accumulation of comp time for state and local government workers at 480 hours for persons employed in emergency services and 240 for other public employees crs13 work practices within the agency based on the facts and circumstances in each case39 the regulations note of unduly disrupt that mere inconvenience to the employer is an insufficient basis for denial of request for compensatory time off such denial should reasonably and in good faith anticipate that it would impose an unreasonable burden on the agencys ability to provide services of acceptable quality and quantity for the public during the time requested without the use of the employees services40 these regulations however relate to the particular circumstances and culture of public sector employment41 the hearings resume during the fall of 1995 the hearings on flsa overtime issues resumed hearing on october 25 focused primarily on issues not addressed in the ballenger bill on november 1 the subcommittee returned to the issue of comp time with final hearing on hr 2391 this time the members were working with specific legislation before them further the ashcroft bill had been introduced in the senate and although s 1129 was quite different from hr 2391 the senate bill provided the subcommittee with additional options in an opening statement for the record chairman ballenger acknowledged there are some who will say that changes to the law which give employees greater flexibility are really an effort to take protections away from employees but he stated employees want flexibility i believe that we should allow employers and employees to work out these types of issues themselves recognizing that there must be protections in the law against coercion42 the lead witness at the november hearings was pete peterson senior vice president for personnel with the hewlettpackard company speaking for the flecs coalition he described the coalition as an industry group that strongly supports hr 2391 as valuable first step in reshaping the flsa to fit todays workplace needs43 the ballenger bill peterson began would permit employers to offer employees the option of comp time he noted the significant point is that employer would be required to offer compensatory time and likewise employee would be required to take it44 peterson member of the board of directors of the labor 39 29 cfr 55325c1 such practices include but are not limited to the normal schedule of work b anticipated peak workloads based on past experience c emergency requirements for staff and services and d the availability of qualified substitute staff 40 29 cfr 55325d 41 while questioning leibig mr ballenger referred to the 6 million corporations in america noting the difficulties that might result were each to go to dol for guidance with respect to the flsa house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 221 42 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 404 43 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 406 44 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 406 hr 2391 as introduced would have established two categories of employees organized workers those continued crs14 policy association expressed enthusiastic support for compressed scheduling part of the ashcroft bill but not of hr 2391 affirming this kind of flexibility would help employees juggle their job child care and other responsibilities along with community and leisure activities he cited poll conducted for the employment policy foundation which found that three quarters of the respondents said they would favor proposal that allows hourly employees to choose to take their time andahalf overtime compensation in the form of paid time off45 in closing he reiterated the flecslabor policy association position the provisions of the flsa made sense probably when the act was passed originally in 1938 but it is time to take look again at how the flsa can help the needs in the nineties and beyond46 representative owens raised the issue of choice whether the comp time option would truly be voluntary for the employee many employees feel he noted that choice would rest with the employer and not with the worker it is really the employer because employee is going to do anything which displeases his employer if the message is communicated from the employer i really want you to take compensatory time and not opt to take overtime pay thats the way employees are going to proceed turning to peterson of hewlettpackard mr owens asked what measures do you feel we can take to ensure that employees choice of compensatory time is truly voluntary would employers be willing to give written statement to the employee that it is your choice and i will accept either choice that you make peterson responded calling the option winwin situation he added i think that it would have to be clear that it is voluntary program on both sides its voluntary on the part of the employer to offer it in some cases offering of compensatory time is just not going to be able to fit with the needs of the business so i think it needs to be voluntary in that regard it also needs to be very clear that its voluntary on the part of employees as to whether or not they take the overtime in pay or compensatory time so whether or not there is requirement that employers put something in writing of that nature im not sure its required 44 continued working under collective bargaining agreement and the unorganized or nonunion workforce for organized workers implementation of comp time would be matter of negotiation between their union and the employer unorganized workers would be allowed to bargain individually with their employers 45 the employment policy foundation is identified as the educational arm of the labor policy association and equal employment advisory council see fischer carolyn and carol schwartz eds encyclopedia of associations 1996 detroit gale research inc 1995 p 1473 46 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 406408 crs15 while he was willing to consider the possibility of written agreement peterson saw more reason to have written statement from the company concerning comp time than with respect to any other provisions of the flsa47 mr owens then turned to the issue of control will workers he asked be able to take compensatory time off at time when its to their advantage it meets their family needs et cetera or will they also have to take it off at the convenience of the company he characterized the problem that he saw workers facing as the employer has the upper hand in terms of demanding that workers do it in way which is more profitable for the company they cant despite the seeming voluntary situation have an equal role in the decisionmaking peterson thought that type of thing is something that could be worked out he also expressed concern about business realities we do have to make sure that businesss needs here are brought into the picture48 in response to representative woolsey peterson affirmed it cant be just the employee saying i want to take it comp time right now matter what there are some business need situations that would make that difficult49 attorney leibig returning as the closing witness on the comp time issue noted that dol regulations governing comp time for the public sector had been more confused than first might appear and had led to litigation after explaining some of the problem areas he urged that if the comp time option were to be made available to the private sector it should be done carefully and more carefully than it was done in the public sector leibig suggested number of possible changes in hr 2391 as introduced he urged that it should be clear that compensatory time not be able to be required as condition of employment he explained one of the things that some employers in the public sector have done is said sic an agreement can be implied you agree to work with i offer compensatory time therefore i have an agreement with you and that has happened regularly in the public sector there has been great deal of litigation about it he pointed to potential confusion with respect to the bills provision allowing the comp time issue to be dealt with either under collective bargaining agreement or in the absence of such an agreement by direct agreement between management and workers he noted technical distinction between having collective bargaining agreement in place or merely having representative pointing out that if you have certified representative under collective bargaining you cant have direct agreement with employees he suggested that the matter was ambiguous and needed clarifying language 47 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 445446 48 house subcommittee on workplace protections hearings 1995 p 446 49 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 451 crs16 the legislation as introduced provided for cashing out of workers comp time bank banked hours upon termination of employment leibig noted that in the courts termination has often been equated with being discharged but that the term would not necessarily cover retirement or voluntary separation he urged that the term cessation be substituted there may arise questions as to when comp time may or must be used and at whose discretion the provision allowing use of comp time where it does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer is fine he suggested as far as it goes but that leaves other questions if an employee has accumulated substantial amount of comp time can the employer insist that it be used and if so at time designated by the employer if the employee is consciously building up comp time for particular purpose eg hunting season he may not have the right to utilize that comp time if the employer finds it inconvenient or disruptive or if the employer mandates prior use of hours during slack period leibig noted major difference between comp time and money if you got money you take it and put it in your pocket or put it in the bank and spend it if you have compensatory time you have record in the employers sic books it is important that the employer cant force you to spend that compensatory time by making you take one hour off or two hours off he suggested language assuring that where the employee has compensatory time he shall not be required by the employer to use up his compensatory time absent his agreement he thought the putative desire of employees for comp time might diminish if they were made to understand that it would be used at the employers discretion and not theirs leibig turned to the issue of banked hours and bankruptcy in the private sector bankruptcy is regular thing every year thousands of companies go out of business it is important he suggested that the legislation make clear that this banked compensatory time is debt owed by the employer to the employee that has the same preference in bankruptcy that wages would have had50 he voiced other concerns the committee he thought should be mindful of the tax loss of the change made and of the potential for tax avoidance51 some employers might be deceived by the fiscal implications of comp time use compensatory time banks will show on the employers balance sheet if they have it accounted as liability so at the end of the period on the employers balance sheet it will show liability in the cash equivalent of this compensatory time many public employers didnt realize that and even in three cases had their bond ratings jeopardized by the large level of liability52 50 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 455459 51 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 463 52 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 459 crs17 he concluded on cautionary note the main purpose for overtime pay time and half he stated is to discourage employers from working people over 40 hours week at all overtime is the primary mechanism through which the national hours of work standard is enforced when you weaken the 40hour workweek you have to be very careful about how you do it or it will be eroded altogether53 an overview of the 1995 house hearings both witnesses and subcommittee members seemed to concur that oversight of the flsa was needed whether the statute was crying out to be fixed as the labor policy association affirmed54 or needed more minor adjustment undertaken only with the greatest care and on the basis of careful attention as urged by attorney leibig55 might be debated the subcommittee hearings of spring and fall 1995 on comp time and related flsa issues were technical56 many of the issues under subcommittee review involved interpretation of the flsa by dol or had been raised in response to regulations and opinion letters issued by the department late in the hearings mr owens referred to request that the department have representatives testify or the secretary himself because i think its important that we start these hearings with an understanding of where the policies are at this particular point57 at several points witnesses disputed among themselves as to what the act required and what was permitted under it yet one appeared to speak for dol or to explain the departments policies extension of the comp time option to the private sector was being urged as pro worker and family friendly when opening the first hearing in march chairman ballenger observed that employees are looking for ways to juggle work family and personal needs58 as the final hearing commenced he reaffirmed changes to the law are necessary in order to give employees the kind of flexibility that they want59 industry spokespersons similarly alluded to the plight of employees working full time schedules while juggling work with the responsibility of caring for children or older parents the lpa argued allowing them the choice of taking overtime pay 53 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 pp 462 and 473 54 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 30 55 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 462 56 while comp time for the private sector was

compensatory time off can help employees ease those burdens60 peterson of hewlettpackard declared that employees increasingly value work time flexibility and that they want more creative ways to handle their various responsibilities61 through the course of the hearings spokespersons for workers were few while several individuals spoke in their own behalf and would later be quoted extensively in the majoritys report on the legislation one appears to have spoken for the trade union movement62 nor for that matter for other bodies of workers63 representatives of womens groups the legislation was presented as prowoman did not testify at this point64 though frequent comment was made about worker demand for increased flexibility the primary statistical measure of such demand utilized in the context of the hearings appears to have been poll conducted for the employment policy foundation by penn and schoen associates the foundation is sometimes identified as the educational arm of the labor policy association65 60 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 43 61 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 406407 62 the trade union press was

control over their working lives 63 attorney leibig has worked with various trade unions and has public employee unions as clients but he was not witness for organized labor ms sandie moneypenny process technician in the assembly area at the timken company presented an endorsement of the comp time option immediately following that of timkens senior human resource representative kathleen m fairall several other workers spoke as individuals and the american network of community options and resources ancor presented for the record several handwritten letters from its employees 64 circular from the womens legal defense fund the ballenger comp time bill will it really help working families undated declared hr 2391 to be sham and argued that under this legislation an employer can require an employee to work 50 60 or more hours week when the workload is heavy and then pressure her to use comp time when the workload eases 65 house subcommittee on workforce protection hearings 1995 p 409 and fischer continued crs19 wide range of issues many of them technical were raised during the hearings and many of them pointed toward refinements that might be considered with respect to the proposed legislation as he drew the final session to close representative ballenger observed to attorney leibig i would like to say that some of your suggestions are right interesting to we would love to look into them before we go further66 hr 2391 reported from committee july 1996 on july 11 1996 hr 2391 was reported by the committee on economic and educational opportunities by vote of 20 yeas to 16 nays the vote split along party lines republicans supporting the bill democrats in opposition modifications in the bill as reported as reported hr 2391 seems to have reflected much of the caution and concern for protection of worker interests suggested by the hearings it contained expanded language dealing with participation of nonunion workers those without collective bargaining agreement in the comp time program provided that such workers must enter the program knowingly and voluntarily and mandated that the comp time agreement between employers and workers must be written or otherwise verifiable statement that can be preserved entering into the agreement may not be condition of employment language was also added to require that an employer neither directly or indirectly intimidate threaten or coerce an employee into participation in the comp time program nor with respect to the utilization of banked hours new cashout provisions were added allowing an employer or an employee to convert the banked hours to cash in the case of the employer at any time in that of the employee within 30 days after written request cashout of remaining banked hours was required upon workers voluntary or involuntary termination of employment penalty structure was added special definition of the concepts threaten coerce or intimidate was provided in either version of the legislation nor were the concepts of reasonable period for being able to draw down banked comp time hours or unduly disrupt the operations of the employer elaborated upon comments from the majority noting the experience of state and local governments with comp time the committees report affirmed that the arrangement authorized in hr 2391 can provide mutually satisfactory solutions in the private 65 continued carolyn and carol schwartz eds encyclopedia of associations 1996 detroit gale research inc 1995 p 1473 the other source of statistical data that appears in the comp time hearings was presented by edith rasell of the economic policy institute body sometimes regarded as having unionworker perspective but rasells data developed by lake research presented somewhat different perspective and one in conflict with the employment policy foundations poll see hearings ibid p 201207 66 house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 474 crs20 sector less than is the case in the public sector67 it quoted the testimony from three working women at the 1995 hearings asserting that there is ample support for concluding that they are not alone in wanting the option of being able to earn compensatory time off rather than cash wages68 the report stated that hr 2391 would not change the employers obligation to pay overtime at timeandahalf where an employee worked more than 40 hours during 7day period the legislation was permissive it would allow the comp time alternative only if the employee and employer agree on that form of overtime compensation it affirmed that the committee does not intend through the reported legislation to alter current public sector state and local governmental use of compensatory time in any way rather it would extend the option to the private sector69 included in the legislation were number of provisions for employees in the private sector which are not provided in current law for public sector employees these the report stated have been added in response to concerns which have been raised about the possible misuse of the comp time option70 it explained the form of the agreement71 noting that it should be written or otherwise verifiable and affirmed the committee does not intend that an agreement to take compensatory time could be purely oral with contemporaneous record kept and it voiced the committees intent that the employee be able to withdraw from such an agreement at any time72 the report emphasized voluntary choice for the employee and prohibition against intimidation threats and coercion it noted that new remedy had been created where employers willfully violate the bills the anticoercion language if the employer fails to pay overtime either in cash wage or compensatory time he or she would be liable under section 16b of the flsa similarly any repeated or willful violations of the anticoercion provision would subject the 67 us congress committee on economic and educational opportunities

70 house report 104670 p 7 71 the report explains the agreement may be specific as to each hour of overtime or it may be blanket agreement covering overtime worked within set period of time this would suggest some flexibility in program design and in the agreement itself house report 104670 p 8 72 house report 104670 p 89 crs21 employer to liability for civil penalties under section 16e in addition if cause of action is brought by an employee the employer may be required to pay the employees attorneys fees and costs it added that the legislation does not require employers to offer their employees the option of taking overtime pay in the form of compensatory time but it allows employers to do so but where employers choose to offer compensatory time the bill provides that the decision is then left to the employee whether or not to request to participate in that option73 an employee with accrued comp time may generally use the time whenever he or she so desires he must request to use compensatory time reasonable time in advance of using it and its use should not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer through public sector experience the unduly disrupt standard has become narrowly defined and does not allow the employer to control the employees use of compensatory time the report stated the committee believes that the law must be written to allow the employer some ability to maintain the operations of the business if that is not recognized in the law then employer will ever offer compensatory time furthermore providing right to an employee to use compensatory time without any regard to workload or business demands is simply unfair to coworkers who in many cases would have to handle the workload of the absent employee74 accrual of comp time by private sector employees would be limited to 240 hours employees and employers may agree to limit accrual of compensatory time to less than 240 hours per year accrued comp time would be treated as unpaid employee wages in the event of the employers bankruptcy and would be priority claim on the employers assets75 comments from the minority the bill as reported grants rights to employers not to employees the minority report stated this legislation encourages employers to hire fewer employees and to work them longer hours by freeing employers from having to pay cash for overtime potentially reducing both workers incomes and employer labor costs76 the minority observed that this was contrary to the spirit and purpose of the flsa adopted to prevent employers from competing on basis of undermining living standards destructive race to the bottom that impoverishes workers and harms the overall economy77 the minority noted an essential premise underlying the flsa that is worker cannot agree to give up his or her right to the minimum wage or overtime pay it explained 73 house report 104670 p 910 74 house report 104670 pp 1011 75 house report 104670 pp 1112 76 house report 104670 p 27 77 house report 104670 p 25 crs22 this fundamental principle of the act is grounded in the reality that individuals will virtually always feel compelled to accede to their employers demands because of the inherently greater and more pressing need for the worker for an income than the employers need for the services of an individual worker this economic pressure the immediate interests of individual workers aside the report argued was inherent in the private sector work environment the waiver of statutory rights by even few workers places all workers at risk it will usually be in the economic selfinterest of some employees to compromise their statutory rights whether in the hope of greater rewards tomorrow or merely to hold onto as much as possible today but even if only few workers in workplace voluntary waive their rights the rest of the employees will come under severe pressure to follow suit in order to keep their jobs moreover allowing individuals to waive their right to living wage or overtime pay erodes the broad social purpose of spreading available work among all workers the minority affirmed the original principles which underlie the flsa are as relevant today as they were in 193878 dols wagehour investigative staff has declined by 15 since 1990 and one realistically forecasts change in that trend this shortage of staff the report suggested makes labor standards enforcement precarious against these presentday realities the republicanled congress is pushing legislation that fundamentally changes the overtime law the republican majority proposes to do so in manner that significantly weakens workers understanding of their rights encourages further violations of the overtime law and weakens the ability of workers to enforce their rights when the law is violated even with verifiable agreements and penalties for violators it said workhours flexibility could exacerbate compliance problems given the remaining deficiencies in the bill the report states this protection is meaningless79 the minority pointed to real and substantial differences between employment in the public and private sectors employers in the private sector have direct self interest in reducing labor costs at the expense of workers that does not typically exist in the public sector worker protections generally are more extensive in the public than in the private sector more than 40 of the public sector work force is organized while less than 15 of the private sector workforce belongs to union further even where public sector workers are not organized they are typically protected by civil service laws in the public sector employees are normally disciplined or terminated on just cause basis in the private sector in the absence of union employees may be terminated by the employer on an at will basis eg at the will of the employer with or without cause finally the report notes public employers rarely go out of business and if they do are unlikely to be judgmentproof 78 house report 104670 pp 2526 79 house report 104670 pp 2527 crs23 private employers regularly go out of business and are often judgmentproof when they so do80 under hr 2391 those who willfully violate the law by engaging in intimidation threats or coercion of workers are subject to penalties but the report explains to be entitled to any remedy an employee must produce smoking gun that proves that the employer engaged in coercive activity for the express purpose of interfering with the employees rights it is burden most employees are unlikely to be able to meet81 employee rights the report contends may be few whether to offer comp time is an employer decision thus the flexibility option is not entrusted to workers nor is the design of the option itself entrusted to workers employee has legal right to work overtime that option which some workers may value because it adds to their income is left to the employer the bill does not prohibit employers from assigning overtime on the basis of whether the employee has chosen compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay thus an employer might reward cooperative employees those accepting comp time through assignment of extra work without being guilty of threats intimidation or coercion an employer may offer comp time option on selective basis there is requirement that all employees be permitted to enjoy flexibility the employer may arbitrarily deny compensatory time to an employee on some occasions while offering it to the employee on others82 the minority concluded rather than increasing an employees control over his or her own life hr 2391 actually increases the employers control over the workers life83 the minority argued that even worker with banked hours of comp time has secure right to use that time under hr 2391 the employer can simply deny the leave on the basis that it will unduly disrupt the employers business or the employer can unilaterally buy back the compensatory time from the employee thereby wiping out the employees compensatory time bank84 an employee requesting the use of comp time may use it within reasonable period after making the request but the employer decides what constitutes reasonable period85 the flsa has requirement for employerprovided sick leave or vacation time if workers can routinely accrue up to six weeks of comp time the question then becomes why should an employer give away paid leave when that employer can 80 house report 104670 pp 2728 81 house report 104670 p 28 82 house report 104670 p 29 83 house report 104670 p 29 84 house report 104670 p 29 under the proposed legislation the employer had the right to buy back cashout an employees banked comp time conversely an employee could convert his comp time to cash at will 85 house report 104670 pp 2930 crs24 require employees to work overtime to order to earn paid leave instead the report queries how voluntary is compensatory time if the only way employees can earn paid leave is to take their overtime compensation in the form of compensatory time instead of being paid for overtime86 the minority report argues that institution of comp time would create substantial enforcementcompliance problems especially in industries where such problems already persist ie lowwage industries there would be obligation for an employer under hr 2391 it states to post an explanation of the option its terms or alternatives thereto hr 2391 called up in the house july 1996 on july 26 the house prepared for consideration first of the rule and then of hr 2391 per as the session commenced prior to calling up either series of oneminute speeches anticipated the opposition that would later be voiced against hr 2391 representative green of texas observed we have bill today on the calendar that will change 60 years of 40hour week laws87 representative bonior opined this comp time bill is not about compensation and it is not about flexibility and it certainly is not about helping working families it is about ending the 40hour workweek mr bonior added it is about changing the laws so employers longer have to pay overtime wages for overtime work88 in opposition to the bill representative schroeder stated that americas working families are under tremendous stress and so she argued the sponsors of the comp time legislation have come up with this new warm fuzzy it sounds wonderful but she added this is not what we need an advocate of flexible and compressed work scheduling for federal employees during the 1970s and 1980s ms schroeder argued that the issue was different and that the legislation was misnamed it is wrong to try and trick americas families who are under such stress that you are trying to be so sympathetic toward them when all you are really doing is giving their employers even more money and even more authority over the time and the hours that they work ms schroeder concluded this is wrong it should be defeated89 consideration of the rule debate commenced with representative greene of utah as part of the houses new crop of working mothers i am proud to be cosponsor of this legislation she said it is commonsense legislation to give working families muchneeded option in balancing their work and family schedules in 1938 most women worked at home today most women work both in their homes and outside of the home and struggle to balance the time demands of work and family particularly those of children she termed the flsa overtime 86 house report 104670 p 32 87 congressional record june 26 1996 p h8561 88 congressional record july 26 1996 p h8562 89 congressional record july 26 1996 p h8561 there were counterpart speeches in behalf of hr 2391 just then but extensive procomp time comments followed during consideration of the rule and of the legislation crs25 provisions the 40hour week anachronistic as hampering americas new generation of working families90 the argument in favor of comp time legislation stressed that it would be family oriented would expand worker choice and flexibility and meet the needs of working women ms greene affirmed things have changed since 1938 we have more working parents more single parents more divorces we also have more seniors living longer needing the care and love of their children and grandchildren hr 2391 will permit working parents to bank comp time so that they can have time available to tend to sick child to go to special event for that child like baseball game or dance recital or to care for fragile parent if some of those workers prefer extra cash wages for overtime they can still choose that focusing upon choice ms greene concluded this is chance to help working families get little more control over their lives by giving them greater choices and more flexibility lets let them choose and she noted the point is that under this legislation the choice will be theirs not washingtons91 representative moakley dissented saying that the legislation basically means that employees can be forced to take paid time off rather than overtime pay it allows the employer to stop paying overtime and to say to employees sorry i cant pay you overtime but in return for your long hours you can take vacation when its convenient for if im still in business he stated the legislation not only enables the employers to decide whether or not to offer comp time but also provides protections for when and how worker can use their comp time his office he noted had not been deluged with letters and calls or telegrams from employees clamoring for comp time92 the heated debate exposed deeply held and diametrically opposed views of this legislation critics chairman goodling charged totally distort the facts93 representative ballenger referred to balderdash sprinkled with horse feathers and to distortions prevarications and untruths94 representative schroeder agreed that there had been distortion but from the other side she urged congress to strip off

pro and seemed to reflect each speakers vision of workers of employers and of their interrelationship within the competitive free market system representative meyers denied that all employers are bad people who are looking for ways to cheat their employees affirming that most employers have deep and genuine concern about the people who work for them and they want to do everything they can to satisfy their employees needs97 conversely representative wynn observed the reality of the workplace is that most employees want to keep their jobs and therefore go along with the employer that means he added that when the employer suggests comp time they are going to take it98 mr ballenger contended that the workers protections of the bill were adequate they the workers can go to court on their own or they could go to the secretary of labor mr reich who is not friend of business and he will do it for them to enforce that law99 representative hefner on the other hand questioned how many people would have on their own the resources to go to court and how many people of their own would know where to go mr hefner suggested that 90 percent of the people in our district in north carolina do not have any idea who mr reich is100 mr wynn concurred i do not want to hear that oh well they can go to court and we lowered the legal standard the fact of the matter is minimum wage workers are not going into anybodys court they are not going down the street to see robert reich to talk about labor violation those remedies he concluded are not practicable101 representative meek seemed similarly dubious many employers will find way to force employees to accept compensatory time instead of cash because they know the employees dont have the resources to fight this coercion102 ms greene of utah pursued the issue of worker choice the bill she argued gives workers the flexibility that they need to be able to balance those competing considerations of work and family it gives workers more control over their lives to be able to choose for themselves in the circumstances for each of their families ms greene urged let us give workers that choice let us respect their ability to choose for themselves what is best and not dictate it from washington as we have for the past 60 years103 again there was dissent mr owens charged that the bill is flawed at its center central to the legislation he argued was the assumption of mutual consent between the parties in relationship where all the power is on one side 97 congressional record july 26 1996 p h8567 98 congressional

truly voluntary agreement was hoax the bill clearly attempts to gut the protection of the fair labor standards act and undermines living standards to the detriment of workers105 unlike traditional overtime pay stated representative mckinney workers can only use their comp time when it is convenient for their employers not their families so much for family friendly legislation106 the vote on the rule was 228 yeas to 175 nays107 floor consideration of the bill on july 30 1996 the house commenced debate on hr 2391 itself representative goodling chairman of the reporting committee explained that 20 changes had been made in the legislation since it was introduced all supporting the employee with further changes to be added on the floor he then set about to correct the misinformation and the disinformation that was distributed friday mr goodling reaffirmed that the choice to take overtime compensation in the form of paid time off must be voluntary and must be requested by the employee and pointed to prohibitions against threats intimidation etc of workers by their employers where the comp time option is concerned chairman goodling stressed safeguards remedies and protections in his defense of the legislation representative clay however branded the legislation flimflam flextime and asserted that it will provide an excuse to undermine the living standards of working families108 the ensuing debate followed wellestablished lines hr 2391 is profamily proworker prowomen and provides relief to the hardworking men and women across our nation who struggle daily to support their families representative myrick observed dads could use the accrued time to make sure they are behind the dugout for that critical little league game and mom and dad could use their time to visit their childs school for the parentteacher conferences enabling and encouraging parents to participate in their childs education ms myrick added even the president and vice president endorse giving workers

president has proposal of his own but does not support the bill that we are debating now the president thinks this bill is disaster continued crs28 representative andrews with 3yearold daughter could appreciate ms myricks concern yet he opposed the bill and questioned whether the comp time option was truly voluntary with workers and were abuse to occur stated that the worker has meaningful or realistic remedy mr andrews had raised this issue during committee consideration i think the employee has burden of proof that would be almost impossible to sustain i think there are some legitimate questions as to under which specific circumstances that employee could in fact recover her or his attorney fees and further i think an employee who exercises his or her right to choose cash rather than comp time would not be able to achieve an effective remedy if the employer wanted to punish him or her for making that choice he distinguished between the workplace environment of public and private sector employment if public sector workers are singled out for unfair treatment there is set body of law that provides for both substantive remedies and meaningful procedures in order to enforce their rights that does not exist in the private sector noting various other concerns he affirmed i oppose the bill i urge its defeat110 conversely subcommittee chairman ballenger argued that the comp time measure was commonsense legislation and affirmed that employees want it he declared american workers want and deserve flexibility in the workplace to better deal with the challenges of balancing work and family obligations in contrast to representative andrews mr ballenger concluded i urge my colleagues to support this legislation which will allow american men and women to make the choice for themselves between extra money or paid time off111 with strong industry support hr 2391 was being urged as family friendly and proworker representative mckinney queried does anyone believe for 1 minute that workers were consulted on this bill112 for the absence of labor support representative shays suggested one answer that it was really debate between union leaders and rankandfile members113 proponents and opponents divided on whether comp time would actually be voluntary representative riggs assured his colleague that the bill in explicit language prohibits an employer from compelling an employee to take compensatory time or time off in lieu of overtime compensation so employee in any 109 continued congressional record july 30 1996 p h8779 110 congressional record july

hr 2391 had better understanding of the concerns of workers than did the trade union leadership it was also possible that the comp time bill was simply industryoriented legislation skillfully titled the working families flexibility act suggested representative pomeroy perhaps it is unintentional but unfortunately this bill represents yet another proposal put forth by the majority which will increase the strain on working families and jeopardize our nations basic workplace protections see ibid p h8786 crs29 occupation in any industry can be compelled to take compensatory time off114 ms schroeder viewed things differently we hear people saying oh employers will not compel employees to say they would rather have time off than pay timeandahalf pay oh yeah show the employer that would rather give you money than time off employers are going to say you want to work here this is voluntary decision if you voluntarily decide you want to work here then you better bloody well volunteer to sign this thing saying if there is any overtime you will take time off rather than get money ms schroeder added let us be real clear about this when people are working at those kinds of levels of jobs they cannot negotiate with their employer either they will never get overtime or they will not get hired at all115 what was really needed ms schroeder argued was predictability we need to be able to predict when we have to work and predict when we are going to have time off so that we can tell the school we can be there to help with the kids if my child is going on field trip he explained that is when i need to have the time off not 3 weeks later when it is convenience for the employer that is why this bill is joke116 as debate drew to close representatives goodling and ballenger proposed series of amendments dealing primarily with employee protections discussed below representative clay opposing the measure argued that the bill should not have been reported out of committee without basic employee protections in the first place though he applauded his colleagues for belatedly recognizing that their bill has many flaws the supplemental amendments he maintained though numerous were insufficient to rescue bill that is fatally flawed117 similarly representative becerra asked how good bill and that is what we were told it was when it left the committee should suddenly need more than 20 changes being made now at the last moment now that it is on the floor to try to correct all these problems in the bill118 the amendments to hr 2391 were approved on passage of the amended bill the vote was 225 yeas to 195 nays amended version passed by the house in the amended bill choice and thus flexibility continued to rest in the first instance with the employer an employer may offer compensatory time off to an employee if the employer declines to make that offer that ends the matter if the employer agrees to initiate program the 114 congressional record july 30 1996 p h8783 115

changes in the legislation were being offered by supporters of the measure crs30 design of the program how many hours to be offered which of his employees may participate in the program on what terms banked hours may be drawn down etc remained with the employer where there was union presence employees may have right to bargain with respect to the option where there was collective bargaining agreement and official employee representative individual workers would negotiate with their employers the issue of the use of accrued hours remained ie definition of within reasonable period and does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer both concepts would need to be defined in regulation or would be left to the discretion of the employer the scheduling of hours of work in excess of 40 per week from which the comp time flows is an employer prerogative as approved by the house the bill would allow private sector employees to accrue up to 240 hours of comp time but under the floor amendments all time in excess of 80 hours may be cashedout by the employer with at least 30 days notice to the worker further an employer could unilaterally discontinue the program upon giving employees 30 days notice119 private sector employee in the absence of collective bargaining agreement etc would be able to terminate his individual agreement to accept comp time at any time120 employee remedies for violation of workers rights were broadened by the floor amendments as reported an employee had to prove that his employer had willfully violated the admonition not to directly or indirectly intimidate threaten or coerce etc with respect to participation in or utilization of the comp time option the word willfully was dropped from the legislation as passed the secretary of labor was directed within 30 days after enactment to develop language that employers could post notifying workers of the comp time option and of their rights were such program to be developed by an employer hr 2391 was essentially enabling legislation it waived flsa overtime pay requirements where necessary to allow employers to develop comp time programs though critics expressed concern for protection of worker rights further worker rights protections could have made the legislation administratively topheavy preventing achievement of the goals of the bills sponsors121 119 it may not be entirely clear what would become of accrued comp time under the 80hour limit were an employer to terminate the program the legislation may permit cashout at the termination of the program but it is also possible that the comp time below 80 hours would continue to be drawable by employees until used or until the end of the program year where comp time program has become part of the collectively bargained agreement or of another agreement with an official representative of the workers it may not be clear the extent to which an employer could terminate the program at will 120 because the language of the legislation as approved by the house grants right of termination of the comp time agreement only to workers covered under paragraph 2aii it may not be clear whether worker covered by collective agreement may similarly withdraw from the program either at all or at his or her own individual choice 121 when legislation of this sort is signed into law it is passed along to the administering continued crs31 the ashcroft proposal on august 7 1995 senator ashcroft introduced s 1129 the work and family integration act122 he stated that the rigid and inflexible overtime pay provisions of the flsa have paralyzed those it was meant to help the flsa he continued now deprives employees of the right to order their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home123 general provisions of s 1129 s 1129 would have added new subsection to section 13 of the flsa exemptions first it would have allowed employers to set aside the standard 40hour workweek and replace it with 160hour basic work requirement ie 160 workhours over 4week period that is scheduled for less than 20 workdays second within the 160hour period employers would have been allowed flexibility in arranging work schedules that is any arrangement of hours so long as the total for the 4week period did not exceed 160 within the 4 week160hour period overtime pay would have been required third if it were deemed appropriate to schedule more than 160 workhours in 4week period then those employees participating in flexible credit hour program under the legislation could have worked up to 48 hours beyond their regular 160 hours carrying over the excess 48 hours to succeeding 4week period as credit hours fourth hours worked in excess of 160 credit hours would have been credited to the employee at straighttime rate thus it appears timeandahalf would not be required until an employee had worked 208 hours in single 4week period ie 160 regular workhours plus 48 credit hours fifth the employer would have been allowed to establish program of flexible scheduling that would have stood alone within the existing 40 hour workweek or have been combined with the 160hour work period for greater flexibility sixth employee could have been required to participate in the flexible and compressed scheduling program any threat intimidation or coercion on the part of the employer would have been prohibited were an employee to decline to participate in the compressed or flexible workhours program he or she could still have been required to work in excess of 40 hours week but in that case the overtime pay provisions of current law would have applied124 the proposal would have divided workers and workplaces into two groups first there were those covered by collective bargaining agreement union workers which would govern implementation of the scheduling arrangements second there 121 continued agency here dol which then develops implementing regulations while such regulations may resolve any remaining ambiguities of the legislative language they may also add to the burdens of employers in the utilization of the option 122 s 1129 was referred to the senate committee on labor and human resources on december 6 1995 companion legislation hr 2723 introduced by representative doolittle was referred to the committee on economic and educational opportunities 123 congressional record august 7 1995 p s11788 124 how such concepts as threat intimidation and coercion might have been interpreted in the various working environments seems unclear crs32 were those not covered by collective bargaining agreement for the most part non union workers in which case the program drawn up or authorized by management would have been controlling in addition s 1129 dealt with series of other issues it allowed for the priority rehiring of former employees under certain conditions without incurring penalties of law eg civil rights discrimination seniority pension requirements etc it modified section 13a1 of the flsa with respect to leave and overtime pay policies for salaried workers an issue that has been in contention for several years125 and it brought the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act into conformity with the 160hour 4week formula of the ashcroft legislation126 the senate hearing february 1996 in the original flsa of 1938 it was fairly simple to determine which employees were entitled to overtime pay and which were not labor and human resources committee chair kassebaum noted in opening the february 27 1996 hearing on overtime work through the years congress has amended the statute and dol has developed regulations to implement those amendments thus senator kassebaum noted what was once simple process has given rise to confusing maze of rules and regulations about how the law should be applied in each workplace127 comments by senator ashcroft through the past half century observed senator ashcroft the lead witness the demographics of the workforce have changed from primarily male workforce to one in which 75 of the mothers with school age children work thus he proposed to allow employers with agreement by their employees to modify the flsa overtime pay requirements in the name of greater flexibility there is real need for workers to be able to devote more time to their families flexible work schedules would give employees more control over their lives by allowing them to balance family and work obligations better in addition 125 salaried workers are generally overtime pay exempt under section 13a1 of the flsa and are normally more highly paid executive administrative or professional workers when such employees work extended hours beyond 40 hours in week they are not paid overtime because they are on straight salary and as professionals etc are expected to do what is required of them however when salaried worker having worked overtime without extra pay needs to be absent from work for an hour or two for personal reasons some employers have chosen to dock the pay of the employee for that absence the department of labor has ruled that such docking may convert the exempt employee into nonexempt employee and subject the employer to the payment of overtime wages where hours are worked in excess of 40 per week 126 federal employees covered by the federal employees flexible and compressed work schedules act 1978 as extended may work compressed schedules of 80 hours however structured within 2week period without the employer being subject to overtime pay requirements 127 us congress senate committee on labor and human resources oversight of the fair labor standards act hearings 104th cong 2nd sess february 27 1996 washington us govt print

reduced by as much as 20128 the senator observed that overtime pay and the 40hour workweek could prevent parent from attending childfamily related activities scheduled for friday afternoon129 he pointed to the popularity of flexible and compressed scheduling for the federal sector cited president clintons endorsement of workhours flexibility noted that balancing work and family obligations was the number one concern of working women and concluded to combat the rigidity of the fair labor standards act i have introduced the work and family integration act s 1129130 general testimony the

this argument the soccer mom thesis the inability of worker to be off on friday afternoon childrelated function such as soccer game would frequently be reasserted through debate on this issue when introducing s 4 in the 105th congress discussed below senator ashcroft stated it is against the law for an employer to agree with his employee that the employee can take time off on friday afternoon to see his daughter get an award at the local high school and to make up that same time on monday the strict laws about hours and overtime he emphasized make it difficult for that to happen make it impossible make it illegal congressional record january 21 1997 p s221 under current law parent wishing to take time off on friday afternoon would be permitted were the employer agreeable to work extra time on the prior monday tuesday wednesday etc or even on friday morning to offset the time away from work on friday afternoon this of course would require some measure of planning as would utilization of the comp time option an employee with the agreement of the employer could also take leave without pay or annual leave if the need were medical emergency the family and medical leave act could in some cases provide an option various witnesses did comment on the question of the need for anticipatory scheduling of comp time use for example pete peterson of hewlettpackard testifying for the flecs coalition in support of hr 2391 observed with respect to the use of the comp time option it cant be just the employee saying i want to take it comp time right now matter what see house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 446 the same position was taken by kathleen fairall of the timken company speaking for shrm and for the flecs coalition when asked by mr romerobarcelo concerning comp time utilization she responded i think they would have to it would be mutually agreeable scheduling i mean they couldnt come up tomorrow and say i want to take tomorrow off as my compensatory time see house subcommittee on workforce protections hearings 1995 p 233 130 senate hearing 1996 pp 24 crs34 of columbia phyllis g diosey malcolm pirnie inc and glenn baker john alden life insurance company131 pay docking initially discussion focused upon pay docking one of the issues dealt with in the ashcroft bill132 the ashcroft bill s 1129 would modify section 13a1 of the flsa so that an executive administrative or professional employee would be both overtime pay exempt and subject to having his or her pay docked should the employer choose to do so in an exchange between senator ashcroft and attorney leibig the senator suggested that under the present system one had flexibility to allow employees to take short term leave if one were willing to pay people for not showing up leibig countered they have the flexibility now to pay people salary or hourly133 if workers are paid on an hourly basis and they absent themselves for few hours the employer can dock their pay under current law however if they are salaried employees the employer cannot dock their salary for short absences without risking their conversion of nonexempt status the choice rests with the employer senator ashcroft so your view is that it should be rigid 40 hour week and if person wants to take 2 hours off on friday afternoon to attend to sick child he or she should not be allowed the flexibility of volunteering to make that up the next week without some sort of penalty is that your view mr leibig it is my feeling that there should be national standard for 40hour work week but that it should be flexible in areas where it is necessary for instance today under the family leave act if people need to take time off to take care of sick child and so forth there is flexibility already 131 several of the witnesses had appeared at prior hearings on overtime issues diosey leibig robinson and coil testified before the house subcommittee on workforce protections in 1995 see us congress house committee on education and labor subcommittee on labor standards occupational health and safety hearing on the fair labor standards act hearings 103rd cong 1st sess july 1 1993 p 32 and us congress house committee on economic and educational opportunities subcommittee on workforce protections hearings on the fair labor standards act hearings 104th cong 1st sess march 30 june 8 october 25 and november 1 1995 pp 16 54 63 208 and 456 in 1995 ms coil had testified both for motorola and the labor policy association 132 speaking generally this issue involves two classifications of employees salaried workers normally more highly paid administrative executive and professional employees may be exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the flsa when as professionals etc they work few hours beyond 40 in week their salary is unchanged but then neither are they docked if they need to absent themselves from the workplace for brief period hourly workers often earning substantially less are nonexempt and are paid overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 per week but their hourly wages are docked when they absent themselves from the workplace for brief periods 133 senate hearings 1996 pp 1415 crs35 the chairman senator kassebaum but mr leibig isnt that only for employers of 50 employees or more mr leibig sure small employers are not covered by the other rules either and if it is question of whether the family leave act should be expanded to employers of less than 50 if that is the debate i guess i would favor expanding it leibig added it is one thing for workers to have comp time available for certain needs especially at their own choice but it is another thing to say we should abandon basic 40hour work standard and allow the work week to get longer and longer134 the workers choice throughout central issue related to whether flexibility could be secured at the workers choice or at the employers convenience senator ashcroft affirmed the proposed change to the statute is to give the employee the option not to give the employer the option and i think those are different questions mr leibig concurred that choice was the issue but disagreed on the substance of s 1129 at it stood mr leibig if there is provision that the employee has absolute access to get comp time and for instance after the comp time is in the bank the employee has the right of when to take it off and when to use it senator ashcroft i think that is the nature of the proposal mr leibig the bills that have been introduced in the house and your own bill do not have that s 1129 you may intend to put it in employee choice and i think that should be encouraged but it is not in there now senator ashcroft well it certainly is at the employees option not at the employers choice mr leibig it is the employees option to take the comp time135 but once he has it it is not at his or her option whether to use it or have access to it it is controlled by the employer or at least it is allowed to be controlled by the employer under the way the bills are136 discussion then moved on to other aspects of the act the various witnesses joining in the discourse with prepared statements and responding to questions an overview of the hearing although the focus of the hearing was s 1129 the compressed schedule comp time and pay docking the seminar portion of the 134 senate hearings 1996 p 16 135 as the legislation was introduced the first option would have been the employers whether or not to institute comp time program then if the employer offered such program the employee would have had the option of participation assuming that he or she was part of the covered group of workers the use of comp time the timing of the drawing down of banked hours would then be left to the discretion of the employer 136 senate hearings 1996 pp 1718 crs36 session was more wideranging also discussed was the wagehour treatment of bona fide executive administrative or professional employees and those employed in the capacity of outside salesman questions were raised concerning waiting time oncall status break time sleeping time training time travel time including commuting in company vehicles unauthorized work the concept of to suffer or permit to work calculation of the regular rate for overtime pay purposes what to do about supplementary earnings such as commissions bonus shift premiums etc and the distinction between discretionary bonuses and nondiscretionary bonuses for wagehour compliance each of the issues involved technical and complex interpretation of the statute and of its implementing regulations chairman kassebaum at various points observed that the regulations were convoluted137 and that the act and its implementation was enormously complicated and with enormously burdensome requirements that she noted is why we are trying to understand and sort through this to see where we can perhaps address it in some constructive way138 through the course of the hearings there was some disagreement as to how the statute was applied what the courts and the department of labor held and what options for flexibility existed under current law one from dol was present to explain that agencys interpretation of the act or its procedures for enforcing it139 toward the end of the session leibig noted that all of the witnesses who are here today except the ones who are lawyers are people who did not benefit or say they did not benefit from the fair labor standards act he suggested that many americans do benefit from the act and that there are employers who will take advantage of workers it would be good idea at some point leibig suggested for the committee to hear some of the workers who do feel they need the protection of the act i think it is unusual that none were invited or are here chairman kassebaum responded well mr leibig i would guess that everyone here would agree with you that they would not want an employer to abuse the fair labor standards act140 overtime pay and comp time the 105th congress as preparations began for the 105th congress changes in overtime pay law remained an issue receiving top priority among emerging labor issues stated tim 137 senate hearings 1996 p 28 138 senate hearings 1996 p 43 139 leibig an attorney in private practice functioned during the hearing as wagehour technician but his views were not necessarily concurred in by other panel members maggi coil of motorola and john shamley from the district of columbia government were introduced as two distinguished wage and hour experts who have taught seminars on flsa through the american compensation association of which coil was then president neither of course was able to speak for the department of labor 140 senate hearings 1996 p 34 crs37 shorrock of the journal of commerce is republican bill designed to make the us workplace more flexible through the use of comp time thats not only good for employees observed sandra boyd of the labor policy association its good for the bottom line peggy taylor of the aflcio was less enthusiastic suggesting in shorrocks summary that the initiatives could gut the 40hour week and make workers vulnerable to pressures from employers to take time off instead of overtime pay141 under date of december 17 1996 representative goodling chair of the full committee on education and the workforce circulated dear colleague letter inviting members to become cosponsors of new comp time legislation that will be the same as hr 2391 as passed by the house on july 30 1996142 roughly parallel letter was dispatched on january 2 1997 by representatives shays and myrick143 on january 8 1997 group of house republican women endorsed what they called family friendly legislation to allow the use of comp time in place of overtime pay meanwhile similar interest was rising in the senate144 by late january the wall street journal reported that republicans and business groups will be taking their fight directly to the public which survey by the probusiness labor policy association suggests supports the concept of flexibility overwhelmingly145 workhours legislation reintroduced on

chaired on january 21 1997 senator ashcroft introduced s 4 the family friendly workplace act147 which was referred to the subcommittee on employment and training chaired by senator dewine cosponsor of the legislation the new ballenger bill hr 1 hr 1 differed in some respects from hr 2391 of the 104th congress in the earlier legislation mr ballenger had proposed restructuring of section 7o of the act dealing only with wagehour coverage for state and local government workers to expand its provisions in modified form to the private sector workforce in hr 1 mr ballenger proposed adding new

that it be entered into knowingly and voluntarily by such employee c that it was not condition of employment149 and d that it must be written or otherwise verifiable statement the employer could not directly or indirectly intimidate threaten or coerce or attempt to intimidate threaten or coerce any employee with respect to the option employees could accrue maximum 240 hours of comp time and

would be allowed to discontinue the comp time option upon 30 days notice to the employee the employee to rescind his agreement to participate giving written notice at any time within 30 days thereafter the employee would be given monetary compensation for his banked hours hr 1 made clear that an employee who terminated his employment voluntarily or involuntarily would be paid for unused comp time hr 1 retained the language providing for the use of comp time within reasonable period of time when it does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer penalty and posting requirements also appeared in hr 1 the new ashcroft bill s 4 s 4 was comprehensive and covered areas not dealt with in hr 1 it set forth several workhours options and in addition the bill dealt with certain other aspects of existing law150 among its provisions were the following compensatory time off like hr 1 s 4 began by adding new subsection r to section 7 of the flsa its provisions were similar to those of hr 1 establishing the same general options and requirements biweekly work programs under s 4 an employer would be allowed to establish 2week 80hour work period during which without incurring an overtime penalty an employer could schedule work in any manner 2 weeks of 40 hours each 60 hours in one week and 20 hours in the other etc he would not have been required to pay overtime rates timeandahalf until after 80 hours had been worked 148 as in the earlier legislation the employer would determine the structure or scope of the option or the restraints imposed upon its utilization 149 the concepts knowingly and voluntarily were not defined potentially significant matter were the worker unaccustomed to american labormanagement practices uncertain of his legal rights or not fluent in english or with respect to the requirement that the agreement not be condition of employment 150 the text of s 4 appears in the congressional record january 21 1997 pp s222s224 and is available on thomas crs39 in 2 calendar weeks for hours worked in excess of 80 in 2week period worker could be compensated either in cash or in paid comp time each at not less than timeandahalf basis worker would have been allowed to participate in this biweekly compressed scheduling with the option set forth in the legislation of declining flexible credit hour program an employer at his initiative but in conformity with collective bargaining agreement where there is trade union presence was to be allowed to establish flexible credit hour program once the program had been established the employee would then have been allowed to elect whether to participate where worker chose to participate in flexible credit hour program he and his employer would then jointly designate hours for the employee to work that are in excess of the basic work requirement151 of the employee so that the employee can accumulate flexible credit hours to reduce the hours worked in week or day subsequent to the day on which the flexible credit hours are worked compensation for flexible credit hours would have been on straight time basis an employee would not have been allowed to accumulate more than 50 flexible credit hours at any one time there were cashout provisions an employee as in the comp time program could not have been forced to participate in the credit hours option an employee would have been permitted to work through 40hour workweek or an 80hour biweekly work period then in agreement with his employer in lieu of the overtime pay requirements of the flsa up to another 50 hours to be worked on straight time basis and designated at credit hours salary practices relating to exempt employees as currently administered the pay of salaried worker one deemed bona fide executive administrative or professional employee may not be docked for brief absences from his or her workplace an hour or two since as noted above he may be called upon to work overtime hours without pay because of his or her status as professional etc if the pay of such salaried worker is docked he may be converted from overtime pay exempt to nonexempt causing the employer to pay extra for overtime hours worked152 s 4 would have amended the flsa by adding new section 13m it would have permitted salaried workers pay to be docked for short absences from his workplace153 151 it appears that the basic work requirement ones preovertime work period would be 40 hours or if participating in biweekly work program 80 hours 152 congressional record january 21 1997 p s225 153 crs report 92761 the overtime pay exemption for salaried employees the salary basis test issue by charles ciccone crs40 hearings of the 105th congress hearings on comp time and related issues commenced early in the 105th congress moving between the senate and the house and between s 4 and hr 1 the arguments pro and largely resembled those of 1995 and 1996 little appeared to have changed the senate opening hearing on february 4 1997 the senate subcommittee on employment and training chaired by senator dewine conducted general hearing on overtime pay issues under the flsa senator hutchison of texas the lead witness and cosponsor of s 4 presented an appeal for flexibility she noted that the flsa had been crafted in the wake of the great depression to protect workers from abusive conditions but suggested that such protection was longer necessary now employers are much more attuned to the needs and preferences of their employees senator hutchison declared s 4 winwin situation for both workers and their employers154 sandra boyd speaking both as chair of flecs and as assistant general counsel of the labor policy association noted that many companies have implemented creative workplace programs but that they are limited in what they can provide because of the overtime pay requirements of the flsa the employers i represent know that providing flexibility in the workplace is winwin she affirmed boyd explained the various provisions of s 4 and concluded that finding solutions to the needs of employers and employees seeking to increase workplace flexibility wont be easy but lifting the current roadblocks in the flsa is critical first step155 several proflexibility speakers followed michael losey president of the society for human resource management shrm branded the flsa as outdated and in some cases even unfriendly to our nations businesses and their employees he observed that employers find themselves constrained by the flsa when attempting to offer workers greater flexibility shrm also endorsed the extended work period 80 hours over 2 weeks as provided in s 4156 mark wilson speaking for the heritage foundation expressed similar views the flsa he stated was enacted to protect unskilled lowpay workers but in todays economy where both parents are likely to be working its rigid and inflexible provisions hurt more than they help wilson opined the flsa deprives workers of the right to order their daily lives both on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home he found it disturbing that only 153 percent of all private fulltime employees were 154 daily labor report february 5 1996

opposition to an increase in the minimum wage support for 160 hour preovertime monthly work period support for wider employment of unpaid volunteers support for pay docking etc crs41 working on flexible schedules157 william kilberg solicitor of labor during the ford administration frequent witness on flsa issues protested that the flsas 60 yearold structure far too often works against the interests and desires of the employees it purports to protect he too called for flexibility158 one of the biggest backers for amending the overtime law is trw inc according to the wall street journal as the senate hearing approached the journal conducted number of interviews with persons interested in changing the overtime pay requirements of the flsa among them christine korzendorfer an executive assistant with trw korzendorfer noted that she had lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars during her last pregnancy after her doctor ordered her to stay in bed for month if she had been allowed to accumulate comp time korzendorfer argued she could have traded in those hours and not lost pay for the days she missed the journal concluded now pregnant again she worries about repeat159 accompanied by sallie larsen trw vice president for human resources and communications korzendorfer also testified before the subcommittee on employment and training160 different perspective was presented by karen nussbaum director of the working womens department aflcio for the past 25 years ms nussbaum began i have been an advocate for working families and particularly working women she noted the number of women now in the workforce and argued that the vast majority of working families the bottom 80 are seeing their incomes stagnate or fall behind she asserted theres gap in work and family policies as well despite the fact that lowincome families need familyfriendly workplaces even more than do highincome earners because their lower pay limits their ability to purchase flexible dependent care and 157 statement of mark wilson february 4 1997 in contrast to wilsons contention is the testimony of later witness edith rasell of the economic policy institute who stated under current law employers can allow employees to vary their arrival and departure time and take time off during the day even while requiring specified number of hours to be worked each week under current law employers can offer workers compressed work week such as four tenhour days per week permitting one additional day off per week employers can reduce the length of the usual work week job sharing can be encouraged all this and more is possible however while many companies say they support such policies they are actually used in very few firms and by very few people survey of 121 private companies found that just 14 routinely made available flextime program moreover 92 of those without flexitime program said it was unlikely they would adopt such program in the future only 10 of fulltime hourly workers have flexible work schedules 158 statement of william kilberg february 4 1997 kilberg represented the coalition for fair labor standards act reform group of employers and associations associated with flecs 159 the wall street journal january 28 1997 p a18 160 statement of christine korzendorfer february 4 1997 crs42 take unpaid leave it is higherincome employees who are more likely to have companysupported child care job sharing and paid leave nussbaum who previously served as director of the womens bureau at dol acknowledged that flexibility was primary concern for working women but the more important issue here is control over working hours women around the country have explained to she recalled that flextime that provides flexibility to the employer but that wreaks havoc on an employees schedule is solution she presented number of examples the bank executive who was expected to work late with notice the waitress at diner who was changed to the night shift despite the fact that she had child care for evening hours and the nurse scheduled to work second shift shortly before her first shift ended when you ask these workers and many like them if changing the 40hour work week helps them they respond with resounding she continued when lowincome workers choose to work overtime they do it for the money she urged that the family and medical leave act be expanded that higher standards for fair pay be set and that paid leave be assured for basic needs161 nussbaum affirmed the aflcios adamant opposition to s 4 and charged we see nothing familyfriendly in taking away from employees the right to overtime pay and substituting system of compensatory time off that is riddled with loopholes and limitations and further we certainly see nothing familyfriendly about expanding the class of employees who are exempt from the fair labor standards act and who thus will have right to either overtime pay or compensatory time off she branded the several proposals large steps backwards that would mean more control to employers and less money for workers162 the house opening hearing the following morning february 5 representative ballenger convened the subcommittee on workforce protection for consideration of hr 1 mr ballenger observed that american workers want more flexibility and choices in the workplace to better deal with the challenges of balancing work and family obligations163 representative owens the ranking minority member of the subcommittee countered that the bill would give employers complete discretion to determine if they will offer comp time when they will offer comp time and to whom they will offer comp time164 in his opening remarks mr ballenger distinguished between the house and senate bills s 4 goes beyond offering comp time and into other issues there are those who will attempt to confuse the bills as way to try to defeat comp time he remarked they do service to american workers he pointed to the work that 161 daily labor report february 5 1997 p e8 162 daily labor report february 5 1997 pp e8e9 163 daily labor report february 6 1997 p e1 164 daily labor report february 6 1997 p a5a6 crs43 had gone into shaping the legislation of the 104th congress noted the interest of president clinton is flexible hours legislation and expressed optimism that hr 1 could be passed165 the first panel was group of republican house members representatives fowler granger and myrick representative dunn had been scheduled to testify but was unable to appear each in turn reiterated the need for workplace flexibility citing their own experiences by way of emphasis today significant portion of employers want to give their employees more flexibility ms fowler observed adding in an ironic twist of fate however they are prevented from doing so by the fair labor standards act law which was passed before many of us were even born166 other panels followed two witnesses associated with trw inc who had testified the prior day at the senate hearing ms korzendorfer and ms larsen and spokesperson for the society of human resource management shrm appealed for workplace flexibility each trw and shrm was associated with flecs several individuals in their own behalf urged that hr 1 be promptly enacted bob weisman management attorney from columbus ohio argued that hr 1 should be considered as piece of winwin legislation and was baffled by organized labors present objection to the proposal167 the womens perspective was addressed pro and by two of the panelists speaking first was diana furchtgottroth resident fellow at the american enterprise institute and member of the national advisory board of the independent womens forum she was followed by helen norton director equal opportunity programs for the womens legal defense fund ms furchtgottroth168 began with the affirmation that hr 1 if enacted could improve the welfare of all americans and will be of especial benefit to working american women ms furchtgottroth began under current law employers are required to offer to hourly workers only monetary compensation in return for overtime the legislation she asserted would be beneficial it would provide workers with choice with respect to compensation time or money it would extend to middleincome americans those privileges already enjoyed by salaried workers it would make it easier for women to combine work and family it 165 daily labor report february 6 1997 p e1 166 news release representative tillie k fowler february 5 1995 p 1 167 statement of bob weisman house subcommittee on workforce protections february 5 1997 168 the independent womens forum iwf based in arlington virginia has been described as group of conservative women activists most of them welleducated wellconnected white professionals see respectively human events april 14 1995 p 11 the wall street journal october 13 1995 p a16 and the washington post november 30 1995 p d1 ms furchtgottroth had been associated with domestic policy council and the office of policy planning of the bush white house and before that with the american petroleum institute crs44 increases the efficiency of the economy by making labor markets more flexible the bill represents prudent use of government authority to enhance the welfare of american workers ms furchtgottroth did not address the options even to private sector workers under current law for flexitime compressed scheduling and even for comp time within 40hour workweek context as she proceeded with her prepared statement ms furchtgottroth emphasized the notion of choice for workers stating the premise giving individuals greater number of attractive choices makes them better off further she affirmed the legislation gives employees not employers the power to choose what is in their best interests either more time or more money169 she stated that the flsa was wellintentioned law fashioned in 1938 by clever people who might never have imagined comp time as we know it today she asserted choice simply is not available to these employees millions of average american hourly workers under current federal labor law she pointed to the increased numbers of women in the modern workforce their desire to spend more time with their children even at the cost of income and noted that it is common sense that working women stand to benefit the most from hr 1 from the additional flexibility in the workplace and additional opportunities to have more flexible hours ms furchtgottroth expressed her belief that many women not already in the workforce might be encouraged to seek employment if comp time option were available she conceded that government might legitimately concern itself with workplace safety and child labor but where she queried is the public interest in denying employees the choice of comp time then returning to the flsa she affirmed overtime is simply hours taken away from the life of employees and yet current law denies those employees the opportunity to regain that lost time she conceded that there was concern in some quarters that hr 1 would lead to exploitation of workers since employers would pressure employees into accepting comp time instead of overtime pay however she concluded history has shown that when workers are given choices these choices are used fruitfully170 ms norton of the womens legal defense fund disagreed171 the fund develops and fights for policies that help women meet the dual demands of work and family and achieve economic security for themselves and their families hr 1 she contended is not about the real flexibility that working women need instead it 169 hr 1 allows employers the option of establishing comp time program where there is union contract the structure and scope of that option could be subject to negotiation where there is collectively bargained agreement the structure and scope of the option would be left to the choice of the employer the employee has the choice of agreeing to participate or of refusing to participate 170 statement diana furchtgottroth before the subcommittee on workforce protections february 5 1997 171 based in washington dc the womens legal defense fund founded in 1971 seeks to secure equal rights for women through advocacy and monitoring and public educations it was an active advocate of the family and medical league act see fischer carolyn and carol schwartz eds encyclopedia of associations 1996 detroit gale research inc 1995 p 2084 ms norton is director equal opportunity programs for the fund crs45 gives employees less control over both their time and their paychecks creating new risks and problems suggesting different view of the world from that of ms furchtgottroth ms norton argued that hr 1 does not give employees true choice she observed in the real world employers will have the last word the bill gives unscrupulous employers substantial new opportunity to coerce employees into taking time off even when they need or prefer to have money in their paychecks instead most hourly workers have little bargaining power in the workplace as it is and they are also the most likely to rely on overtime pay just to make ends meet if they insist on getting money instead of time they run very real risk if an employer would rather keep the money in the bank employees who do not accept comp time could find that they just are not getting the hours they have counted on or are getting assigned to bad shifts or have otherwise put their jobs and livelihoods at risk for those who need overtime pay the most comp time is not real option but it may be one they are directly or indirectly forced to accept under this bill if an employee is coerced into taking comp time against her wishes she has just two choices accept it or sue her employer in court bringing suit would put her job at risk and require resources both time and money that few hourly workers really have in practice she suggested hr 1 is not oriented toward the more highly paid salaried workers but rather toward lowerincome workers paid on an hourly basis ms norton went on to outline what she perceived to be additional hazards someone who is pressured into taking comp time when she really wants or needs overtime pay is taking an involuntary pay cut pure and simple since the employer controls when the comp time may actually be used the worker is essentially being asked to gamble on the chance that they will be able to take time when it is as valuable to them as overtime pay under the flsa she explained when employees work overtime they are compensated for it in the week that they worked but under hr 1 worker who accepts comp time could wait weeks or months before she can use the hours shes earned she added meanwhile the overtime pay that she would have received can be invested by her employer if the employee decides that she is better off with the cash than waiting any longer the employer can take up to 30 more days before putting the money in her paycheck the employee has lost money while her employer has had the opportunity to make money on the extra hours she worked further she pointed to the risk that firms paying their workers on an hourly basis such as the garment construction and janitorial service industries may simply close up shop without paying employees for their work for firms that have low capitalization the banking of comp time with its cashout value she suggests may provide an added stimulus for such employer behavior the more comp time workers accumulate and the longer employers can wait in fulfilling requests for compensation in time or money she noted the greater the risk to employees if employers disappear without ever paying for all the hours worked crs46 in ms nortons view hr 1 gives the employer not the employee the flexibility to decide when and even whether an employee can use her earned comp time should an employee turn to an employer with request to draw down few hours of comp time the employer can essentially say ill get back to you and keep her waiting for an as yet undefined reasonable period of time before responding regardless of her needs and when the employer does eventually respond the answer could as easily be as yes further she asserted hr 1 provides resource for employees whose requests to use their comp time are arbitrarily or unfairly denied there is nothing she can do this she stated is not flexibility from any working womans perspective ms norton observed that mandatory overtime is legal under current law and that hr 1 will not change that employers can still require employees to work up to 50 60 or more hours in week without advance notice or regard to employees other obligations employees in this situation can hardly be said to have flexibility or choice about the time they spend at work or at home under hr 1 however those overtime hours could be paid for in subsequent time off rather than in cash finally ms norton suggested that enforcement of federal wagehour law could potentially be rendered more complex were hr 1 enacted however she stated the bill contains money for the increased education or enforcement efforts that its changes will require172 karen nussbaum of the aflcio also appeared before the subcommittee on worker protections reiterating the points that she had made before the senate subcommittee the previous day see discussion above although not part of the hearing agenda statement from the associated builders and contractors inc supportive of hr 1 was circulated the senate second hearing on february 13 1997 the senate subcommittee on employment and training met second time for consideration of s 4 following brief review of the legislation chairman wine variously quoted statements by president clinton who appeared to have endorsed flexibility though not the specific ashcroft proposal and concluded i think we have consensus here and that we are very well positioned to make good faith effort to pass this legislation in bipartisan way173 172 statement of helen l norton womens legal defense fund before the subcommittee on workforce protections february 5 1997 173 statement by senator michael dewine subcommittee on employment and training february 13 1997 president clintons statement in his state of the union address was broad endorsement of flextime the president stated with new pressures on people in the way they work and live i believe we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences and childs medical checkup we should pass flextime so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their families see clinton william j address before joint session of the congress on the state of the continued crs47 the session opened with senator ashcroft as the first witness he was followed by paul jadin mayor of green bay wisconsin who focused primarily upon the treatment of salaried employees the salary basis test under the flsa similar issues were addressed by marilyn richter assistant corporation counsel of the city of new york174 support for s 4 was provided by the employer community william stone president of louisville plate glass company and speaking for the us chamber of commerce the worlds largest business federation forecast that almost all if not all of our employees will ask to participate in the comp time program if s 4 is passed but he quickly added of course it would be not only unwise but essentially unworkable to allow employees with accrued comp time to use that accrued time whenever they pleased and further with the comp time provisions of s 4 there would be little or need for most of the provisions of the family and medical leave act fmla175 ms kathleen fairall of the timken company returned as witness for the society for human resource management shrm being accompanied by ms sandie moneypenny technician for the timken company each had testified before the house subcommittee on workforce protections in 1995176 like other industry witnesses mr fairall argued that flexibility is not permitted under the flsa though she acknowledged that we can be flexible anytime within the seven day work week177 further appeal for s 4 was presented by james willms associated with the unicover corporation of cheyenne wyoming178 willms explained that unicover employees back in 1981 had sought comp time option on oneforone basis instead of timeandahalf in the form of overtime pay they said they wanted more freedom to work most when the company really needed it and 173 continued union february 4 1997 weekly compilation of presidential documents vol 33 6 p 140 in summarizing the senate subcommittee hearing the daily labor report february 14 1997 p aa1 noted the clinton administration has not endorsed the ashcroft bill 174 the statements of mayor jadin and of assistant corporation counsel richter are lengthy and detailed but address issues only tangential to this report and therefore are merely noted 175 statement william stone for the us chamber of commerce february 13 1997 176 at the june 8 1995 hearing before the house subcommittee on workforce protections ms fairall had spoken both for shrm and for the flecs coalition both in 1995 and here before the senate subcommittee ms moneypenny spoke as an individual through her testimony appeared in each case on timken letterhead and had the support of the timken company 177 statement by ms kathleen fairall subcommittee on employment and training february 13 1997 178 it was an appeal from the unicover corporation which had inspired senator wallop to introduce comp time legislation during the mid1980s the cheyennebased firm markets fine collectibles throughout north america and to about 30 countries from europe to the pacific rim it has about 160 employees crs48 less when demand was down willms explained the department of labor would not permit the arrangement and therefore willms urged that the law be changed179 the final employer witness was susan m eckerly speaking for the national federation of independent business nfib180 for years she commenced small business owners have been seeking less regulation in the workplace and more flexibility regarding how they treat their employees eckerly explained the burden created by federal regulation falls predominantly and disproportionately on the very people who we rely upon to create jobs small business owners and from this perspective she stated the flsa has become part of this burden that the federal government has dumped on the back of small business s 4 she suggested would be more small business friendly as with many earlier witnesses eckerly pointed to the age of the statute and noted that times have changed since its enactment the great depression has long since vanished and the widespread rates of high unemployment are an afterthought she noted the fair labor standards act is in desperate need of reform181 during discussion following her formal statement eckerly emphasized the financial hardship and narrow margin of profit facing small businesses some small employers she suggested cant afford to pay their employees overtime this flextime is something they can offer in exchange that gives workers benefit say youre building contractor because of the seasonal nature of building contractors you want to have your employees work 30 hours one week and 50 hours the next you dont want to have to pay in that second week 10 hours of additional overtime to your employees the reason why small contractor cant on that second week have employees work for 50 hours is because they cant afford to pay the additional overtime for that 10 additional hours senator wellstone responded we want to make sure that large or small business now does not say to an employee listen we have other choice we need the 50 hours of work done and thats the option were presenting to you then the senator observed people worry theyre going to lose their job if they dont take it182 179 statement of james willms subcommittee on employment and training february 13 1997 180 ms eckerly explained that the nfib is the nations largest small business advocacy organization representing 600000 small business owners in all 50 states and the district of columbia 181 statement of susan m eckerly subcommittee on employment and training february 13 1997 182 congress daily february 19 1997 cngdailynjdccom following the hearing senator ashcroft wrote to nfib president jack faris to protest what he argued was mischaracterization of s 4 ms eckerly congress daily observed had implied the bill would allow company managers not employees to set an employees 80hour schedule over two weeks and would help small businesses that cannot afford to pay overtime senator ashcroft termed the eckerly statement unfortunately misleading and inaccurate continued crs49 as in prior hearings the womens legal defense fund opposed s 4 and similar amendment of the flsa donna lenhoff general counsel for the fund declared that s 4 was not about the real flexibility that working women need instead it gives employees less control over their time and their paychecks creating new risks and problems it does not give employees true choice between extra time off and overtime pay183 david m silberman labor lawyer but speaking only on his own behalf similarly raised objections to s 4 but presented them in somewhat different manner quickly summarizing the requirements of the act overtime after 40 hours of work per week he noted within this limitation the act leaves employers and employees complete leeway to work out mutually satisfactory work schedules and there is absolutely nothing in the flsa which in any way constrains the ability of employers to accommodate employees who need time off by granting such employees paid or unpaid leave s 4 he suggested would be sharp break with this longsettled system of overtime compensation and the 40hour week would longer necessarily be the benchmark for determining an employees entitlement to overtime pay the preovertime workweek under s 4 he argued could be 50 60 or even 70 hours so long as over two weeks the employee did not work more than 80 hours and if hours in excess of 80 were worked they could be compensated for with comp time or with flexible credit hours silberman acknowledging the stated purpose of these provisions of s 4 affirmed important questions have been raised as to whether in practice in the run of private sector workplaces it is possible to create new and voluntary scheduling options for employees as the bills statement of purposes declares the argument came down to perspective ie how one might view the relative power position of workers and their employers regardless of what the law says will employees and especially the large number of lowwage and contingent workers who are in most need of the laws protections in fact feel free to insist on overtime pay after working 40 hours if their employer makes plain his preference to use biweekly work schedule or to provide comp time for flexible credit hours instead further silberman asked will an employee who has earned comp time or flexible credit hour feel constrained to use the time off when it is convenient for the employer for her to miss work or will the employee actually feel free to use that time when it suits her familys needs and will an employee whose rights are violated feel able to stand up to her employer 182 continued congress daily february 21 1997 cngdailynjdccom 183 statement donna r lenhoff subcommittee on employment and training february 13 1997 crs50 silberman noted that under s 4 and hr 1 an employee might be allowed to receive comp time in place of overtime were that to happen as provided for in the legislation the employee will end up in essentially the same position as if she had been paid for the overtime hours and then took unpaid leave to meet her familys needs that of course he pointed out is lawful today like ms lenhoff of the womens legal defense fund silberman argued that the legislation would not actually provide workers with free choice he said that the entire program was structured to provide choice to the employer nothing in the legislation he affirmed would assure that employees who prefer premium pay are not disfavored by the employer when it comes to awarding overtime assignments and in the absence of such assurance comp time could be the only option he suggested because regular overtime could quickly become unavailable he observed an employer could without violating the law hire only those applicants willing to work overtime without premium pay andor award overtime only to those employees willing to accept an iou for time off in return184 concluding comment allowing for variations among individuals and between historical periods workers have tended to favor legislated labor standards requirements minimum wages overtime pay restraints upon child labor workplace safety etc conversely employers have tended to favor system less restrained by public enactments that division in some measure was reflected in the debate about hr 1 and s 4 labor standards regulation whether by the federal government or by the states speaking generally has not been welcomed by employers some have viewed such regulation as violation of the spirit of the free market others as restraint upon the ability of employers to manage their own businesses however justified in terms of worker protection some have argued that the establishment of high labor standards within the united states may impair industrys ability to compete in global marketplace still others especially from the small business community contend that many employers cannot afford to pay minimum wages and overtime rates and still make profit employee perspectives toward labor standards have varied through the years depending upon the experience of individual workers general economic conditions and distance from the adverse conditions that caused such standards to be legislated some workers are anxious to work overtime hours with overtime pay others for their own reasons would prefer to have more free time away from work even with slight loss of income over the years memories may have dimmed with respect to the conditions under which workers toiled late in the 19th century and through the early decades of the 20th century as the great depression has become part of historical memory as opposed 184 statement of david m silberman subcommittee on employment and training february 13 1997 crs51 to personal memory attitudes have tended to change some point to positive developments in the area of labor standards and labormanagement relations during recent decades and suggest that it is anachronistic for the rules governing the workplace to be rooted in 1930s experience and enactments185 conversely others argue that the basic protections and safeguards provided by new deal era labor laws including the fair labor standards act are the bases of these postdepression workplace improvements and that without them conditions would likely regress changing workforce demographics may have brought new perspectives about work and labormanagement relations they may also have produced new lifestyle realities for workers how they live what they value what they need what is required of them in june 1996 directive to the federal executive departments and agencies president clinton expressed his belief that establishment of family friendly environment including flexible work arrangements results in greater cost efficiency increased worker commitment and productivity and better customer service186 journalist tim shorrock pointed to similar beliefs in recent journal of commerce article many us manufacturing and transportation companies believe the family friendly workplace proposals could boost their productivity and improve the nations competitive position in global trade187 congress will face number of questions as it considers modification

loosely defined and narrowly conceived set of benefits that have become new corporate darling in this age of family values however useful they are to some if these benefits become frozen into simplistic response to very complex problems they will not only miss the mark of enhancing employee effectiveness at work they will miss an even greater opportunity for improving the overall quality

workplace realities have reenforced that need for such regulation workplace hazards remain though their nature may have changed new processes and advanced technology may even have exaggerated the risks there is still competition for work especially among hourlypaid workers most directly affected by the protections afforded by the flsa conversely the workforce itself has changed through the years women are more represented throughout the workforce and professions than may have been the case early in the century while some women always worked outside the home even after marriage and the birth of children that practice is now more the norm to that extent the tensions between domestic life and employment may have escalated as result some have projected need for increased flexibility in hours of work both for women and men for others it may be predictability that is needed meanwhile us businesses especially smaller businesses may feel more competition today than in recent history especially from foreign firms and in the new global marketplace from their vantage point securing relief from some requirements of the flsa holds the possibility if not the promise of higher productivity at lower costs thus an easing of workhours regulation in their view presents winwin situation rationalization of production in manner so that overtime would not be necessary reducing costs and at the same time providing an option for workers more effectively to manage the dual responsibilities of work and family188 while s 4 and hr 1 and related legislation have been presented as worker and family friendly the hearings on this legislation revealed strong worker concerns about proposals to change the 40hour workweek and modify overtime pay requirements large part of this dichotomy relates to choice initiation of the comp timeflexible scheduling options would rest with employers as would the determination as to when banked hours could be used without unreasonably disrupting work processes these essential flexible workhours choices rest with employers as some would argue they must if business is to be run with efficiency and be profitable however those concerned mainly with protection for workers fear that the current proposals provide flexibility for employers but only uncertainty or unpredictability for employees thus they suggest the position of the individual worker may be rendered more difficult diminishing not increasing his or her ability to deal with family concerns while reducing the family income through elimination of overtime pay industryoriented witnesses arguing for more worker flexibility and choice have pointed to the putative inflexibility of the overtime requirements of the flsa workeroriented witnesses conversely have affirmed that existing law provides adequate flexibility but with statutory safeguards against employer abuse flexible scheduling even where now permitted appears to have developed slowly in american workplaces mark wilson of the heritage foundation for example testified it is disturbing that after nearly 20 years since flextime was first introduced in the us 188 ashcroft john time or money vs time and money prescription for worker relief common sense summer 1996 p 115128 crs53 only 153 percent of all private fulltime employees are working on flexible schedules189 as wagehour standards under the flsa are currently structured they are complex and difficult to enforce given the relatively small staff of dols wage and hour division even so the 40hour workweek is by and large relatively straight forward concept and not too difficult to understand some have voiced concern about the affect of the proposed legislation on compliance the more variations there are from rigid norm they suggest the greater the flexibility is likely to be but at the same time such variations may well increase the burden of compliance and enforcement both for department of labor and for employers190 proponents of the alternative work scheduling legislation however suggest that restructured system would create larger problems for enforcement than exist under current law and at the same time the benefits both for employers and for workers may outweigh any added administrative problems 189 statement mark wilson subcommittee on employment and training february 4 1997 see interview with suzanne seiden acting deputy administrator wage and hour division department of labor in daily labor report march 5 1997 p a8a9 190 each variation from standard each element of worker or employer protection will require regulations from the secretary of labor for implementation and enforcement it is not clear how cumbersome these regulations might be in some settings the burden may not be great in others and perhaps especially for small businesses it could be substantial for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97532
