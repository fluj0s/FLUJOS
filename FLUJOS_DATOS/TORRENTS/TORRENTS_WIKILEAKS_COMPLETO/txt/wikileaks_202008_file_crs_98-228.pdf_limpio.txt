for lawmakers to obtain vote in the house they are voice votes division votes yea and nay votes and recorded votes g24g152g146g140g142g561g24g152g157g142g561 this means that lawmakers call out yea or nay when question is first put by the speaker or speaker pro tempore as rule i clause 6 states the speaker will first say those in favor of the question say aye then the speaker will ask those opposed say voice vote can be quick and easy but it is sometimes difficult for the speaker to determinebased on the volume of each responsewhether more lawmakers shout ed aye compared to those who shouted g6g146g159g146g156g146g152g151g561g24g152g157g142g561 rule xx clause 1a states that if the speaker is uncertain about the outcome of voice vote or if member demands division the house shall divide those in favor of the question shall first rise from their seats to be counted and th those who are opposed to the proposition shall stand to be counted this procedure is reasonably accurate and takes only few minutes but it does not provide public record of how each member voted only vote totals 95 for 65 against for instance are announced in this seldomemployed method of voting g27g142g138g561g138g151g141g561g16g138g162g561g24g152g157g142g561 the constitution article i section 5 declares that the yeas and nays of the members on any question shall be obtained at the desire of one fifth of those present under this provision it does not matter if quorum of the house 218 members is not present to conduct business which the constitution requiresbecause any member can say mr speaker on that vote i demand the yeas and nays if the demand is supported by onefifth of those present the speaker will say the yeas and nays are ordered there is also an automatic yea and nay or rollcall vote provided in house rule xx clause 6 for example if it is evident to lawmaker that quorum is not present in the chamber he or she may object to vote on that ground and automatically vote will be ordered by the chair to request an automatic vote member says i object to the vote on the ground that quorum is not present and i make point of order that quorum is not present the actual vote will then simultaneously determine both issues the presence of quorum and the vote on the pending question clause 10 of rule xx also states th at the yeas and nays shall be considered as ordered on final passage of limited number of measures or matters such as concurrent budget resolutions the constitution requires that votes to override presidential vetoes shall be determined by the yeas and nays g20g142g140g152g155g141g142g141g561g24g152g157g142g561 under rule xx clause 1b if any member legate or resident commissioner requests recorded vote and that request is supported by at least onefifth of quorum such vote shall be httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98228g10g152g158g156g142g561g24g152g157g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g497g561g8g152g155

by electronic device employed since 1973unless the computerized voting system malfunctions then standby procedures outlined in rule xx clause 2b are used to conduct the votes to obtain recorded vote member states mr speaker on that i demand recorded vote if at least onefifth of quorum of 218or 44 membersstand and support the request then the recorded vote will be taken by electronic device recall that the distinction between recorded votes and the yeas and nays goes to the number of members required to support each request onefifth of those present for the yeas and nays and onefifth of quorum 44 of 218 for recorded votes g11g151g561g157g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g25g145g152g149g142g561 three methods of voting are available in the committee of the whole voice division and recorded yea and nay votes are not permitted in the committee either the constitutional or automatic forms in short there is only one way to obtain recorded vote in the committee where quorum is 100 membersand it is outlined in rule xviii clause 6e this rule of the house states the chairman shall order recorded vote on request supported by at least 25 members thus any member may say i request recorded vote and if 25 lawmakers the member who made the request can be part of the tally too rise to be counted by the chair the recorded vote will occur by electronic device alternatively lawmaker who plans to request recorded vote even though few members are present in the chamber will usually say mr chairman i request recorded vote and pending that i make point of order that quorum is not present once the chair ascertains that quorum is not present there is an immediate quorum call and the member who requested the recorded vote can ask 24 other colleagues to support his request as they come onto the floor g14g142g151g144g157g145g561g152g143g561g22g146g150g142g561g143g152g155g561g24g152g157g146g151g144g561 under rule xx clause 2a the minimum time for record vote by electronic device is 15 minutes in either the house or the committee of the whole the 15minute period is the minimum rather than the maximum time allowed for the conduct of recorded vote the chair has the discretion to hold the vote open longer new 110 th rule states that votes are not to be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of vote however this rule seems difficult to interpret in practice there are also occasions in the house see rule xx clause 9 when the speaker has the discretion to reduce the voting time to not less than five minutes the speaker also has the authority under rule xx clause 8 to postpone and cluster certain votes v otes in the committee of the whole may also be reduced to five minutes as noted in rule xviii clause 6f
