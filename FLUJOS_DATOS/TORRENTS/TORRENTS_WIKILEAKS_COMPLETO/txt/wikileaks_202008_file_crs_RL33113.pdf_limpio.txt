purposes of va benefits the va re lies substantially upon military department service records the va is bound by informa tion that the service documents contain8 generally speaking the va findings will be in accord with the information contained in the applicants service records9 such records may include an original service department record copy issued by the service department with the certification that it is true document or copy submitted by an accredited agent attorney or service representative with special training who certifies that it is copy of an original service document or copy of copy of such document10 in addition to meeting these criteria the document must contain data regarding the length time and character of the service and the va must believe that the document is genuine and accurate11 if the claimant does not provide the requisite documentation or other evidence or the submitted documentation does not meet th requirements the va must seek to verify service directly from the appropriate military service department12 discharge criteria the statutory definition of veteran requires that the individual has been discharged or released from military service under conditions other than dishonorable13 there are currently five types of discharges issued by the military services 1 honorable discharge hd 2 discharge under honorable conditions uhc or general discharge gd 3 discharge under other than honorable conditions uothc or undesirable disc harge ud 4 ba d conduct discharge bcd and 5 dishonorable discharge dd14 the language of the statute does not pr ecisely match the current categories of the discharges and the va often deter mines on casebycase basis whether the claimants discharge satisfies any of th criteria and which category of discharge applies in most cases the va consider s honorable discharges and discharges under honorable conditions to fall within the c onditions other than dishonorable categoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33113crs4

eligibility test15 usually honorable and general discharges qualify veteran fo r most benefits16 bad conduct discharge from special c ourtmartial and othe r discharges made under other than honorable conditions may or may not disqualify the claimant from being considered veteran for purposes of benefits eligibility17 in the case of such discharge the va will make special ch aracter of service termination based on the particular facts in the claimants case on this basis the va will determine whether the veteran was parated from service under dishonorable conditions or under other than dishonorable conditions the va will review of the entire period of the claimants enlistments to assess the quality of the service and to determine whether it is sufficient to deserve the award of veterans benefits18 if claimant has served more than one period of enlistment he or she may have two or more different discharge categories the va federal benefits guide offers the following on discharges dishonorable and bad conduct discharges issued by general courtsmartial may bar va benefits veterans in prison and parolees may be eligible for certain va benefits va regional offices can clarify the eligibility of prisoners parolees and individuals with multiple discharges issued under differing conditions va benefits will not be provided to any veteran or dependent wanted for an outstanding felony warrant19 certain exceptions permit the award of va benefits even if the character of the discharge would ordinarily bar va benefits for example if it is determined that the claimant was insane at the time of the offense leading up to the discharge the claimant may be granted va be nefits there does not need to be direct connection between the insanity and the misconduct20 the requirement of active service an applicant must have active military na val or air service in order to be considered veteran for va benefits21 however not all types of service are

to scrutinize the claimants service records to determine whether service fits into one of the many categories of active service or whether an exception has been made for hisher service so that it is considered to be active service for the purposes of veterans benef its in addition claimant may have more than one period of service which may further complicate the determination whether the military service was during time of war29 whether or not veteran has served during time of war may impact hisher potential va benefits all military service is classified as either wartime or peacetime service

ease or injury incurred during active service should almost always be able to receive serviceconnected comp ensation for hisher condition or disability42 other significant exceptions to the minimum service requirements include claims for va insurance benefits43 hardship discharges44 and persons retired or separate d from service because of servicerelated disability45 if the former service member

impediments to va benefits willful misconduct if the va determines that an injury or disease resulted from willful misconduct on the part of th claimant such misconduct may serve as bar for any disability benefits regulations define willful misconduct as deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of or wanton or reckless disregard of its probable consequences47 such willful misconduct is an act that involves conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action48 veterans whose health conditions or disabilities resulted from willful misconduct may not receive compensation from either the nonserviceconnected pension plan49 or the serviceconnected disability compensation program50 likewise vocational rehabilitation benefits and certain other benefits will be denied as such benefits are based on rviceconnected condition51 customarily the va reviews all of the circumstances of each claimants case to determine whether there was willful misconduct on the pa rt of the claimant alcohol abuse for the purpose of va benefits alcohol buse has been defined as the use of alcoholic beverages over time or such excessive use at any one time sufficient to cause disability to or death of the user52 alcohol abuse is deemed to be willful misconduct even though the simple drinking of alcoholic beverage is not of itself willful misconduct53 drug abuse the va has defined drug abuse rather broadly for the purposes of va benefits drug abuse has been defined as the use of an illegal drug the use of prescription drug illegally or illicitly obtaine d the use of drug for purpose other than that for which it was medically intende d or the use of drug any substancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33113crs9 54 id 3301d 55 id 56 38 cfr 3301c3 57 38 cfr 3301cl 58 idother than alcohol to enjoy its intoxicating effect54 should the claimants use of drug coincide with any portion of this definition then the claimants use is considered drug abuse any resultant death or disability is then not considered to have occurred in the line of duty55 the va considers it not to be case of willful sconduct however when drug is used for medical purposes or when during the use of drugs for medical purposes addiction or habituation to drugs results from serviceconnected disability56 accordingly if claimant develops medical problem because of the use of prescribed medications used as pr escribed to respond to serviceconnected problem the resultant problem could be c onsidered to be serviceconnected and not willful misconduct venereal disease under certain circumstances the va will consider the effects of venereal disease not to be the result of willful conduct thus disab ilities that result from venereal disease contracted during period of military service may be compensable57 however such compensation may be withheld if it is determined that the venerealdisease predated military service and that the medical problems were result of the progress of the disease 58 step two entitlement to disability benefits disability benefit programs once it has been determined that the claimant is eligible for veterans benefits then it must be determined whether the claimant is entitled to certain benefits again there are two basic disability benefit programs for veterans the disability compensation program nd the pension program the disability compensation program is serviceconnected and the pe nsion program is nonserviceconnected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33113crs10 59 see crs report rl33323 veterans affairs benefits for serviceconnected disabilities by douglas

serviceconnected disability compensation59 the award of serviceconnected disability compensation has several requirements first the fundamental ligibility requirements discussed above service and discharge require ments must be met in addition the veteran must prove three elements 1 medical diagnos is of the current disability 2 medical evidence and in some instances lay ev idence of the inservice occurrence or worsening of an injury or disease and 3 link between the inserviceincident or the worsening of disease or injury and the current disability60 if the va is satisfied that these three elements are proved then the va determines the severity of the disability61 the va assigns percentage evaluation from 0 to 100 for the amount of disability that the va deter mines that the veteran has sustained62 after the va determines the percentage of disability the va sets an effective date for the award of the disability compensation and payments begin to the veteran63 should the va deny disability benefits or should the veteran disagree about the percentage determination the veteran may appeal the decisions through va appeals process requirements for the award of nonserviceconnected pension like the serviceconnected disability compensation the fundamental eligibility requirements of discharge and active wartime service must be met prior to the award of nonserviceconnected pension then several additional cr iteria must be met first the veteran must have limited income64 and the va must ascertain that the veterans net worth does not provide sufficient income to meet hisher needs known as the needs test65 second the veteran must be permanently and totally disabledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33113crs11 66 38 usc 1521a 38 cfr 417 67 see discussion at pp

the va regional office adjudicators they will fi rst determine the basic eligibility of the applicant for pension benefits after this fundamental ligibility is established the adjudicators will look at the claimants in come and net worth if the claimants income or net worth is bar to the pensi on benefits the claim will be denied without determination of the claimed disability if the income or net worth does not seem to serve as bar to pension benefits the pe nsion claim is sent to the rating board for disability determination68 the disability determination is undertaken on case by case basis congress has provided some guidance in this process specifically veteran is considered permanently and totally disabled if the veteran is in any of the following circumstances 1 nursing hom patient for long term care because of disability 2 disabled as determined by the commissione r of social security for the payment of social security benefits 3 unemployable because of disability which is reasonably certain to continue through the claimants life or 4 suffering from disability adequate to render it impossible for the av erage person to be gainfully employed if the disability is expected to continue for the life of the person or b disease or disorder determined by the secretary of veterans affairs to per result in permanent and total disability69 veterans who are aged 65 or older and apply for pension are presumed to be permanently and totally disabled for pension purposes hence disability determination is not required for veteran aged 65 or older to be granted pension entitlement70 after the disability status is determined71 pension benefits are paid to the claimant on monthly basis
