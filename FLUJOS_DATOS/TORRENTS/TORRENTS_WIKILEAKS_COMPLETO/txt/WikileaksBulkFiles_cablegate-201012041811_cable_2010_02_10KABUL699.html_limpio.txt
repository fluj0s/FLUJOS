1 s summary ambassador eikenberry and deputy ambassador ricciardone demarched president karzai and his inner circle on the problems of the final version of the electoral decree february 2425 stressing the need for an independent electoral complaints commission with international commissioners protection of the vetting process and change in independent electoral commission iec leadership they cautioned that successful us visit hangs in the balance end summary to the advisors protect democracy and the relationship 2 s on february 24 deputy ambassador ricciardone separately called on presidential chief of staff omer daudzai education minister recently named as the peace jirga coordinator farouk wardak and agriculture minister rahimi ricciardone made the following points with each the election issue is potential spoiler to successful us trip and fixing it should be an urgent priority worse it threatens to turn 2010 back into 2009 derailing the strategic course agreed on and established from karzais inauguration through the london conference for elections to be credible the ecc and iec cannot be seen to be in the pocket of the president what matters now is how karzai acts on the iec ecc and candidate vetting process he left nonpaper 15 with daudzai and wardak who promised to raise this issue the afghan way 3 s daudzai made excuses for having missed the import of the decree which we had raised with him prospectively on february 8 he said it had been discussed in the cabinet but gotten changed before its final presentation he had spoken to karzaisupporting parliamentarians who were concerned about it and had told them to make their concerns public so the president understands ricciardone noted parliament is confused over its right to review the decree and this adds to our concerns about undue expansion of the presidents powers daudzai said he would add further palace signals to parliamentary leadership that they are empowered to review the decree ricciardone reiterated that this issue could undermine the prospective karzai trip to the us by compelling karzai to explain and defend his actions at every turn rather than focusing on the strategic opportunities and challenges ahead of us in 2010 karzai must act in the next week or so on the items cited above in order to remove us and afghan concerns over the meaning of the decree daudzai alluded elliptically to his dinner meeting the previous evening with minister of interior atmar and other supporters of the president who shared serious concerns about karzais actions 4 s minister of education wardak agreed that the decree gives karzais critics the evidence they want that he is not committed to democracy and that it posed serious problem in karzais standing abroad as well as at home ricciardone noted that afghan democracy would look different from other versions but that the foundation has to be based on credible institutions he reiterated the need for changes at the iec genuinely independent ecc and vetting process which can ensure unreconstructed taliban are eligible for office wardak agreed with these points and claimed that our inseparable partnership would be greatly served by good us visit he promised to go directly to the president and to press karzai to withdraw the decree in its entirety and improve it before it is resubmitted frankly wardak said this behavior was comparable to the powergrabs of the mujahedin in 19911992 and he and zakhilwal had already protested against it 5 s on february 25 ambassador eikenberry called on minister of finance omer zakhilwal who told him that he could almost guarantee that he could persuade karzai to act as we had urged regarding the ecc candidate vetting and ludins replacement he affirmed that the ambassador was pursuing this agenda in the best way by approaching karzai clearly but respectfully and then allowing his inner circle of ministers to prod him in the right direction zakhilwal noted that he was then meeting with parliamentarians on the issue of the presidential decree and that he was building support and case for the points that eikenberry had raised 6 s apparently echoing daudzai zakhilwal went on to speak kabul 00000699 002 of 004 candidly about karzai saying that he was an extremely weak man who did not listen to facts but was instead easily swayed by anyone who came to him to report even the most bizarre stories of plots against him whenever this happened karzai would immediately judge the person to be loyal and would reward him he warned against former fm spanta pursuing his narrow selfinterest at the expense of national ones but in general affirmed to eikenberry that the inner circle now including daudzai had decided they must collaborate to influence karzai when they see him going astray on such matters they reportedly pledged that if karzai took umbrage at them raising such sensitive issues they would defend each other message to karzai dont put success on the line 7 s meeting with karzai national security advisor spanta and deputy nsa spinzada february 25 ambassador eikenberry asked karzai what he wanted his trip to be about and how he wanted it to be perceived in the united states he said he hoped it has become obvious to karzai that the us wants karzai and afghanistan to be strong eikenberry noted that the success of the visit would require that americans to gain confidence that we have reliable partner who is leading afghanistan forward 8 s eikenberry went on to explain that democracybuilding in afghanistan could be among karzais strongest legacies to the future and what he will be remembered for and democracy promotion is in americas dna and how we judge institutional strength in any country reminding karzai of the political risks our own president took on december 1 when he announced his strategy of deepened engagement in afghanistan in the face of very real domestic opposition eikenberry pointed out that karzai has always reminded us of afghanistans domestic politics now it is his turn to be aware of american domestic politics 9 s at this point before the planned oneonone session karzai said he wanted spanta to remain present however spanta demurred apparently sensing difficult message would follow alone with karzai the ambassador told karzai that we want his visit to be about longterm strategic and political issues including karzais political vision and reintegrationreconciliation it should lead us towards stronger afghanistan and stronger karzai eikenberry said that the sooner karzai addresses pressing issues like electoral reform the sooner he can remove distractions from his agenda in washington if he did nothing before his departure to allay our concerns about his decree and intent on electoral reform he wouldnt be able to talk about reintegration and reconciliation with congress with the media or with anyone in washington karzai said he wanted to speak in washington about civilian casualties but then added the longterm strategic partnership as well 10 s karzai appeared more attentive and eikenberry went into greater detail he said that the election is very important for us and that if americans and our allies believe that karzai is weakening in the building of democratic legitimacy in afghanistan our support inevitably will weaken he urged karzai to make and announce well before departing for washington the needed changes regarding the chair of the iec placing internationals on the ecc and retaining internationals from unama and isaf as observers on the candidate vetting board diag he asked karzai if he had anyone else in mind for the iec chair karzai said he did not and that he couldnt make quick decision about it eikenberry suggested that he could easily make an announcement prior to his visit to washington about having accepted ludins resignation and having begun talent search for ludins replacement karzai agreed that that was something he could do and said he would meet with ludin on february 27 11 s eikenberry continued that karzai could also announce before his trip that he would be appointing two internationals to the ecc to which karzai apparently confused about the law said he could not make this announcement now he could only form the ecc three months before the election date the ambassador told karzai he was mistaken on this point according to the new presidential decree the ecc must be established later than three months before the election date there is injunction against establishing it earlier than that karzai alleged that the ecc had tried to steal the election and had not performed well in the provincial council audits eikenberry replied that while the ecc had not performed perfectly looking to the future with some highquality international commissioners such as justice kriegler was very important kabul 00000699 003 of 004 he added that the iec had performed poorly point karzai agreed with 12 s he then asked karzai to keep unama and isaf on the candidate vetting commission as observers he pointed out that there are lot of very bad actors who want political power and that it was always good to have impartial internationals available to be the ones drawing the line against those people karzai challenged the ambassador on the grounds that the usg pays the contracts of some of these bad actors to which the ambassador responded that while that was fair point it didnt mean karzai shouldnt keep unama on the candidate vetting commission 13 s the ambassador then pointed out to karzai that the appointment of independent internationals on these electoral bodies could be helpful to karzai politically if karzai appointed every official involved he would be the one blamed entirely for an election which will certainly be flawed eikenberry noted again that this was karzais legacy and would be judged by future generations and then asked karzai if he was really completely positive that afghanistan and its institutions are strong enough to not need any foreigners playing any roles karzai ended the meeting by saying that ludin had told him he wanted to step down eikenberry replied that that was good and once more pressed karzai to ensure the ecc commissioners are independent reminding him that karzai had separately told srsg eide and eikenberry several weeks prior unambiguously that he would retain two foreigners on the ecc in accordance with formula developed by eide 14 s comment we will continue our engagement over the next several days with key karzai ministers supportive of pragmatic electoral reform as well as with interested parliamentarians as noted above minister zakhilwal told ambassador eikenberry he would rally likeminded ministers and attempt to reach favorable outcome by monday the electoral reform issue provides good test of the future potential and limits of karzai as partner us interests the imperatives of afghanstatebuilding and afghanistans longterm developmental interests will occasionally require karzai to make difficult choices this is such an instance also to be validated is his coterie of reformminded ministers ability to adroitly manage karzai behind closed doors as occurred during his decision to accept second round in last falls election strong empowered group of such ministers will be crucial to usafghan success in the months ahead 15 u begin nonpaper text electoral reform president karzai made firm commitment at the london conference to put in place meaningful electoral reforms which reflect lessons learned from 2009 and to ensure measures are in place to tackle the electoral abuses witnessed last year strengthening the independence of the independent elections commission iec and the electoral complaints commission ecc is vital to ensuring that these institutions are impartial and effective the following three key measures are essential to ensuring the credibility of the parliamentary electoral process and the success of the future parliament an institution integral to strengthening afghanistans democracy they are also measures that will enable the international community to convince their governments to help fund and otherwise support these and future elections replacing the iec chair with an independent and qualified official maintaining the integrity of the ecc through combination of independent afghans and international experts establishing strong candidate vetting process that involves the participation of both afghans and the international community the following key reforms would represent important steps towards constructive electoral reform that draw on the lessons learned in 2009 iec staff committing or complicit in electoral offenses are dismissed iec sessions are opened to accredited observers iecrecommended fraud deterrence plans are implemented comprehensive ministry of interior and iecendorsed security plan is established 6090 days before the election

candidates and voters domestic observers and political party agents are supported and their participation in election day activities is facilitated end nonpaper text ricciardone
