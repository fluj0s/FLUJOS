27 prospects c10 references 29 c3 community added value and contribution to eu policies the eu has deserved reputation for the proactive role it has played in addressing the issue of climate change in the global arena this was demonstrated by its early commitment to stabilise co2 emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 made at the 1992 rio janeiro conference subsequently the eu has advocated early action by all developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and in april 1998 it was signatory to the kyoto protocol and as result has agreed an 8 reduction target by 2010 for each member state successful and timely implementation of this policy will depend on the extent to which national policy makers are motivated to carry through the legislation or tax policies that will have practical impact on nonrenewable energy usage this in turn is critically dependent on public perceptions of i the reality and unprecedented nature of any recent and future climate change ii the confidence with which it is attributable to anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases and iii the perceived reliability of future climate scenarios generated by climate models the policy of the eu and its member states towards future protocols and perhaps greater emissions reductions will also be influenced by the evolving state of the science that underlies our ability to attribute climate change to anthropogenic causes and our ability to predict future climate there is growing scientific consensus that current levels of global mean temperature are unusually high in the context of the instrumental record and limited comparisons with palaeoclimate data in the last millennia however the need to understand and account for the influence of natural climate variability and to distinguish the individual role of natural and anthropogenic climate forcings is still widely acknowledged our only viable prospect of accurately predicting future climate change and its accompanying variability derives from the development of realistic general circulation models gcms of the climate system however gcm based climate simulations have until now had to assume that the range of natural variability generated by internal model processes is reasonable representation of the real world and that additional uncertainty need be assumed to account for the influence of different natural forcings on the range of future climate change our work under the proposed programme will provide tangible basis for assessing the extent to which key climate models developed within europe and that are internationally recognised as providing the most authoritative predictions of likely rates and patterns of future warming simulate the extent of underlying natural climate variability this is not theoretical or esoteric academic issue article 2 of the framework convention on climate change aims for stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system however policy makers seek reliable guidance on the likely course of climate change and are heavily dependent on the efforts of modelling groups including those who are partners in this proposal to provide this article 1 of the convention when defining climate change states that this must include natural climate variability observable over comparable time periods given that this refers to 10100 year timescales it is clear that this issue cannot be addressed without the use of proxy climate data only by combining the scientific resources and expertise of the various partners in soap will the project be able to achieve its overall aim to assess the true extent to which two important european climate models are capable of reproducing the natural variability of climate that underlies any anthropogenic changes keith is this overall aim slightly aligned with the new october call researchers in disciplines such as modern and historical climatology and different palaeodisciplines such as dendrochronology and sea level studies have tended to work separately similarly until very recently there has been insufficient cross disciplinary contact between the general palaeoclimate and modelling communities this proposal is motivated by the opportunity for the palaeoclimatologists to meet the needs of the modelling community to reconstruct natural variability on time and space scales that cannot be achieved using instrumental data alone this proposal will provide mechanism by which the different palaeoclimate institutes can compare statistical techniques of data processing and climate calibration and undertake systematic integration of the various interpreted palaeodata into form suitable for their own investigation of the role of natural climate forcing agents but also crucially for use by the modelling groups the collaboration of these internationallyrenowned modelling groups with clear mutual focus on testing the realism of nonanthropogenically forced variability using the same climate forcing conditions of itself represents new and exciting prospect for advancing eu expertise in gcm diagnostics intercomparison of results from two leading coupled gcms will provide an estimate of how sensitive the conclusions are to individual model uncertainties this is clearly major advantage of combining these efforts and will provide more authoritative results than if single model were used it should be stressed also that the modelling groups involved in this project and the results of these particular models are those used by government departments in the uk department of environment transport and the regions and germany german federal environment ministry to inform decisionmaking on energy and environmental policy hence the outcome of this work will directly influence the environmental policy of these countries but will also be internationally scrutinised elsewhere in and beyond the eu the scientific interchanges that will be facilitated within co ordinated program involving diverse groups of ecologists keith do we have any of these climate historians dendrochronologists climatologists and climate modellers will bring mutual benefits within the climate observation and modelling communities and also for the wider multidisciplinary scientific community of the european union the close collaboration between the palaeoclimatologists and the climate modellers in one sense the suppliers and the users respectively will help to focus the research and its deliverables towards the policyrelevant needs of the endusers finally we stress the international significance of the science we are proposing as evidence by its relevance to the stated objectives of the igbp past global changes programme pages and the wcrp climate variability and predictability program clivar both of these have benefited from eu support for range of initiatives particularly for the pagesclivar intersection initiative and both stress the crucial nature of elucidating the character of highlyresolved climate changes in recent millennia and for integrating the efforts of the palaeoclimate and modelling communities specifically to address the issue of modelled climate uncertainties that arise because of the natural variability of climate on decadal to century timescales c4 contribution to community social objectives changes in climate state towards warmer or colder or wetter or drier can have fundamental implications for the functioning of society especially when the shifts are large or abrupt many aspects of modern society are also particularly affected by changes in the frequency of extreme weather events that might accompany these climate changes the profitability or even viability of range of economic and industrial activities such as agriculture forestry tourism the health of sections of the population particularly the old or underprivileged the general condition of our environment as reflected in peoples comfort levels the diversity of wildlife and the quality of our surroundings are all vulnerable to climate changes studies of the mechanisms of climate variability and change such as we propose here at first do not seem to bear directly on the quality of life or enhance the environment but they certainly contribute in an indirect but meaningful way to our knowledge of the possible societal pressures and risks that may accompany climate variations our intention is that this project should represent useful progress in our understanding of the past occurrence of climate fluctuations and the statistical probabilities of extreme climate events in multicentury timeframe both as they occurred over large parts of the northern hemisphere and also in the extent to which such changes are reliably simulated in the same models that are used to predict future changes the confidence one can place in the ability of these mathematical tools to indicate the course and rapidity of climate changes in the decades to come underpins their use as basis for deciding mitigation adaptation and environmental management policies limited resources mean that difficult decisions need to be made regarding the allocation of funds at eu national and local government levels money spent on building reservoirs flood protection schemes or in attempts to protect coastlines of necessity divert funds from other possible projects such as the improvement of medical and educational facilities or the transport infrastructure in the private sector many areas of agriculture such as forestry viticulture and fruit production require longterm planning and development and require significant forward investment the extent to which such enterprises will be seen as reasonable risks and the subsequent success that they achieve have direct influence on local employment and hence quality of life defining and understanding the history of past climate variability where this can be done with sufficient resolution and good dating control provides reference base for rigorous studies of the changing statistical distributions and probabilities associated with climate changes in the period from before industrialisation to present these provide the context for comparative studies of recent instrumental variability and the essential test bed for validation of the climate prediction models the verified and quantified output from such models then provide for the probabilistic scenarios of future climate shifts upon which planners and policy makers must base their decisions in this context we feel that our work can make valuable contribution to community social objectives we also note that all of our sampling techniques are nondestructive damage is inflicted on the natural environment and our methods are non polluting except for running supercomputers keith do we still need this sentence even though were not doing fieldwork c5 project management the climatic research unit cru at the university of east anglia uea will have overall responsibility for the scientific and administrative coordination of the project the responsible person dr keith briffa has successfully coordinated two previous eufunded scientific projects he will be supported by scientific and administrative personnel at uea see below for details of additional administrative costs sought uea will ensure that soap is managed effectively and efficiently so that the project objectives can be met and represent the project at eu meetings for the smooth running of the science and decision making the project has been divided into five workpackages the primary linkages between the workpackages have deliberately been kept straightforward and are outlined in section b6c within each workpackage individual participants will be responsible for undertaking their designated tasks and producing their deliverables thus all participants will have some role in the successful management of the project the workpackage leaders will monitor progress via the deliverables and the specified milestones and report regularly to the coordinator who will be proactive in ensuring that scheduled tasks are completed on time the coordinator will be supported in the management of the project by the designated leaders of the projects workpackages who together will form the steering group for the project the main roles of this group will be to ensure that the flow of expertise and data between the workpackages takes place to ensure that the workpackage objectives are met and to ensure that efficient dissemination of data results and products takes place both within the project and to the wider scientific and user community during the 3year project costs for additional administrative support have been included in the coordinators budget with 2 personmonths allocated to the development and continual updating of project web site and 4 personmonths allocated to the organisation of project meetings the collation and production of interim and final reports facilitating the electronic exchange of information data and expertise between the project participants and to aid in the monitoring of the timely completion of milestones and deliverables as much of the project management as possible will be undertaken electronically through the use of email and mailing lists and especially via the projects dedicated web site the web site will be used for the exchange of data between the participants and the workpackages and for the dissemination of data and products to the wider scientific and user community as they are progressively released for the organisation of the project meetings agendas travel arrangements etc and for the exchange of progressexpertise between the participants by housing interim and final reports and drafts of scientific manuscripts although much of the project management will be achieved electronically the diverse nature of the participants fields of expertise makes number of project meetings necessary timings of the meetings are laid out in section b6b we will have three meetings of all the project participants together full project meetings 1 the first will be planning meeting attendance will be compulsory for all participants it will be held at the beginning of the project to finalise the finer details of the workpackages particularly with respect to confirming the suitability of the variables and regions that the project will focus on defining optimum formats for communication of data and introducing the particular idiosyncrasies of the palaeo and simulated data this meeting will initiate the maximum efficient collaboration and communication between the project participants 2 the second main meeting will be held at month 18 of the project this is critical time because the assembly calibration and analysis of the palaeodata and the integration of the climate model experiments will be nearing completion data exchange will have begun and any problems that have arisen will be addressed delivery dates of various data sets and reports will be confirmed expertise in the particular characteristics of the data sets can be exchanged 3 reporting meeting will be held few months before the end of the project also involving all participants this will facilitate any action needed to ensure the projects objectives are met to prepare for the final project report to aid in the preparation of joint scientific papers and to obtain all the scientists input into the final synthesis of palaeo and model estimates of natural climatic variability in addition three special interest groups will be formed to assist progress towards achieving the projects objectives in the areas of i climate reconstruction from palaeoclimate and documentary data ii combined analysis of palaeo and model data sets and iii simulated and reconstructed sea level variations these special interest groups will meet not only at the times of the full project meetings but also on three other occasions during the course of the project the coordinator and the workpackage leaders will make the administrative and scientific arrangements for the meetings the venues of the meetings will be varied to maximise the participation and expert input external experts will be invited as appropriate the meetings will be arranged to minimise the cost of international travel while maximising the exchange of data and ideas the three full meetings will most likely be held at three of the workpackage leaders institutions while the special interest group meetings will be held at suitable location to minimise costs for their individual members quality control of the projects data sets reports and products will be achieved in variety of ways with the objective of ensuring they remain useful after the end of the project statistical assessments of the quality of the palaeodata will be obtained during the course of the work crosscomparison of dated records eg local and regional treering chronologies where necessary at different time scales will give quantitative assessment of the quality of the new regionallyamalgamated climate estimates the climate proxy data will be further tested by the quantitative identification of the expected climate signals in the palaeorecords this represents an additional quality control procedure for the methodologies of reconstructing climate as we will also follow the standard statistical approach of verifying our reconstructions using independent climate data witheld from the statistical calibration the climate model simulations will be monitored during the integrations to ensure that any errors or problems are identified at the earliest possible time then corrected to allow the integrations to continue the use of two different climate models to perform the same experiments will allow an assessment of the uncertainty in the climate variability estimates which is in itself form quality control the scientific research completed during the project will be presented as peerreviewed journal papers and at scientific conferences both of which will provide an opportunity for the external assessment of the scientific quality of the work undertaken for soap software for proxysimulation comparison will be documented reviewed and extensively tested prior to widespread use this software will be made available from the project web site c6 description of the consortium the consortium has been assembled in order to integrate the expertise and data available in the fields of coupled modelling of climate variability instrumental climate data analysis palaeoclimatology with emphasis on sea level history and dendrochronology historical climatology and multi variate statistical techniques the participants their numbers and the acronyms that we use for them are detailed in the table below the coordinating institution climatic research unit at uea and its key personnel dr keith briffa and dr tim osborn combine extensive experience in the processing statistical analysis and climatic interpretation of treerings with expertise in studying climate variability in range of proxies in instrumental data and in climate model output dr briffa has previously coordinated two projects funded under the eu fourth framework programme whose focus was more tightly constrained to the development and climate interpretation of networks of living and subfossil treering chronologies uea will lead the project coordination and management workpackage 1 coordination and dissemination with contributions from all project participants to successfully undertake the multicentury simulations of natural and anthropogenicallyforced climate variations we have brought together the two european climate modelling centres with the most experience at simulating climate with coupled oceanatmosphere general circulation models the hadley centre at the uk met office will lead the climate simulation workpackage wp2 model simulations of the climate of the last 500 years dr simon tett and the hadley centre have performed and analysed multicentury model integrations with particular interest in natural climate variability comparison with palaeoclimate data and the use of natural variability estimates in climate change signal detection and attribution exercises the hadcm3 model used by this partner is stable for multicentury simulations simulates current climate well and does not require the use of flux adjustments contributions to wp2 in the form of further model simulations and analyses will be provided by two climate modelling centres based in germany modelling and data group mad associated with the maxplanckinstitut fuer meteorologie and the institute for coastal research at gkss who also have extensive experience in the fields of natural climate variability climate change detection and statistical methods for palaeoclimate modellingreconstruction hence gkss will also contribute to workpackage 3 mad dr ulrich cubasch and gkss professor hans von storch will run and analyse simulations from the echam4hope coupled climate model professor tom crowley and dr gabi hegerl texas am university have agreed to collaborate with us in defining suitable histories of natural forcing and will provide us with their latest estimates uea will lead workpackage 3 amalgamation and calibration of 500years of highresolution climate data working closely with the institute of geography at bern ubern and the institute of mediterranean ecology and palaeoecology in marseille udesam professor heinz wanner ubern is world authority on the interpretation of documentary climate information and his institute has access to the most famous archive of such data in the world the euroclimhist database held by the institute of history at ubern dr jürg luterbacher ubern has considerable expertise in the analysis of long instrumental climate records for europe and has produced the most reliable reconstruction of the north atlantic oscillation variability currently available dr joel guiot udesam has an international reputation for statistical techniques for processing and calibrating palaeodata in terms of climate variability the highresolution palaeo and documentary data already available to these soap partners will be augmented by ongoing dendrochronological research in various parts of the northern hemisphere that will run in parallel with our project existing and new temperaturesensitive data will be obtained for northern eurasia through our close ties with laboratories in sweden hakan grudd finland matti eronen russia stepan shiyatov and eugene vaganov and for alaska northern canada mongolia and tibet gordon jacoby ed cook and rosanne darrigo lamont doherty treering laboratory palisades new york north central canada and the kola peninsula glen mcdonald ucla california northwestern canada serge payette university laval quebec the western united states malcolm hughes and others treering laboratory university of arizona and the canadian rockies brian luckman university of western ontario collaborators will also provide us with new moisturesensitive treering databases eg the newly extended drought reconstructions for the us developed by ed cook and the naosensitive moroccan data being developed by chuck stockton and mary glueck university of arizona other data will be extracted from international treering data bank part of the ngdc at boulder colorado the major contributions of soap to the scientific and enduser communities will rely upon the synthesis and intercomparison of the palaeoclimate reconstructions with the climate model simulations this workpackage wp4 synthesis and interpretation of observedreconstructed and simulated climates will be led by mad though with very close involvement with uea the met office and gkss these institutes will develop appropriate statistical and signal detection methodologies to be applied to the comparisonsynthesis of the data ubern and udesam will also contribute to this workpackage though at reduced level guiding the comparisons with their evaluation of the uncertainties associated with the palaeoclimate reconstructions and providing interpretation of results all participants will therefore make vital contributions towards achieving the objectives of this workpackage these participants were not simply selected for their ability to generate the necessary palaeo and model data but also because of their expertise in the interpretation of the data and in the statistical approaches to data analysis necessary to meet the project objectives mike mann university of virginia us has agreed to provide us with his climatic reconstructions for use in the project and to collaborate on the comparisonimprovement of statistical techniques for reconstructing past climate the hadcm3 and echam4hope coupled climate models can be used also to produce state of the art simulations of regionally differentiated sealevel histories for the past 5001000 yrs in the course of the 1990s methodology to reconstruct shortterm 50150 yr smallamplitude dm sea level variations during the past several millennia was successfully tested and applied this significant and timely refinement in sealevel research methodology initiated by dr orson van plassche vua and developed in close collaboration with researchers in the usa thomas and jc varekamp wesleyan university is currently being applied by research groups in the netherlands united kingdom canada and the usa results of these activities will become available over the next 1 to 4 years thus creating the first modest but important database of highresolution sea level records for the north atlantic region that together with available long instrumental tidegauge sealevel records can be compared with modelcomputed sealevel change patterns over the past 5001000 years dr van plassche vua will therefore take the lead on the sea level workpackage wp5 collating these newly available sea level records for subsequent comparison with the simulated sea level

environmental systems and analysis group working within the institute for coastal research renamed in january 2001 from the institute of hydrophysics of the gkss research centre has substantial experience in the design and analysis of climate simulations with global climate models this group originally joined the gkss research centre from the maxplanck institute for meteorology where they participated in the eu project millenia in this project 1000year simulation under fixed external forcing with an early version of the echam climate model was conducted and analysed in terms of the decadal and centennial scale natural climate variability the group shows also recognised expertise in the design of statistical downscaling models for the estimation of regional climate change based on the output of climate model simulations currently the group is part of the project funded by the helmholz society climate variations in historical times in which approximately 50 scientists working in five hgf research centres participate the rationale of this project is to investigate the climate of the last 10000 years with the task of the group to provide multiproxy reconstructions of atmospheric circulation for the last millenium and to assimilate these into the echam climate model the natural forcings run of echam to be used in soap is undertaken as part of this project other areas of expertise within the institute for coastal research include physical and biogeochemical processes in coastal seas estuaries and rivers their interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer the interaction on spatial scales in climate impact and other applications and the sensitivity of coastal oceans estuaries and rivers to natural and anthropogenic disturbances numerical dynamical models of the coastal seas of the regional atmosphere of transport of matter or morphodynamics are available these have either been developed at the institute or imported from other institutions these models have been used in many process studies eg aspen they serve as dynamical reference in the interpretation data assimilation of observational data eurorose pioneer and envoc projects past developments have been reconstructed for instance anthropogenic lead palaeoclimatic conditions and scenarios of future developments derived climate change another field of expertise is the retrieval

costs these are given for the cost of employing contract research staff and exclude the time spent on the project by permanent staff at each institution the costs of which are not included in the budget the personnel months and cost per month have been estimated to provide sufficient time for staff at the appropriate level to achieve the deliverables of each workpackage durable equipment all partners will make heavy use of computer equipment during this project which requires storage and processing of very large quantities of observed and simulated data some institutions will provide computer equipment without charge depending upon existing equipment availability and individual departmental resources others do not have sufficient existing equipment to ensure success of the project and have individual budgetary items listed for the purchase of new computers gkss workstation required for data analysis and visualisation wp2 and wp4 udesam linux workstation required for statistical

external to the project is also budgeted for wp5 computing some computer costs directly related to soap will be borne by institutional budgetsresources some specific items have however been included in the soap budget and these are justified here uea this partner does not provide individual pcs for contract research staff and only limited data storage and processing facilities are available on the university multiuser workstations thus the climatic research unit cru has introduced standard rates for the rental of departmental computing facilities on all research contracts for access to the crudedicated unix multiuser workstations and associated file storage on which the soap data bases of reconstructed and simulated climate data will be held and the use of an individual pc dedicated to the contract researchers employed to work on the soap project the rental is 315 euros per personnel month forty five months rental including six for coordination of computing facilities are therefore budgeted at this standard rate an additional cost to cover the maintenance contract for our idl software license providing updates and technical support is also included the met office using its climate model hadcm3 this partner will simulate the last 500 years using natural forcings alone and for the last 250 years an extra simulation in which both natural and anthropogenic forcings will be applied the t3e supercomputer at the met office will be used for this purpose with data being stored in the met officess data archive these simulations are essential for the success of the project and the total simulation time of 750 years requires great deal of supercomputer time which has been included within the budget for 95238 euros wp2 mad 250year climate simulation under natural and anthropogenic forcings with the echam4hope climate model will be performed by the hamburg model and data group to complement the 1000year simulation already being undertaken by partner 3 gkss with german national funding computing costs for this 250year simulation are not being requested from the european community but will instead be covered by german national funding sources vua small amount 2000 euros has been included in the budget to cover the costs of acquiring the statistical and visualisation software necessary to reassess analytical data and to undertake to intercomparison of reconstructed and simulated sea levels c9 economic development scientifictechnological prospects the participants in soap are notforprofit institutions based in the tertiary level education and scientific research sectors our principal goal is to undertake research that leads to new scientific results and increased understanding of the climate system the project will provide numerous deliverables that translate directly into opportunities for future exploitation particularly in the form of subsequent scientific research it is the intention of the proposers to exploit this potential in their own future work and also to ensure efficient dissemination of the primary data and model outputs which themselves will enable large body of value added research to be undertaken special attention will be paid to the organisation and dissemination of the numerous results palaeoclimate and model data that will be generated by this project details are itemised below one important dissemination route will be through dedicated soap project web site that will be developed at uea to facilitate internal communication during the project and dissemination after the project is complete this site will represent the ongoing point of contact for the wider science community and the public background details and the work plan will be described there and regular updates of progress results and drafts of papers will be posted many of the products of the project eg maps or timeseries of climate reconstruction will also be directly downloadable from this site at the end of the project this web site will be maintained using ueas own resources to allow continued dissemination of the projects principal results to the public and dissemination to the scientific community of the climate reconstructions and the output from the new model simulations the project will train and improve the skills of the research staff involved climate modellers will have better appreciation of climate proxy data how to apply it what it is useful for and what its disadvantages and limitations are the palaeoclimate community will have better understanding of the needs of the modelling community and the issues that they seek to resolve researchers will be trained providing them with the skills needed to use and understand models and to use and interpret proxy data thus the skillsbase of the scientific community will be further developed to produce the scientists that are needed to undertake future research at the interface of the modelling and palaeoclimate disciplines productoutput improved palaeoclimate reconstructions users and scientific prospects palaeoclimate researchers scientists studying and testing models and processes of subcomponents of the climate system and variety of climate change impacts researchers the improved palaeoclimate reconstructions generated within the project will spawn numerous possibilities for additional research in palaeoclimatology and wider ecosystem studies these data will represent an important resource for future studies of climate processes using different methodologies than those used here the combination of absolute dating wide geographic coverage annual resolution and in particular the wide range of timescales represented by these data from seasonal to multicentury all combine to provide valuable basis for comparison with other frequently less resolved and probably not formally calibrated records derived from terrestrial lacustrine and even marine locations indeed comparisons of our annualtimescale proxy data with long instrumental records and lower resolution palaeo records could aid the development of process models aimed at elucidating the lag responses to climate forcing inherent in many proxy records eg associated with glacier movements or lake level changes dissemination strategy our homogeneously formatted amalgamated palaeoclimate data sets and reconstructions will be deposited in the world data center for palaeoclimatology housed at the national geophysical data centre boulder colorado dissemination of data will also take place via the soap website publication of our research in the peerreviewed scientific literature and at scientific conferences will be used to advertise the availability of these data sets productoutput simulated climate over the past 500 years users and scientific prospects palaeoclimate researchers scientists studying and testing models and processes of subcomponents of the climate system and variety of climate change impacts researchers there is wide range of potential research applications for the model output that will be produced models of many natural and societal systems are being developed to study the impact of climate variability and change and soap will be able to provide simulated climate data to drive these models over the past 500 years allowing longterm view to be taken for testing these models as well as for assessing the role of climate variability on past changes within each of these sectors examples of these applications include models of various plant or animal communities and

gateways dkrz in hamburg for mad and gkss and the climate impacts link project at uea for the met office dissemination of data will also take place via the soap website publication of our research in the peerreviewed scientific literature and at scientific conferences will be used to advertise the availability of these data sets productoutput improved knowledge of natural climate variability assessments of climate model reliability at decade to century time scales and betterdefined uncertainty on climate predictions made from these models users and scientific prospects 1 palaeoclimate researchers scientists studying and testing models and processes of subcomponents of the climate system and variety of climate change impacts researchers 2 governments and policymakers soap will deliver concrete quantitative estimates of the individual contributions to climate variability generated at different temporal and spatial scales by natural and anthropogenic forcings within two different coupled models these will contribute to betterdefined uncertainty on the climate predictions from these models these results are sure to engender wide scientific and public interest and may either dilute or reinforce the message about the causes of recent climate changes and likely future trends the modelling groups involved are intimately linked with important interest groups to the extent that much of their work is funded and directed by member state government bodies that seek to use their research as basis for devising wider environmental policy the outcome of our project will be used to identify model shortcomings and lead directly to work aimed at improving them 3 industryeconomic stakeholders improved knowledge about natural climate variability will be useful to other users of information on climate variability such as the energy reinsurance and agricultural sectors in particular the increasing homogeneity of european agriculture makes the sector as whole more sensitive to climate variations than in the past improved knowledge about climate variability and of the veracity with which climate models simulate it is also required for the assessment of potential predictability on interannual to decadal timescales especially since it is the same models that are often used to identify such predictability dissemination strategy dissemination to the policy community will be through contributions to consensus reports such as the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and via the input that individual partners contribute to their national policy makers and government departments we have budgeted for one brochure to be published during the project to advertise the project its main findings the implications
