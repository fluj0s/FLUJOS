the location of the wrongfully retained child to prevent further harm to the child and to ensure the prompt return of the child signatory nations do not have to automatically return the child to his or her place of habitual residence discretionary exceptions exist that enable the child to remain with the removing parent for exam ple article 4 of the convention establishes that if the child is over sixteen at the time of the original taking or retention or becomes sixteen at any time after the taking the conve ntion does not apply also if the custody rights involved are those of vi sitation access as they are rmed in the convention the central authority may facilitate and secure those rights but under article 21 violation of visitation rights does not trigger procedures for the childs return other requests for returns may be affected by discretionary factors it is within the judges discretionary power under article 12 to refuse return of the child if the child has become settled in the new environment and more than one year has passed from the date of the taking or detention if more than one year has passed and the reason for the delay was concealment of the childs location th petition may still be considered under the argument that the oneyear limit should be to lled due to the abduc ting parents conduct as equity demands one pr ofit from their own wrongdoing discretion is also afforded under article 13 if the child is deemed mature enough to voice preference for staying or if there is grave risk of harm to the child if returned children as young as nine have been found mature enough to have their wishes considered12 finally return may also be refuse d if it would be against the fundamental principles of human rights and freedoms in the requested state to return the

respective state15 the hague convention bases its terms on civil not criminal international law and therefore criminal liability and extradition provisions do not fall within its scope16 although the hague convention contains cer tain limitations it appa rently offers the greatest chance of prompt return of the wrongfully removed child the difficulty with parental international child abductions lies in the fact th at many countries have not participated in the hague c onventi on and when parent takes child to nonhague contracting state governments of the nations involved are not obligated to assist in that childs return some countries refuse to pa rticipate in the hague convention because they do not believe in the automatic return of the child rather they presume that the determination of the childs best interests should occur within thei r own jurisdiction under their own laws17 an analysis of the childs best interest considers the religious and social values of the respective countries involved but religious and cultural tensions between these countries and western culture fa mily law often render negotiations nearly impossible18 us laws law enforcement in the united states often viewed parental kidnapping as private family matter that did not requi re outside involvement this belief has changed with the enactment of several laws that recognize the seriousness and criminality of parental kidnappings19 presently law enforcement agents with arrest warrants seek out parents who violate custody decree by taking child out of the state or country unfortunately difficulties arise when parents ta ke children out of the country because foreign courts have obligation to enforce american custody decr ees or to abide by american laws even though the united states has difficulty enforc ing parental kidnapping laws abroad these laws can act as useful mechanisms to facilita solutions to intern ational child abductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21261crs5 20 42 usc
