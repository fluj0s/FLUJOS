officially made him cubas head of government and state most observers expected this since he already had been heading the cuban government on provisional basis since july 2006 when his brothe r fidel castro cubas longruling communist leader stepped down as president because of poor health for many years raúl as first vice president of the council of state and the council of ministers had been the officially designated successor and was slated to become chief of state with fidels departure raúl also had served as minister of the revolutionary armed forces far since the beginning of the cuban revolu tion when fidel stepped down from power in late july 2006 because of poor health he signed proclamation that ceded political power to raúl on provisional basis including the positions of first secretary of the cuban communist party pcc commander in chief of the revolutionary armed forces far and president of the council of state despite the change in government in february 2008 fidel still holds the official title of first secretary of the pcc in late april 2008 raúl announced that the pccs sixth congress would be held at the end of 2009 the last was held in 1997 some observers speculate that fidel castro could officially be replaced as the head of the party at that time and it is likely that some of the pccs 25member political bureau politburo will be replaced while it was not surprise to observers for raúl to succeed his brother fidel as head of government the selection of josé ramón machado ventura as the council of states first vice president was surprise physician by training machado is 77 years old and is part of the older generation of socalled históricos of the 1959 cuban revolution he has been described as hard line communist party ideologue and reportedly has been close friend and confident of rauls httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33819g5g158g139g138g497g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g343g343g342g157g145 g561g5g152 g151g144

significant because it makes him the official successor to raúl according to the cuban constitution many observers had expected that carlos lage one of five other vice presidents on the council of state would have been chosen as first vice president he was responsible for cubas economic reforms in the 1990s and at 56 years of age represents younger generation of cuban leaders while not rising to first vice president lage nevertheless retained his position as vice president on the council of state and also will continue to serve as the councils secretary several key military officers and confidants of raúl also became members of the council increasing the role of the military in the government general julio casas regueiro 72 years of age who already was on the council became one of its five vice presidents most significantly casas who had been first vice minister in the far was selected by raúl as the countrys new minister of the far officially replacing raúl in that position casas also is chairman of gaesa grupo administracion empresarial sa the cuban militarys holding company for its extensive businesses two other military appointments to the council were gen alvaro lópez miera the armys chief of staff and gen leopoldo cintra frías who commanded the western army one of cubas three military regions 2 since fidel stepped down from power in 2006 cubas political succession from fidel to raúl castro has been characterized by remarkable degree of stability although initially there were not any significant economic changes under raúl there were signs that changes could be coming in july 2007 speech raúl maintained that structural changes were needed in the cuban economy in order to increase efficiency and production in his first speech as president in february 2008 raúl promised to make the government smaller and more efficient to review the potential reevaluation of the cuban peso and to eliminate excessive bans and regulations that curb productivity 3 since march 2008 the government has implemented number of economic changes that from the outside might not seem significant but are significant policy changes for government that has heretofore followed centralized communist economic model see economic changes under raúl below while additional economic changes under raúl castro are likely few expect there will be any change to the governments tight control over the political system which is backed up by strong security apparatus some observers point to the reduced number of political prisoners from 283 at the end of 2006 to around 219 in mid2008 as evidence of lessening of repression but dissidents maintain that the overall situation has not improved some observers contend that as the new government of raúl castro becomes more confident of ensuring social stability and does not feel threatened it could move to soften its hard repression but for now the government is continuing its harsh treatment of the opposition the selection of josé ramón machado as first vice president also appears to be clear indication that the cuban government has intention of easing tight control over the political system for

cuban revolution which ousted the corrupt government of fulgencio batista in april 1961 castro stated that the cuban revolution was socialist and in december 1961 he proclaimed himself to be marxistleninist from 1959 until 1976 castro ruled by decree constitution was enacted in 1976 setting forth the pcc as the leading force in state and society with power centered in political bureau headed by fidel castro in october 1997 the cuban communist party held its 5 th congress the prior one was held in 1991 in which the party reaffirmed its commitment to single party state and reelected

as president of the council of state although national assembly members were directly elected for the first time in february 1993 only single slate of candidates was offered direct elections for the national assembly were again held in january 1998 and january 2003 but voters again were not offered choice of candidates in contrast at the local level elections for municipal elections are competitive with from two to eight candidates to be elected the candidate must receive more than half of the votes cast as result runoff elections between the two top candidates are common in 2007 the process of nominating candidates for the local municipal assemblies took place in september 2007 municipal elections were held october 21 2007 with runoffs on october 28 and over 15000 local officials were chosen the new municipal assemblies then met on december 2 2007 to nominate candidates for provincial assemblies and for the national assembly of peoples power national assembly elections were held on january 20 2008 along with elections for 1201 delegates to 14 provincial assemblies and fidel castro was once again among the candidates elected to the now 614member legislative body as in the past voters were only offered single slate of candidates on february 24 2008 the new assembly was scheduled to select from among its ranks the members of the council of state and its president many observers speculated that because of his poor health fidel would choose not be reelected as president of the council of state which would officially confirm his departure from h eading the cuban government statements from castro himself in december 2007 hinted at his potential retirement that proved true on february 19 2008 when fidel announced that he would not accept the position as president of the council of state essentially confirming his departure as titular head of the cuban government

discerned several potential scenarios for cubas future after fidel these fit into three broad categories the continuation of communist government military government or democratic transition or fully democratic government according to most observers the most likely scenario at least in the short term was continued leadership under raúl this was likely for variety of reasons but especially because of raúls designation by fidel as successor in the party and his position as leader of the far the far has been in control of the governments security apparatus since 1989 and has played an increasing role in cubas economy through the ownership of numerous business enterprises the scenario of militaryled government was viewed by some observers as possibility only if successor communist government failed because of divisiveness among leaders or political instability for many observers the least likely scenario upon fidels death or departure was democratic transition government with strong totalitarian security apparatus the castro government successfully impeded the development of independent civil society with only small and tightly regulated private sector independent labor movement and unified political opposition g10g158g150g138g151g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561 g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 cuba has poor record on human rights with the government sharply restricting

critics although some anticipated relaxation of the governments oppressive tactics in the aftermath of the popes january 1998 visit government attacks against human rights activists and other dissidents have continued since that time the interamerican commission on human rights maintains in its 2007 annual human rights report that the cuban governments restrictions on political rights freedom of expression and dissemination of ideas have created over period of decades situation of permanent and systematic violations of the fundamental rights of cuban citizens 4 according to the state departments human rights report for 2007 issued in march 2008 the cuban government continued to commit numerous serious abuses during the year among the human rights problems cited in the state department report were arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights advocates and members of indepe ndent professional organizations harassment beatings and threats against political opponents by governmentrecruited mobs police and state security officials beatings and abuse of detain ees and prisoners which led to the death of two prisoners in 2007 denial of fair trial harsh and

three years in prison in july 2008 the independent cuban commission on human rights and national reconciliation ccdhrn documented at least 219 political prisoners down from 234 in january 2008 this number reflected decline from previous years when the number of prisoners was at least 283 at the end of 2006 and 333 at the end of 2005 the commission maintains however that the real number of prisoners is likely greater because of cubas totalitarian regime that does not allow scrutiny of the prison system 5 despite the reduction in the number of prisoners human rights activists maintain that the overall situation has not improved cuban human rights activist elizardo sánchez the head of the ccdhrn asserts that the government is still repr essing dissidents with threats police searches of peoples homes interrogations and short detentions sánchez asserts that the police state is still in force in cuba reflected in almost every aspect of national life 6 in late february 2008 cuba signed two human rights treaties the international covenant on civil and political rights and the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights some considered this positive step but others stressed that it remains to be seen whether the cuban government will take action to guarantee civil and political freedoms 7 one significant step taken by the government in late march 2008 was the lifting of ban on cubans staying at tourist hotels although few cubans will be able to afford the cost of staying in such hotels the move is symbolically significant and ends the practices of what critics had dubbed tourism apartheid human rights group known as the ladies in white damas blanco was formed in april 2003 by the wives mothers daughters sisters and aunts of the members of the group

from preferential oil agreement with venezuela which provides cuba with more than 90000 barrels of oil day some observers maintain that venezuelas oil subsidies amounted to more than 3 billion year in 2006 19 venezuela also helped cuba upgrade an oil refinery in cienfuegos which was inaugurated in 2007 in 2008 economic growth slowed to an estimated 45 this was prompted by several problems including the declining price of nickel which accounts for major share of cubas exports the rising cost of food imports and the devastati on wrought by hurricanes gustav and ike in 2008 particularly in the agricultural sectors20 over the years cuba has expressed pride for the nations accomplishments in health and education in 2005 according to the development programs 20072008 human development report

considered part of their core business some analysts viewed the measure as an effort to turn back the clock on economic reform measures22 also in 2004 fidel castro announced that us dollars longer would be used in entities that currently accept dollars such as stores restaurants and hotels instead dollars had to be exchanged for convertible pesos with 10 surcharge for the exchange dollar bank accounts are still allowed but cubans are not able to deposit new dollars into the accounts beginning in april 2005 convertible pesos were longer on par with the us dollar but instead were linked to basket of foreign currencies this reduced the value of dollar remittances sent to cuba and provides more hard currency to the cuban government23

government would be more open to economic policy changes and debate about potential economic reforms reemerged in cuba on july 26 2007 in speech commemorating cubas revolutionary anniversary raúl castro acknowledged that cuban salaries were insufficient to satisfy needs and maintained that structural changes were necessary in order to increase efficiency and production he also maintained that the government was considering increasing foreign investment in the country some observers maintain that the speech was forecast for economic reforms under raúl while others stressed that only small marginal changes had occurred in raúls first year in power 24 in the aftermath of raúls july 2007 speech cuban public expectations for economic reform increased thousands of officially sanctioned meetings were held in workplaces and local pcc branches around the country where cubans were encouraged to air their views and discuss the future direction of the country complaints focused on low

cubans are prohibited from visiting tourist hotels policy subsequently changed in late march 2008 or traveling abroad the video demonstrated the disillusionment of many cuban youth with the poor economic situation and repressive environment in cuba since raúl castro officially assumed the presidency in february 2008 his government has announced series of economic changes in his first speech as president in february 2008 raúl promised to make the government smaller and more efficient to review the potential reevaluation of the cuban peso and to eliminate excessive bans and regulations that curb productivity 26 in midmarch the government announced that restrictions on the sales of consumer products such as computers microwaves and dvd and video players would be lifted in late march it announced that it would lift restrictions on the use of cell phones and this officially occurred in midapril one of cubas major reform efforts under raúl castro in 2008 was focused on the agriculture sector vital issue because cuba reportedly imports some 80 of its food needs and is paying an increasing amount for such imports because of rising food prices in an effort to boost food production the government is giving farmers more discretion over how to use their land and what supplies to buy decisionmaking on agriculture reportedly has been shifted from the national government to the local municipal level with government bureaucracy reportedly cut significantly27 in april 2008 the government announced that it would be revamping the states wage system by removing the limit that state worker can earn this an effort to boost productivity and to deal with one of cubas major economic problems how to raise wages to level where basic human needs can be satisfied cuban state companies reportedly have until august to revise their salary structures in order to reward workers who work hard with more compensation28 the problem of low wages in cuba is closely related to another major economic problem how to unify the two official currencies circulating in the country the cuban convertible peso cuc and the cuban peso which trades for about 25 to 1 cuc most people are paid in cuban pesos and the minimum monthly wage in cuba is about 225 pesos about 9 us dollars29 but for increasing amounts of consumer goods convertible pesos are used cubans with access to foreign remittances or work in jobs that give them access to convertible pesos are far better off than those cuban who do not have such access looking ahead several factors could restrain the magnitude of economic policy change in cuba number of observers believe that as long as fidel castro is around it will be difficult for the government to move forward with any major initiatives that are viewed as deviating from fidels orthodox policies other observers point to the significant oil subsidies and investment that cuba now receives from venezuela that have helped spur cubas high economic growth levels over the past several years and maintain that such support lessens the governments impetus for economic reforms another factor that bodes against rapid ec onomic policy reform is the fear that it could spur the momentum for political change given that one of the highest priorities for cubas 26 cuba full text of raúl castros national assembly address cubavisión havana as translated by open

communist dictatorship and moved his country toward close relations with the soviet union the often tense and hostile nature of the uscuban relationship is illustrated by such events and actions as us covert operations to overthrow the castro government culminating in the illfated april 1961 bay of pigs invasion the october 1962 missile crisis in which the united states confronted the soviet union over its attempt to place offensive nuclear missiles in cuba cuban support for guerrilla insurgencies and litary support for revolutionary governments in africa and the western hemisphere the 1980

and the february 1996 shootdown by cuban fighter jets of two us civ ilian planes operated by the cuban american group brothers to the rescue which resulted in the death of four us crew members since the early 1960s us policy toward cuba has consisted largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions including an embargo on trade and financial transactions the cuban assets control regulations cacr first issued by the treasury department in july 1963 lay out comprehensive set of economic sanctions against cuba including prohibition on most financial transactions with cuba and freeze of cuban government assets in the united states the cacr have been amended many times over the years to reflect changes in policy and remain in force today these sanctions were made stronger with th cuban democracy act cda of 1992 pl 102 484 title xvii and with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 pl 104 114 the latter often referred to as the helmsburton legislation the cda prohibits us subsidiaries from engaging in trade with cuba and prohibits entry into the united states for any vessel to load or unload freight if it has engaged in trade with cuba

currently budgeting for these programs 32 thereafter the commission recommended funding of not less than 20 million annually for cuba democracy programs until the dictatorship ceases to exist this would roughly double the amount currently spent on cuba democracy programs the report also set forth detailed plans of how the us government along with the international community and the cuban community abroad could provide assistance to cuban transition government to help it respond to critical humanitarian and social needs to conduct free and fair elections and to move toward marketbased

although us policymakers have agreed on the overall objectives of us policy toward cubato help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the islandthere have been several schools of thought about how to achieve those objectives some advocate policy of keeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while continuing current us efforts to support the cuban people others argue for an approach sometimes referred to as constructive engagement that would lift some us sanctions that they believe are hurting the cuban people and move toward engaging cuba in dialogue still others call for swift normalization of uscuban relations by lifting the us embargo fidel castros initially provisional and now permanent departure as head of government could eventually foster reexamination of us policy in this new context there are two broad policy approaches to contend with political change in cuba statusquo approach that would maintain the us dualtrack policy of isolating the c uban government while providing support to the cuban people and an approach aimed at influe ncing the cuban government and cuban society through increased contact and engagement for

civil war scenario they argue that since the demise of cubas does not appear imminent even without fidel castro at the helm the united states should espouse more pragmatic approach in trying to induce change in cuba supporters of changing policy also point to broad international support for lifting the us embargo to the missed opportunities for us businesses because of the unilateral nature of the embargo and to the increased suffering of the cuban people because of the embargo proponents of change also argue that the united states should be consistent in its policies with the worlds few remaining communist governments including china or vietnam and also maintain that moderating policy will help advance human rights on the other side opponents of changing us policy maintain that the current twotrack policy of isolating cuba but reaching out to the cuban people through measures of support is the best means for realizing political change in cuba they point out that the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 sets forth the steps that cuba needs to take in order for the united states to normalize relations they argue that softening us policy at this time without concrete cuban reforms would boost the castro government politically and economically and facilitate the survival of the communist regime opponents of softening us policy argue that the united states should stay the course in its commitment to democracy and human rights in cuba and that sustained sanctions can work opponents of loosening us sanctions further argue that cubas failed economic policies not the us embargo are the causes of cubas difficult living conditions

authoritarian governments major arguments in opposition to lifting the cuba travel ban are that more american travel would support castros rule by providing his government with potentially millions of dollars in hard currency that there are legal provisions allowing travel to cuba for humanitarian purposes that are used by thousands of americans each year and that the president should be free to

exports to cuba amounted to 608 million far higher than the same time period in previous years in part because of the rise in the cost of food prices and because of cubas increased food needs in the

the health and nutrition of the cuban population us agribusiness companies that support the removal of restrictions on agricultural exports to cuba believe that us farmers are missing out on market of over 700 million annually so close to the united states some exporters want to change us restrictions so that they can sell agriculture and farm equipment to cuba 63 agricultural exporters who support the lifting of the prohibition on financing contend that allowing such financing would help smaller u s companies expand purchases to cuba more rapidly64 opponents of further easing restrictions on agricultural exports to cuba maintain that us policy does not deny such sales to cuba as evidenced by the large amount of sales since 2001 moreover according to the state department since the cuban democracy act was enacted in 1992 the united states has licensed billions of dollars in private humanitarian donations opponents further argue that easing pressure on the cuban government would in effect be lending support and extending the duration of the castro regime they maintain that the united states should remain steadfast in its opposition to any easing of pressure on cuba that could prolong the castro regime and its repressive policies some agricultural producers that export to cuba support continuation of the prohibition on financing for agricultural exports to cuba because it ensures that they will be paid g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g11g151g146g157g146g138g157g146g159g142g156g561 in the first session of the 110th congress congress approved the fy2008

assurances that it would respect all its treaty commitments including the 1934 treaty covering the guantanamo base subsequently however as uscuban relations deteriorated the cuban government opposed the presence as illegal the mission of the base has changed over time during the cold war the base was viewed as good location for controlling caribbean sea lanes as deterrent to the soviet presence in the caribbean and as location for supporting potential military operations in the region in 1994 1995 the base was used to house thousands of cubans and haitians fleeing their homeland but by 1996

oppose the new mission of housing detainees defense minister raúl castro noted that in the unlikely event that prisoner would escape into cuban territory cuba would capture the prisoner and return him to the base 123 the cuban government however has expressed concerns about the treatment of prisoners at the us base and has said it will keep pressing the international community to investigate the
