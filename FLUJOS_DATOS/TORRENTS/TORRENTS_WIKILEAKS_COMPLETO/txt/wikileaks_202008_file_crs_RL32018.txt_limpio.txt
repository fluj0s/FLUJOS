telecommunications services for all consumers including lowincome consumers as well as those in rural and highcost areas the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 codified universal service principles in new section section 254 added to the communications act of 1934 within the broad framework of universal service the telecommunications act newly included elementary and secondary schools and libraries as beneficiaries of universal service for telecommunications services this specific support in the form of discounts on telecommunications services provided to schools and libraries under the universal service program has become known as the education rate or erate program this report provides an overview of the erate program including background information current status of participation and funding information it also considers selected issues involving the program the report focuses solely on the participation of schools in the erate program it does not address the participation of libraries or universal service in general erate provisions section 254 of the communications act of 1934 contains statutory provisions codifying universal service principles in general as has been noted under the provisions of section 254 schools and libraries are designated as beneficiaries of the universal service program section 254 requires that upon legitimate request any telecommunications carrier serving geographic area is required to make any of its services that are within the definition of universal service available at reduced rates to elementary and secondary schools and libraries for educational purposes section 254h1b among seven principles for universal service the legislation also provides that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms health care providers and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services section 254b6 in describing the telecommunications services that are to be provided the legislation states that the federal communications commission fcc is to establish competitively neutral rules to enhance to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable access to advanced telecommunications and crs2 information services for all public and nonprofit elementary and secondary school classrooms health care providers and libraries section 254h2a erate and schools program administration in its may 7 1997 order addressing the universal service provisions enacted under the communications act the fcc stated that up to 225 billion year would be made available to support universal service discounts for schools and libraries1 the funds are to be used to subsidize discounts on services provided to schools and libraries although erate is federal program it is funded by providers of telecommunications services all interstate telecommunications providers are required to contribute to the program funds for erate2 come from contributions that are based on percentage of the telecommunications providers interstate and international revenues3 many telecommunications service providers have elected to transfer the cost of their universal service contribution to their subscribers thereby shifting the costs of the program to the consumer the erate program is administered by the schools and libraries division sld4 of the universal service administrative company usac the usac is nonprofit corporation appointed by the federal communications commission fcc the sld provides discounts to assist schools and libraries in the us with obtaining affordable telecommunications services and internet access the sld provides discounts for connectivity the means to communicate using telecommunications services and the internet schools are expected to provide the requisite equipment and additional resources to support the connectivity eligibility to qualify for funding under the erate program school must meet the definition of an elementary or secondary school as delineated in the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea as amended by the child left behind act of 2001 nclba pl 107110 eligible schools can include either public or nonprofit institutional day or residential schools as well as 1 federal communications commission report and order fcc 97157 may 7 1997 2 the contributions from telecommunications providers are to support universal service goals in general not just the schools and libraries component of universal service 3 this percentage or contribution factor is calculated by the fccs common carrier bureau on quarterly basis and varies depending on the anticipated funding needs for the program as of the date of this report the monthly contribution factor is 89 4 in 1996 the fcc created nonprofit corporation known as the schools and library corporation slc to manage erate however amid congressional criticisms and general accounting office determination that the fcc exceeded its authority when it directed the creation of the slc on jan 1 1999 the slc was merged into the universal service administrative company which currently administers other portions of the universal service system and changed its name to the schools and libraries division crs3 public charter schools schools that operate as forprofit schools or that have an endowment in excess of 50 million are not eligible discounts the discounts for the services are divided into four categories telecommunications services internet access internal connections and basic maintenance of internal connections telecommunications services are those recurring services that are used to communicate information between two parties such as the telephone the second area internet access applies to basic access to the internet including email internal connections consist of the wiring and other components that expand access throughout the school such as wiring classrooms for computer and internet access the final category basic maintenance of internal connections is limited to maintenance of existing connections under fcc rules requests for telecommunications services and internet access are considered top priority priority 1 and are funded first any remaining funds are for schools seeking discounts for internal connections priority 25 priority is given to schools that are the most economically disadvantaged this applies to both priority areas the discounts for these services range from 20 to 90 depending upon the schools percentage of pupils from lowincome families and the urbanrural location of the school see table 1 for breakdown of the discounts6 generally the service provider seeks reimbursement from usac for the discounted portion of the services provided schools and libraries are responsible for paying service providers the non discount portions of eligible service costs schools can also pay the service provider in full and then seek reimbursement from usac table

poverty income level application process to apply for erate interested schools must annually submit technology plan specifying how technology will be integrated into the curriculum and professional development to improve education although the technology plan should be long term due to technologys rapidly changing status with new developments in software and hardware the technology plan should not cover more than three years the technology plan must contain the following components clear goals and realistic strategy for utilizing technology to improve education professional development that indicate staff are able to use technology to improve education an assessment of the telecommunications services hardware and software that are necessary to improve education budget illustrating the schools ability to acquire the non discounted components of the technology plan and an evaluation that enables the school to monitor progress and achievement of specified goals technology plans must be independently approved by state agency overseeing schools or libraries or another sld certified technology plan approver applicants who seek discounts only for basic local andor long distance telephone services do not need to prepare technology plan after the applicant has identified the requisite products and services necessary to support the technology plan form 470 description of services requested and certification form must be submitted either online or as paper application the sld posts all form 470s on their website to notify interested service providers of the needed products and services form 470 is posted on the sld website for competitive bidding period of 28 days during which time potential service providers submit bids for the requested services to applicants at the conclusion of this period an applicant is required to select the most cost effective provider form 471 services ordered and certification form enables the applicant to request funding for what was submitted in the technology plan because funding for erate is capped each year at 225 billion and the actual requests for funding have annually exceeded the cap fcc rules allow all form 471s to be submitted during window period whereby all applications are treated as though they were received simultaneously the 2006 window is open for 73 days december 6 2005 through february 16 2006 crs5 sld informs applicants of its decisions through waves the waves are actually groups of funding commitment decision letters fcdl notifying applicants of slds decision which are sent to applicants as decisions are made rather than waiting for all applications to be processed waves are based on the fcc rules of priority as detailed above funding and participation the year 2006 marks the eighth funding year of erates existence january 1998 through january 2006 in its inaugural funding year which was 18 months january 1998 to june 19997 the commission supported approximately 25000 programs and provided close to 17 billion in funding discounts in the second grant cycle the program experienced significant increase providing more than 21 billion to applicants subsequent years have witnessed similar numbers of applicants and each year funding has been provided up to the programs maximum cap of 225 billion during the seventh funding year erate provided funding discounts to approximately 26000 applicants8 for the first seven years of the program 153 billion in funds have been committed the total committed as of january 2006 is 116 billion with an average discount of 44500 nearly 27 of the applicants awarded received the maximum discount available of the funded applicants approximately 25 were from schools 58 from school districts 14 from libraries or library consortia and approximately 2 from schoollibrary consortia the percentage distribution of the dollar value of the discounts awarded was 7 for schools 84 for school districts 6 for libraries and library consortia and 4 for schoollibrary consortia9 selected issues the defining legislation for the erate program telecommunications act of 1996 did not explicitly state how the erate program was to be administered which has subsequently raised some issues for the how the program operates for example does the fcc have the authority to use usf funds for oversight of the erate program the erate program is both highly regarded for its ability to bring telecommunications to rural and poor schools and libraries but it is also highly criticized because of the increasing incidents of fraud waste and abuse this section presents brief discussion of selected program and policy issues 7 the fcc issued an order in june 1998 cc docket 9645 making several modifications to the program one of which revised the funding year from calendar year to fiscal year cycle the first year was extended by six months to allow subsequent grant cycles to correspond to the fiscal year thereby synchronizing the program with the budgetary cycles of schools and libraries 8 data retrieved from the usacs website at httpwwwsluniversalserviceorg fundingy2005nationalasp 9 percentages do not sum to 100 due to rounding crs6 fraud and abuse there has been much written lately about fraud and abuse within the erate program the center for public integrity authored report entitled phone fund for schools libraries riddled with fraud in which erate was described as being honeycombed with fraud and financial shenanigans10 the inspector general ig for the fcc conducted an investigation in which they noted errors ranging from regulatory noncompliance to computational errors all of which resulted in approximately 8 million being erroneously disbursed federal communications commission office of inspector general semiannual report october 31 2002 the year 2002 marked the first time that federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against telecommunications provider that participated in the erate program the complaint alleged that the owner and three employees of connect2 internet networks inc hereinafter connect2 conspired to defraud the program of several million dollars by persuading administrators from schools with the highest need those that qualify for 90 telecommunications services discount to purchase expensive equipment that they did not need connect2 further informed the administrators that they would not be financially responsible for the requisite percentage due because foundation would pay the balance as result several administrators reportedly purchased equipment that was significantly more expensive than what they would have purchased if they had to pay portion of the bill by doing this it was charged that connect2 was able to sell large quantities of equipment and services to schools with little to restriction on the amount charged11 the owner of connect2 and the employees who were charged subsequently pleaded guilty and are barred from participating in the erate program for three years12 the sld created both task force and whistle blower hotline to deal with fraud waste and abuse the task force initially reported13 that the structure of the erate program and the ambiguity of certain policies and procedures likely contributed to wasteful program management they recommended that the sld develop and publicize list of products and services and reasonable prices for the products and services in 2005 webbased database of eligible services was added to the sld website to enable applicants to search list of eligible products and services it is expected that the list will help limit ambiguity and wasteful practices 10 httpwwwpublicintegrityorg 11 see david mcguire fraud issue could undermine erate program

report is available at httpwwwsluniversalserviceorgtaskforce update2asp crs7 the whistle blower hotline allows interested persons to report waste fraud or abuse and to remain anonymous if they so choose each call received is referred to usacs general counsel for assessment and investigation oversight the erate program has very few resources dedicated to oversight of the program recent report14 by the fccs ig noted that lack of funds was significant problem for independent program oversight the report states that additional funds have been requested for staff to provide independent oversight for fy2006 and fy2007 with respect to the erate program the ig stated that lack of adequate resources has made it difficult for the oig to provide an adequate level of support to federal law enforcement as they investigate fraudulent activity in the rate program in october 2002 the ig issued report stating that the fcc was unclear whether the funds could be utilized for oversight federal communications commission office of inspector general semiannual report october 31 2002 the most recent ig report 2005 appears to suggest that this issue has not been resolved these budget requests reflect our inability to use the usf itself to provide funding for the cost of oversight report language in the commissions fy2004 final budget indicated that the monies for usf audits should come from the fund itself however neither the senate nor the house of representatives has included language to permit the fcc to use usf funds in the draft funding bills to date for fy2006 federal communications commission office of the inspector general semiannual report to congress april 1 2005september 30 2005 universal service fund and the antideficiency act the question of how to treat the funds used to support the erate program is perennial and contentious issue according to the government accountability office gao the fund has been listed in the budget of the united states and since fy2004 has been subject to annual apportionment from the office of management and budget omb15 thereby making the usf federal funds however in senate hearing regarding exempting the usf from portions of the antideficiency act ada acting general counsel for the fcc austin schlick stated that the fcc has operated the usf according to ombs interpretation that the usf is special fund 14 see federal communications commission office of the inspector general semiannual report to congress april 1 2005september 30 2005 the full report is available athttpwwwfccgovoigsar35_103105pdf 15 government accountability office testimony before the subcommittee on oversight and investigations committee on energy and commerce house of representatives telecommunications concerns regarding the structure and fccs management of the rate program gao05439t crs8 and does not constitute public money16 to date this issue has not been completely resolved the issue presented itself again in late 2003 when the fcc ordered usac to prepare financial statements for the usf during this period it was determined that the fcdls previously discussed that were sent to grantees constituted obligations because the ada does not allow an agency or program to make financial obligations in excess of the amount that is available it was determined that the erate program was in violation of the ada as result of this discovery in august 2004 the usac suspended the mailing of additional fcdls for funding year 2004 and was ordered to liquidate investments to comply with the antideficiency act requirement for the fcdls that were previously issued it was reported that the liquidation which occurred over twoday period cost the fund approximately 46 million in immediate losses and possibly more in future interests17 during the suspended funding period it was reported that many schools were unable to continue programs that depended upon financial support from the erate program18 the decision received significant amount of attention from the media and the congress the suspended funding and lack of clarity regarding the ada resulted in the passage of the universal service antideficiency temporary suspension act pl 108494 which exempted the usf from the antideficiency act until december 31 2005 in november 2005 it was extended by one year in the annual appropriations bill for science state
