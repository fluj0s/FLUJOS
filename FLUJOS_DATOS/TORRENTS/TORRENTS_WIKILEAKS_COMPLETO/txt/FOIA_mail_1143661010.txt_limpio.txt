from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to gustafson diane dgustafsnasedu subject re proxy time series date wed 29 mar 2006 143650 0100 cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xflowed dear diane mike nrc committee at 2218 28032006 gustafson diane wrote dear tim our national research council committee on surface temperature reconstructions has been considering your paper with keith briffa published in recent issue of science could you please elaborate on your criterion for selecting the proxy time series included in the analysis we are interested in how you computed the correlation between the proxy time series and local temperature time series is the correlation based on filtered or detrended time series how would you counter the potential criticism that your selection method tends to favor proxy time series that show strong 20th century warming it would be most helpful for us if you could reply in time for us to consider your response at our meeting tomorrow morning thanks in advance for your help mike wallace we tim osborn and keith briffa will first respond to these specific questions about our recent science paper in addition copied below are some further comments by keith briffa on issues related to treering proxy records that may be of interest to the committee the primary purpose of our paper was to implement an alternative and possibly complementary method of proxydata analysis to the methods used in most previously published reconstructions of past nh temperature variations we did not want to introduce an entirely new selection of proxy records even if this were possible because that would obscure whether differences in our conclusions compared with published work arose from our method or different selection of proxy records we decided therefore to make use of as many of the individual records used in almost all the previously published nh temperature reconstructions excluding any records for which an indication of at least partial temperature sensitivity was lacking so very low resolution records for which comparison with instrumental temperatures is problematic were excluded we used records specifically from mann and jones 2003 and esper et 2002 in addition we included records from mann et 2003 which i think just adds the van engelen documentary record from the low countries in europe because the others were already in the mann and jones set we excluded duplicates and our paper explains which series we used where duplicates were present we did not average the tornetrask yamal and taimyr treering records as done by mann and jones because we could see reason not to use them as individual series the series used by mann and jones had already been correlated with their local instrumental temperatures using decadallysmoothed nondetrended values so we accepted this as an indication of some temperature sensitivity for the other series we calculated our own correlations against local instrumental temperatures trying both annualmean or summermean temperatures in our papers supplementary information we state that we used the hadcrut2 temperatures for this purpose which combines land air temperatures with sst observations in fact we used the crutem2 landonly temperature data set for this purpose these should be identical where the proxy locations are not coastal for these correlations we did not filter the data nor did we detrend it and we used the full period of overlap between the proxy record and the available instrumental record we excluded records that did not show positive correlation with their local temperatures the remaining set includes most of the long high resolution records used by others such as moberg et crowley and lowery hegerl et mann bradley and hughes etc as well as by mann and jones and esper et the final question regarding the selection method favouring records that show strong 20th century warming trend is more philosophical issue as stated above we did not actually use strongly selective criteria preferring to use those records that others had previously used and only eliminating those that were clearly lacking in temperature sensitivity to some extent therefore the question is then directed towards the studies whose selection of data we used certainly we did not look through whole host of possibilities and just pick those with strong upward trend in the last century and we dont think the scientists whose work we selected from would have done this either there are very few series to choose from that are 500 years long and are from proxy typeslocations where temperature sensitivity might be expected it would be entirely the wrong impression to think that there are 140 such priori suitable possible series and that we picked either explicitly or implicitly just those 10 that happened by chance to exhibit upward 20th century trends the correlation with local temperature is an entirely appropriate factor to consider when selecting data these could be computed using detrended data though for those that we calculated our use of unfiltered data means that the trend is unlikely to dominate the correlation one would need to inspect the trend in the temperature data at each location to evaluate how much influence it would have on the results but in locations where strong upward trend is present it would be right to exclude proxy records that did not reproduce it though also correct that proxy shouldnt be included solely on the basis of it having the trend especially where the proxy resolution is sufficient to test its ability to capture shorter term fluctuations finally note that our method has not selected only those records with strong 20th century warming trend of the 14 proxies selected see our figure 1 7 do not have strong upward 20th century trends quebec chesapeake bay w greenland tirol tornetrask mangazeja and taimyr our method gives equal weight to all records so it should not be biased towards single record or small number of records that do show strong upward trends here are the additional comments on treering issues i would also like to take the opportunity if you will allow to comment briefly on some reports that have reached concerning the contribution made by rosanne darrigo to your committee apparently this is being interpreted by some as reflecting adversely on the validity of numerous temperature reconstructions that involve significant dependence on treering data this is related to rosannes focus in her presentation on the apparent difference between measured temperatures and tree growth in recent decades socalled divergence problem first let make it clear that as i did not attend the committee meeting i am not able to comment specifically on the details of rosanne darrigos actual presentation though i am aware of her papers with various coauthors related to this divergence in the recent circa post 1970 trends in treegrowth and temperature changes as recorded in instrumental data at near treeline sites in the canadian arctic there are also other papers dealing with changing growth responses to climate in north american trees i have coauthored paper in nature on the reduced response to warming as seen in treering densitometric data at highlatitude sites around the northern hemisphere increasingly apparent in the last 30 years or so first it is important to note that the phenomena is complicated because it is not clearly identifiable as ubiquitous problem rather it is mix of possible regionally distinct indications possible mix of phenomena that is almost certainly in part due to the methodological aspects of the way treering series are produced this applies to my own work but also very likely to other work the implications at this stage for the hockey stick and other reconstructions are not great that is because virtually all long treering reconstructions that contribute to the various reconstructions are not affected by this most show good coherence with temperature at local levels in recent decades this is not true for one series based on the density data as these are our data i am able to say that initial unpublished work will show that the problem can be mitigated with the use of new and again unpublished chronology construction methods in the case of the work by rosanne and colleagues i offer my educated opinion that the phenomenon they describe is likely also at least in part chronology construction issue i am not saying that this is full explanation and certainly there is the possibility of increased moisture stress on these trees but at present the issue is still being defined and explored as the issue needs more work this is only an opinion and until there is peerreviewed and published evidence as to the degree of methodological uncertainty it is not appropriate to criticize this or other work for my part i have been very busy lately with teaching and ipcc commitments but we will do some work on this now though again lack of funds to support research assistant do not help the matter is important but i do not believe that the facts yet support rosannes contention in her global biogeochemical cycles paper vol 18 gb3021 doi1010292004gb002249 2004 that an optimum physiological threshold has been consistently exceeded at site in the yukon this conclusion should certainly not be taken as indicating widespread threshold exceedence it was my call not to overplay the importance of the divergence issue knowing the subtlety of the issues in the fortcoming ipcc chapter 6 draft we did always intend to have brief section about the assumption of uniformitarianism in proxy interpretation including mention of the possible direct carbon dioxide fertilization effect on tree growth equally controversial but it is likely to conclude that here as well there is strong evidence of any major realworld effect this and the divergence problem are not well defined sufficiently studied or quantified to be worthy of too much concern at this point the uncertainty estimates we calibrate when interpreting many treering series will likely incorporate the possibility of some bias in our estimates of past warmth but these are wide anyway this does not mean that temperatures were necessarily at the upper extreme of the reconstruction uncertainty range 1000 years ago any more than they may have been at the bottom the real problem is lack of widespread and nonterrestrial proxies for defining the level of early warmth and the vital need to update and study the responses of proxies in very recent times
