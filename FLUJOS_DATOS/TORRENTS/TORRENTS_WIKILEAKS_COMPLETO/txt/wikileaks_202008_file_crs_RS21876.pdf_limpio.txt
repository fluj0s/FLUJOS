in the case of recidivists judge could not sentence criminal defendant to term of imprisonment greater than that which the statutory maximum assigned to the crime for which he had been convicted by the jury in blakely v washington us 2004 the court made it clear that apprendi meant that when sentencing criminal defendant under sentencing guidelines judge may proceed up the severity scale only so far as the speciﬁc ﬁndings of the jury will allow blakely v washington us 2004 facts new to jurys verdict or to defendants guilty plea may not be relied upon for judicially determined upward departure to impose sentence more severe than the verdict or plea alone will support although it arose out of state sentencing proceeding blakely has obvious implications for the federal guidelines system it appears that to the extent to which that system permits sentence enhancements based on judicial ﬁndings of relevant conduct sentencing factors or grounds for upward departures the facts upon which they are based must have been presented to the jury or the right must have been clearly waived although it may constitute prosecutorial inconvenience the obligation apparently may be honored by

but otherwis more plausible judici alsentencingfactorto montana1 he eventually pled guilty to second degree kidnaping involving domestic violence and use of firearm class b felony2 class b felonies were punishable by imprisonment for maximum of 10 years3 the applicable statutory sentencing guidelines called for standard range of imprisonment of from 49 to 53 months4 consistent with the plea bargain the pros ecution recommended sentence at the top of the 49 to 53 month range5 the guidelines however authorized the court to impose more severe sentence an upward departure when it found additional aggravating factors present6 the court took advantage of this au thority to sentence blakely to term of 90 months imprisonment ba sed on several factors including the fact that the offense had been committed with deliberate cruelty7 the washington appellate court rejected blakelys apprendi argument8 t h sentencing courts factual terminations upon which it based its sentencing enhancement did not define new crime w ith separate penalties nor di d it carry blakely beyond the statutory maximum sentence the court be lieved even though the 90 month sentence exceeded the 53 month limit of the applicable standard sentencing guideline range it came within the 10 year statutory ceiling set for the crime for which he was convicted class b second degree kidnaping felony thus the washington court concluded apprendi had been avoided the united states supreme court disagreed apprendi several years prior to apprendi the supreme court announced decision that seemed to encourage legisla tive bodies to explicitly authorize judges to weigh various aggravating and mitigating circumstances when determining how long sentence to impose upon criminal defendant in mcmillan v pennsylvania 477 us 79 1986 the court rejected constitutional challenge to sentencing scheme under which defendant might be sentenced to mandatory minimum term of imprisonment if the court found by preponderance of the evidence the presence of particular sentencing factor in this case that the defendant had brandish ed firearm during commission of the underlying offense as th popularity and diversity of these judicial sentencing factor schemes grew the court became increasingly uneasy with their implications if facts that might otherwise have been cast as elements of crime could instead be classified as judicial sentencing factors what would become of the constitutional right to jury trial and the due process right to conviction only upon proof beyond reasonable doubt9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21876crs3 construction 10 harris v united states 536 us 545 568 2002 11 united states v cotton 535 us 625 632 2002 12 ring v arizona 536 us 584 589 2002 13 see generally

apprendi v new jersey 530 us 466 2000 apprendi had been convicted of crime puni shable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years he had been sentenced to impri sonment for 12 years however based on the sentencing judges determina tion by preponderance of the evidence of the applicability of statutory hate crime enhancement th is the court declared neither due process nor the sixth amendment permits for other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond th prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved bey ond reasonable doubt 530 us at 460 response to apprendi f t r apprendi the supreme court affirmed the continued vitality of mcmillan judicial determination by preponderance of the evidence of fact that results in the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences offends neither due process nor the sixth amendment as long as it falls beneath the statutory maximum penalty10 it confirmed that the principles identified in apprendi applied with equal force to the right to grand jury indictment in federal felony cases11 and to the right to have jury determine the presence or absence of the aggravating factors required for imposition of the death penalty12 among the state and lower federal appellate courts narrow construction settled upon the statement in apprendi that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond th prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt apprendi governed the world beyond the statutory maximum pena lty set for crime it was often said sentencing guidelines and the exercise of judicial sentencing authority beneath that statutory ceiling rested beyond the shadow of apprendi they believed13 they were wrong blakely the question in blakely is simply does apprendi s statutory maximum refer to the 10 year maximum for second degr ee kidnaping or the 53 month ceiling of the applicable sentencing guideline the stion turns on what the jury found or the defendant conceded since the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21876crs4 14 the legacy of todays opinion whether intended or not will be the consolidation of sentencing power in the state and federal judici aries the court says to congress and state legislatures if you want to constrain the ntencing discretion of judges and bring some uniformity to sentencing it will cost you dear ly congress and states faced with the burdens imposed by the extension of apprendi to the present context w ill either trim or eliminate altogether their sentencing guidelines schemes and with them 20 years of sentencing reform because i find it implausible that the framers would have considered such result to be required by the due process clause or the sixth amendment and because the practical consequences of todays decision may be disast rous i respectfully di ssent 124 sct at 2543 544 oconnor j with breyer j and except with respect to the impact on the federal sentencing guidelines rehnquist chj and kennedy j dissenting 15 witte v united states 515 us 389 399401 1995 united states v watts 519 us 148 15357 1997 16 for example the guideline covering robbe ry extortion and blackmail calls for sentencing enhancements based upon the amount of money involved ussg 2b31b7 chapter 3 envisions sentencing enhancements based upon the presence of hate crime motivation or vulnerable victim ussg 3a11 if the victim is pubic official ussg 3a 12 if the victim was restrained ussg 3a13 if the offense was crime of terrorism ussg 3a14 if the offender played some lead ership role in an offense invo lving several individuals ussg 3b11 if the offense involved an abuse of position of trust or the use of special skill ussg 3b13 if the offense involved the us of minor ussg 3b14 if the offense involved the use of body armor in drug trafficking offense or crime of violence ussg 3b15 if the offender obstructed justice in th investigation or prosecution of the offensejury verdict or adm itted by the defendant in other words the relevant statutory maximum is not the maximum sentence judge may impose after finding additional facts but the maximum he may impose without any additional facts 124 sct at 2537 emphasis in the original in ternal citations quotations and captions omitted thus because the states sentencing procedure did not comply with the sixth amendment blakelys sentence is invalid 124 sct at 2538 without actually saying so the courts opinion coming on the heels of blakelys guilty plea makes it clear that guilty plea w ithout more is not enough to overcome the defects found in apprendi and blakely when defendant pleads guilty the state is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant either stipulates to the relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding 124 sct at 2541 the dissenters protest that the results in blakely as in apprendi are neither constitutionally necessary nor well advised14 federal consequences on its face the federal sentencing guidelines scheme seems very similar to the wash ington scheme more troubling it seems to assign federal judges sentencing authority that the court in blakely identified as within the exclusive domain of the jury the federal sentencing gu ideline system requires the sentencing court to consider all relevant c onduct whether presented to th jury or nor ussg 1b13 in fact it permits considera tion and reliance upon charges that the jury has never seen or ones that it has rejected by acquitting the defendant15 more specifically without any demand that the matter be mentioned in the indictment or presented to the jury the guidelines permit the court to increase defendants sentence should it find by preponderance of the evidence any of the sent ence enhancing factors listed in the basic applicable guideline or in the collection of factors prescribed in chapters 3 and 5 of the guidelines16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21876crs5 ussg 3c11 or if the offender created reckless endangerment during flight ussg 3c11 chapter 5 permits upward departur seemingly comparable to those in blakely for conduct unusually heinous cruel brutal or degr ading to the victim ussg 5k28 or for possession of weapon during the commission of th offense ussg 5k28 or for abduction or unlawful restraint in furtherance of some other crime ussg 5k24 17 the federal guidelines are not before us and we express opi nion on them124 sct at 2538 n9 18 if the washington scheme does not comport with the constitution it is hard to imagine guidelines scheme that would what i have fear ed most has now come to pass over 20 years of sentencing reform are all but lost 124 s ct at 2550 oconnor j dissenting perhaps the court will distinguish the federal sentencing guidelines but i am uncertain how as result of todays decision federal prosecutors like state prosecutors must deci what to do next how to handle tomorrows case federal prosecutors will proceed with those prosecutions subject to the risk that all defendants in those cases will have to be sentenced perhaps tried anew 124 sct at 2561562 breyer j dissenting 19 decision invalidating washingtons departure mechanism would raise questions about the federal sentencing guid elines constitutionality it is nonetheless not certain that this court would ultimately conclude that the diffe rences between the washington system and the federal guidelines are of constitutional magnitude amicus curiae brief for the united states at 2930 bold in the originalthe court in blakely specifically declined to address the impact of the decision on sentencing under the federa l sentencing guidelines17 both justices oconnor and breyer in their dissents saw obvious and severe consequences for the federal sentencing guidelines18 although the justice departments brief in support of the state of washington makes what justice oconnor calls halfhearted attempt to distinguish the federal sentencing guidelines 124 sct at 2549 oconnor j dissenting the brief concedes the differences may be constitutionally inconsequential19 if as it seems the obligations identified in blakely apply with equal force to sentencing under the federal sentencing guid elines compliance in future cases seems possible without either statutory or guidelin alterations in cases where the defendant pleads guilty the government is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant either stipulates to the relevant facts or consen ts to judicial factfinding 124 sct at 2541 in ot her cases the obligation may be met by including the relevant facts in the indictment the supreme court has granted certiorari in two cases which each raise questions of whether the principles announced in blakely apply to the united states sentencing guidelines and if so whether constitutionally invalid portions of the guidelines may be severed united states v booker cert granted us 2004 united states v fanfan cert granted us 2004 questions concerning retr ospective application of blakely are bit more complicated in schriro v summerlin 124 sct 2519 2004 announced the same day as blakely the court held that ring which applied apprendi in capital punishment cases did not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct appeal when ring was handed down apprendi applied to cases pending final appeal at the time where the defendant had previously raised the issue ye t in cases pending final appeal when apprendi was decided and in which the defenda nt had failed to preserve an apprendi argument thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21876crs6 defendant was required to bear the substantial burden of demonstrating that failure to vacate the apprendi offending sentencing would thr eaten to cast doubt upon the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings united states v cotton 535 us 625 63233 2002 the same principles woul d presumably apply should the principles in blakely be found applicable to cases under the federal sentencing guidelines
