established general framework forregulation of child labor but left to the discretion of the secretary of labor thedetermination of which types of work ought to be considered particularlyhazardous for persons under 18 yearsofage where the secretary determined that an area of work was particularly hazardous he was directed by congress todevelop regulations under which young persons might be employed or to bar them totally from such employment the result has been the development through theyears of seventeen hazardous occupations orders hos for nonagricultural work under ho 2 the employment of persons unde r 18 yearsofage is restricted in occupations that require operation of moto r vehicle such employment must be in conformity with stated safety standards where vehicle operation is required must not involve driving outside of daylight hours and what driving is permitted must be occasional and incidental to the young persons employment with only slightmodification that standard

stimulated inte rest in child labor standards through the period steady stream of bills appeared both in the house and senate withnumerous hearings the department of labor reacted with renewed enforcementactivity in her annual report for 1988 s ecretary mclaughlin noted the wage and hour division found 20454 minors employed in violation of the child laborprovisions of the flsa during fiscal 1988 and it assessed 214 million in childlabor civil penalties against 902 employers who were found to be illegally employing13838 minors 24 with the appointment of eli zabeth dole as secretary of

violati ng our child labor laws indeed weve witnessed disturbing 128 percent increase in violations in the past four yearssecretary dole reacted by increasing substantially the departments child laborenforcement efforts she created series of strike forces which moved in ontargeted industries in which children were most likely to be employed the purpose of these initiatives collectively operation childwatch was to promoteunderstanding of child labor law and to redress abuses 25 strike forces were directed initially toward the retail fastfood grocery and restaurant industries then toward agricultu re and the garment industries with others to follow in her annual report for 1990 mrs dole noted the first strike force in march 1990 utilized more than 500 investigators for two full

youth were found illegally employed 26 secretary dole and in some measure secretary mclaughlin did not promulgate new regulations rather they had chosen to enforce standards long in place butfrequently it appears violated with impunity 27 continuing regulatory reform in late october 1990 the department published proposed rule suggesting change s in three hazardous occupations orders one of which was ho 2 its concern w ith ho 2 focused upon the issue of 16 and 17 yearold school bus drivers it moved to end that option argui ng that 16 and 17 yearold minors generally have more

that the committee had markedup noting that subsequent negotiations between the sponsors of the bill and thedepartment had resulted in compromise language quoted above which was moreprotective of youth workers than the original proposal 47 representative ford termed the comp romise bipartisan and commended the various advocates of protection for young wo rkers for their insights and persistence which had resulted in legislation addre ssing many of the legitimate concerns that had been raised he took note of the high accident rate associated with youngerdrivers observed that while

balance 48 as debate continued the focus returned to the specific case of the automobile dealers there are many young people male and female who have gotten their startworking parttime at an auto dealer ship representative andrews observed frankly if the young person is not permitted to drive on occasion his or her value to the auto dealer as an employer is rath er diminished the bill mr andrews argued is really youth employment bill 49 representative blumenauer taking regional focus pointed to the auto d ealers of the pacific northwest pretty straightahead folks good public citizens

some regarded it as noncontroversial56 that it was considered both in the house and in the senate under unanimous consent and without recorded vote might confirm that assessment howe ver number of questions may still arise as the statute is implemented rulemaking vs legislation development of standards under which young persons new to the worldof work may be safely employed is complicated undertaking initially in 1938congress established broad framework for such regulation and left its finetuning to the secretary of labor through the years the secretary has dealt with that issue through the rulemaking process ie suggesting policy publishing proposedregulation inviting comment and after ex tended evaluation publishing final rule such rule could then be further modified if necessary through the same process even when the regular rulemaking pro cess is followed scrupulously which it may not have been in the case of the teen drivers the result can be time consuming and frustrating general review of federal child bor regulation commenced early in the reagan administration and concl uded without achieving its putative intent ie the existing regulations were neither changed nor affirmed to be appropriatethen late in the reagan administration the department created special childlabor advisory committee which conferred and consulted into the bushadministration and expired by the time the clinton administration came into office in 1994 under secretary reich the department commenced another general reviewof the federal regulation of child labor process that is ongoing it may be that the dol regards the exis ting child labor regulations that it has developed including ho 2 as functioning well and without need of major change but in the enforcement of existing child labor regulations some have argued thatdol has been neither precise clear nor consistent position voiced with somevigor by the automobile dealers associations at the same time some proponents ofthe regulation believe that it is inappropriate to weaken the system of hazardousoccupations orders over issues that are essentially administrative the preciserestriction of employment of

prior to enhanced enforcement initiatives57 in march 1994 senator gorton with ne house members from washington had sought secretary reichs intervention to prevent an injustice against large number of auto dealers in washington stat who are unintentionally at odds with an undefined department of labor regulation the letter stated that the senator and the signatory members had been advised by the auto dealers one from the department of bor has ever communicated to them an interpretation of incidental and ccasional driving that is at odds with this contested practice in fact it was only during the current compliance audit that the dealers first learned of an internal department of laborinterpretation meaning driving only in an emergency andor not more thanonce or twice per year an interpretation found nowhere in law orregulation mr secretary we believe that the va st majority of auto dealers in our state have sincerely attempted to comply with the law and regulation asthey are written they have reviewed the law and the regulation theyhave consulted their national and state trade associations on compliancematters it affirmed we share their frustration that they are being penalized for violating phrase which the department has been ble to define in its own regulations 58 in retrospect it appears dol would ve preferred an administrative solution in the ho 2 case in

issues should be dealt with through the rulemaking process 59 in march 31 1998 letter to chairman goodling of the committee on education and the workforce secretary herman expressed th same view as general matter it is preferable to address such issues thr ough notice and comment rulemaking rather than legislation60 but some employers and members of congress may have lost confidence in the

calculationsthat what was once simple process has gi ven rise to confusing maze of rules and regulations about how the law shoul d be applied in each workplace61 that maze of rules and regulations however did not develop spontaneously rather theyhave resulted from the form and structure of the legislation dol was asked toimplement as development of hr 2327 proceeded some questioned whether the legislation was practical ie were its term s sufficiently precise the impetus for the teen driver bill after all had stemmed at least in part from dols interpretation ofthe language of existing regulations but even with explicit definitions interpretive questions may well arise some may be rooted in unforeseen circumstances for example if youth were on the road at dusk 30 mile radius is allowed and drove back after dark to his employe rs establishment would that be violation his operation of the vehicle is permitted only during daylight hoursfurther pl 105334 requires that only one third of an employees worktime in any workday may be given over to driving similarly more than 20 percent of anemployees worktime in any workweek if youthful driver were 25 miles from her place of employment caught in traffic jam and her third of workday expired before she returned to her place of business has violation occurred at aminimum such situations seem to imply the need for very careful planning in the utilization of ones workforce and for equally careful record keeping andcompliance inspection must the employer review time sheets for youth workersassess length of likely travel time includi ng any mishap and then send out only driver with undeniably ample time to complete the triperrand before expiration ofher third of workday and early enough to avoid darkness however defined 62 such contingencies may need to be dealt with in regulations or opinion letters developed by dol regulations as free as po ssible from ambiguity so that they are clearly and easily understood by employers workers and departmental compliance staff each nuance of policy each regul atory provision could provide an occasion were enforcement strict for sanctions judgment will be required both indevelopment and implementation of the re gulations for administering pl 105334 on such issues there may well be disagreement and thus some measure of disputemay continue even in the wake of congressional action the safety factor little may be expected from most 17 yearold workers in the way of prior training or skill however in the contex t of pl 105334 there is one critical skill that such workers must possess ie the ability to drive the question remains as to how safely such teen workers may drive are young persons for whatever reasonsmore likely to experience risks in the workplace than older persons httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98561crs19 63state of washington department of labor and industries occupational injuries among adolescents in washington state 19881991

found that 16 and 17 yearolds appear to have an overall workrelated injury rate more than three times greater thanfor adults for each hour worked 63 within the 16 to 17yearold cohort it was found that the injury rate for males is almost two times greater than that forfemales the report speculated that the higher rate of injury among males mightresult from propensity for males to work in more hazardous jobs and to exhibitmore risktaking or reckless behavior 64 speaking generally the report suggested that adolescents are highrisk group for occupational injury and explained this increased risk is due to the differences between adults and adolescents in development size maturity experience and judgmentrisktaking behavior is typical characteristic of adolescence sic asthey explore their capabilities but often lack perception of their limitationsand vulnerability in workplace tting teens may not feel capable of refusing to do task that is inappropriate or dangerous especially if adesire exists to be treated more like and adult than child and the report added they may also believe that they would not be asked to do something if it is considered dangerous 65 when in 1990 secretary dole published the proposed rule dealing inter alia with ho 2 the advisory committee had r ecommended that there be exemption from the age restraints because among othe r concerns 16 and 17yearold drivers lack experience maturity and have poorer judgment than adults and further that in comparison to adult drivers 16 nd 17yearold minors generally have more accidents per million miles and per driver the department observed based upondata from the national transportation safety board the accident rate per millionmiles for 16 and 17yearold drivers was 127 for 198283 140 for 198384

data may vary so mewhat as they may from one agency to another depending upon methodology but th general pattern appears consistent younger less experienced drivers have relati vely high accident rates where driving on public roads or in other public areas is concerned some have argued the bottom line must be safety the safety of our children and of all of us who travel onpublic thoroughfares 68 the department of labor responding to its mandate from the congress has emphasized the safety factor requiring that where young persons are expected todrive as part of their work obligation that requirement should not be more than occasional and incidental should be st rictly of limited nature and should not be preferred activity others not wholly in disagreement have suggested that the market may provide its own protection it might be argued that employers with expensive equipment and insurance obligations have vested interest in safe driving practices on the part of their staff there are some of my coll eagues who will say that this legislation will endanger teenagers observed representative fawell an active supporter of hr2327 but the fact of the matter is that teens do drive and they are safer whendriving at work with these restrictions than they would be outside of work 69
