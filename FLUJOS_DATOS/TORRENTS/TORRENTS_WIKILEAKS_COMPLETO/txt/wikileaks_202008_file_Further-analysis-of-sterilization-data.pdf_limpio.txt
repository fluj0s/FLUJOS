researchers respond to catholic hospital criticism of sterilization data analysis confirms data and exposes unqualified ethicists at hospitals this analysis continues the initial study of texas inpatient hospital discharge public use data file s regardin g sterilization abortion and contraceptive data from us catholic hospital systems operating in texas 2000 t hrough 2003 see wwwwikileaksorgwiki catholic_hospitals_betray_mission knowledge of the methodology and findings of the initial study is presumed some us catholic h ealthcare systems and the ir individual hospitals have raised llegations against the claim of the initial study that the 9684 cases of patients with v252 diagnostic code represent direct sterilizations forbidden in catholic hosp itals the researchers are accused of inadvertently inflating the numbers or incorrectly labeling permitted sterilizations as prohibited procedures in particular some systems and hospitals insist that the v252 code can be used for pathological cases calling for medically indicated sterilizations and that their ethicists have stated these are indirect sterilization s permitted in catholic hospitals one has provided evidence from the study s database actual clinical practice diagnostic code manual s or catholic ethicists to substantiate these allegations in response to these allegations the researc hers went back to the initial study data to confirm the meaning of the codes the researchers reviewed the actual use made of the codes in the hospital data the laws related to sterilization the use of the codes by medicaid and catholic insurance program s and vatican pr onouncements on sterilization r esearchers found it increasingly difficult to account for how informed catholic health care prof essionals could clinically or ethically suggest that the v252 code represents anything other than call for direct sterilization and found reason to alter the initial findings of the study the evidence seemed to suggest situ ation like the one desc ribed recently by dr john haas of the national catholic bioethic s center namely that prohibited direct sterilizations are taking place nationwide at some catholic hospitals and that this practice is linked to shocking lack of understanding about sterilizations and catholic ethics at catholic hospitals and including the ethicists used by the hospitals see haas interview in our sunday visitor july 13 2008 at wwwosvcomosvnav osvnewsweeklyjuly132008inf ocusshockinglackofunderstandingtabid6388defaultaspx the researchers were unable to find any description of the way ethicists are accredited by the individual hospitals the hospital systems or the catholic church to ensure that their judgments of hospital protocols and practices are actually in accord with catholic belief in the end the researchers faced overwhelming evidence that the personnel from the hospital system s or individual hospital s making good faith claims that v252 can be request for permitted medically indicated or indirect sterilization are under the influence of unqualified ethicists who misidentify direct sterilizations as indirect sterilizations because they are inexplicably ignorant of or knowingly departing from establis hed clinical and catholic practice given the scope and prominence of the hospital systems involved th is would mean as dr haas indicate d national problem not limited in any way to texas given the gravity of this conclusion and its national implica tions for catholic health care the researchers wish to share their review w ith the bishops and the general public v252 diagnosis and accompanying sterilization procedure codes in the study the original study extracted the records of 10792 patients t catholic hospitals from the texas database because of potential violations of the ethical and religious directives for catholic health care services erd authored by the united states conference of catholic bishops in 2 determining potential violations of the erd the study relied on the diagnostic and procedure codes from the icd 9cm international classification of diseases 9th edition clinical modifications classification present in the records icd9cm diagnostic codes are used by physicians h ospitals and allied health wor kers to indicate diagnostic conditions for all patient encounters icd9cm procedure codes are used to identify as specifically as possible surgical and others procedures completed to address the patients diagnostic condit ion these codes are commonly used in c laims to federal state and private insurance programs the original study asserted that the presence of v252 diagnostic code in 9684 records indicated that the accompanying procedure was direct sterilizatio ns prohibited by the erd it is this claim that has been contested by some of the hospitals criticizing the study it is important to note that the original study made assertion regarding the approximately 900 other cases of sterilizing procedures do ne without v252 diagnostic code those cases would have to be reviewed individually and are not considered in the present analysis the icd 9cm describes the v252 diagnostic code as indicating contraceptive management by means of sterilization ad mission for interruption of fallopian tubes or vas deferens the v252 code is contraceptive management diagnosis calling for sterilization procedure not diagnosis of pathology calling for therapeutic procedure because v252 expresses the pati ents choice of means for contraception it requires underlying pathology to justify it ny additional diagnostic codes appearing in an individual patient record therefore refer to the present condition of the patient not to reason for the v252 re quest for sterilization the v252 code is usually entered in the patients chart by the physician and under federal and state regulations an informed consent signed by both the physician and patient is required indicating the entirely voluntary nature f the procedure being requested in the 9684 patient records examined with diagnosis of v252 the accompan ying icd9 cm procedure code is entered by the hospital to describe the proce dures completed for sterilization by interrupting the fallopian tubes or vas deferens of the seven male patients with v252 diagnosis six received vasectomies which are procedures only used for sterilization and in the seventh case sterilization was done by procedure on the spermatic cord the following points from n analysis of the data for the 9677 female patient records containing the v252 code clearly reveals that the purpose of the accompanying procedure is for voluntary direct sterilization not for treatment of an existing pathology see appendix for t able with sample records 1 976 of the cases 9445 of the 96 77 took place in the context of the delivery of live child it should be noted that while tubal procedures for sterilization may also occur in an outpatient setting pregnant women usua lly elect to have the procedure done post partum as matter of convenience of the cases reporting delivery with live childbirth 326 had diagnostic admission code s for normal deliver icd 9cm 650 or previous cesarean delivery icd 9cm 65421 with one or additional diagnostic codes indicating the condition of the mother or child b the other 674 had an admission code plus two or more additional diagnostic codes some were associated with the child such as cord entanglement malposition of the baby and abnormality in fetal heart rate others involved the mother for example hypertension viral or bacterial infections reactions to anesthesia assisted delivery obesity tobacco use drug use advanced age of the 3 mother 35 plus multipar ity given birth two or more times and grand multiparity given birth five times or more these codes are not presented as justifications for the v252 diagnosis but to express the present condition of the patient c 983 of all admissions with live bi rths reported procedure code for bilateral ligation destruction or crushing of the fallopian tubes icd 9cm codes 6621 6622 6629 6631 6632 and 6639 04 reported procedure for unilateral ligation or destruction of fallopian tube icd 9cm code 6692 such procedures are rarely if ever used for treating any pathology 2 24 232 of female patients with the v252 code did not record delivery of live child 110 cases were stillborn deliveries or did not indicate the outcome the remaining 122 sterilizations were done at the same time as another surgical procedure treating an existing pathology for example stress incontinence benign neoplasm of the ovary and tubal or ectopic pregnancy of these 122 sterilizations 13 had d iagnosis of tubal pregnancy icd 9cm 6331 or ectopic pregnancy icd 9cm 6338 and 6339 that was treated by unilateral removal of fallopian tube salpingostomy or destruction of ovary icd 9cm 6662 6602 6525 10 of the tubal and ectopic p regnancy cases had additional procedures for bilateral or unilateral destruction occlusion or ligation of the fallopian tubes or total bilateral salpingectomy icd 9cm codes 6692 6632 6629 6639 signifying that functioning fallopian tubes were i nterrupted in order to achieve the sterilization called for by the v252 diagnostic code 3 it should be noted that codes for procedures which sterilize appear to be absent in small number of the v252 cases less than 075 these may represent coding errors this data indicates that these catholic hospitals have allowed procedures whose direct purpose is to prevent future pregnancy rather than to treat an existing pathology the icd 9cm diagnostic code v252 explicitly states the ceptiv purpose of the accompan ying procedure therefore t he sterilizing procedures accompanying the v252 diagnostic code cannot be correctly interpreted as if they were treatments for pathological diagnosis not only is this clear from the definition of v2 52 in the icd 9cm but also from the use made of the procedure codes in the hospital data over 96 of cases diagnosed with v252 use tubal procedures that rarely if ever have therapeutic use icd 9cm codes 6621 6622 6629 6631 6632 6639 and 6692 in the remai ning cases surgical procedure that might be used to tr eat an existing pathology is employed for sterilization and the v252 code states the pu rpose is in fact contraceptive when diagnostic code for existing patho logy such as stress incontinence appear s in addition to the v252 code the patient receives both treatment for the pathology and sterilization procedure in accord with the v252 request all these sterilizations called for by the v252 code therefore have b een done to avoid future pregnancy and are direct sterilizations prohibited by the erd not indirect sterilizations arising from the treatment of existing pathologies the meaning and use of the v252 code and related sterilization procedural codes can be verified not only from the codes themselves and the actual use made of them by the hospitals in the study but by considering how medicaid and catholic i nsurance program s interpret and use the codes 4 v252 diagnosis and sterilization procedure codes in medicaid and catholic insurance federal law governing medicaid reimbursement defines sterilization as any medical procedure treatment or operation for the purpose of rendering an individual permanently incapable of reproducing title 42 cod of fede ral regu lations 441251 subpart f such procedure requires informed consent and that consent in turn requires providing the patient description of available alternative methods of family planning and birth control 44127 ii thus the federa l government recognizes that sterilization that is purposefully rendering patient permanently incapable of reproducing is voluntary act whose effect of avoiding pregnancy can be obtained by alternate means sterilization is not considered medically necessary by medicaid californias medicaid program medi cal explicitly notes that under the regulations human reproductive sterilization is defined as any medical treatment procedure or operation for the purpose of rendering an individual permane ntly incapable of reproducing sterilizations which are performed because pregnancy would be life threatening to the mother so called therapeutic sterilizations are included in this definition httpfilesmedi calcagovpubsdocopublications mast ersmtppart2ster_m00i00o03doc page 1 medi cal is correct in noting the later situation is included in the definition of sterilization because danger fro m future pregnancy does not ter the fact that the proposed procedure has the purpose of re ndering an individual permanently incapable of reproducing medi cal acknowledges that the v252 code is exclusively request for sterilization procedure for example when discussing particular sterilization procedure the essure system medi cal states that the procedure will only be covered for sterilization purposes not for experimental uses and therefore will only be reimbursed when billed in conjunction with icd 9 cm diagnosis code v252 sterilization page 21 22 when discussing medicaid reimbursement for procedures medi cal notes sterilization consent form pm 330 i s required for claims submitted for sterilization services claims submitted with any of the following cpt 4hcpcs or icd 9cm procedure codes that are not accompanied by sterilization consent form will be denied icd9cm volume 3 procedure codes 6370 6371 6372 6373 6621 6622 6629 6631 6632 6639 6651 6652 or 6663 page 25 26 in other words these codes are interpreted as steriliza tions that require consent and not as treatment of present pathology medi cal acknowledges that some of the procedural codes requiring sterilization consent form can be used for purposes other than rendering person permanently incapable of reproducin g when not used for the purpose of sterilization these procedures do not require consent form but at least one of the following must be recorded with the claim quoted from page 26 the surgery was unilateral procedure and did not result in ster ilization the surgery was unilateral or bilateral but the patient was previously sterile on signed attachment to the claim the physician must explain the cause of the sterility the procedure was not elective and was done for an acute condition the medi cal protocols based in icd 9cm codes would seem to parallel the requirements of the erd regarding the identification of direct sterilization for contraceptive purpos and 5 distinguishing it from sterilization arising indirectly from medical pr ocedu re treating present ie acute pathology insurance programs operating under t he erd also recognize that particular icd 9cm codes including v252

wwwsuburbanhealthcomphysicianservicesmaterialssho_catholic_directive_l istpdf vatican and erd statements on direct sterilization as demonstrated above the meaning and use of the v252 code indicates request for direct sterilization this is not matter of opinion of the researchers but is established clinical practi ce some catholic ethicists have tried for decades to assert that these types of sterilizations can in some circumstances be considered medically indicated or indirect but the ca tholic church has insisted that their opinions are false and may not be used at catholic hospitals the vatican pronounced this judgment in reference to us catholic hospitals in 1975 reaffirmed it in 1993 nd the pope reiterated it to us bishops in 1998 these direct statements of the vatican regarding the american situation pro vide context for understanding the current erd against direct sterilization erd 53 the 1975 statement quaecumque sterilizatio was issued by the vatican in defense of proper interpretation and implementation of 71 of the us bishops 1971 ver sion of the erd in response to efforts of catholic ethicists seeking to permit sterilizations to prevent future dangerous pregnancy see origins 10 197633 35 these ethicis ts sought to justify so called therapeutic or preventative sterilizations by app ealing to concepts such as the totality of the person by which sterilization of reproductive organs would be in accord with the totality of the patients well being the vatican affirmed the prohibition against direct sterilization in 71 of the directives and exposed the therapeutic preventative sterilization as nothing other than prohibited direct sterilization it noted that the official approbation of direct sterilization and fortiori its management and execution in accord with ho spital regulations is matter which in the objective order is by its very nature or intrinsically evil the document explicitly cautioned that the vatican is aware that many theologians dissent from it ie the teaching on direct sterilization but denies that this fact as such has any doctrinal significance as though it were theological source w hich the faithful might invoke in justifying such sterilizations in 1993 the vatican returned to the issue because ethicists in the united states were still trying to permit sterilizations as means of avoiding the danger of fu ture pregnancy by calling them uterine isolations the vaticans responses to questions proposed concerning uterine isolation and related matters provides precise t reatment of the distinction between direct sterilization and medical treatments that indirectly result in sterilization it is worth presenting in its entirety q 1when the uterus becomes so seriously injured eg during delivery or caesarian sect ion so as to render medically indicated even its total removal 6 hysterectomy in order to counter an immediate serious threat to the life or health of the mother is it licit to perform such procedure notwithstanding the permanent sterility which will r esult for the woman r affirmative q 2when the uterus eg as result of previous caesarian sections is in state such that while not constituting in itself present risk to the life or health of the woman nevertheless is for eseably incapable f carrying future pregnancy to term without danger to the mother danger which in some cases could be serious is it licit to remove the uterus hysterectomy in order to prevent possible future danger deriving from conception r negative q 3in th same situation as in 2 is it licit to substitute tubal ligation also called uterine isolation for the hysterectomy since the same end would be attained of averting the risks of possible pregnancy by means of procedure which is much simpler for the doctor and less serious for the woman and since in addition in some cases the ensuing sterility might be reversible r negative explanation in the first case the hysterectomy is licit because it has directly therapeutic character even tho ugh it may be foreseen that permanent sterility will result in fact it is the pathological condition of the uterus eg hemorrhage which cannot be stopped by other means which makes its removal medically indicated the removal of the organ has as its aim therefore the curtailing of serious present danger to the woman independent of possible future pregnancy from the moral point of view the cases of hysterectomy and uterine isolation in the circumstances described in 2 and 3 are diffe rent these fall into the moral category of direct sterilization which in the congregation of the doctrine of the faiths document quaecumque sterilizatio aas lxviii 1976 738 740 1 is defined as an action whose sole immediate effect is to render the generative faculty incapable of procreation and the same document continues it direct sterilization is absolutely forbidden according to the teaching of the church even when it is motivated by subjectively right intention of curing or prev enting physical or psychological ill effect which is foreseen or feared as result of pregnancy in point of fact the uterus as described in 2 does not constitute in and of itself any present danger to the woman indeed the proposal to substitute uterine isolation for hysterectomy under the same conditions shows precisely that the uterus in and of itself does not pose pathological problem for the woman therefore the described procedures do not have properly therapeutic character but are aim ed in themselves at rendering sterile future sexual acts freely chosen the end of avoiding risks to the mother deriving from possible pregnancy is thus pursued by means of direct sterilization in itself always morally illicit while other ways whi ch are morally licit remain open to free choice the contrary opinion which considers the interventions described in 2 and 3 as indirect 7 sterilizations licit under certain conditions cannot be regarded as valid and may not be followed in catholic h ospitals emphasis added the closing remark of the response similar to the caution in quaecumque sterilizatio is noteworthy the vatican was aw are that dissenting theologians were being invoked to permit direct sterilizations and deemed it necessary not only to reaffirm the true teaching and expose the errors but to warn catholics and catholic hospitals against following the false theories in 1998 pope john paul ii addressed the bishops of texas oklahoma and arkansas during their every fifthyear meeting with him while speaking on the role of bishops as moral teachers he took the occasion to speak of conscience dissent and catholic hospital practice including sterilization as bishops you have to teach that freedom of conscience is never fr eedom from the truth but always and only freedom in the truth this understanding of conscience and its relationship to freedom should clarify certain aspects of the question of dissent from church teaching by the will of christ himself and the life givin g power of the holy spirit the church is preserved in the truth and it is her duty to give utterance to and authoritatively to teach that truth which is christ himself and to declare and confirm by her authority those principles of the moral order whi ch have their origin in human nature itself dignitatis humanae 14 when the church teaches for example that abortion sterilization or euthanasia are always morally inadmissible she is giving expression to the universal moral law inscribed on the hu man heart and is therefore teaching something which is binding on everyones conscience her absolute prohibition that such procedures be carried out in catholic health care facilities is simply an act of fidelity to gods law as bishops you must remind everyone involved hospital administrations and medical personnel that any failure to comply with this prohibition is both grevious and source of scandal for sterilizations cf congregation for the doctrine of the faith quaecumque sterilizatio march 13 1975 aas 1976 738 740 this and other such instances are not it must be emphasized the imposition of an external set of criteria in violation of human freedom rather the churchs teaching of moral truth brings to light the truths which conscience ought already to possess veritatis splendor 64 and it is these truths which make us free in the deepest meaning of human freedom and give our humanity its genuine nobility evidently the vatican has been aware for over 30 years that d issenting ethicists were presenting false theories justifying what were in fact direct sterilizations and has sought to support the us bishops in proclaiming the truth and ensuring that human dignity is promoted at catholic hospitals in 2001 the us bish ops issued the fourth edition of the erd and left unchanged the longstanding prohibition against direct sterilization 53 direct sterilization of either men or women whether permanent or temporary is not permitted in catholic health care institution procedures that induce sterility are permitted when their direct effect is the cure or 8 alleviation of present and serious pathology and simpler treatment is not available footnote references the 1993 response on uterine isolation note that the sole cri teria in erd 53 for permitting procedures that can result in sterility is the presence of present and serious pathology for which simpler treatment is available the v252 diagnostic code expresses existing pathology and moreover is an explicit call for contraceptive sterilization as such the sterilization procedure given in response to v252 diagnostic request is clear and certain violation of erd 53 why some catholic hospitals insist that v252 diagnosis can include med ically indicated indirect sterilization the icd 9cm definition of the v252 code its use in the hospital records the definition of sterilization in the federal medicaid regulations the use of the v252 code by medic cal and sho the vatican statements of 1975 1993 and 1998 as well as the 2001 erd are in complete agreement that request for procedure intended to render person permanently incapable of reproduction is voluntary sterilization not medically necessary procedure regardless of the reason why person intends to avoid pregnancy clin ically the requested procedure is called sterilization and the erd call it direct sterilization clinical practice and the erd take into accou nt that some procedures that result in sterilization ca n be used to treat present pathologies and distinguish these procedures from sterilizations this distinction is indicated in the icd 9cm by the v252 code not being used in such pathological cases in medi cal by noting non contraceptive purpose throu gh establishing pathological treatment and in the erd by allowing procedures that result in sterilization when simpler treatment exists for present pathology clinically and in the erd these procedures are not calle d sterilizations but simply procedures for an existing pathology in some documents of the catholic ch urch these procedures are said to be or to result in indirect sterilization because the direct purpose and effect of the procedure is the treatment of an existing pathology catholic hospitals would therefore seem to be without any clinical or ethical basis for deny ing that the v252 code request s direct sterilization or for insisting that it can be used to request medically indicated indirect sterilization permitted by t he erd when in fact it represents existing pathology yet in response to the study of catholic hospital data in texas some catholic hospital systems and individual hospitals have made exactly these claim s and have attempted to discredit the integrit of t he researchers data analysis their knowledge of the icd 9 cm codes andor their understanding of direct sterilization in the erd what would cause the hospitals to do this first this should surprise one familiar with catholic medical ethics if the vatican in 1975 and 1993 had to identify and condemn various theories by catholic ethicists in the united states who were permitting direct sterilizations under different name then there is evidently long established practice by s ome catholi c ethicists to refuse to accept the judgment of the c atholic church why the ethicists would want to justify direct sterilizations by renaming them therapeutic medically indicated medically necessary uterine isolations or indirect steriliza tions would be matter of speculation that they have continually made such attempts is an established fact documented in two vatican statements issued in the last 33 years the 1998 remarks of the pope indicate that the vatican remained concerned that catholic hospitals were following the counsel of dissenting ethicists despite previous warnings and that as result direct sterilizations continued 9 these ethicists decades long persistence means that they are either unaccountably ignorant of clinica l practice as well as catholic teaching or they are determined to invent way to permit what is known to be prohibited under the erd for example doggedly refusing to call direct sterilizations what they are creating n ew phrases to describe them using old phrases in novel ways or employing new ethical theories that render the concept of direct sterilization meaningless would be ways to avoid id entifying these procedures as prohibited under the erd people not familiar with the erd clinical practic or the details of catholic theology w ho were taught by these ethicists w ould have reason to believe the erd prohibit the procedures they could then in good faith but erroneously maintain that they were complying with the erd this seems to be what is happening larger issue made evident by the hospital data in the study and by the insistence of some hospital systems and individual hospitals that v252 is not call for direct sterilization but can be used to call for sterilization procedure s that are permitted by the erd is that these catholic institution s evidently continue to employ ethicists who provide ignorant or dissenting guidance like the ethicists they hire some of the leadership at the hospital systems and within the sponsoring religious communities must be either unaccountably ignorant or willfully determined to permit what is prohibited at the highest levels of catholic healthcare in the united states representing annual revenues and assets totaling tens of billions of doll ars and enormous professional competence ignorance cannot be the explanation for everyone the systems and the religious communities either have effective oversight of the drafting and implementation of individual hospital protocols and so are unaware of what the ethicists are permitting or among the leadership there are some who concur with the discredited ethicists certainly local administrators doctors and staff at these hospitals know that voluntary sterilizations have taken place even if on ly to prevent potentially dangerous future pregnancy this explains why they have entered the v252 diagnostic request and the various procedural codes for sterilization into the patients records and reported them to the state of texas it also explai ns the likely fact that they have obeyed the law and obtained and filed informed consent documents for these voluntary sterilizations apparently however someone has misled them into believing that these types of direct sterilizations are considered per missible ind irect sterilizations by the erd some of the confusion for the medical personnel at catholic hospitals may also arise from distinctio n sometimes found in secular medical ethics literature between therapeutic or medically indicated ste rilization done to prevent unwanted impact on the healthlife of mother or child in future pregnancy and an elective sterilization done for other reasons such language is imprecise and can be misleading to those not familiar with the clinical and ethical issues the procedure is not therapeutic because it treats exist ing pathology and actually damages the patients reproductive system clinically speaking there may be medical indications suggesting that woman avoid future pregnancy but t he specific means by which she avoids pregnancy is not medically indicated since there are variety of means that would achieve the same purpose ie abstinence natural family planning contraception vasectomy of her partner sterilization choo sing to av oid pregnancy by sterilization for whatever reason is an ethical decision not mandated by medical condition this is why in part federal regulations require those receiving sterilization to be told how other means of birth control might be u sed in place of permanent sterilization ethical decisions at catholic hospitals are to be made in accord with human dignity and the gospel in harmony with the erd this is why the erd mandate that all doctors and staff 10 be educat ed about the erd and agree to use them as the ethical standard for all care given at the catholic hospital but these mandates are meaningless if the hospital ethicist explaining the erd is making judgments not rooted in solid knowledge and acceptance of catholic belief and prac tice by allowing so called medically indicated sterilizations the hospitals are allowing the subjective ethical judgment of the doctor and patient to appear as an objective clinical necessity rendering steri lization indirect under the erd when in fact it is voluntary procedure and direct sterilization the catholic hospitals could avoid subjective and misleading criteria such as medically indicated by using objective clinical criteria such as the icd 9cm codes as found for example in m edicals manual and sho s catholic directive list direct sterilization could then be readily and accurately distinguished from indirect sterilization the codes would allow the hospital protocols to be directly linked to the coding used for hospital billing and the state data base this would minimize confusion and facilitate implementing and auditing h ospital compliance with the erd it would also allow hospital protocols across the united states to employ common set of criteria closing appeal the researchers have placed their analysis and ration ale before the bishops and the general public we will publicly correct any mistaken representations of the data found in our study the researchers invit the catholic hospital systems and individual hospitals making accusations against the integrity of the data or speculating on how the data has allegedly been clinically or ethically misinterpreted by the researchers to undertake more constructive and open discussion of the public data we request that they 1 provide the public with the hospital protocols for procedures proh ibited under the erd as well as the name of the ethicists and officers of the hospital system who approved them these protocols involve nothing confidential or secret and re known to all hospital employees there is reason to prevent the public from being able to evaluate them in light of the catholic directives if the policies are in accord with the erd this will be clear to everyone 2 describe the oversight mech anisms by which the hospital systems ensure that the protocols and education at individual hospitals represent the erd as interpreted by ethicists in accord with catholic belief and practice this should include description of the criteria used in selec ting the ethicists and establishing that their judgments are formed by accurate clinical knowledge and acceptance of catholic teaching 3 acknowl edge or deny the data in the study if denying then provide examples from the study in which the codes have been fabricated or miscounted 4 demonstrate from clinical manuals and actual practice that the v252 diagnostic code or any other codes are legitimately used in fashion other than claimed by the researchers the hospital systems and individual hosp itals have long history of avoiding public disclosures regarding their practices and protocols they tend to answer all questions by stating they work in conjunction with the local bishop and in accord with the erd under the present circumstance s their assurance that they are following the erd is of little value since the assurance depends entirely on the accuracy of their understanding of the erd which is better than their ethicists 11 appendix samples of actual
