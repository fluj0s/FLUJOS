reductions to take effect in fiscal 2007 according to the conference report nsmias intent was to reduce over time the fees collected by the sec and to ensure that at the end of the applicable 10 year

lowering the fees was based on considerations of fairness since the fees were enacted to fund the sec supporte rs of fee reduction argued that securities market participants should be expected to pay the cost of federal re gulation of the market but not more in this view the surplus over the sec budget is an unwarranted tax on capital formation and savings us er fees have become taxes that lower investment returns and subtract from business spending on ne w productive capacity and jobs opposition to fee reduction was based on gene ral fiscal principles the clinton administration opposed fee reduction legislation in the 106th congress5 on the grounds that there were higher budgetary priorities than lowering fees paid by investors and the securities industry congressional action to reduce

to raise salaries for certain of its employees to the levels of federal bank examiners whose pay exceeds the normal civil service scale by considerable margin the law directs the sec to consult with the bank regulators to ensure that this pay parity is maintained the sec has argued that pay parity is necessary to allow it to attract and retain qualified personnel the agency complains that it suffers from very high rate of employee turnover because of the high sala ries available in the securities industry the office of personnel management pm opposed the pay parity provisions because of concerns about the fragmentation of personnel systems nd adverse effects on the portability of federal employees in may 15 2001 letter to chairman dan burton of the house government reform committee op m noted that in march 2001 it approved special pay rates for sec lawyers accountan ts and examiners the letter recommended that the pay parity provisions not be enacted until the effectiveness of these special pay rates can be assessed nd also called for more study of the sec pay situation chairman burton stated that the sec pay raises should not be enacted without broad review of the effects on the civil service systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20204crs5 latest developments estimates of the cost of granting pay parity raises to sec employees are in the range of 6080 million the senate
