authority over national bank activities to the exclusion of state authority except as specifically authorized by federal law3 included in the preemption regulations are prohibitions on certain types of predatory lending in connection with consumer loans offered by national banks in promulgating the regulations occ expressed its commitment to take enforcement actions against national banks engaging in abusive lending practices4 these regulations come in the wake of state legislative and enforcement activity to combat predatory lending and other abusive practices impacting consumers5 heavily regulated financial institutions such as national banks have not been the primary target of state predatory lending laws state ba nking regulators howev er have expressed concern that preemption of state laws by fe deral banking regulators may dilute consumer protections under state law they have also criticized preemption as harmful to the dual banking system under which every bank whethe r statechartered or federally chartered is subject to both federal and state law with primary regula tion dependent upon the authority under which the bank is ch artered state attorneys general6 and consumer groups have also opposed preemption of state laws by federal regulators7 on the other hand banking trade associations seem to view occs preemption regulations as comporting with healthy dual banking syst em presumably because of the resulting sharpening of distinctions between statechartered and national banks and the possibility of some banks electing to switch charters under the dual banking system banks either new banks or those in operation may choose federal or state charter or convert from one charter to nother and thereby from one pr imary regulator to another the national association of realtors in testimony before the house financial services subcommittee on oversight and investiga tions on january 28 2004 sharply criticized the preemption rules as twisting legal preceden t maximizing the valu of the federal bank charter at the expense of the state bank char ter and diluting cons umer protections with worsening implications if bankers are permitted to be real estate brokers and managers8 the courts have been receptive to occs preemption efforts the exclusivity of occs authority to police the credit card practices of national banks

state banking co mmissioner was therefore preempted from requiring an audit of the mortgage loans ma by that subsidiary occ regulation 12 cfr 74006 provides that state laws and regulations apply to national bank operating subsidiaries to the same extent as they apply to national banks10 the court found that occ had authority under the nati onal bank act to promulgate the regulation and that the regulation was reasonable in terpretation of legislation preemption standard although national banks are ch artered by the federal gove rnment much of their daily activity is determined by state law as with any other business operating in state national banks are federal instrumentalities charte red to perform functions relating to among other things the national economy the pub lic debt federal dis bursements and the payment system federalism involves balanc ing federal and state authority over such entities as national banks the supremacy clau of the us constitution art vi cl 2 declares that the constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding this means that congress may override c onflicting state laws by exercisi ng any of its delegated powers when congress has preempted state law that law is unenforceable such was the ruling in mccullough v maryland 17 us 4 wheat 316 435 1819 which declared state law taxing notes issued by the first bank of the united states to be void the starting point for preemption analysis is the language of the federal legislation if congress under one of its delegated powers has enacted statute that includes an explicit statement that state law is preempted the supreme court will generally give effect to that legislative intent wisconsin public intervenor v mortier 501 us 597 605 1991 where there is language of preemption the court is likely to find preemption when it identifies direct conflict between the federal law and the state law or when it concludes that the federal government has so occ upied the field as to preclude enforcement of state law with respect to the subject at hand generally the federal courts have read congressional grants of power to national banks as presumptively preemptive in reaching such conclusion about federal statute granting national banks power to sell insurance from offices in towns with popula tions of not more than 5000 the supreme court stated in defining the preemptive scope of st atutes and regulations granting power to national banks these cases take the vi ew that normally congress would not want states to forbid or impair significantly the exercise of power that congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22057crs4

or significantly interfere with the national banks exercise of its powers11 under the barnett standard states may not enact laws that forbid or impair significantly or prevent or significantly interfere with nationa l banks granted power earlier cases dealing with the same issue in various contexts adopted varying formulations of the test of whether or not there was preem ption of particular state law with respect to national banks specifics of occs pr eemption regulations although the barnett standard forms the basis of occs preemption analysis the standard that occ employs draws from other supreme court decisions to arrive at what may be broader standard than formulated in barnett under occs interpretation where there is federal statute delineating how state law is to be applied to national banks in particular circumstance state law would be applicable onl if it is not altering or conditioning national banks ability to exercise power that federal law grants to it the occ regulations cover real estate nding deposittaking and other lending and specify that state laws that obstruct impair or condition national banks ability to fully exercise the power in question
