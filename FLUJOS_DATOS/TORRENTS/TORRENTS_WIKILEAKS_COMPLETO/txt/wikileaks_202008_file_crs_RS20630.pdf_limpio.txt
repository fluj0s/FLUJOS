senators thomas carper and tom coburn the bill would require the director of the office of management and budget to tablish fiveyear pilot program to speed the disposal of surplus or underutilized federal real prope rties the bill would authorize the omb director to select federal properties to partic ipate in the program it would authorize the expedited sale of those properties for cash at not

disposal pilot program would not be subject to gsa requirements and procedures fo r public benefits conveyance an agency that sold surplus property th rough the expedited disposal process would receive reimbursement for any administrative costs incurred through the sale of the property in addition s 1667 would authoriz that 20 of the balance of any proceeds received by the disposal of surplus property would be deposited into that agencys account the remaining 80 of the proceeds would be deposited into the us treasury as miscellaneous receipts on june 20 2007 the legislation was referred to the senate committee on homeland security and governme ntal affairs on november 14 2007 the committee approved by voice vote an amendment that would include provision to allow for nocost conveyance of surplus fe deral property to homeless assistance groups s 1667 as amended was ordered to be reported favorably by the co mmittee on november 14 2007 the bill was reported14 and placed on the senate legislative calendar under general orders c alendar 631 on april 7 2008 hr 5787 according to gao agencies are limited in their ability to bear the costs of preparing properties to be declared exce ss and surplus and subsequently disposed of15 one reason for this is that under current law net proceeds of the sale of surplus federal real property are placed in fund in the tr easury and are not available to the selling agency on april 14 2008 however representatives moore and duncan introduced hr 5787 the federal real property disposal act to allow federal agencies to retain the net proceeds of the sale of their surplus r eal and related personal property this would help them to cover the costs of preparing the property for disposal the bill would also authorize gsa to assist agencies in preparing properties to be reported excess and further authorize gsa to dis pose of property that has reve rted back to the federal government from previous sales16 on may 15 2008 the house committee on oversight and government reform favorably reported hr 5787 as amended17 on may 22 2008 the house agreed to the bill and sent it to the senate
