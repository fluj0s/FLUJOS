included an estate tax gift tax and generation skipping tax the estate and gift transfer taxes have been part of the federal revenue system off and on since the earliest days of the united states the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 provided for phaseout of the estate and generation skipping taxes over 10year period leaving the gift tax as the only federal transfer tax it is important to note that as structured in this act the repeal of the estate and generationskipping taxes is not permanent unless revised these taxes are to be reinstated at 2001 levels in 2011 two primary categories of legislation pertaining to transfer taxes may be expected to be introduced in the 111 th congress as noted above the repeal of the estate and generationskipping taxes is not permanent one category would ma ke the repeal permanent the second would reinstate these taxes at lower rates andor in manner more considerate of familyowned business in this report the

death tax and the controversies surrounding such taxes have ancient roots there is evidence of 10 percent tax on transfers of property at death in ancient egypt as early as 700 bc1 later the greeks and romans adopted death taxes critics of such taxes may trace their grievances at least to pliny the younger who charged that death tax was an unnatural tax augmenting the grief and sorrow of the bereaved2 the gift tax has developed as necessary concomitant to the death tax because the easiest way to escape tax on the gratuitous transfer of property at death is to divest oneself of the property during life the impact of either tax alone would be diminished by the escape offered by the alternate transfer3 starting in 1976 congress almost completely restructured the federal transfer tax system the estate and gift taxes were unified the scope of these taxes was changed in terms of size of estates affected perceived loopholes of major importa nce were closed or narrowed certain groups previously thought to have suffered excessive tax burdens were afforded relief new tax the generationskipping transfer tax was added to supplement these two other transfer taxes the enactment of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 20014 begins movement away from the use of transfer taxes this act phases out the estate and generation skipping taxes over ten year period leaving the gift tax as the only federal transfer tax the repeal of the estate tax would leave the united states without federal estate tax for the first time since 1916 this report details the

prior to 1916 the united states did not make regular use of death and gift taxes the federal government turned to them only in time of extraordinary revenue demands such as wartime although individual states used them extensively g22g145g142g561g6g142g138g157g145g561g21g157g138g150g153g561g22g138g161g497g561g343g349g350g351g556g343g350g342g344g561 the federal experience with death taxes began in the eighteenth century when strained trade relations with france necessitated development of strong naval force in 1794 special revenue committee of the house of representatives recommended that system of stamp duties be adopted to meet the resultant revenue needs the recommended duties included tax on inventories of the effects of deceased persons ten cents on receipts for legacies or shares of personal estate where the sum is above 50 and not exceeding 100 twentyfive cents more than 100 and not exceeding 500 fifty cents for every further sum above 500 dollar not to extend to wives children or grandchildren on probates of wills and letters of administration fifty cents 6 in 1796 the house committee on ways and means reported to congress bill to adopt such tax7 and the tax was enacted in 1797 the stamp act of july 6 17978 required the use of federal stamps on receipts and discharges from legacies and intestate shares and levied charge for the purchase of the required stamps the rate structure recommended by the special revenue committee in 1794 was adopted along with exemptions for distributions to wife but not husband or child or grandchild 9 the stamp tax continued in force until 1802 when it was repealed10 for the next 60 years the federal tax structure endured without any form of death tax

important in the development of the federal estate and gift tax system the revenue act of 1862 introduced the first federal gift tax and included number of features which have become important parts of the present federal estate gift and generationskipping tax laws including taxation of certain lifetime transfers of testamentary character and exemption of 6 1 american state papers in finance 277

the first time special treatment of charitable transfers11 the use of federal death tax was revived in 1862 to meet the revenue demands of the civil war12 the 1862 levy like its predecessor taxed legacies and distributive shares of personal property but unlike its predecessor it was not documentary stamp tax but an inheritance tax tax imposed upon individuals who receive property from decedent upon the privilege of inheriting the property 13 the amount of the 1862 tax was as is typical of inheritance taxes graduated according to the closeness of the familial relationship between the decedent and the beneficiary the rates ranged from 075 percent for distributions to ancestors lineal descendants and siblings to 5 percent for distributions to distant relations and unrelated persons the tax was imposed only on personal estates in excess of 1000 bequests to surviving spouses were entirely exempt from tax gifts intended to take effect at the donors death or thereafter were included in the donors estate for tax purposes war revenue needs prompted congress to increase the rates of tax on inheritances in 1864 and to impose succession tax on the receipt of real property by devise the succession tax applied both to devises of real property and to transfers for inadequate consideration though transfers in consideration of marriage were regarded as transfers for adequate consideration widows though not widowers were exempt from the succession tax and charitable transfers of real estate were expressly taxed at the highest rate 14 in 1866 congress responded to pleas of the special commissioner of the revenue and tightened enforcement of the legacy and succession taxes penalty of up to 1000 was imposed on executors and administrators who failed to fu rnish the required statements or filed false statements15 the legacy and succession taxes were repealed in 1870 when the need for their additional revenues had ceased16 four years later the united states supreme court held in scholey v rew17 that the legacy and succession taxes had been constitutionally imposed 11 during consideration of the 1862 tax representative william payne sheffield of rhode island argued unsu ccessfully for special treatment of charitable bequests in debates on the floor of the house of representatives congressman sheffield stated it seems to proper for the national legislature to give encouragement to making of this class of devises for charitable and literary purposes there are great many of them mademade to poor churches and made for the purpose of building schools and colleges the government has frequently aided such institutions by grants of land and it seems to to be in harmony with the previous policy of our legislature to adopt provision of this character cong globe 37 th cong 2nd sess 1534 1862 12 act of july 1 1862 12 stat 432 483 13 an inheritance tax may be distinguished from an estate tax such as the tax presently imposed by the federal

were direct taxes which under the united states constitution must be apportioned according to the census18 the court disagreed stating that taxes on lands houses and other permanent real estate have always been deemed to be direct taxes and capitation taxes by the express words of the constitution are within the same category but it never has been decided that any other legal exactions for the support of the federal government fall within the condition that unless laid in proportion to the numbers that the assessment is invalid whether direct taxes in the sense of the constitution comprehends any other tax than capitation tax and tax on land is question not absolutely decided nor is it necessary to determine it in the present case as it is expressly decided that the term does not include the tax on income which cannot be distinguished in principle from succession tax such as the one in the present controversy 19

was not in technical sense death or gift tax but it did treat gifts and inheritances as income and tax them as such20 the tax was shortlived as the united states supreme court ruled it unconstitutional in 1895 in pollock v farmers loan and trust company 21 the court found that to the extent the 1894 income tax was imposed on the gains from real estate it so burdened the real estate as to constitute direct tax which had to be apportioned among the states according to the ce nsus the court struck down the entire statute because it found that elimination of only the tax on real

178 us 41 it has to be that the united states has power to tax legacies but it is said that this tax is cast upon transfer while it is being effectuated by the state itself and therefore is an intrusion upon its processes whereas legacy tax is not imposed until the process is complete an analogy is sought in the difference between the attempt of state to tax commerce among the states and its right after the goods have become mingled with the general stock in the state consideration of the parallel is enough to detect the fallacy tax that was directed solely against goods imported into the state and that was determined by the fact of importation would be better after the goods were at rest in the state than before it would be as much an interference with commerce in one case as in the other conversely if tax on the property distributed by the laws of state determined by the fact that distribution has been accomplished is valid tax determined by the fact that distribution is about to begin is greater interference and is equally good 30 g20g138g157g142g561g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g156g497g561g343g351g343g349g561 the revenue demands of defense preparations prompted

the conclusion of world war i prompted debates over the continued existence of the estate tax the house of representatives approved rate in 191833 but the senate sought instead to replace the estate tax with an inheritance tax the revenue act of 191834 reflected compromise between the views of the house and senate retaining the estate tax but cutting the rates on estates of less than 1000000 the 1918 law also expanded the estate tax base by including the value of surviving spouses dower or curtesy right in the decedents estate and the proceeds over 40000 of life insurance policies on the decedents life if they were receivable by the executor or the estate the 1918 act also included in the gross estate the value of any property subject to general power of appointment held by the decedent whether exercised in the decedents will or exercised during the decedents life in contemplation of death 35 charitable contributions were deductible in computing the taxable estate the estate tax remained unchanged until 1924 when congress again increased the estate tax rates to top rate of 40 percent on net estates over 10000000 made certain adjustments to the estate tax base and added gift tax36 the estate tax base was increased by adding the value of property which decedent transferred during life but over which the decedent retained the power to alter amend or revoke the beneficial enjoyment provision was also made for allocating to the estate portion of the value of concurrently owned property acquired by decedent and surviving joint owner by gift or inheritance in which case there would be relative contributions also credit against the federal estate tax was allowed for state death taxes up to total of 25 percent of the federal tax liability the revenue act of 1924 also added gift tax with the same rate schedule as the estate tax lifetime exclusion of 50000 and an annual exclusion of 500 per donee were both allowed neither charitable contributions nor gifts of property which the donor had received by gift or inheritance within the past five years were subject to gift tax stiff opposition to the estate and gift taxes increased during the mid1920s and in 1926 the gift tax and many of the estate tax rate increases were repealed 37 the 1926 act created an estate tax rate range from 1 percent on net estates under 50000 to 20 percent on net estates above 10000000 the estate tax exemption was increased from 50000 to 100000 and the maximum credit for state death taxes was increased from 25 percent to 80 percent of the federal estate tax liability 33 see

act of 1932 39 increased the estate tax rates at virtually every level added two new rate brackets and reduced the estate tax exemption to its 1924 level of 50000 the resultant estate tax had rates graduated from 1 percent on net estates up to 100000 to 45 percent on net estates above 10000000 the 1932 act also reintroduced federal gift tax but with rates set at threequarters of the estate tax rates level maintained until 1976 the lifetime gift tax exclusion was set at 50000 and the annual exclusion at 5000 per donee tax was imposed on charitable gifts the gift tax was and continues to be

50000 in specific year the donor with the greater amount of lifetime taxable gifts after 1932 would pay the higher tax on the present transfer between 1934 and 1942 social policies and wartime demands led to series of estate and gift tax rate increases though the gift tax rates continued to be maintained at threequarters of the estate tax rates the revenue act of 1934 raised the maximum estate tax rate to 60 percent on net estate over 10000000 40 and the revenue act of 1935 further raised it to 70 percent on net estates over 5000000041 the 1935 act also reduced the estate and gift tax lifetime exemptions to 40000 each the outbreak of world war ii in europe raised c ongressional concern over the state of american military preparedness and prompted an increase in the estate and gift taxes to provide additional revenue the revenue act of 1940 added 10 percent surtax to the income estate and gift taxes 42 the revenue act of 1941 increased the estate and gift tax rates even further producing

the basic estate and gift tax exemptions were altered again by the revenue act of 194244 which created 60000 estate tax exemption 30000 lifetime gift tax exclusion and 3000 annual per donee gift tax exclusion the 1942 act also increased the estate tax base by including in decedents gross estate the proceeds of any life insurance policy on the decedents life if either the proceeds were payable to or for the benefit of the estate or the decedent had paid the premiums on the policy the 1942 act also attempted to correct the perceived inequity in estate and gift taxation between residents of community property states and noncommunity property states 45 property owned concurrently by decedent and surviving spouse in noncommunity property state was excluded from the decedents gross estate only to the extent it could be shown that the surviving spouse contributed to the acquisition cost in community property state however onehalf of all property acquired by either spouse during their marriage belonged to each spouse by operation of law on the death of either spouse only onehal f of the community property would be subject to estate taxes46 this resulted in the automatic equalization of the estates of spouses residing in community property states and lower total estate tax burden congress attempted to resolve this problem by treating community property like it treated concurrently owned property in noncommunity property state community property was included in decedents gross estate except to the extent that the surviving spouse could be shown to have contributed to the acquisition cost this solution deemed complex and unsuccessful was replaced in the revenue act of 1948 47 by the estate and gift tax marital deductions and the rules on splitgifts the estate tax marital deduction permitted decedents estate to deduct the value of all property passing to surviving spouse whether passing under the will or otherwise under the 1948 act the maximum deduction was onehalf of the decedents adjusted gross estate the gross estate less debts taxes and administration expenses community property however was ineligible for the estate tax marital deduction thereby equalizing the tax treatment of estates of residents of community property states and noncommunity property states the gift tax marital deduction allowed donor to deduct onehalf of an interspousal gift other than community property to third person concomitantly the split gift rule allowed the non donor spouse to elect to be treated as having made gift of onehalf the total transfer this election was to be made on the gift tax return and use of two annual exclusions on gifts by spouse to third person was permitted 44 act of october 21 1942 56 stat 798 45 under community property laws the

graduated rate of tax imposed on both lifetime gifts and testamentary dispositions the gift tax remained cumulative so that the rate of tax on each successive taxable gift was higher throughout the donors entire lifetime transfers made at death are treated as the last taxable gift of the deceased donor therefore the amount of lifetime taxable gifts affects the rate of tax imposed on the donors taxable estate though it does not affect the actual size of the taxable estate the estate and gift tax rates were graduated to maximum tax rate of 70 percent on cumulative gifts or taxable estates of more than 5000000 51 the tax reform act of 1976 also merged the estate tax exclusion and the lifetime gift tax exclusion into single unified estate and gift tax credit52 which may be used to offset gift tax liability during the donors lifetime but which if unused at death is available to offset the deceased donors estate tax liability the credit was 42500 for transfers made in 1980 and 47000 for transfers made after 1980 this was equivalent to an estate and gift tax exemption of 161000 for transfers made during 1980 and 175625 for transfers made after 198053 the 3000 per donee annual gift tax exclusion was retained unchanged 48 26 usc 2042 an incident of ownership is any economic benefit from the policy such as the right to change the beneficiary to borrow against the cash surrender value

consequences of sale of property received from decedent the gain on sale is the difference between the amount realized by the seller and the sellers basis an heirs basis in inherited property prior to the 1976 act was its fair market value for federal estate tax purposes therefore if inherited property were sold soon after the date of death there would be gain and income tax liability the appreciation accruing prior to the date of death would be forever eliminated from the income tax base the 1976 act provided rule under which the basis of property received from decedent was carried over from the decedent this socalled carryover basis rule gave heirs basis in inherited property equal to the decedents basis on the date of death with adjustments for share of the appreciation accruing before 1977 share of the estate taxes paid on the property and share of the state death taxes imposed on the property the heir could also increase the basis in all of the decedents property to minimum basis of 60000 54 the 1976 act also increased the limitation on the estate tax marital deductions for moderatesized estates allowing the deduction for the greater of onehalf of the adjusted gross estate the former limitation or 25000055 in conjunction with the unified transfer tax credit the increased estate tax marital deduction permitted the taxfree passage of an estate of up to 425625 in 1981 if at least 250000 passed to the surviving spouse the limitation on the gift tax marital deduction was also increased in certain cases allowing donor spouse to deduct the full amount of the first 100000 of lifetime interspousal taxable gifts after 1976 but allowing deduction on the next 100000 of interspousal taxable gifts deduction was allowed for onehalf of the value of all subsequent interspousal taxable gifts56 the inclusion of property transferred by gift in contemplation of death was also revised by the 1976 act eliminating the rebuttable presumption that all gifts made within three years of death were made in contemplation of death now the 1976 act required automatic inclusion in the gross estate of the value of all gifts made within three years of death unless they were less than 3000 57 the 1976 act also provided method by which spous could assure the exclusion of onehalf of the value of concurrently owned property by electing to treat the creation of the joint interest as taxable gift 58 previously gift to spouse of onehalf of the value of concurrently owned property did not remove any portion of the value of the property from the donors gross estate if the donor predeceased under the fractional interest rule however if the creation of the concurrently owned property was taxable gift and if certain other requirements were met the estate of the first spouse to die included only onehalf of the value of the concurrently owned property therefore the executor did not have to establish relative contributions of the deceased and the surviving spouse 54

crude oil windfall profits tax act of 1980 infra 55 pl 94455 2002 56 to further integrate the estate and gift taxes there was an offset in the estate tax marital deduction for gifts which qualify for more than onehalf gift tax marital deduction to the extent that decedents life time taxable interspousal gifts were less than 250000 the estate tax maximum marital deduction was reduced by the

principally of interests in closely held business or family farm if the business or farm interest was sufficiently large share of the estate and if it satisfied certain other requirements any real estate used in the farm or business will be valued at its present use rather than its highest and best use59 this provision could reduce the size of the decedents gross estate by up to 500000 but any estate tax savings were recaptured if the business or farm was not continued by the decedents family for the next 15 years the 1976 act also permitted estates composed primarily of an interest in closelyheld business or family farm to defer payment of the estate taxes attributable to the business interest 60 if certain rules were met regarding the size of the business interest in proportion to the estate portion of the estate taxes attributable to the business interest would have to be paid for the first five years with only interest required the estate taxes on this share of the estate were allowed to be paid in up to ten equal annual installments thereafter the 1976 act also created an estate tax deduction for certain bequests to minor children of the decedent if the children had other living parents after the decedents death this orphans deduction was limited to 5000 for each year each child is under 21 years of age 61 one of the major changes in the 1976 act was the adoption of new tax on certain generation skipping transfers generationskipping transfer was defined as one which split the enjoyment and ownership of property between two individuals the first level of beneficiaries usually the donors children received the right to use and benefit from property during their lifetime the second level of beneficiaries usually the settlors grandchildren received the outright ownership of the property at the termination of the interests of the first level of beneficiaries prior to the 1976 act the character of the interests held by the different beneficiaries had resulted in estate or gift taxation of the property to the donor and the ultimate second level of beneficiaries but not the intervening first level of beneficiaries the tax reform act of 1976 added complex series of rules designed to treat the termination of the interest of the intervening beneficiaries as taxable event taxed at rate equal to the estate and gift tax rates which would have been applicable had the property been transferred outright by the donor and then by the first beneficiary 62 g22g145g142g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g3g140g157g561g152g143g561g343g351g349g350g561 the

availability of this deduction by limiting the deduction to sales of nonpublicly traded securities limiting the deduction to 50 percent of the taxable estate limiting the maximum reduction in estate taxes to 750000 imposing holding requirements on the decedent and the esop prohibiting the deduction in the case of securities acquired with assets transferred from another plan of the employer and

changed fro m the estate tax to the gift tax the act added new rules for determining if the transfer constituted gift and if so valuating the transferred interest at the time of the freeze transaction for gift tax purposes these new rules were premised upon the general principal that the value of residual intere st is determined by subtracting the value of any retained interests from the value of the entire bus iness entity adjusted to reflect percentage of ownership or control obra90 changed the gift tax consequences of the freeze transaction by establishing the value of the rights retained in th transaction at zero or much lower value than that which would have been found under prior law thus greatly increasing the value of the transferred gifted interest 120 113 pl 101239 7815d7a 114

tax is being accomplished primarily through lowering the rates and increasing the lifetime exemption the generationskipping transfer tax is imposed at the top rate of the estate tax147 therefore when the top rate of the estate tax is lowered under the act it has the affect of lowering the generationskipping tax as well the lifetime exemption is increased by making the exemption equal to the estate tax applicable exclusion amount 148 g15g152g141g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g22g145g142g561g9g146g143g157g561g22g138g161g561 the gift tax was not repealed as originally proposed in order to protect the integrity of the income tax it was felt that absent gift tax income producing property could be gifted to taxpayers in lower brackets sold the taxes paid and the proceeds gifted back to the higher bracket taxpayer thus avoiding great amounts of income tax on the sale of capital assets the gift tax was modified by lowering the rates and increasing the applicable exclusion amount the top rate of the gift tax declines with the top rate of the estate tax 149 after the repeal of the estate tax the top gift tax rate is lowered to 35 of the excess over 500000150 the applicable exclusion amount was raised to 1000000 in the year 2002 this amount remains constant through the phaseout period of the estate tax and after the repeal of the estate tax151 thus when the unified applicable exclusion amount increases for the estate tax in the phaseout period only 1000000 may be used to cover lifetime transfers ie gifts continued business to be deducted from the estate if an estate opted to use this deduction the estate was limited to 675000 applicable exclusion amount giving total of 1300000 which was deducted from the estate therefore when the applicable exclusion amount ex ceeded the 1300000 level it was longer useful and therefore was repealed 147 26 usc 2641 148 pl 10716 521c 149 pl 10716 511c see discussion above 150 pl 10716 511d 151 pl 10716 521

technically the new basis rules are income tax rules not estate tax rules basis is used to determine gain on the sale of capital assets for income tax purposes often basis and cost are equivalent generally to determine taxable income from sale of capital asset the basis in that asset is subtracted from the sale price currentl the basis in property received from decedent is steppedup basis152 the inheritor of property instead of having the basis of the one from which he received the property carryover basis has basis in the property of the fair market value of the property at the date of death of the decedent the purpose of the steppedup basis rule was to avoid double taxation the property had been subject to the estate tax if the property had carryover basis and was sold after inheritance there would be capital gain subject to the income tax the use of the steppedup basis eliminates this capital gain and thus the income tax on the sale with the repeal of the estate tax this need for the steppedup basis rules will be removed the act repeals the steppedup basis rule at the end of the year 2009 when the estate tax is repealed 153 the new basis rule will be that the basis in property received from decedent is the lesser of carryover basis or the fair market value of the property on the date of death of the decedent154 under the estate tax and the income tax steppedup basis rules an amount of the gross estate was not subject to either tax155 to compensate for the loss of the exempt property with the repeal of the estate tax and the change to carryover basis the act provides for two amounts of property which may still receive steppedup basis every estate may allocate 1300000 basis increase to property in the taxable estate156 in addition to this general stepup property passing to the spouse of the decedent may be allocated up to 3000000 basis increase157 each of these amounts is to be indexed for inflation

of transfer taxes has represented an important part of the federal tax structure for the past 85 years not so much in terms of revenue produced but in terms of impact on individual taxpayers and their personal and business decisions the history of the estate gift and generationskipping taxes shows mixed desire to raise revenue and to promote certain social goals these goals include 1 reducing large estates and inheritances while 2 alleviating the burden on small and moderate sized estates and facilitating the continued operation of family businesses the phaseout and repeal of the estate and generationskipping transfer taxes meets the second of these goals but leaves the first unaddressed at least from perspective of tax policy
