mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq introduction by the director of international armament and technology trade iatt this report arose out of memorandum of understanding mou between the undersecretary of defense for acquisitions technology and logistics atl and the inspector general of the department of defense oig that mou which was the product of nearly two years of discussion created an office in the oig which brought together the strong analytical scientific and technological capabilities of atl as vested in the office of the deputy undersecretary for international technology security dusdits with the investigative capabilities and mandated authority of the oig in the area of technology transfer and munitions controls one of the aims of that joint venture was to ascertain which us and internationally controlled weaponry and technology had evaded those controls and become part of the iraqi armament inventory and then to analyze and catalog it the resulting office was called the directorate of international armament and technology trade iatt and it began to gather information on the ground in iraq as soon as the official end to hostilities permitted the mou continued in force until the completion of the iraq investigations it was intended to foster at the end of march 2004 see appendix the workability and effectiveness of the idea underlying the mou was enhanced by the fact that the dusdits was former senateconfirmed inspector general in this area of expertise and had held senior line positions in the area of export control and enforcement at the state and commerce department and his two deputies had several decades of senior experience in both substantive and investigative terms at state commerce the larger defense community and the congress this fact is significant because it created team which was immediately able to put what was found in theater within the larger framework of international armament and technology trade and the financing mechanisms which underlie it that ability led to this report the pattern of weapons sales and inventory in iraq brought to the surface among many other things the name of nadhmi auchi an iraqi billionaire who has played role in the iraqieuropean arms trade for over two decades and who behind the facade of legitimate business served as saddam husseins principal international financial manipulator and bag man he lives in london and has become british subject either through official use onlywarning this document is the property of the department of defense inspector general

mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq his luxembourgbased holding company general mediterranean holdings sa or possibly through controlled subsidiary cipaf international sa of panama auchi is the largest shareholder in the french banking conglomerate bnp paribas his role in the international arms trade and as major commercial force in bnp paribas led to bnp paribas becoming the sole bank administering the oilforfood program the saddam regime was given sole discretion over the selection of the bank to administer the oilforfood program and reportedly the only bank it even considered for the program was auchis bnp paribas clearly his bank was an enormous beneficiary through fees and other services from the program and there is substantial information from credible sources that auchi and the bank acted as middle parties on the oil against vouchers scams that siphoned off large portion of the 10 billion estimated to be illegally taken under the oilforfood program which is currently under investigation by congress and by special panel created by kofi annan the secretarygeneral auchis financial empire includes the cellular telephone systems of tunisia algeria egypt jordan and most recently iraq his ability to operate supranationally has generally hindered attempts at prosecution but he was recently extradited to france for his role in the elfaquitaine scandal was found guilty and given 15 year suspended sentence his persistent role in iraq weapons purchases set off instant alarms in iatt when it was discovered that he had managed to manipulate the us and britishsponsored cellular telephone tender under the auspices of the coalition provisional authority cpa by having nominal or beneficial ownership of major part of the equity in two of the winning licenses and through complex arrangement controlling interest in all three licenses the investigation which underlay this report was triggered by universal complaints that the tender process had been rigged and that the process lacked transparency the effort to subvert and suborn the cellular telephone tender process in iraq reflected worldclass skills in corporate and financial manipulation its audacity its meticulous attention to carefully tailored political needs its placement seemingly beyond any governing legal frameworks and its scheduled disappearance in the train of the cpa on july 1 2004 into three unsupervised iraqi institutional entities all reflect the hand of master manipulator each of the licenses has defensible rationale for its award official use onlywarning this document is the

only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq when looked at in isolation when the three licenses are looked at in toto however the organizing ownership of the whole becomes evident with regard to corruption similar attention to skating beyond legal boundaries is evident the money involved was not appropriated usg funds and most of it was in cash although the alleged corruption of an iraqi minister or governing council member may or may not be legal problem as there is legal framework for the interim government it is nonetheless noteworthy similarly the alleged corruption of two british employees evades oversight because of the cpa status of forces agreement it would only be alleged wrongdoing by american cpa employees that would fall within usg oversight but if one of those was positioned to control any investigation into the matter it would then ensure that the scheme was nearly impervious to serious investigation nonetheless the cpa tender process was publicly advertised as following the federal acquisition regulations fars and this report is prompted by the spirit of the us foreign corrupt practices act itself prompted by just the sort of activities present in the iraqi cellular license tender the directorate of international armament and technology trade alerted the inspector general of dod personally to alleged fixing and corruption in the cpa cellular license tender on october 24 2003 and sent on supporting material that had been referred to his office by former deputy us trade representative see appendix at the igs suggestion the director of iatt spoke to the two ig subordinates who were directing the resulting ig inquiry he also spoke at length in baghdad with the acting cpa ig and the three investigative officers looking into the case and reported to the ig by telephone on the problem overall the oig judged that the matter was outside its purview as it used appropriated funds and appeared mainly focused on nonus nationals the resulting defense criminal investigation service dcis report dated december 16 2003 had through ig office error not been based on the original supporting material but depended instead on daniel sudnicks explanation of the process the report was as result seriously incomplete and from an investigative standpoint worthless that report was not brought to iatts attention until early march 2004 when its own parallel investigation was nearly completed the conjunction of an inquiry from the british ambassador to the united states to deputy secretary paul wolfowitz about the two british subjects allegedly implicated in the fix and simultaneous request for information on related subject from the deputy secretarys office brought renewed attention to the issue the newly appointed cpa inspector general stuart bowen was therefore official use onlywarning this document is the property of the department of defense inspector

general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq alerted to the problem that the problem did not receive the attention it deserved in the regular ig channels is hardly surprising given the extraordinary complexity of the case and the overburdened ig staff in iraq only iatts intense focus on iraq and illegal technology transfers there allowed the real story in outline to emerge in this report further investigation is therefore in order the winners in the iraqi cellular license tender were saddams most senior financiers their egyptian kuwaiti and iraqi supporters the bank bnp paribas european cellular corporationsparticularly alcatel and the european gsm technology it depends onand chinese telecom interests such as huawei which had been active in breaking the iraqi embargo motorola was the sole american winner thanks to its provision of handsets the losers were all the american bidders the more advanced american technology cdma and the myriad of honest iraqis who put together solid consortia that were not part of the fix the greatest losers were the new iraq and the iraqi people who had an opportunity to have in place state oftheart cellular phone network and instead were given system thus far nonfunctional that is run by and for corrupt interests meeting with the us customs team in iraq assured the its team that customs is actively collecting information to use against some 20 american companies who violated sanctionsus laws that were in effect before the war the initial iatt investigation began with foreign corporations particularly french corporations as they were the largest nato supplier of arms and armsrelated technology to the former regime that effort put the spotlight on major nonamerican figures who played very significant role in the armament trade such as auchi significant and credible evidence was developed that conspiracy was organized by nadhmi auchi to offer bribes to fix the awarding of cellular licensing contracts covering three geographic areas of iraq in addition circumstantial and credible evidence was offered that the conspiracy existed to ensure certain firms were awarded the contracts to assure that auchis control was total and that the european gsm standard would be universally adopted and remain dominant in iraq to assure the second objective required continued oversight of iraqi telecommunication to prevent the addition of any cdma competition until the cellular build out was complete official use onlywarning this document is the property of the department of defense

inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq iatts concern with auchi whose life is described in more detail in appendices g and h is that he used influence peddling and access to the iraqi regime in conjunction with his european north african and middle eastern financial and business empire to build worldwide network additionally significant and credible evidence has been developed that nadhmi auchi has engaged in unlawful activities working closely with iraqi intelligence operatives to ðbribe foreign governments and individuals prior to operation iraqi freedom to turn opinion against the americanled mission to remove saddam hussein ðarrange for significant theft from the oilforfood program to smuggle weapons and dualuse technology into iraq in violation of and other international export control regimes ðorganize an elaborate scheme to take over and control the postwar cellular phone system in iraq this conspiracy used assets auchi already had in iraq in conjunction with british interests to both design the architecture of the iraqi telecom system and ensure he owned or controlled its component parts while auchis name surfaced as personal fixer for saddam and as central figure in the oilforfood scandal the investigation into who shipped illegal weapons and technology to iraq took dramatic turn when it discovered him in new role as the chosen arbiter of the new iraqi cellular phone system the implications of his having fixed the tender for the entire iraqi cellular telephone system go beyond mere corruption and technological empire building it put in control of iraqi telecommunications man with an antiamericananti coalition mindset and history of illegal international arms traffic that control could allow him to compromise the entire iraqi telecommunications system and undermine the iraqi security system on an ongoing basis with american and coalition soldiers at increasing risk in iraq this investigation was therefore put on an accelerated footing the july 1 2004 date for the transfer of iraqi sovereignty provided an appropriate element of urgency to the effort as of that date any effort to determine responsibility for the cellular phone licensing process much less questions of legality and criminal culpability would be set up to fail given the extralegal or supra legal dimension of activities on the fringe of cpa

important to have the picture of the cellular phone conspiracy available to the appropriate authorities prior to july 1 those who might object that this report depends heavily on information supplied by two failed bidders in the iraqi tender should remember that in complex financial investigations it is sometimes only through the cooperation of closely involved parties that resolution is attainable the internal revenue service for example often depends on estranged spouses to break complex tax fraud cases in this instance it is fair to say that only those fully involved in the bidding process have the knowledge and interest in fully investigating the fix that the process is believed to have been fixed in baghdad is beyond dispute representative of turkcell said that after the winners were announced everybody involved in the process believed daniel sudnick was lying in every pronouncement he made on the results of the tender process darrell trent the original senior director of communications and sudnicks putative boss until the ministry of communications became independent commented that forces much stronger than sudnick had taken over by the time the original announcement of the tender winners was pulled the pressure exerted by the auchi combine was overwhelming the failed bidders moreover had early on in the process registered their patriotic interest in assuring the finest american technology would be seriously considered for adoption in iraq both liberty mobile delaware corporation whose cdmabased consortium included lucent and qualcomm and turkcell gsmbased consortium with worldclass regional elements and parsons communications as its implementer brought their superior capabilities to the defense department via the office of the deputy secretary and the defense communication team that had been assembled to support the iraq reconstruction effort and both companies were strongly encouraged to engage themselves that support unfortunately was of little use against the auchi combine both companieseven after their manipulated eliminationused their best efforts to persevere in the market in spite of the fix liberty mobile recast itself with additional partners to build an interactive gsmcdma spine for the first responder network frn and turkcell went allout to buy out key parts of the contract that was denied them this inquiry found

made to the participants everything is difficult to prove and the evidence tends to be either circumstantial or hearsay the situation is made murkier by the fact that there is nothing illegal about iraqis in high position accepting multimillion dollar bribes the arab street is however reasonable sounding board for accepted truth two iraqi ministers identified daniel sudnick as one of three people paid by nadhmi auchis paymaster in the cellular phone tender another minister who knows sudnick well stated in brussels that sudnick was fired for corruption bribes amounting to between 18 and 21 million were allegedly allocated among six people as many payments until recently continued to be made in cash in baghdad money disappears very easily the ig report helpfully suggested that the 5 million alleged to go two britons may have been the 5 million payable to the ministry of communications for one of the licenses that might have been true but there are records to indicate where any such payment went it was reported by cpa baghdad in late april that financial controls in the moc were few to nonexistent in that context all the records of the cellular tender appear to have disappeared while some of the evidence in this report is fragmentary the dots are connected in convincing and important ways below the deadly serious efforts to restore security and legitimacy to iraq lies muted gold rush mentalitythe billions in the supplemental appropriation do indeed begin to add up to real money it is testament to the integrity of the thousands of dedicated americans both

general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq executive summary this report reviews the process that was used and the individuals and companies involved in the awarding of mobile cell phone contracts late last year in iraq corruption was hallmark of the saddam hussein regime in iraq the award of the telecommunications contracts should have been an early example of how things would be different in the new iraq however there is ample evidence that the old ways have transferred to the new iraq with the award of these cellular contracts and that americans in the cpa were either duped in the process and should have exercised far greater due diligence or may have been participants in the matter what should have been fair and transparent contracting process was in fact hidden behind shady dealings corrupt processes and businessmen who made their money from saddams exploitation of the iraqi people the result appears to be contracts that guarantee the new iraq will be shackled to old communications technology key points undermining the cpas declaration that this was fair and transparent process ðthis contracting process produced three interrelated parties contrary to the stated objectives of the cpa ðone investor in all three regions billionaire nadhmi auchi is widely regarded as corrupt supporter of saddam husseins regime who got his money from doing deals especially illegal arms transfers for saddam this is in clear violation of section 614 of the cellular license agreements1 auchi is the central figure in the oilfor 1 section 614 of the iraq mobile cellular public telecommunications license authorization and agreement reads the licensees shall endeavour to ensure that person who had substantial business activities with who supported or who associated or collaborated with the previous regime prior to april 2003 shall control or own directly or indirectly any ownership interest in the licensee additionally licensees shall endeavour to ensure that

taxpayers and that cell operators were using usmanufactured equipment yet as of april 2004 the facts on the ground regarding the licensees appear to be the following ðroaming among the cell phone operators within iraq was considered an essential provision of the contracts there is currently roaming service in iraq virtually partitioning the country ðwhile some us companies like motorola are in

northern region is supposedly not deploying according to the provisions of its contract award and is not offering service in large part of the region full investigation into the awarding of the contracts and the reliability of the people involved is therefore warranted and should be undertaken immediately outside parties newsweek usa today are already conducting such investigations the us government must proactively address this issue our recommendations are ðupon receipt by the department of defense inspector general this report be immediately transmitted to the department of justice to determine what civil or criminal activities might be pursued by relevant authorities in spite of the relative absence of dependable legal or judicial base in iraq or within the cpa anyone determined to have committed any improper acts should be subjected to appropriate administrative procedures and anyone determined to have committed any criminal acts should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law ðthat fullscale audit be immediately undertaken of the moc and of the cpa office of communications to determine whether any files bearing on the cellular licenses can be located or reconstructed ðthat an investigation of the winners of the three cellular licenses be undertaken on an urgent basis to determine if each or any of the licensees have properly fulfilled their obligations under the terms of the award as there appears to be only segmented incomplete and expensive service in baghdad virtually build out in the south and the evolution of very limited

grounds for rescinding the licenses that of course is in addition to the inherent prohibition of any adherents of the regime of saddam hussein holding license this investigation should be completed as soon as possible and based on the information uncovered to date serious consideration should be given to the swift and summary cancellation of all three licenses to prevent further exacerbation of ongoing harm to both us and iraqi interests ðif such cancellation appears in order there is not sufficient time before july 1 to rerun bidding process and there is sufficient evidence of corruption to counsel against such an effort for those reasons it is recommended that the remaining bidders who are currently capable of immediately taking over the build out of the cellular system be identified and chosen as replacements for the failed and flawed bidders such choice should include cdma component to ensure that the auchi monopoly cannot be reconstituted under readjusted ownership the chosen consortia should be empowered to take over the build out immediately and have performance benchmarks established for july 1 and for the remainder of twoyear renewable license official use onlywarning

official use only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq background the cpa is the interim governing body of postwar iraq as part of its efforts to rebuild iraq and establish previously nonexistent critical infrastructures in this case mobile telecommunications capabilities the cpa announced competition in july 2003 to solicit bids for mobile telecommunications service throughout iraq to fully understand the conspiracy to control the iraqi cellular telephone system it is useful to look at the landscape before the war started before there was coalition provisional authority cpa the entity charged with designing and managing the institutions necessary for running postconflict iraq was the office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance orha it was run by retired lt general jay garner and was staffed by dod using resources from the agency for international development aid dod and elsewhere in the government and private sector orha grew quickly in washington and then was transferred to kuwait early in february 2003 it was charged with providing everything that was necessary to transform iraq from theater of war to functioning administrative entity important among its tasks was restoring iraqs existing communications system and designing new system which could allow coalition military communications to connect to that new system iraqs prewar system was essentially hardwire and fiber optic cable network that was said to serve 125 million customers largely in baghdad with buildout to the larger cities cellular phone service had never been allowed to get foothold in iraq because of saddam husseins security concerns but in the year before the war saddam had had his principal international finance man nadhmi auchi bring in team from luxembourg that formed part of the frenchtrained support structure that underlay his north african and middle eastern cellular phone empire that team would remain in place in baghdad and help to form the core competency of the cpa communications effort after the war in kuwait the orha communications effort was acquiring form and personnel britishdominated team was put together to include nick massey david leech jim davies and terry sullivan the first three were communications specialists from the british military services sullivan was american with similar

inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq for emergency systems to allow the coalition forces to communicate beyond the purely military channels in basra and baghdad the british leadership reflecting the capabilities of the british telecom leader vodafone gave out gsm contract for basra to mtcvodafone hybrid firm composed of wataniya kuwaitbased cellular firm with kuwaiti and iraqi partners and vodafone imprimatur but vodafone participation with nick massey as its supervisor mci an american firm which already provided telecom services to dod but was enmeshed in bankruptcy proceedings was given parallel gsm contract for baghdad the mtcvodafone consortium was significant choice for the emergency network for basra because it was fully prepared month before the war started to begin an unauthorized gsm buildout from kuwait northwards employing small fleet of flatbed trailers to carry the towers and using large cache of allegedly stolen handsets with kuwaiti telephone numbers to hand out free of charge it was significant as well because the consortium was put together using the financing and telecom resources of nadhmi auchi the very same consortium would reappear later as part of another winning auchi combination the mci award for baghdad assured interoperability with basra but with company that probably could not compete in the long run and had international operating experience after the orha communications group moved to baghdad it was decided that it should focus on quickly putting together competitive bidding process for national iraqi cellular telephone system it was further decided that to promote competition and to ensure that the buildout was not concentrated in baghdad the most developed and lucrative market the country would be split into three parts north central and southern the bids were to be ostensibly technology neutral ie between gsm and cdma and would allow bidders to bid on any two of the three regions winning bidders would be allowed to build out in other regions as soon as they completed the buildout in their original area the cpa team headed up by david leech drew up the plans for this elaborate bidding process the plans and the official request for proposals rfp were to be unveiled at bidders conference in baghdad in late july 2003 from nearly the outset the team was without significant supervision in baghdad as result of the replacement of general jay garner by ambassador l paul bremer former department of transportation deputy secretary darrell trent was appointed senior cpa advisor to the

licenses in iraq only in late may and was inundated by aviation railroad bridge port and road problems to the detriment of the communications sector this anomaly lasted about five months and ultimately prompted the decision to create freestanding ministry of communications but the problem gave the understaffed cpa communications team relatively free rein to develop the plans for the cellular phone tender it is believed that in that effort they were assisted by the ongoing presence in baghdad of team of gsm experts from mec telematik of luxembourg see appendix m this inquiry has established that the company or members of its team were in saddams iraq prior to the war assisting on the telecommunications infrastructure there is speculation that auchi had assisted saddam with procurements for this telecommunications infrastructure through his holding company also based in luxembourg there is strong circumstantial evidence that mec telematik was able to exercise influence over the specifications for the cellular bidding and subsequent work including the first responder network for iraq in written communication of february 13 2004 the cpa deputy senior advisor of communications states to us contractor in reference to mec telematik there is one who knows iraq and the existing networks better as they are the ones who just spent 18 months installing it all while david leech was in full control of the rfp and the cellular bidding process the cpa found and appointed senior advisor for telecommunications dr daniel sudnick who had strong telecommunication policy background he would serve as darrell trents deputy until the ministry of communications was formally split off from the joint ministry sudnicks initiation into the world of iraqi telecommunications came at the bidders conference in amman on july 31 david leech led the rollout effort on behalf of darrell trent but it was evident from the moment he finished his presentation and the questioning began that the bidders group believed that the rfp had been rigged to assure gsm result and suspected that it might have been further rigged for particular companies the original press notice from the cpa on july 18 2003 had said that either gsm or cdma technology could be employed provided it was within the offered frequency band as it turned out the only frequency band offered in the rfp issued on july 27 allowed the 900 mhz frequency used by gms but required cdma users to justify use of the 800 mhz this discrimination was only corrected by letter to ambassador bremer resulting in changes to the rfp but it did not allay suspicions that bias toward gsm did exist in the cpa official use onlywarning this document is the property of the department of defense inspector general international

bidders leech who was to have overseen the bidding process to the end was relieved and sent back to england sudnick then took over the process using jim davies leechs deputy as his guide there is doubt that davies followed the leech blueprint for the licensing in order to understand what ultimately took place it is useful to follow the official and unofficial descriptions of the bid submission process bids were to be submitted in electronic form and the decisions on the three licenses were to be made by an unnamed committee consisting of four people two iraqis and two americans it was also reported that individual bids would be edited to remove the identity of the bidders ostensibly for reasons of impartiality it is unclear however who did the editing and what the extent of the editorial activity was after the licensees were chosen there was concern that rival proposals might have been intentionally and materially altered during the judging process sudnick initially appeared to be the supervisor of the project but admitted privately early in the process that he was also one of the us evaluators or selectors if in fact these two boards were truly different in composition as it was stated to the bidders they were the identity of the projected second american evaluator is illusive as several americans were brought in and out of the process on continuing ad hoc basis it was not darrell trent as he recused himself from the process because relative of his worked for mci which already had the baghdad startup emergency contract and was thought to have an interest in the bidding that fact however left the ringmasters role to sudnick alone and in appearance and in fact he was in charge regarding sudnicks own growing substantive responsibilities he complained that he did not have the backup he needed in baghdad or washington to help with the judging or indeed to support his larger role overseeing the nascent ministry of communications he claimed he could not begin to look at proposals until 1030 at night and complained that he had markedly fewer staff than his iraqi counterparts none of the iraqi judges or indeed the american judges if there were any were ever

details of the selection process other than in the most generic terms who composed the source selection evaluation board sseb for example how were they selected what if any technical advice were they given by experts outside the usg what specific metrics and in what priority were used to assess the bids davies in response to questions raised in the interagency working group spoke of general criteria about capability and connectivity which would result in red yellow or green light classification being given to each proposal even after the fact there remains confusion as to who actually made the selection throughout the projected rfp period the process appeared to be entirely in the hands of davies with some input from sudnick in spite of serious concerns expressed in transatlantic cpawashington interagency teleconferences about the absence of transparency davies remained resolutely defensive and opaque for an extended period he would not divulge even the number of bidders much less their names or nationalities this lack of transparency prevented rival bidders from analyzing the makeup of all the various consortia and thereby allowed the agents of the former regime to proceed unnoticed and unacknowledged in the process it is not clear at what point sudnick became an unwavering backer of gsm as he maintained the public fiction of technology neutrality until the ig investigations he maintained in statements to the press and as it was the official cpa position repeatedly told the bidders that the competition was technology neutral yet when questioned by the ig investigator whether there had been absolute neutrality between the two cellular standards in the bidding he straightforwardly admitted that cdma had been eliminated from the competition neutral observer might provide clue to sudnicks bias in this regard he said that sudnick seemed overwhelmed with his responsibilities when he arrived in baghdad and was clearly grateful to be able to follow the british agenda that had been put in place before his arrival sudnick would have had reason to think at this time that his british cohort colleagues at the cpa had any interests beyond promoting vodafone and gsm technology or that auchi interests were hovering around the process he may well have come from washington fully prepared in advance to implement gsm cellular solution for iraq which

one sudnicks inaugural briefing in washington stressed only that he might come up with bell solution to include gsm as result of his experience with bell labs and lucent nonetheless sudnicks bias against cdma became apparent to darrell trent and was the subject of quarrels between them while trent still retained the responsibility for communications as soon as sudnick became the undisputed senior advisor for communications he backed the british plan and leadership 100 per cent as stated earlier there is evidence suggesting that sudnick had any reason to suspect at the outset any connection between the british contingent and auchis plans and activities in iraq auchi had effectively bought himself both respectability and influence in british social and political circles and british political leaders and cabinet ministers have served and still serve on his boards of directors in addition there is transatlantic organization called cercle the club founded decades ago by french minister antoine pinay that brings together europeans and americans from the political military and intelligence communities to discuss issues of mutual concern and to network in 2002 auchi was brought into cercle by lord cavendish the former head of british intelligence it is altogether possible therefore that the marriage between the british telecomm specialists in iraq and the auchi telecomm interests in the region was brokered in advance while the britishcontingent and the auchi operatives were weaving their web in baghdad ostensibly under the trentsudnick split responsibility two cpa bureaucracies were being built in parallel in baghdad and washington the cpa rear based in washington was created to provide instant backup to baghdad in every functional activity central to iraqs reconstruction as result first class telecomm team was put together using the top telecommunications people at dod the professional telecommunications assets of bearing point management consulting firm brought in by consultants working under aid and an oversight team culled from the policy bureau at dod and the nsc its aim was to assure viable strategic plan was being developed in

spring of 2004 the growing tension between these two communications elements of cpa created situation in which sudnick became the unchallengeable arbiter of telecomm issues from cellular licenses to the creation of an iraqi telecommunications regulatory body to the creation of first responder network frn tying together security forces iraqi institutions and emergency services and the emerging iraqi public telephone system he reported directly to ambassador l paul bremer and used his considerable technical literacy to assure total control of cpa telecommunications policy in baghdad in this capacity he controlled the evolution of the entire iraqi cellular tender process assuring the continued british direction of the effort and the eventual success of the auchi interests washington grew increasingly frustrated by sudnicks inability to generate any real implementation plans or activity and his stream of complaints excuses and halftruths about what was happening in effect sudnicks absorption with the license tender during the late summer and fall of 2003 provided him with rationale for overall lack of responsiveness to washington this background is important as sudnick davies and the rest of the cpa telecomm team were able to develop the plans for the cellular license tenders with only intermittent supervision cpa authority senior to sudnick was unable to really challenge him until march 2004 by which time the cellular licenses were in the hands of auchi interests and sudnick had moved to try to ensure through the emergency first responder network frna gsm commercial monopoly in iraq his resistance to the incorporation of us cdma technology persisted even into the development of the frn and surfaced as violent opposition to any potential commercialization of the frn even though he had seemingly agreed to the utility of having an interoperable gsmcdma spine on the frn in spite of the fact that need existed to provide ongoing maintenance and support for the frn sudnick unsuccessfully tried to include anticommercialization language in his submissions to omb for congress he disingenuously tried later to pass this off as congressional language in an effort to

the tender process began to pick up momentum and he began to actively promote and coordinate simultaneously all three elements of the auchi trident the british orchestrators of the tender process the mec telematik group from luxembourg and the components of the auchi corporate empire with its alcatel underpinnings this activity together with allegations late in the process by two iraqi ministers that he was one of three people and the only american who was being paid off by auchis paymaster in baghdad make it clear that he had to be the hub of the process and not wellmeaning dupe regarding the award process for the iraqi cellular licenses sudnick was obviously late arrival to the scene he arrived just in time for the amman bidders conference in late july 2003 but the gsm and auchi fix had been in progress for some time before his appointment darrell trent used the shortcomings of the gsmfocused rfp to try to produce completely revamped technology neutral rfp while david leech was fired for producing both the slanted rfp and for what was seen as an arrogant take it or leave it briefing in amman leech had announced at the conference that he would in effect administer the tender process himself sudnick slowed down leechs departure and eased the transition to davies to fully understand what happened in the cellular license tender however it is useful to see how the leech and auchi influences were introduced into the rfp and how they remained undiminished in the disposition of the proposals the collaboration is first evident in the evolution of the bid documents for the iraq cellular tender on june 13 2003 white paper entitled postwar wireless telecommunications in iraq see appendix b was published the paper was written by ahmad haleem an employee of wataniya kuwaiti business that subsequently was awarded one of the three mobile licenses in iraq from field of 35 bidders wataniya was also involved in the pirate gsm buildout from kuwait to basra immediately after the war cpa press release of july 18 2003 announced the competition for three separate licenses north central and south for mobile telecommunications services in iraq minimum coverage and rollout expectations were set out as was the licensing period of 24 months licenses were to be issued following transparent and fair competition to be based on an assessment of fair value undertaken by the

of the bid documentation for the cellular competition for iraq statement of objectives for iraq mobile license offer see appendix c authored by leech and davies was offered on july 27 2003 several major recommendations were lifted straight from the white paper and inserted into the offer including ðcpa would issue three licenses one each for north central and south paragraph 3 in the statement of objectives section 42 in the white paper ð bidders must state coverage levels at 2 months 6 months 12 months and 24 months paragraph 5 in the statement of objectives section 43 in the white paper ð

statement of objectives annex c in the statement of objectives page 21 in the white paper the white paper made several seriously incorrect claims about cdma technology including that it costs more would limit international communications and that there would be limited suppliers see appendix d for comparison of cdma and gsm the paper concludes on the basis of these mistruths that iraqi cellular service should be keyed only to the gsm standard while there are myriad reasons to support gsm in iraq the only reason to exclude an interoperable gsmcdma system would be to exclude cdma technology entirely and it would be hard to explain the concerted efforts to eliminate this american technology except that it threatened the gsm monopoly now enjoyed by the auchibacked cellular winners the level of dissatisfaction from the amman bidders conference forced general revision of the terms of the rfp by trent overseeing sudnick leech who was about to depart and davies when they returned to baghdad on july 29 2003 liberty mobile one of the potential bidders wrote to ambassador bremer asking that several key points in the bid specifications be altered or removed since they had the effect

armament and technology trade page 22for official use only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq cdma technology from consideration liberty also questioned how and by whom the bids would be considered the liberty mobile letter cited several major problems in the specifications chief among them was the apparent lack of permission to be able to use the 800 mhz spectrum universally employed by cdma the specifications required bidder to justify use of this spectrum and to make complete spectrum survey prior to commencement of operations neither such requirement was made for company seeking to use the gsm frequencies moreover should bidder be granted use of the 800 mhz spectrum he would be deemed secondary user of the spectrum such burden was placed on the 900 mhz spectrum which is used by gsm technology the liberty letter also criticized omissions such as the failure to include any provision for wireless data services despite the demand for data transmission in the reconstruction work and particularly given the dilapidated wire network since cdma is vastly superior technology in this aspect the complete absence of any requirements for high speed data services despite the needs of the country was seen as an unfair attempt to exclude this important competitive feature the letter also raised the matter of roaming the offer stated that licensees will be required to provide full national and international roaming service through agreements with other iraqi licensees and with wide range of operators in trading partner countries it is worth quoting at length the liberty letters objection to this requirement since the objection itself stands on practices used in the us by the fcc this statement is vague it does not define trading partner countries and could be construed to require that the licensee must provide roaming to western european countries where wireless operators are not permitted to deploy cdma technology in the united states the fcc does not impose any roaming requirements on carriersand does not use roaming as criterion in issuing wireless licensesto do otherwise would violate the fccs principle of technology neutrality as consequence the tender documents were revised august 3 ostensibly removing the bias against use of cdma technology the bid specifications were altered to accommodate many of these objections and in subsequent letter to ambassador bremer liberty mobile stated we believe the new terms represent marked improvement and that they have effectively removed the bias against use of cdma technologyand liberty mobile is preparing to participate in the tender nonetheless since several bidders including liberty mobile had seen the wataniya white paper

promised in his statement by ambassador bremer could in fact be relied upon in spite of the responsiveness that was reflected in the issuance of the revised rfp interested observers in both baghdad and washington regard the ensuing period from august 3 through the deadline for proposals on august 14 which then slipped to august 21 and then through september 5 when the winners were to be announced as black hole so far as information was concerned there was much political activity on the part of the iraqi governing council and reports of interaction between the leadership in each region and different levels of the cpa in baghdad the socalled source selection evaluation board sseb never attempted to appear transparent either as to membership or as to relations with the governing council or specific parts of the cpa this created situation in baghdad in which fragmentary information generated rumors and the rumors fed into conspiracy theories as one cpa insider summarized the licenses in an email to another insider on november 2 2003 you said that auchi had 30 percent in the stake sic with swaris who is orascom so it would look more like talabani in the north swaris in the center with auchi chalabi in the south what was unseen or not remarked upon until the final announcement of the winning consortia was the unflinching hand of nadhmi auchi working with the various elements of the cpa telecomm team and the iraqis on the award team see appendices g h when the window finally closed for proposals on august 21 it remained unclear what the full range of bidders represented most were gsm based many had strong european corporate representation many had either american corporate participation or were largely american consortia only after the announcement of the winners on october 6 2003 was it revealed that proposals had been received from 35 companies which because of the requirement to bid on more than one region of the country submitted total of 85 bids for the three licenses list of the bidders and their component elements has never been made public of greater consequence as of this date the records of the process

only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq the two months after the closing of the bidding was time of tension within the cpa and time of opaque political and financial intrigue in the perception of both the bidders and baghdad cognoscenti the supposed announcement date of september 5 2003 however turned out to be anticlimactic after the mountain had labored to bring forth the mouse in the form of three winners ambassador clayton mcmanaway ambassador bremers administrative deputy pulled the announcement with only the explanation that the awards would be postponed one beyond the cpa administrative circle knew the reason for the change but it was later leaked that one of the winning bidders had heavy baathist components within its consortium as the ultimate winning trio was controlled by central financial figure of the saddam regime it seems ludicrous that the process was stopped to supposedly remove firm turkcell that was one of the strongest bidders and which in the end had saddam ties which could be identified nonetheless the process resumed for over month more with ostensible due diligence being done in baghdad on the winners financially astute observer might ask searching questions about the extent of appropriate due diligence done both before and after september 5 by the cpa team internal financial control processes for the ministry of communications according to memorandum issued by bearing point on april 13 2004 shortly after sudnicks removal were few to nonexistent see appendix f sudnicks claim that the consortia had been vetted by the cia and his complaint that that effort had itself been responsible for prolonging the process could not be confirmed turkcell which had been led to believe it had won the northern region contract and had been fully vetted appropriately cried foul and has been trying diligently to get reinstated in the north turkcell thought its ties to talibani would be when conjoined to merit sufficient to assure the license auchi was presumably able to trump turkcells talibani card with one of his own and have turkcell eliminated on trumped up baathist charges generated by his supporters within the governing council it is impossible to determine without additional investigation whether an auchi deal with one of turkcells component companies fell through in the end or whether auchi merely managed to cut more comprehensive deal with asiacell at turkcells expense this small turkcell vignette is however mark of the depth of the intrigue underlying the award of the iraq cellular licenses it shows the difficulty of separating wrongdoing from dealmaking when operating in an environment which lacks any legal basis also it should be noted that while this office

was time of public claims and counter claims and moves made by some of the ostensible winners to assure their victory auchi and his financial associates were able to pump up the price of their companies by leaking the news of the awards to the financial world indeed the stock runup on orascom see appendix h during late september 2003 fueled by press predictions they would win in iraq

intertwined elements of the cpa team and the auchi controlled companies that they had managed to rig the contracts for one of the crown jewels of iraqi reconstruction cpas treatment of liberty mobile

licenses in iraq each of bells points is either untrue or irrelevant to the terms of the rfp in parallel performance bell informed turkcell of their ostensible failure in performance that they could only label as pathetic at that time sudnick took pains to denigrate the cdma proposal which was liberty mobiles as one of the worst proposals and said that it depended on unproven dualuse gsmcdma handsets and had operating element with sufficient experience to do the job all of this was demonstratively untrue samsungthe operating arm of libertyhas base of 50 million subscribers and its dual

comprehensive proposal they had ever made they wondered if their proposal had been electronically edited or otherwise tampered with as the process provided for neither appeal nor redress and was devoid of transparency liberty had way to make its case known except to cry foul one further element entered the cellular license picture however on september 1 2004 on that date without any warning to the cpa telecom team the iraq governing council announced the appointment of minister of communications the minister named was haider alabadi an elevator engineer and parttime islamic lecturer based in london he was the creature and appointee of ibrahim aljafferi head of the shia dawa party and member of the iraqi governing council haider alabadis appointment created new problem for the cpa cellular phone team determining the role and responsibilities of the minister in the approaching announcement of the license winners the choices had been made and the preparations under way for an announcement on september 4 the sudden announcement of his appointment however created political problem that at minimum was likely to delay the announcement and at worst could have revised or reversed the licensing decisions the next few days were agonizing for the telecomm team and the cpa leadership as there was determination to go forward with the decisions in spite of desire on the part of the minister to review and reaward the licenses all of the assumptions of the telecomm team regarding the viability of the putative licensees were thrown into the political melee created by the governing councils appointment of the cabinet of ministers political arrangements that may have been quietly worked out without any overview then had to be able to resubmitted to political scrutiny the auchi element in particular had to be acceptable to the new iraqi political slate it is therefore not surprising that the announcement date was first slipped to official use onlywarning

london for five to seven days and met there with naguib sawiris the head of orescom and amar alkhadi london and kuwait based bagman for auchi at the meeting he was allegedly either promised or was actually paid 5 million to ratify the auchi trio of licensees the object of the mcmanaway pullback however should be seen in relation to the london meeting it was to ensure the removal of turkcell for reasons best understood by the iraqi governing council and the ratification of country wide auchi combine the minister returned to baghdad supportive of the auchi choices he nonetheless raised litany of difficulties over the period running up to the license announcement he would add fourth licensee he wanted the two year duration of the licenses shortened he wanted to change the licensing terms and he carried on running debate over who should actually announce the licenses the cpa or the ministry as this would be an iraqi system in way reflecting appropriated us funding cpa insisted that the announcement and responsibility for the choices be accepted by the ministry of communications and by the minister personally in the end abadi made the public announcement in front of his ministry

substantively they were in agreement on the results of the cellular competition as long as alabadi did not change the daviessudnick auchi choices of licensees they got there by different routes but sudnick ensured that alabadi bought into the master plan that assured monopoly gsm system for auchi as the various licensees failed to meet some of their obligations in april 2004 alabadi began to make noises about revoking the three licenses and issuing new ones and fourth license presumably for his own account his action not only prompts chicagostyle thoughts about how long he was prepared to stay bought but raises questions about what will happen when he becomes fully empowered on july 1 2004 perhaps that was what prompted sudnick to leave memo urging alabadis firing as he himself was relieved in baghdad from the start and throughout the process the competition for mobile phone licenses was supposed to be completely technology neutral in conformance with very wellestablished policy observed by the fcc in the us and by the ustr and department of state in every forum where telecommunications issues are raised that was the official position of sudnick as the us government senior director of communications for the cpa he continued to claim he established level playing field until he was interviewed by the ig months after the tender results were announced he alone was entrusted

associated with the saddam hussein regime while there are valid reasons why gsm could be considered as more appropriate for iraq such as its use by neighboring countries the only reason for

system for mobile gsm type of technology was more appropriate for iraq than the code division multiple access cdma type of technology further the ig stated although cdmabased companies were not precluded from submitting proposals only gsmbased companies were deemed to be fully qualified this runs counter to sudnicks assertion and us government policy that the two technologies would compete

question of whether cdma was being considered as an equal competitor to gsm there were questions of who was reviewing the bids and making the awards in various documents it was claimed that the iraqi ministry of communications would make the decision the cpa would make the decision or according to the bid documents themselves source selection evaluation board and source selection authority would make the decision the igs report contains sudnicks contention that cpas only role in the licensing agreement was to provide technical advice on how to conduct source selection process in order to adequately vet the qualified bidders the source selection evaluation board sseb consisted of 14 evaluators and advisors who represented us british and iraqi interests all members of the board had equal weight in their input half of the board members were iraqi this counters the oftstated assertion that the decision on awardees was made by two cpa members one of whom is assumed to be daniel sudnick and two iraqis the full composition of the sseb remains mystery see appendix l for record of sudnicks statements on the sseb this statement of cpas role is major distortion of the truth the question remains of who would have reason to lie about the process finally there remain numerous allegations of payoffs and kickbacks from the winning consortia to variety of decisionmakers including minister of communications haider alabadi dr daniel sudnick and iraqi governing council member ibrahim aljafferi since the key winning bidders experienced timely runups in their stock prices prior to the public awarding of contracts and the key stakeholdersoverlapping in multiple winners bidshave reputations as illegal money handlers involved in saddams former regime the entire process has been viewed by many iraqis as deeply corrupted three separate sources provided details of corruption for this report one identified separate source reported that on the one hand payment of 5 million was made to alabadi payment of 5 million was made to the two brits and payment to terry sullivan of 15 million with an undisclosed sum going to second american at the cpa second source identified on the other that payment of 3 million made to aljafferi and matching amount to alabadi third source two iraqi ministers identified sudnick as one of three people had been paid by auchis bagman amounts unstated if the 5 million payments above derived from the license fees then 35 million is unaccounted for from that source if sudnick was the second american then that sum could be the amount of the

that was engineered to produce three cellular license winners and one winning technology in iraq one should start with the unlikely and startling outcomethe hat trick victory of three consortia covering the entire country of saddam husseins principal finance man and then work backward to try and determine how it could have happened several groups had to come together to assure the results the british gsmfocused group who initially were tasked with the design and direction of cpa cellular communications policy their iraqi counterparts and co conspirators from the nascent ministry of communications the auchi connected groups running from mec telematik through the two kuwaiti pirate gsm operators who created the first cellular linkage between kuwait and baghdad and who became an integral part of the resulting auchi combine in iraq and finally the elements of the iraqi political leadership who could derive significant personal and political benefit from tapping these three cash cows the success of the conspiracy to fix the iraqi cellular license tender is attributable to four things first cohesion and coordination between the british architects of the system and the evolving elements of the auchi empire in practical terms this meant close cooperation at the outset between leech and his associates in baghdad and the developers of the kuwaiti pirate operators in the south this was first evident in the use of the white paper produced by one of those operators to craft the overall rfp for the system on an ongoing basis it meant the incorporation of the kuwaiti arms of the auchi combo with its orascom core using the mec telematik team which auchi brought to iraq before the war as midwives employed by the cpa the fact that terry sullivan and nick massey moved to atheer and left their coalition positions two weeks before the announcement and the rapid eradication of any sense of competitiveness between the ostensibly opposing bidders are indications of the success and indeed inexorability of the auchi planning process it required that there be buyin of their plans by the nascent ministry of communications but the ownership of the moc and the minister by ibrahim aljafferi as the head of the dawa party ensured that the moc would be wholly responsive to auchis requirements it also required that sudnick validate their contributions to the process on continuing basis but he appears to have been coopted early and remained supportive of them to the end official use onlywarning this document is the property of the department of defense inspector

general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq second the process had to be and remain unremittingly opaque as long as there was deviation in the official line regarding the ostensible terms of the process and near total absence of any information about the bidders their consortia or their financing valid criticism could be made of the principal cpa players in the process the process then became self validating third the successful execution of the conspiracy depended on timing it had to move with stealth in series of abbreviated time frames so that the absence of any telecomm system in country would become the overwhelming countervailing reality if any potential criticism or competition were to challenge the move toward auchi control after the choices were announced similarly the june 30 date for the disappearance of the cpa provided safe haven against the investigation of any wrongdoing as all decisions would then be in friendly iraqi hands the june 30 date also became another fulcrum for the countrywide imposition of the gsm standard in the frn and provided necessary final role for sudnick finally the success of the auchi takeover plan required competent and reliable facilitator in the senior communications position at cpa at the outset that required only unwavering support for gsm solution for all of iraq as the tender offering proceeded it required someone to assure devolution of the bidding process and the certainty of auchi control in all three regions sudnick created the perception as the winners were announced that he had been the overworked and understaffed victim of the wily iraqi zealots at the moc that posture however clashed with the reality of his apparently fast growing strength as the cpa telecomm tsar in baghdad the creator of new regulatory structure to replace the moc and not least the ongoing regulator of the commercial cellular system and the overseer of its incorporation in frn his ability to translate criticism from washington into support in baghdad however gave him false sense of invincibility he believed he had taken control of the cpa contracting process as it affected telecomm and was setting up what he called silicon crescent in baghdad to be the source of all telecommunications research and regulations with himself as its gray eminence in the process he forgot the elaborate web of explanations he had helped to craft both as to past and to future cpa activities the combination of his failure to implement the frn effectively and recognition of the extent he had misled everyone in both baghdad and washington led to his dismissal as senior advisor in march 2004 he was told to resign formally on april 15 and submitted his resignation april 16 although he had been relieved by gerald official

appear to be performance grounds for rescinding the licenses that of course is in addition to the inherent prohibition of any adherents of the regime of saddam hussein holding license this

iraq executive summary establishing sound telecoms infrastructure in iraq is vital to coalitionled reconstruction and redevelopment efforts transition to robust telecommunications service will lead to substantial improvements in the well being of the iraqi people historically telecommunication infrastructure has been key catalyst for economic social and political development it can do the same in iraq and for the iraqi people technological developments allow this to be done rapidly and cost effectively with wireless technology which allows easier more secure and faster implementations than traditional copper wirebased systems rapid deployment makes wireless technology well suited for iraq it can help advance the strategy of the coalition provisional authority to kickstart successful reconstruction of iraq the proper selection and implementation of the right technology is critical otherwise the resulting infrastructure may not fully meet iraqs short or longterm needs factors such as time to service standards vendor coverage tariffs license award and term selected operators and stakeholders all need to be considered carefully at the outset to ensure successful strategy for the long term this white paper outlines wireless telecommunication blueprint for iraq that addresses the challenging task faced by the coalition provisional authority to implement strategy that delivers services that are mission critical to the economic political and social future of iraq this paper assumes that the coalition provisional authority has twoyear remit to manage wireless telecommunication policy and implementation it has the task of making shortterm decisions needed to establish strong foundation for longterm development of telecommunications in iraq key measures of success in pursuing the set goal with given resources and minimum risks are ðidentification of telecommunications requirements and appropriate technological solutions to meet specific needs ðselection

official use only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq 30 mobile wireless technology strategy the future shape of iraqs telecommunications sector will be determined by the technologies chosen the international global systems for mobile communications gsm standard is the logical choice for iraqs cellular network there are numerous reasons for this first is gsms status as the predominant global cellular standard other considerations that have special significance for iraq include cost the availability of trained resources and most importantly international roaming and regional interoperability gsm is dominant throughout the middle east including iraqs neighboring countries of turkey jordan kuwait and saudi arabia the roaming capability and device interoperability that would result from building gsm network in iraq would make major contribution to its economic and political reintegration regionally and globally gsm also is the standard for international travel setting any other standard particularly one limited to the us or countries in other parts of the world would severely limit international communications out of iraq subscribers to nongsm system also would face higher costs due to limited supplies and choice 31 gsm and cdma technology comparisons gsm has distinct advantages over cdma in selecting technology standard for iraq ðroaming in the region critical for economic development trade ðcommunications needs of international business personal government users ðhandset availability compatibility competition and low cost in the region ðlarge supply of gsm engineers network operators and support resources in the region at the same time cdma is ideally suited for fixed wireless communications as in india and china this is the preferred solution in many developing markets versus traditional landline service such as india and china in this regard cdma is more cost effective than traditional pstn landlines and faster to deploy as it wireless environmentally both gsm and cdma are official use onlywarning this document is the property of the department of defense inspector

general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq better solutions than traditional landline services as there is need for extensive civil works and digging of cables in summary it is proposed that ðthe cellular technology of choice for iraq should be gsm based on middle east market trends and dominance of gsm in the region ðcdma wireless local loop cdmawll should be deployed to provide fixed wireless solutions in target areas 311 fixed wireless loop cdma cdma fixed wireless loop cdmawll can achieve telecommunication service avaibility in poor communication areas with benefits over traditional wire line systems these include ðexceptional voice quality ðhigh data speeds ðfaster to deploy ðlower cost than wireline ðeasy to bypass wireline system ðmore secure stealing of cables ðmore reliable not prone to interruption due to construction accidents ðmore environmentally friendly need to dig and uproot plantstrees ðcdma technology can be used effectively to serve fixed wireless market segments in iraq it is recommended that cdmawll be deployed close to or in parallel with the rollout of gsm cellular infrastructure 32 present cellular technologies in the middle east region as noted above gsm 9001800 is the dominant cellular technology in the middle east at least dozen countries have gsm systems there are cdma cellular commercial systems in the region the selection of cellular technology for iraq or any regional market must carefully consider the requirement for roaming between neighboring countries local expertise and handset availability choosing

authority will end when an iraqi government is installed to ensure continuity of service and evolution of the wireless infrastructure the following key steps are proposed 1the new government should be encouraged to consider the issuance of longterm licenses on par with the typical period of ten to fifteen years under the jurisdiction of new regulatory authority of iraq rai which the new government will have to establish 2it is proposed that the regulatory project team rpt before being disbanded by the interim governing authority works closely with the rai to handover the statusof play in terms of the shortterm licenses services spectrum use and management and recommendations on the regulatory strategy this will better position the newly created rai to set to work to deliver its role 3it is critical for the new rai to recognize and deliver on the terms conditions committed to the liencees in the short term licensessie the commercial incentive of first refusal etc 4to safeguard the public interest feasibility study should be conducted to research the deregulation roadmap for the iraqi wireless market based on this feasibility study recommendations should made on number of licenses to award and on what basis ie beauty contest or acquisition model 50 fixed wireless cdma strategy the primary objective of providing fixed wireless communication to the iraqi people is to provide fixed wireless communication to their homes and businesses cdmawll enables highspeed data for commercial as well as personal use cdmawll can allow data transmission speeds of 144 kbits second official use

trade page 65for official use only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq markets that require the rapid provision of lowcost fixed telecoms service such as india and china have stronger preference to cdmawll versus the traditional option of fixed wireline copper cable main factors for choice are cost and speed to implement cdmawll has shorter return on investment as an additional benefit to investors and ultimately consumers with substantially lower call rates and increase in services there are various standards of cdmawll available such as cdma 450 800 and 1900 mhz cdma systems in the 800 mhz band are the most dominant globally and will allow the greatest competition in the long term user terminals are also most easily available and cost effective in these spectrums cdma 800mhz is well suited to iraqi needs due to its larger propagation providing more effective and efficient coverage cdmawll licenses however must be restricted in use to fixed wireless communication it should not compete with the mobile wireless service to ensure its market segment is served adequately investors in the mobile wireless license with extensive capital expenditures and resources must be protected to ensure successful telecoms landscape in iraq implementing cdmawll in iraq would be somewhat more difficult than deploying gsm cellular as its necessary to install at individual fixed locations ie homes and offices across iraqi this will be difficult in some regions if there is not equal and regional distribution of licenses to at least three separate areas of the central south and north regions although its important that multiple licenses are issued for cdmawll it is important to carefully manage them and ensure they comply with the same standard and terminal complications are avoided license awards should be made by geographic regions as done in many other markets 60 recommended regulatory body for iraq with the future political structure of iraq still being defined it is proposed that the coalition provisional authority create regulatory project team rtp to oversee the development of telecommunications services for the interim and hand over its role and responsibilities to future regulatory authority of iraq rai that would be created once an iraqi government is in

only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq iraqi consumer interests by assuring wide access to reliable and high quality service it is recommended that the ira should be an independent entity with an absolute mandate to regulate all areas of telecommunications both fixed and cellular 61 mandate strategy the rai should have responsibility for setting and implementing policies stemming from those undertaken by the coalition provisional authority and others under guidance of internal subject matter experts from the international telecommunications union itu ðthe rai should have complete and undisputed control of the national spectrum and should be the sole body responsible for managing and allocating spectrum ðthe rai would oversee the transfer to iraqi responsibility of spectrum managed by the us military and the coalition provisional authority the rai should be encouraged to see that spectrum is clearly allocated between commercialmunicipality use and security military use ðboth spectrum categories should be managed by the rai separate dedicated department within the rai should manage each portion both would report to the head of the spectrum management directorate of the rai ðthe key mission of the rais responsibilities in this area should be to encourage the most efficient use of spectrum to maximize economic development and promoting high usage and service availability ðthe structure and mandate of the rai should evolve with the phased reconstruction of iraqs telecommunication infrastructure the first phase should focus on issuing the 1015year wireless licenses and providing basic telephony as basic service ðafter bot license awards the rai should work toward fully

mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq ðwhen the iraqi market is ready the rai should award license for national operators the license issue must be structured to encompass all service offerings and the economic value associated with them in the establishment of the iraqi regulatory body it is recommended that the following 10 principle guides from the gsm association are taken into consideration 1regulators should continue to seek balance between the benefits and costs of intervention on the one hand and regulatory forbearance on the other 2regulation should be based on clearly defined goals and policy objectives and should be kept to those necessary to meet key objectives 3regulators should acknowledge that normal competitive markets reflect range of operator return and should not intervene in competitive markets where one or more operators return appears to be above the norm 4regulation should fit reflect the market situation and balance the micro and macro views 5regulators should be publicly accountable and act in transparent way 6governments should adopt licensing practices that encourage new investments in telecommunication infrastructures and facilitate competition within the sector 7spectrum should be allocated on the basis of achieving economically efficient competitive and structurally desirable outcomes rather than to extract monopoly rents from the industry 8the feasibility and commercial desirability of sharing of facilities and infrastructure is matter which is operator and market specific 9restrictions on the deployment of mobile networks should be based on science and substantiated studies and not in response to public concern which is without scientific basis 10adequate consumer safeguard against the inappropriate use of customer

government is in place spectrum should be allocated on the basis of achieving economically efficient competitive and structurally desirable outcomes rather than to extract monopoly rents from the industry in principle iraqi regulators in the long run may permit secondary trading of spectrum within planned internationally frequency allocations after thorough consultation process with the industry subject matter experts spectrum is the most essential resource needed for the establishment of new and robust iraqi telecommunications infrastructure and the rai would be the single authority for spectrum management across all applications civil military broadcast aviation etc this will ensure that data base is established which can be tracked to ensure that all users are using their spectrum allocations efficiently as opposed to overstating of requirements and establishing near monopolies on prime spectrum real estate by powerful users 71 scope of the band plan it is important at the outset to have the right spectrum plan to ensure iraqi market needs can be served the band plan nominally covers the frequency range 203100 mhz the plan is designed with time horizon of roughly 8 to 10 years nevertheless it is possible that technological or other developments could necessitate an earlier revision of the band plan for instance developments at an itu world radio conference could require the band plan to be changed in certain areas perhaps even in the near future in addition there is the issue of the feasibility of sharing portion of the band now exclusively allocated to the broadcasting service between the broadcasting service and the mobile and fixed wireless access services the following scope of band of frequency allocations is in alignment with other regional middle east markets aa total of 2 x 110 mhz of spectrum is recommended to be allocated to the cellular mobile service of this 2 x 35 hz is in the 900 mhz band at 890915 935960 mhz and 880890 925935 mhz of

framework presently in iraq the starting point for the coalition provisional authority is to formulate wireless telecommunications policy to serve as point of contractual reference for ðthe terms and conditions of the first iraqi operator licenses for wireless telecommunications ðthe foundations of the regulatory framework and policies that will create an operational foundation for the iraqi wireless telecommunications market ða progressive market model that addresses the shortterm twoyear requirements and evolves to present market forces and competition and deregulate the market ðtechnology of choice and strategic initiatives to accomplish interoperability and achieve new technical standards over time in line with middle east market trends ie adoption of 25g and 3g with the urgent requirements for telecommunication in iraq it is advised that the license award and subsequent vendor selection process be managed using internationally recognized procurement and contractual guidelines the critical success of building wireless infrastructure in iraq will be dependent on the right choice of qualified consortium as the operator and more importantly the right vendor who has

inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq appendix d gsm vs cdma debate when comparing these two technologies the technical and business issues facing the military are found to be very similar to those facing any large government agency or country one of the largest issues to consider is that of next generation technology cdma and gsm technologies are now entering third major advancement in standards and implementation called third generation 3g 3g builds upon previous generations and makes significant leaps in capability 3g entirely changes the wireless landscape and is fundamental aspect of the cdma versus gsm debate international consolidation on singular version of the 3g gsm standard has not materialized as expected instead third generation gsm technology has had to reinvent itself to compete with the performance of third generation cdma traditional gsm technology is not fast enough to support high speed data and other advanced services this has resulted in new set of gsm standards incompatible with the currently used gsm this new 3g gsm standard is called umts universal mobile telephone service or wcdma wide band cdma unlike 3g cdmas upgrade path from is95a 3g gsm umts require new equipment spectrum and handsets cdma on the other hand has proven flexible enough that it provides relatively painless upgrade path 3g cdma services reuse the same spectrum allocations and existing cell site equipment with only mild upgrade allow the use of secure voice calls up to nsa type 1 not available for gsmumts and are fully backwards compatible with old cdma handsets 3g cdma allows the use of gps technology to track where any handset user isanother feature not available with gsm technology and very useful for military and public safety use an attempt at increased standardization between the two systems coordinated by the itu international telecommunications union has effectively made 3g cdma viable alternative 3g upgrade path for existing gsm operators should they choose to implement it although this alone does not guarantee compatibility between these different technologies the following bullets summarize key comparison points

technology trade page 94for official use only preliminary findings report to the inspector general into mobile telecommunications licenses in iraq ðcdma offers security advantages in terms of eavesdropping and jamming immunity over gsm networks due to its spread spectrum nature ðbecause of the move to the incompatible umts gsm is now largely deadend technology and third generation gsm standards essentially discard the existing gsm spectrum and infrastructure in contrast 3g cdma technologies reuse most of the second generation while gaining significant performance ðin addition to the exorbitant implementation expense for 3g gsm the requirement for new spectrum allocations and the inability to extend the existing gsm architecture has risked serious erosion to the traditional advantage of the gsm system international uniformity and roaming an additional threat to 3g gsm uniformity and universal roaming capability is that china the worlds largest cell phone market representing 280 million users and over 20 of the worldwide gsm user base is deploying 3g cdma technology while at the same time examining an alternative technology based on cdma known as td scdma with developmental help from siemens ðin contrast to 3g gsm implementation of 3g service for cdma networks cdma2000 is more graceful evolution that maintains backwards 2g compatibility reuses almost all existing base station equipment and is dramatically less expensive than the gsmumts deployment ðin implementing third generation service the gsm community has had to entirely abandon the older gsm radio link technology this forces most of the base station equipment to be discarded and requires operators to license entirely new frequency spectra at very high cost to deploy and operate over the old gsm infrastructure ðfor deployment of new 2g networks in developing countries cdma has an enormous advantage in that it can be directly upgraded to 3g services whereas the gsm upgrade path requires new spectrum and considerable new infrastructure ðbecause of the obvious advantages of cdma certain aspects of the cdma technology have been licensed by the gsm community however the entire standard has not been brought over and underlying legacy technology issues which still hamper gsm have been retained making it incompatible with cdma official use onlywarning this document is the

tenacious french investigative magistrates who issued an international arrest warrant for auchi in 2000 it stated that auchi is suspect of complicity in the misuse of company assets and receiving embezzled assets for tony blair the events in france may have seemed unimportant but scandal was about to cross the channel in spectacular fashion auchi despite being one of the countrys richest men

knows iraq extremely well as they have been working there since long before the us liberation this means that they would likely have been working under the oilforfood program where funds were controlled and dispersed through bnp paribas it is interesting to note that auchi key player in the oilforfood program and the largest single shareholder in bnp paribas uses luxembourgbased holding
