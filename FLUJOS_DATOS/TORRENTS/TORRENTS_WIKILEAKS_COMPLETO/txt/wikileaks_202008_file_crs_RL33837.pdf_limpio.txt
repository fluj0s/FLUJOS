summary on october 16 2002 president bush signed the authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of 2002 since the march 2003 invasion of iraq congress has enacted appropriation bills to f und the continuation of the iraq war including military training reconstruc tion and other aid for the government of iraq in april 2007 however congress passed supplemental appropriations bill to fund the war th at contained cond itions and deadline fo r ending some military operations the president vetoed the bill arguing in part that some of its provisions are unconstitutional the current dispute is centered on whether congress has the constitutional authority to legislate limits on the presidents authority to conduct military operations in iraq even though it did not initially pr ovide express limits specific issues include whether congress may through limitations on appropriations set ceiling on the number of soldiers or regulate which soldiers the president may assign to duty in iraq and whether an outright repeal or expiration of the authorization for use of military force aumf against iraq would have any effect it has been suggested that the presidents role as commander in chief of the armed forces provides sufficient authority for his deployment of troops and any efforts on the part of congress to intervene could represent an unconstitutional violation of separationofpowers princi ples while even proponents of strong executive prerogative in matters of war appear to concede that it is within congresss authority to cut off funding entirely fo r military opera tion it s been suggested that spending measures that restrict but do not end fi nancial support for the war in iraq would amount to an unconstitutiona l condition the question may turn on whether specific proposals involve purel operational decisions committed to the president in his role as commander in chief or whether they are instead valid exercises of congresss authority to allocate resources using its war powers and power of the purse this report begins by providing background discussing constitutional provisions allocating war powers between congress and the president and presenting historical overview of re levant court cases it di scusses congresss power to rescind prior military authoriza tion concluding in light of relevant jurisprudence and the war powers resolution that the repeal of the aumf absent the further denial of appropriations or the tablishment of specific d eadline for troop withdrawal would likely have little if any legal effect on the

presidents decisions on troop deployment nd mission assignment are purely operational decisions committed to the president in his role as commander in chief or whether cong ressional action to limit the ava ilability of troops and the missions they may perform is valid exercise of congresss authority to allocate resources using its war power s and power of the purse background on october 16 2002 congress passed and president bush signed the authorization for use of military fo rce against iraq resolution of 20025 while the president noted he had sought resoluti on of support from congress to use force against iraq and appreciated receiving that support he also stated that my request for it did not and my signing this resolution does not constitute any change in the longstanding positions of the executive branch on either the presidents constitutional authority to use force to deter prevent or respond to aggression or other threats to us interests or on the constitutionality of the war powers resolution6 the president indicated he would continue to consult with congress and to submit written reports to congress every 60 days on matters relevant to the resolution to use force7 which authorizes the president to us the armed forces of the united states as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states agai nst the continuing threat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq the statute required certain conditions to be met prior to the initiati on of military operations and made periodi c reports to congress manda tory but did not set timetable or any criteria for determining when to withdraw troops from iraq it appears to incorporate future security council resolutions concerning iraq that may be adopted by the security council as well as those adopted prior to its enactment effectively authorizing military force not only to compel disarmament but to carry out other functions necessary for achieving the goals adopted or that may be adopted by the security council thus it ppears that the resolution authorizes forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs3 8 cincinnati soap co v unite d states 301 us 308 321 1937 9 fullilove v klutznick 448 us 448 474 1980 south dakota v dole 483 us 203 20607 1987 for scholarly

for so long as iraq poses continuing threat to the united states and the us military presence is not inconsistent with relevant resolutions the resolution does not itself stipulate limitations with respect to the amount of force that may be used or the resources that may be expended to accomplish the authorized objectives however congress may set limits by means of legislation or the budgeting process the department of defense has some latitude regarding how it allocates funds for various operations nd may have additiona l statutory authority to obligate funds without additional pr ior express authorization from congress i constitutional provisions at least two arguments support the cons titutionality of congresss authority to limit the pres idents ability to increase or maintain tr oop levels in iraq first congresss constitutional power over the nations armed forces provides ample authority to legislate with respect to how they may be employe d under article i 8 congress has the power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defenceto rais and support armies to provide and maintain navy to make rules for th government and re gulation of the land and naval forces and to declare war gr ant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capt ures on land and water as well as to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union suppress insurrections and repel invasions and to provide for orga nizing arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states further congress is empowered to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers as well as all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof secondly congress has virtually plenary constitutional power over appropriations one that is not qualified with reference to its powers in section 8 article i 9 provides that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriati ons made by law it is well established as consequence of these provisions that money can be paid out of the treasury unless it has been appropriate d by an act of congress8 and that congress can specify the terms and conditions under whic h an appropriation may be used9 so long as it does not impose an unconstitutional c ondition on the use of the funds10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs4 10 continued 1946invalidating as bill of attainder an

faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and to the best of his ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states id 1 cl 8 it is clear that the constitution allocates powers necessary to conduct war between the president and congress while the ratification record of the constitution reveals little about the meaning of the sp ecific war powers clauses the importance of preventing all of those powers from accumulating in one branch appears to have been well understood11 and vesting the powers of the sword and the purse in separate hands appears to have been part of careful design12 it is generally agreed that some aspects of the exercise of those powers are reserved to the commander in chief and that congress could conceivably legislate beyond its authority in such way as to intrude impermissibly into presidential power the precise boundaries separatin g legislative from executive functions however remain elusive there can be little doubt that congress would exceed its bounds if it were to confer exclusive power to direct military operations on an officer not subordinate to the president13 or to purport to issue military orders directly to subordinate officers14 at the same time congresss power to make rules for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs5 14 continued johnsons efforts to circumvent the statute were

and regulation of the arme d forces provides it wide latitude for restricting the nature of orders the president may give congresss power of appropriations gives it ample power to s upply or withhold resources even if the president deems them necessary to carry out planned military operations15 congresss war powers the power to declare war has long been construed to mean not only that congress can formally take the nation into war but also that it can authorize the use of the armed forces fo r military expeditions that may not amount to war16 while restrictive interpretation of the power to declare war is possible for example by viewing the framers use of the verb to declare rather than to make17 as an indication of an intent to limit congresss ability to affect the course of war once it is validly commenced18 congresss other powers over the use of the military would likely fill any resulting void in practice courts have not sought to delineate the boundaries of each clause relating to war powers or identify gaps between them to find specific powers that are denied to congress19 early exercises of congresss war power s may shed some light on the original understanding of how the

whether the absence of specific authority was meant to be limitation see sofaer supra note 20 at 14754 the john adams administration interpreted the legislation restrictively and instructed naval

sometimes raised forces for specific purposes which may be viewed as both an implicit authorization to use the forces for such purposes and as an implicit limitation on their use23 on the other hand congress often dele gated broad discretion to the president within those limits and appears to have acquiesced to military actions that were not explicitly authorized24 in several early instances congress authorized the president to use military forces for operations that did not amount to full war rather than declaring formal war with france congress authorized the employment of the naval

citizens and subjected them to mistreatment27 congress also authorized us merchant vessels to defend themselves against french vessels28 the supreme court treated these statutes as authorizing state of partial war between the united states and france29 such an undeclared war was described as an imperfect war as distinguished from solemn or perfect war declared as such in that in the first case all members of one nation are at war with all members of the other nation in the second case those who are aut horized to commit hostilities act under special authority30 this suggests an early understa nding that congresss war powers extend to establishing the scope of hostilities to be carried out by the armed forces in the majority of cases however it appears that congre ss has given broad deference to the president to decide how much of the armed forces to employ in given situation after tripoli declared war against the united states in 1801 and us vessels were already engaged in fensive actions against them congress did not enact full declaration of war rather it issued sweeping authorization for the commissioning of privateers captures and other actions to equip officer man and employ such of the armed vessels of the unite d states as may be judged requisite by the president of the united states for protecting effectually the commerce and seamen thereof on the atlantic ocean the diterranean and adjoining seas as well as to cause to be done all such other acts of precaution or hostility as the state of war will justify and may in his opinion require 31 in declaring war against great britain in 1812 congress authorized the pres ident to use the whole land and naval force of the united states to carry the same into effect and to issue to private armed vessels of the united states commissions or letters of marque nd general reprisal in such form as he shall think proper32 that congress has traditionally left it up to the president to decide how much of the armed forces to employ in given conflict need not imply that such deference is constitutionally mandated the fact that congress has seen fit to include suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs8 33 see eg

1808language may just as easily be read as an indication that congress believes that the decision is its to delegate under this view even in the case of declaration of war congress retains the power to authorize th president to use only portion of the armed forces to engage in particular c onflict on the other hand some have argued that the president is authorized to deploy ll of the armed forces as he sees fit with or without an express authorization to use force or declaration of war33 according to this theory in essence congress can stop the deployment of military forces only by cutting appropriations nd discharging the troops congress has also used its authority to provide for the organization and regulation of the armed forces to regulate how military pe rsonnel are to be organized and employed the earliest statutes prescribed in fairly precise terms how military units were to be formed and commanded for example the 1798 act establishing the marine corps mandated the raising of corps to consist of one major four captains sixteen first lieutenants twelve second lieut enants fortyeight sergeants fortyeight corporals thirtytwo drums and fifes and seven hundred and twenty privates34 congress authorized the president to appoint certain other officers as necessary if he were to assign the marine corps or any pa rt of it to shore duty and to assign the detachment to duty in forts and garrisons of the united states on the seacoast or any other duty on shore officers of the ma rine corps could be detached to serve on board frigates and other ar med vessels the marine co rps was increased in size and reorganized in 1834 to be commanded by colonel with the proviso that marine corps officer could be placed in command of navy yard or vessel of the united states35 it appears to have been understood th at personnel and units authorized to perform certain duties could not be ssigned to perform other duties without authorization from congress in 1808 when congress authorized eight new regiments of specific types and compositi on it felt compelled to include language making members of the light dragoon reg iment liable to serve on foot as light infantry until sufficient horses and ot her accouterments c ould be provided36 the supreme court later interpreted an 1802 st atute providing for the establishment of the corps of engineers although broadly worded to permit the president to direct that its members serve such duty in such places as he saw fit to authorize only engineering dutieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs9 37 gratiot v united states 40 us

engineers upon any other duty except such as belongs either to military engineering or to civil engineering37 the commanderinchief clause early in the nations history the commanderinchief pow er was understood to connote nothing more than the s upreme command and direction of the military and naval forces as first general and admiral of the confederacy38 concurring in that view in 1850 chief justice taney stated the presidents duty and his power are purely military as commanderin chief he is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy39 this formula taken alone provides only an approximate demarcation of the line separating congresss role from the presidents advocates of strong role for congress might characterize legislativ effort to limit the number of troops available in iraq as placing troops b law under the presidents command while proponents of strong executive woul d likely view it as limitation on the presidents ability to employ them in the manner he sees fit with respect to the latter argument however it should be noted that the particular question before the fleming court did not call into question the ex tent to which congress could restrict the manner of employing troops once pl aced at the command of the president other early cases demonstrate congresss authority to restrict the presidents options for the conduct of war in little v barreme 40 chief justice marshall had occasion to recognize congressional war power and to deny the exclusivity of presidential power there after congress had authorized limited hostilities with france us vessel under orders from the president had seized what its commander believed was us merchant ship bound from french port allegedly carrying contraband material congre ss had however provided by statute only for seizure of such vessels bound to french ports41 upholding an award of damages to the ships owners for wrongful seizure the chief justice said it is by means clear that the president of the united states whose high duty it is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and who is commander in chief of the armies and navies of th united states might not without any special authority for that purpose in th then existing

absent such authorization seizure authorized by the president was void the onset of the civil war provided some grist for later assertions of unimpeded presidential prerogative in matters of war in the prize cases 46 the supreme court sustained the blockade of southern ports instituted by president lincoln in april 1861 at time when congress was not in session congress had at the first opportunity ratified the presidents actions47 so that it was not necessary for the court to consider the constitutional basis of the presidents action in the absence of congressional authorization or in the face of any prohibition nevertheless the court approved the blockade fiveto four as an exercise of pr esidential power alone on the basis that state of war was fact nd that the nation being

follows the power to make the necessary laws is in congress the power to execute in the president both powers imply many subordinate and auxiliary powers each includes all authorities essential to its due exercise but neither can the president in war more than in peace intrude upon the proper authority of congress nor congress upon the proper authority of the president52 the chief justice described

states were invalid without congressional approval despite the govern ments assertion that the commander in chiefs power to make an effectual use of his forces must include the power to arrest and

discretion when acting with respect to matters of foreign affairs than may be the case when only domestic issues are involved in that case congress concerned with the outside arming of the belligerents in the war between paraguay and bolivia had authorized the president to proclaim an arms embargo if he found that such action might contribute to peaceful resolution of the dispute president franklin roosevelt issued the requisite finding and proclamati on and curtisswright and associate companies were indicted for violating the embargo they challenged the statute arguing that congress had failed adequately to elaborate standards to guide the presidents exercise of the power thus delegated59 justice sutherland concluded that the limitations on delegation in the domestic field were irrelevant where foreign affairs are involved resu lt he based on the premise that foreign relations is exclusively an executive function combined with his constitutional model positing that internationally the power of the federal government is not one of enumerated but of inherent powers emanating from cepts of sovereignty rather than the constitution the court affirm ed the convictions stating that it is important to bear in mind that we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in the president by an exertion of legislative power but with such an authority plus the very delicate plenary and exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations power which does not require as basis for its exercise an act of congress but which of course like ev ery other governmental power must be exercised in subordination to the applicab provisions of the constitution it is quite apparent that if in the maintenance of our international relations embarrassment perhaps serious embarrassment is to be avoided and success for our aims achieved congressional legislation which is to be made effective through negotiation and inquiry w ithin the international field must often accord to the president degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were

d the powers exercised by the president was described by justice jackson concurring in the steel seizure case63 the constitution expressly places in congress power to raise and support armies and to provide and maintain navy this certainly lays upon congress primary responsibility for supplying the armed forces congress alone controls the raising of revenues and their appropriation and may determine in what manner and by what means they shall be spent for military and naval procurement there are indications that the constitu tion did not contemplate that the title commander in chief of the army and navy will constitute him also commander in chief of the country its industries and its inhabitants he has monopoly of war powers whatever they are while congress cannot deprive the president of the command of the army and navy only congress can provide him any army or navy to command the jackson opinion is commonly understood to establish that whatever powers the president may

during the constitutional conven tion motion was made by one of the delegates to modify the draft document by adding the words and peace after the words to declare war74 this motion however was unanimously rejected convention records do not clearly evidence the framers intent in rejecting the motion some early constitutional commentators suggested that the motion failed because the framers believed that the power to make peace more naturally belonged to the treatymaking body as conflicts between nations were typically resolved through treaties of peace75 although the framers did not

the framers failure to designate single political branch responsible for returning the country from state of war to st ate of peace the power to make peace was likely understood to be shared power with each branch having the authority on terminating military conflict78 the executive could return the country to state of peace through treaty with the warring party subject to the senates advice

foreign nations or its power to make laws necessary and proper to effectuate its constitutional powers79 regardless of the framers intent the legislative and executive branches have historically

rescinding military authorization versus cutting appropriations procedural and other considerations as procedural matter it is more difficult for congress to terminate authorization for military conflict than to limit appropriations necessary for the continuation of hostilities as in the cas of ordinary legislation congressional declarations of peace and rescissions of milita ry authorization have historically taken the form of bill or joint resolution passed by both houses and presented to the president for signature85 like other legislation ch measures are subject to presidential veto which congress may overri only with twothirds majority of each house86 in contrast congresss ability to deny funds for the continuation of military hostilities is not contingent upon the enactment of positive law though such denial may take the form of positive enactment87 although the president has the power to veto legislative proposals he cannot compel congress to pass legislation including

would be required to override presidential veto simple major ity of single house could prevent the appropriation of funds necessary for th continuation of military conflict 88 it should be noted however that legislation probably would be required to prevent the president from exercising statutory authority to transfer certain funds appropriated to other operations for use in support of the military conflict that congress was attempting to limit like other positive legi slation such meas ure would be subject to presidential veto while it may be procedurally easier for congress to refuse appropriations for military conflict than to rescind military authorization policy considerations may sometimes make the latter option more appealing for example some members of congress who support the winding down of military operation might nevertheless be reluctant to reduce the funds for troops on the battlefield there might also be concerns over potential effects that nial of appropriati ons might have on unrelated military operations although appr opriations legislati on can be crafted to effectively terminate hostilities wh ile permitting f unding of force protection measures during the orderly redeployme nt of troops from the battlefi eld such legislation like other positive enactments would be subject to presidential veto in certain circumstances president may be more willing to agree to rescission of military authorization than to an appropriations bill that limits the funding of military operations particularly if the re scission does not include deadline for troop withdrawal indeed dur ing the vietnam war congress was able to rescind military authorization at an earlier date than it was able to cut off appropriations in 1971 cong ress passed and president nixon signed measure rescinding the 1964 gulf of tonkin reso lution which had pr ovided congressional authorization for us military operations against north vietnam89 the mansfield amendment enacted later that year called for the prompt and orderly withdrawal of us troops from indochina at the earliest possible date90 however these measures did not include deadline fo r troop withdrawal although us troop presence in south vietnam diminished considerably pursuant to the nixon administrations vietnamization strategy even prior to these enactments the united states continued significant air bombi

either prohibited funds from being used for certain military operations in southeast asia or required complete withdrawal of us troops from vietnam in 1973 two years after rescinding military

vietnam and served primarily to end the aerial bombing campaign in cambodia and prevent us forces from being reintroduced into hostilities in sum in situations where congress seeks to prevent the executives continuation of military combat operations it may be procedurally easier for congress to deny appropriations than it would be to statutorily compel withdrawal from hostilities however past experience suggests that at least in certain circumstances policy considerations may cause the two branches to view the rescission of military authoriz ation as more appealing alternative postponing an interbranch conflict on appropriations for later da enabling congress to signal its interest in winding down conflict and at least temporarily preserving the presidents discretion as to how the conflict is waged legal consequences of congr essional rescission of military authorization absent additional congressional action although congress has the power to resc ind authorization of military conflict or enact declaration of peace the practical effect that such an action might have on the presidents ability to continue military conflict may nevertheless remain difficult to predict historically courts have been unwilling to interpret congressional rescission of military authorization as barring the executive from continuing to wage military campaign at least so long as congress continues to appropriate money in support of such operations although the war powers resolution establishes proce dures by which congress may direct the withdrawal of us troops from military conflicts that lack statutory authorization the constitutionality and practical effects of these requirements have been questioned finally even in the absence of express congressional authorization the president may possess some inherent or implied power as commander in chief to continue to engage in certain military operations the following sections explain these points in greater detail judicial interpretation jurisprudence suggests that courts would not necessarily view repeal of prior aut horization by itself as compelling the immediate withdrawal of us forces as an overarching matter

were truly meant to further continuing hos tilities would necessar ily require the interrogation of members of congress regarding what they intended by their votes and then synthesization of the

the president at the very least from escalating hostilities though the court of appeals for the second circuit suggested in 1971 case that this argument might be valid103 subsequent rulings indicated that the court would only be willing to consider this argument in very limited circumst ances notably in the 1973 case of dacosta v laird 104 the second circuit court of app eals dismissed challenge

the court inferred from this language that military activities at issue in the case before it occurring before this deadline were authorizedenactments ordering the withdrawal of us troops at the earliest practicable date the circuit court dismissed this challenge because it raised nonjusticiable political question deciding such case would requi re the court to assess the strategy and tactics used by the executive to wind down conflict an assessment it was ill equipped to make judges deficient in military knowledge lacking vital information upon which to assess the nature of battlefield decisions and sitting thousands of miles from the field of action cannot reasonably determine whether specific military operation constitutes an escalation of the war or is merely new tactical approach within continuing strategic plan what if fo r example the war deescalates so that it is waged as it was prior to the mining of north vietnams harbors and then escalates again are the courts requi red to oversee the conduct of the war on daily basis away from the scene of action in this instance it was the presidents view that the mining of north vietnams harbor was necessary to preserve the lives of american soldiers in south vietnam and to bring the war to close history will tell whether or not that assessment was correct but without the benefit of such extended hindsight we are powerless to know105 though the circuit court did not completely rule out the possibility that further escalation of hostilities could be deemed unlawful the court suggested it would be willing to consider such arguments only in the most limited of circumstances for example the court suggested that radical change in the character of war operations as by an intentional policy of indisc riminate bombing of civilians without any military objective might be sufficiently measurable judicially to warrant courts consideration106 in holtzman v schlesinger decided later that year the second circuit court of appeals reversed lower court decision that had declared unlawful the continued bombing of cambodia following the remova l of us troops nd prisoners of war from vietnam the circuit court held th at it was nonjusticiable political question as to whether the bombing violated th mansfield amendments instruction that hostilities be terminated at th earliest practicable date comparing the situation with that at issue in dacosta the court found that the challe nge raised precisely the questions of fact involving military and di plomatic expertise not vested in the judiciary107 further

report rl32267 the war powers resolution after thirty years by richard f grimmett 111 the wording of the war powers resolution makes clear that appropriations in support of military operations does not in itself constitute specific statutory au thorization of those operations for purposes of wpr requirements see wpr 8a noting that authorization is not to be inferred from provisions cont ained in any appropriation act unless such provision specifically authorizes the intr oduction of united states armed forces into hostilities and states that it is intended to c onstitute specific statutory authorization 112 462 us 919 1983taken together these cases suggest th at reviewing court would probably not interpret repeal of prior military authorization as requiring the immediate withdrawal of us forces from ongoing hostilities in iraq further courts may be reluctant to assess whether specific military tactics or strategies pursued by the executive constitute an impermissible escalation of conflict in the aftermath of such repeal109 accordingly it does not appear that the termination of direct authorization to use force absent additional action such as the denial of appropriations or possibly the inclusi on of an unambiguous deadline for troop withdrawal would be interpreted by revi ewing court as constraining the executives ability to continue us combat operations implications of the war powers resolution the consequences of repeal of an authorization to use military force were arguably made more significant with the enactment of the war powers resolution wpr110 enacted in 1973 over president nixons veto the wpr was an effort by congress to reassert its role in matters of war role that many members believed had been allowed to erode during the korean and vietnam conflicts among other things the wpr establishes procedure by which congress may theoretically compel the president to withdraw us forces from foreignbase d conflicts when declarati on of war or authorization to use military force has been terminated specifically wpr 5c provides that at any time that united states armed forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the united states its possessi ons and territories without declaration of war or specific statutory authorizati on such forces shall be removed by the president if the congress so directs by concurrent resolution while 5c offers mechanism by which congress might compel presidential compliance with law that had rescinded statutory authorization to use military force111 its constitutional validity is

constitutionality of the war powers resolution 70 va l rev 101 130132 1984 the legitimacy of this argument is untested and highly controversial as congress has always presented declaration of war or authorization to use military force to the president further even assuming arguendo that declaration of war does not need to be presented to the president it is not ne cessarily clear that legislation ending hostilities would also not require presentment see henkin supra note 55 at 127 379 carter supra at 130132 describing weaknesses of argume nt against presentment requirement see also sidak supra

armed attack upon the united states 50 usc 1554 the 60day deadline is automatically extended fo r thirty days if the president determines and certifies to the congress in writing that unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of united states armed forces requires th continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about pr ompt removal of such forces 117 pl 107243 5 c congress declares that this section is intended to constitute specific authorization within th meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution 118 see dacosta 448 f2d at 1369 the repeal of gulf of tonkin resolution did not wipe continuedentirety113 accordingly concurrent or simp resolution could not be used as legislative veto against ex ecutive action although the chadha court did not expressly find wpr 5c to be unconstitutional it was listed in justice whites dissent as one of nearly 200 legislative ve toes for which the majority had sounded the death knell114 and most commentators have agreed with this assessment115 thus it seems highly unlikely that the wpr could be used to enforce congressional repeal of an authorization to use military force in iraq section 5b of the wpr establishes requirement for the withdrawal of us troops 60 days after armed forces are introduced without congressi onal authorization into situation where hostilities are imminent unless congress enacts legislation providing authority for the use of force or extends the deadline116 this provision would not appear to supply means by wh ich congress could compel the withdrawal of us forces from iraq as the introduc tion of those forces was done pursuant to congressional authorization117 even if congress were to rescind that authorization the legality of actions taken pursuant to it would not be nullified118 r g u b l httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs28 118 continued out its history nor could it have the effect of nunc pro tunc action 119 pl 93148 4a 5b the reporting requi

into hostilities see m ichael j glennon constitutional diplomacy 103 1990explaining that the omission of requirement for the president to specify whether report is submitted pursuant to 4a1 or 4a2 or 3 makes it impossible to know whether the sixty day time period has been triggered 120 in addition it could be argued that even if congress repealed the aumf the subsequent appropriation of funds in support of military ope rations would constitute legal authorization for such activity at least in circumstances where congress intended appropriations to support further hostilities rather than simply to protect troops already in the field see olc opinion on hostilities in kosovo supra note 97 at 3352 discussing instances in which appropriations suggest clear intent by cong ress to authorize further hostilities and arguing that the wpr cannot be read to deny legal ffect tothe clear intent of congress to use appropriations measures to authorize further hostilities 121 see glennon supra note 119 at 104 noting efforts with respect to lebanon in 1983 pl 98119 and grenada in which case ch final triggering legislation emerged despite both houses having passed measures to that effect the necessity for separate legislation to trigger the triggering provision subject as it is to presidential veto seems to defeat the purpose for 5b see id at 105 opining that the provisions central objective was to create selfactivating mechanism to c ontrol abuse of presidential discretion in the event congress lacked the backbone to do so 122 see supra at 915however substantial increase in troop leve ls that takes place subsequent to any repeal of the authorization for use of military force against iraq could trigger the requirements of wpr 5b119 although it is unclear how large such an increase would need to be before it woul d be sufficiently substantial120 congress has in the past enacted or considered legislation declaring the 60day limit to have taken effect although apparently with little practical effect121 in any case it appears that wpr section 5c which per mits congress to compel the withdrawal of us troops via concurrent resolution wa s intended to address situa tions where congress desired an end to previously authorized hostilities inherent presidential authorit to use military force absent congressional authorization even in the absence of express congressional authorization it is wellreco gnized that the president may still employ military force in some circumstances pursuant to his pow ers as commander in chief and his inherent authority in the area of foreign affairs122 at least so long as statute stands in his way president would likely argue that this inherent authority would permit him to instruct us forces to engage in certain military operations related to an ongoing conflict even if statutory authoriza tion for us participation in that conflict had been rescinded further even if cong ress were to enact legislation requiring the cessation of military operations after specified date it is highly unlikely that this measure would be interpreted to prohibit any and all military operations specificallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs29 123 for example even after congress enacted legislation cutting off funding for all combat operations in indochina president fords subs equent use of military forces to evacuate us citizens and third country nationals was not seriously questioned nor was subsequent authorization of an operation to rescue the crew of the mayaguez from cambodian

any other provision of w funds may be used the phrase none of the funds appropria ted in this act limits only funds appropria ted and made available in the act that carries the rest riction but not

that the language in question is germane it remains in the bill and the point of order that it constitutes legislation is dismissed and is not presente d to the presiding officer for ruling if majority of the senate votes that language is not germane the presiding officer then rules on whether it constitutes legislation if the point of order is sustained the language is removed if it is

of general counsel ii principles continuedas mentioned earlier the intent of thes house and senate ru is to separate authorizing and appropriatin g functions by constraining the bodies from enacting legislation in appropriations bills but prohibiting use of funds for purpose or purposes does not contravene the house or senate rule provided that the prohibition applies only to funds appropriated in the b ill being considered because an appropriations act generally funds progra ms for fiscal year each provision contained in the act is presumed to be in effect only until the end of the fiscal year provision contained in an annual appropriation act is not to be construed as permanent legisl ation unless the language used therein or the nature of the provision makes it clear that congress intended it to be permanent the presumption can be overcome if the provision uses language indicating futurity or if the provision is of general character bearing relation to the object of the appropriation the most common word of futurity is hereafter and provisions using this term have often been construed to be permanent132 other words of futurity include after the da of approval of this act henceforth and specific references to future fiscal years133 while including word or words of futur ity has the effect of making provision extend beyond the fiscal year covered by an appropriations act such provision would constitute legislation th at would appear to be subj ect to point of order under house rule xxi clause 2 and senate standing rule xvi during congressional consideration if the pa rliamentary impediments can be overcome however such legislation may be enacted and become valid law availability of alternative funds fundamental principle in appropriations law is that appropriations may not be augmented with funds from outside s ources without statutory authority as general proposition an agency may not augment its appropriations from outside sources without sp ecific statutory authority when congress makes an appropriation it also is establishing an au thorized program level in other words it is telling the agency that it cannot opera beyond the level that it can finance under its appropriation to permit an agency to operate beyond this level with funds derived from some other source without specific congressional sanction would amount to usurpation of the cong ressional prerogative restated the objective of the rule against augmentation of appropriations is to prevent government agency from undercutting the congressional power of the purse by circuitously exceeding the amount cong ress has appropriated for that activity134httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33837crs34 134 continued of appropriations law 6162 3d ed 2006 135 id at 6163 136 id

31 usc 1301 appropriated funds may be used only for the purposes for which they are appropriated criminal provisi on 18 usc 209 prohibits supplementing the salary of an officer or employee of the

fiscal year 1991 pl 101403 1990 passed before the first gulf war section 202 added new section 2608 to title 10 of the united states code to au thorize any person foreign government or international organization to contribute mone or real or personal property for use by the department of defense however before the depar tment of defense could spend the funds they had to be fi rst appropriated by congress the purpose statute states that funds may be used only for purposes for which they have been appropriated by imp lication it precludes using funds for purposes that congress has prohibited when congre ss states that funds may be used for purpose an agency would vi olate the purpose statute if it should use funds for that purpose it also in some circumstances could contravene provision of the antideficiency act 31 usc 1341 section 1341 prohibits entering into obligations or expending funds in advance of or in excess of an amount appropriated unless authorized by law if congress s barred using funds for purpose entering into an obligation or expending any amount for it would violate the act by exceeding the amount zero that congress has appropriated for the prohibited purpose136 to determine whether an agency has violated the antideficiency act it would be necessary to review the language in an appropriations act or authorizing statute that includes prohibition on using funds fo r specific purpose if an appropriations act prohibits using funds in this act fo r purpose for example expending any amount from that act for the prohibited pur pose would appear to contravene the antideficiency act because c ongress has appropriated zero funds for it entering into obligations or expending funds if an that may be available from different appropriations act or other fund for that purpose however would not appear to be prohibited by the antideficiency act an agency would be able to use funds from sources other than the appropriations act that contains the prohibition or limitation violating the antideficiency act would be significant because it has notification and penalty provisions not found in the pur pose statute the purpose statute does not

precise scope of congresss ability to limit the deployment of us military forces has not been ruled upon by the cour ts and it is therefore unclear whether legislative measures limiting the use of particular military pe rsonnel during wartime would ever be deemed to be an uncons titutional infringement upon the presidents authority as commander in chief174 nonetheless historical practice suggests that at least in some circumstances congress may oblige the president to comply with certain requirements on the deployment of particular military personnel including during periods of armed conflict analysis and conclusion much of the historical debate over war powers has taken place in the context where president has initiated the use of military force with ambiguous or congressional authorization wh ich is not the case here there is obvious reason however to suppose that congresss c onstitutional power to limit hostilities depends on whether the hostilities were initiated with congresss express approval at the outset175 likewise it does not seem consistent to suggest that congresss authority to limit the scope of hostilities may be exercised validly only at the initiation of hostilities without opportunity for changi ng course once troops are engaged in modern times federal cour ts have been reticent to decide cases involving war powers on the merits176 including those

most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people for obtaining redress of every grievance and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure despite congresss wellestablished au thority over appropr iations it has been argued that the power of the purse cannot be wielded in such way as to fetter the discretion of the commander in chief181 congresss power of the purse is subject to the same constitutional restrictions as any other legislative enactment including those that affect allocation of powers among the three branches182 that is congress cannot use appropriations measures to achieve unconstitutional results although it might in some circumstances achieve similar resu lt simply by failing to

however adds little to the analysis congress has ample constitutional authority to enact legislation that restricts the scope of military operations if congress can enact limitation on the conduct of military operations directly it can do so through appropriations the larger question remains whether the limitation enacted amounts to an unconstituti onal usurpation of the actual conduct of war some commentators agree that congress s the authority to cut off funds for military operations entirely but assert that partial cutoff or limitation on the use of funds would amount to an unconstitutiona l condition by interfering with the presidents authority to conduct battlefiel d operations185 there has been some suggestion in the past that the president s responsibility to provide for troops in the field justifies further deployments w ithout prior authorization from congress186 with some arguing that the president has an independent implied spe nding power to carry out these responsibilities187 these arguments do not easily square with congresss established prerogative to limit the scope of wars through its war powers and do not conform with congress s absolute authority to appropriate funds congress has frequently although not invariably acceded to presidential initiatives involving the use of military fo rce while history of congressional acquiescence may create gloss on the constitutional allocation of powers188 such gloss will not necessarily withstand an expr ess statutory mandate to the contrary it does not appear that congress has develope d sufficiently consistent or lengthy historical practice to have abandoned either its war pow er or its authority over appropriations the executive branch has objected to legislative proposals it views as intrusive into presidential power in cluding conditions found in appropriations measures189 and it remains possible to cons true the function of conducting military operations broadly to find impermissible c

citing with approval the legislative record describing the articles of war as not intende d to exclude the inherent power residing in the president of the united states under the constitution id at 557 the senate committee explained further in this state of the history of legislati on and practice and in consideration of the nature of the office of commander in chie f of the armies of the united states the committee is of opinion that the acts of congress which have authorized the constitution of general courtsmartial by an officer commanding an army department etc are instead of being restrictive of the power of the commander in chief separate acts of legislation and merely provide for the constitution of general courtsmartial by officers subordinate to the commander in chief and who without such legisla tion would not possess that power and that they do not in any manner control or restrain th commander in chief of the army from exercising the power which the committee think in the absence of legislation expressly prohibitive resides in him fro m the very nature of his office and which as has been stated has always been exercised id at 55758 even recognizing the inherent pow er of the president to convene courts martial however the court proceeded to explore whether the articles of war had been properly applied the case appears to demonstrate that congress may regulate the exercise of inherent commanderinchief powers as long as it does not extinguish them completely 191 see little v barreme 6 us 2 cr 170 1804 ex parte milligan 71 us 4 wall 2 1866 youngstown

directly related to the allocation of resour ces at the presidents disposal and would therefore not appear to interfere impermissibly with the presidents ability to exercise command and control over
