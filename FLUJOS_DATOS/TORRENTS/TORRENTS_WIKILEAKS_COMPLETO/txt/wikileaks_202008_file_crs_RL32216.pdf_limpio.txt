emphasized that as part of the departme nt of defenses transformation initiative new force structures must be accompanied by new base structure and added that brac 2005 should be the means by which we reconfigure our current infrastructure bases into one in which operational capacity maximizes both war fighting capability and efficiency3 he then directed that the process begin immediately it was in effect the formal launching of dods 2005 base closure imple mentation process4 the secretary of defense also revealed in his memo particularly important brac 2005 objective namely exa mining and implementing opportun ities for greater joint activity as means of achieving more efficient base structure he explained that prior brac rounds had analyzed functions on unique servicetoservice approach and therefore di d not benefit from joint exa mination of functions that cross services it would appear for example that dods network of research laboratories medical facilities mainte nance depots and testing and evaluation facilities will become prime candidates for consolid ation in the next round in respect to the selection process secretary rumsfeld declared that dod would not make any binding closure or rea lignment decisions prior to the submission of its final recommendations to the ne w brac commission in may 2005 it should be noted however that his statement left open the possibility if not likelihood of dod conducting internal non binding deliberations to underscore the importance of the ne w brac round secretary rumsfeld has created two office of the s ecretary of

defense must develop force structure plan based on an assessment of the probable threats to the national security over 20 year period beginning with fy2005 he is also required to estima the endstrength levels and the major military force units needed to meet such threats finally the secretary of defense must estimate the an ticipated level of funding that will be necessary to carry out the plan comprehensive inventory second the secretar of defense is required to conduct comprehensive inventory of us military in stallations he must under the terms of the new brac law determine the anticipated need and availability of military installations outside the united states in addition the s ecretary of defense must give special consideration to any efficiencies that might be gained from the use of joint tenancy by more than one branch of the armed forces at military installation selection criteria third the secretary of defense must deve lop set of criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment he must address broad range of military fiscal and environmental considerations likely to aff ect closure and realignment decisions in prior rounds dod assigned highest priority to four criteria rela ted to military value an additional four included return on investment economic impact community infrastructure and environmental impact th eight selection criteria as

the past four completed rounds 85 of dods closures nd realignments were approved by the commission19 on january 22 2004 senator kay bailey hutchison chairman of the military construction appropriations subcommittee sent letter to the pentagon stating that while military value is impor tant to assessing the nece ssity of installations the dod should also conduct comprehensive study of us facilities abroad and determine whether existing base structures and locations meet the needs of current and future missions it would be unwise to close or realign dom estic bases that may be needed for troops returning from outdated fac ilities abroad senator hutchison further stated that the dod s hould also consider how closing or realignment of installations affects our homeland security the current draft criteria very similar to that proposed in the previous brac rounds do not fully reflect the security of issues our country faces in the wake of september 11 2001 our nation is not dealing with the same th reats as we were in 1995 and therefore we must develop new strategies to insure the military does not close base only to later realize its costly mistake20 on february

locations eighty percent of our nations installations are experiencing urban growth at rate higher than the national average residential and commercial communities are potentially exposed to artillery fire aircraft noise dust and worse yet accidents as urban growth and development incr ease near and around bases so do land use conflicts between mission activities and local communities for instance many military airports conduct night tr aining exercises the city lights of encroaching development often compromise the effectiveness of night vision equipment making night trai ning exercises impractical the extent of urban encroachment and its effect on operational activity of an installation is consideration in determ ining its future viability and such mission constraint can lead to activity reductions or even closures the resulting reduction in installation personnel and mission activities can jeopardize economic activity jobs and tax revenues encroachment puts local and state economies at risk42 the fy2003 defense authorization act pl 107314 included natural resource conversion provision that addressed the impact of land development on military installations the pentagon argued that environmental requirements placed serious limitations on the use of certain nds as result section 2881 authorized the secretary of defense to create conser vation buffer zones outsi its
