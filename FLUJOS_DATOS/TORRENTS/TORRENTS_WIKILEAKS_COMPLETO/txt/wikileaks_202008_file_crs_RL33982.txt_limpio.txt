2007 brent d yacobucci specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division robert bamberger specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division corporate average fuel economy cafe comparison of selected legislation in the 110th congress summary the rise in crude oil and gasoline prices since the winter of 2006 has renewed the focus on us fuel consumption in the transportation sector wider concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have contributed to interest in reducing fossil fuel consumption and improving the efficiency of the us transportation sector possible changes to the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe standards are one policy option to address the issue cafe standards are fleetwide fuel economy averages that manufacturers must meet each model year currently separate cafe standards are established for passenger cars and light trucks which include sport utility vehicles suvs vans and pickup trucks several bills have been introduced in the 110th congress to modify the cafe program senate energy legislation hr 6 passed that body on june 21 2007 the bill includes language on cafe on august 3 2007 the house passed energy legislation hr 3221 241170 and hr 2776 221189 but these bills did not include cafe provisions two house bills addressing cafe hr 1506 hr 2729 were circulated as possible amendments but neither were debated on the house floor this report provides sidebyside comparison of these and other bills in the th 110 congress addressing passenger vehicle fuel economy in general and the cafe program specifically the bills are compared on various policy options including but not limited to the types of provisions identified above the report also compares provisions in bills that would establish greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger cars outside of the cafe structure such emissions standards would likely also have the effect of increasing fuel economy one issue in the cafe debate over the years has been whether congress should set cafe standards or delegate that authority exclusively to nhtsa for passenger cars the original epca legislation established specific targets for model year my 1978 and my1985 and required that the secretary of transportation set standards for the interim years some of the current proposals would also set specific targets in the future others would require annual improvements in cafe by some specified percentage in some instances both approaches are used those proposals would establish mandated cafe by certain date and require subsequent annual percentage increases some bills would also require nhtsa to set the maximum feasible interim standards another key question is the form cafe standards should take one bill would require that the cafe standard be expressed in grams per mile of carbon dioxide emissions co2 in addition to miles per gallon states are preempted from establishing their own cafe standards but are permitted to set clean air requirements this has generated controversy and some believe requirement to report fuel economy as function of co2 emissions is intended to have some bearing on the differing treatment of the states between cafe and emissions standards contents background establishment of the cafe standards 1 recent cafe regulations 2 policy options 2 policy options within cafe 2

and gasoline prices since the winter of 2006 has renewed the focus on us fuel consumption in the transportation sector wider concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have contributed to interest in reducing fossil fuel consumption and improving the efficiency of the us transportation sector among the various policy options to address the issue are changes to the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe standards1 cafe refers to the average miles per gallon used by manufacturers entire fleet of cars or light trucks in given model year various bills in the 110th congress would modify the cafe program to increase fuel economy standards for all vehicles heighten the stringency of testing procedures andor grant the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa broader authority to implement the program in the senate s 357 was reported as amended from the committee on commerce science and transportation on may 8 2007 some of its provisions were inserted along with other energy initiatives reported from committee into samdt 1502 to hr 6 hr 6 passed the senate june 21 2007 and includes cafe language on august 3 2007 the house passed energy legislation hr 3221 241170 and hr 2776 221189 but these bills did not include cafe provisions two house bills addressing cafe hr 1506 hr 2729 were circulated as possible amendments but neither were debated on the house floor some argued that it would strengthen house negotiations with the senate in conference if the house bill had also included cafe provisions an effort to add cafe language to house energy legislation was defeated on june 28th in house committee on energy and commerce markup 2631 it is possible that provisions of hr 1506 and hr 2927 may figure in discussions should an energy bill reach conference background establishment of the cafe standards the arab oil embargo of 19731974 and the subsequent tripling in the price of crude oil brought into sharp focus the fuel inefficiency of us automobiles new car fleet fuel economy had declined from 148 miles per gallon mpg in model year my 1967 to 129 mpg in 1974 in the search for ways to reduce dependence on imported oil automobiles were an obvious target the energy policy and 1 for more information on cafe see crs report rl33413 automobile and light truck fuel economy the cafe standards by brent d yacobucci and robert bamberger crs2 conservation act epca pl 94163 established cafe standards for passenger cars for my1978 the cafe standards called for an eventual doubling in new car fleet fuel economy epca also granted nhtsa the authority to establish cafe standards for other classes of vehicles including lightduty trucks2 nhtsa established fuel economy standards for light trucks beginning in my1979 for passenger cars the current standard is 275 miles per gallon mpg for my2007 for light trucks the standard is 222 mpg for my2007 under epca the secretary of transportation has the discretion to adjust the passenger car standard within range from 260 to 275 mpg any increase above 275 mpg or below 260 mpg requires the secretary to issue an amendment to the standards that amendment would be in force unless either chamber of congress disapproves however this onehouse veto could be judged to be unconstitutional3 the secretary has much broader discretion with respect to setting light truck fuel economy standards referred to in the regulations as nonpassenger automobiles this includes the authority to establish different standards for different classifications of these vehicles recent cafe regulations in april 2006 nhtsa promulgated new cafe rules for light trucks after my2007 light truck manufacturers may voluntarily comply with new reformed standard based on the size of each specific manufacturers vehicles starting in my2011 all light truck makers will be subject to the reformed standards which nhtsa estimates will be equivalent to about 240 mpg under the old system epca gives nhtsa the authority to modify the light truck standards as it sees fit including setting standards based on vehicle attributes in this case size epca does not grant similar flexibility in application of the passenger car standard policy options policy options within cafe several bills would amend the current cafe program to increase cafe standards change testing procedures andor grant nhtsa broader regulatory discretion crs analyzed 12 caferelated bills with regard to several key policy options combined passenger carlight truck standards definition of automobile and light truck mandated numeric increase in cafe standards mandated percentage increase in cafe standards 2 lightduty trucks include most sport utility vehicles suvs vans and pickups 3 for more information see crs report rs22132 legislative vetoes after chadha by louis fisher crs3 regulatory flexibilityauthority expanded considerations for maximum feasible fuel economy attributebased standards credit trading carbon dioxide emissions and other key provisions none of these policy options is mutually exclusive and any or all options could be adopted together each of these options is discussed below combined passenger carlight truck standards one criticism of the current cafe program is its separate treatment of light trucks and passenger cars when epca was first enacted most light trucks were used solely as work vehicles and they constituted relatively small percentage of the lightduty vehicle fleet since that time light trucks which include sport utility vehicles suvs and vans are used more and more as passenger vehicles currently light trucks make up roughly half of the new lightduty vehicle market as consequence some argue that the distinction between the two fleets should be eliminated critics also allege that specifications for some carlike vehicle models may have been designed purposefully to qualify those vehicles for the lower mpg standard that applies to the light truck fleet definition of automobile and light truck passenger car and light truck standards could be combined by simply expanding the definition of passenger automobile to include light trucks up to 8500 pounds some proponents of tighter standards argue that light trucks should be treated as passenger vehicles further some light trucks are too heavy to be included under the current cafe standard therefore some proposals would expand the definition of automobile or light truck to include all vehicles up to 10000 pounds gross weight current standards cover vehicles up to 8500 pounds gross weight other proposals would expand cafe standards to some heavier vehicles eg suvs and passenger vans but would exclude work trucks eg pickups and cargo vans mandated numeric increase in cafe standards some analysts argue that price volatility in oil markets sends inconsistent signals to prospective new car purchasers and that the only way to avoid these mixed signals would be to mandate higher cafe standards some legislative proposals would require nhtsa to establish new cafe standards set at fixed mpg target in given year various proposals would mandate increased standards for passenger cars light trucks or both mandated percentage increase in cafe standards while some bills would mandate an increase in the cafe standards to specified levels others would require nhtsa to set rules to increase fuel economy by set percentage every year in most cases the bills mandate an annual cafe increase of 4 from the previous year the bills vary on whether the increase would cover passenger cars light trucks or both crs4 regulatory flexibilityauthority as was mentioned above nhtsa currently has limited authority to modify the specific mpg target or the general design of passenger car cafe standards some legislative proposals would significantly broaden nhtsas authority to amend the program including allowing nhtsa to set higher passenger car standards than epca currently allows currently any increase above 275 mpg or below 260 mpg requires the secretary to issue an amendment to the standards that amendment is to be in force unless either chamber of congress disapproves other proposals would allow nhtsa to extend the current singleyear compliance period to multiyear periods such proposal for example might allow nhtsa to require manufacturers to meet set cafe average for my2011 through my2013 instead of requiring that the cafe average be achieved in each model year expanded considerations for maximum feasible fuel economy current law requires nhtsa to consider various factors in determining maximum feasible average fuel economy nhtsa must consider technological feasibility economic practicability the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the government on fuel economy and the need of the united states to conserve energy4 some of the bills would add further dimension costeffectiveness and stipulate weighing of several factors in assessing the costeffectiveness of any proposed changes in the standards among these factors are value to consumers economic security national security foreign policy and the impact of oil use on various other national policy concerns attributebased standards as noted above nhtsa has established size based cafe standards for light trucks but does not have similar authority for passenger cars some proposals would allow nhtsa to establish multiple levels of passenger car cafe standards for given model year the levels could be based on variety of vehicle attributes including size andor weight the senatepassed hr 6 would require attributebased standards hr 6 would also require that after enactment the secretary of transportation would initiate study toward developing fuel economy program to raise the vehicle fuel efficiency of medium and heavy duty trucks credit trading for each model year automakers must meet separate cafe targets for three new vehicle fleets domestically produced passenger cars imported passenger cars and light trucks in any year that manufacturer exceeds the cafe standard for one of these given fleets that manufacturer may bank credits for use in meeting future year requirements conversely in any year that the manufacturer comes up short it may borrow credits from an anticipated surplus in future years under the current cafe program banked or borrowed credits may be used only for the fleet in which they originated for example if an automaker generates credits for its fleet of imported passenger cars those credits may not be applied to its fleets of domestic cars or light trucks similarly automakers may not trade credits with other automakers however some of the legislative proposals would allow manufacturer to move credits between fleets andor trade credits with another manufacturer 4 49 usc 32902f crs5 carbon dioxide standards one bill hr 2927 would require that new cafe standards be expressed in grams per mile of carbon dioxide co2 in addition to miles per gallon under epca states are preempted from establishing their own cafe standards but the clean air act permits states to set their own clean air requirements this has generated controversy and some believe requirement to report fuel economy as function of co2 emissions is intended to have some bearing on the differing treatment of the states between cafe and emissions standards some of these matters are currently being litigated bush administration proposal in his 2007 state of the union address president bush outlined goal of reducing gasoline5 consumption by 20 from projected levels in 2017 of that 20 reduction the president proposed that 15 come from the increased use of renewable and alternative fuels and that 5 come from increased vehicle fuel efficiency it has been estimated that an annual 4 increase in cafe standards would lead to 5 reduction in projected gasoline consumption in 2017 the bush administration has not proposed legislation that would mandate an increase in cafe standards on february 6 2007 nhtsa submitted draft legislation to the house energy and commerce committee on the bush administrations cafe proposal6 the administrations proposal would not require an increase in fuel economy standards but would grant nhtsa broader regulatory authority the draft would allow nhtsa to establish attributebased standards for passenger cars and would allow for cafe credit trading noncafe policy options in addition to bills modifying the cafe program several other bills have been introduced that would likely increase vehicle fuel economy through other measures for example several bills requiring reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced of those bills two would require permile emissions reductions from passenger vehicles while such emissions standards would not technically constitute change in fuel economy standards automakers and others contend that there is way other than fuel economy increases to reduce automobile greenhouse gas emissions7 5 gasoline is only one part of oil consumption albeit the largest and thus 20 reduction in gasoline consumption translates to smaller reduction in overall petroleum consumption 6 as of february 22 2007 member has sponsored and introduced the administrations proposal 7 for more information on climate change bills see crs report
