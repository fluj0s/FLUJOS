organiza tion nato in afghanistan is test of the alliances political will and military capabilities since the washington summit in 1999 the allies have sought to create new nato capable of operating beyond the european theater to combat emerging threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction afghanistan is natos first outofarea mission beyond europe the purpose of the mission is the stabilization and reconstruction of afghanistan the mission has proven difficult because it must take place while combat operations against taliban insurgents continue recent assessments of the situation in afghanistan point to rise in the overall level of violence due to increased taliban military operations and an increase in terroristrelated activities security council resolutions govern natos responsibilities in afghanistan the natoled international security assistance force isaf faces formidable obstacles shoring up weak government in kabul using military capabilities in distant country with rugged terrain and rebuilding country devastated by war and troubled by resilient narcotics trade natos mission statement lays out the essential elements of the task of stabilizing and rebuilding the country train the afghan army police and judici ary support the government in counternarcotics efforts develop market infrastructure and suppress the taliban isaf has proceeded in four stages to extend its area of responsibility over the whole of afghanistan although the allies agree on isafs mission they continue to differ on how to accomplish it some allies do not want their forces to engage in counterinsurgency operations and have placed operational restrictions on their troops the principal mechanism to rebuild afghanistan are the provincial reconstruction teams prt composed of military and civilian officials and charged with extending the reach of the afghan government by improving governance and rebuilding the economy however there are significant differences in how individual na to governments run their prts unt il recently only the united states wanted to engage directly in the destruction of poppy fields and drug facilities in countering the drug trade finally continued turmoil in parts of pakistan has complicated the effort to prevent the taliban from infiltrating afghanistan the 111 th congress will likely support the new administrations policies in afghanistan but may seek more coherent plan for integration stabilization and reconstruction operations in 2008 congress appropriated 31 billion for the conflict in afghanistan hr 2642pl 110252 most observers predict that isafs efforts to stabilize afghanistan will require longterm commitment us leadership in afghanistan may well affect na tos cohesiveness

in distant land and to sustain that commitment since the washington nato summit in 1999 the allies have sought to create new nato capable operating beyond the european theater to combat emerging threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd nato is seeking to be global in its geographic reach and in the development of nonmember partner states that can assist in achieving an agreed mission this change in overall mission initially reflected nato consensus that the principal dangers to allied security lie distant from the treaty area and require new political tools and military capabilities to combat them two military operations in afghanistan seek to stabilize the country operation enduring freedom oef is counterinsurgency combat operation led by the united states against the taliban and qaeda insurgents primarily in the eastern and southern parts of the country along the pakistan border oef is not na to operation although many coalition partners are nato members approximately 20000 troops operate in oef including approximately 18000 us forces 2 the second operation is the international security assistance force isaf isaf was created by united nations security council resolution 1386 on december 20 2001 led by the united states the isaf mission was initially limited to kabul nato took over command of isaf in afghanistan in august 2003 the security council passed the currently governing resolution res 1776 on september 17 2007 the resolution calls upon nato to disarm militias reform the justice system train national police force and army provide security for elections and provide assistance to the effort to address the narcotics industry by december 2008 isaf had an estimated 51000 troops from 40 countries with the 26 nato members providing the core of the force the largest troop deployments come from the united states which has approximately 19000 troops the united kingdom 8700 german 3600 canada 2700 italy 2300 france 2700 the netherlands 1800 and poland 1200 3 the natoisaf mission in afghanistan is led by us general david mckiernan who assumed command in june 2008 natos effort in afghanistan is the alliances first outofarea mission beyond europe the purpose of the mission is the stabilization and reconstruction of afghanistan although nato has undertaken stabilization and reconstruction missions before for example in kosovo the scope of the undertaking in afghanistan is considerably more difficult taliban and qaeda insurgents are providing stiff resistence to the operation afghanistan has never had wellfunctioning central government the distance from europe and the countrys terrain present daunting obstacles to both na to manpower and equipment stabilization and reconstruction must therefore take place while combat operations continue and although the allies agree upon general political objective of the isaf mission some have differing interpretations of how to achieve it 1 the

in afghanistan is likely to be important for natos future several key nato members above all the united states have insisted that the allies must generate the political will to counter the greatest threats to their security afghanistan provides test of will against the concrete danger of international terrorism over the past several years na to governments have also repeatedly pledged to develop capabilities making their forces more expeditionary flexible and deployable the mission in afghanistan provides hard test of these capabilities natos mission in afghanistan also tests us leadership of the alliance some allies have questioned whether the us commitment to the interests of the allies preserves the mutual sense of obligation that characterizes the alliance the allies also believe that the united states as global power must provide leadership and resources to counter the destabilizing influences upon afghanistan of two neighboring states iran and particularly pakistan highly respected german marshall fund poll has found sharp decline in european public opinion towards us leadership since 2002 in key european countries the desirability of us leadership in the world fell from 64 in 2002 to 36 in june 2008 the approval rating of former president bush in these same countries fell from 38 in 2002 to 19 in 20084 this decline complicated the effort of allied governments to sustain public support for the isaf mission secretary of defense robert gates gave credence to the political ramifications of the iraq war when he said in february 2008 i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused many of themhave problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan 5 whether europes public view toward us world leadership will begin to change as the new us administration begi ns to govern will also be test of how well natos mission in afghanistan will be viewed the conflict in afghanistan continues to present growing challenge to na to over the past two years taliban attacks have increased in scope and number and taliban fighters have adopted some of the tactics such as roadside bombs and suicide attacks used by insurgents in iraq in january 2008 report issued by the afghanistan st udy gr oup claimed that the year 2007 was the deadliest for american and international troops in afghanistan since the 2001 invasion of afghanistan6 however in 2008 the violence continued to escalate with reported 30 increase nationwide and an estimated 40 rise in attacks over 2007 in the usled eastern sector as result 2008 has now recorded the most us combat casualties 150 and afghan deaths 5500 of the war in june 2008 talibanled attack on prison in kandahar resulted in the release of several hundred taliban inmates on july 13 2008 taliban attack on joint usafghan outpost along the eastern border with pakistan resu lted in the death of 9 us troops this attack was the deadliest against us forces in afghanistan since 2005 on august 20 2008 french forces suffered their worse combat casualties when 10 soldiers were killed after an ambush of patrol by taliban forces in addition to increased insurgent activity terrorist violence has increased since the beginning of 2008 in february 2008 terrorist bomb killed over 70 civilians and police officers near kandahar in april 2008 an

and west of afghanistan and kabul in the east are largely stable but combat operations in the south and east against the taliban and qaeda continue forces from the united states britain canada and the netherlands which are deployed in the east and south bear the brunt of the fighting the inequity of burdensharing in combat operations remains an important point of contention within the alliance and is factor in the domestic opposition to the conflict in states that contribute the most combat forces turmoil in neighboring pakistan has further complicated isafs mission7 the assassination of presidential candidate benazir bhutto in december 2007 possibly by islamic extremists led to increasing internal restiveness against presiden t pervez musharraf criticized by some nato governments as unable or unwilling to stem taliban movement across the pakistan border into afghanistan some experts see pakistani and afghan taliban militants increasingly merging and pooling their efforts against governments in both countries qaeda is reportedly actively facilitating the afghanistan insurgency since the resignation of musharraf the new government in pakistan has dispatched military units to the border region and has authorized the army to conduct offensive operations against taliban forces in the northern tribal areas in october 2008 the pakistan government announced that it would begin to arm antitaliban tribal militias in the northern region in an attempt to control taliban activity 8 with the inability of the pakistani government to control the number of taliban in surgents who use pakistan as sanctuary the united states has stepped up its use of missile attacks against suspected insurgent hideouts this has caused deterioration in uspakistan relations to the point where there have been some shooting incidents between pakistani forces and us forces patrolling the afghan border area us officials in july 2008 confronted pakistani officials with evidence that pakistans inter services intelligence agency isi was actively he lping afghanistan militants particularly the haqqani faction9 in another development intelligence sources suggest that there has been an increase in the number of proal qaeda foreign militants arriving in pakistan from iraq and other places in the middle east these sources believe these new arrivals continue to join taliban fighters in afghanistan the karzai government in afghanistan has come under international criticism and its public support has diminished due to corruption and an inability to improve living conditions some warlords continue to exert influence and the narcotics industry remains an entrenched threat to the countrys political health the allies are not in full agreement on how to counter these problems but allied officials say that they need strong competent and reliable afghan government to provide reasonable services to the population if nato is to succeed the 110 th congress largely supported administration policy in afghanistan and it is expected that the 111th congress will follow those same general lines of support however number of congressional committees had called on the previous administration to develop more coherent plan to coordinate isafs stabilization and reconstruction efforts and it is expected that the same sentiments will be expressed to the new obama administration in response the bush administration led an effort before natos bucharest summit in april 2008 to develop 7 for an overview and analysis of key issues in afghanistan including the role of pakistan see

the mission that could be used to garner more public support for isaf the paper made four principal points the allies promised longterm commitment to afghanista n expressed support to improve the countrys governance pledged comprehensive approach to bring civil and military efforts to effect stabilization and promised increased engagement with afghanistans neighbors especially pakistan10 the paper represented some strides in bringing to gether allied views but it also masked some important differences it committed the allies to an indefinite period of time to stabilize afghanistan something that several allies had previously resisted the paper however did not commit governments to pledge more forces rather the phrase comprehensive approach was seen by some observers as euphemism for equating the importance of reconstruction and combat some governments believe that the military commitment remains paramount if security in the country is to improve so that reconstruction may proceed throughout afghanistan the paper also did not present plan for engaging pakistan or iran instead the allies would continue to do so bilaterally an approach that has not th us far yielded success in stemming the flow of arms or fighters into afghanistan 11 this report follows the path of natos evolution in afghanistan and addresses the current situation on the ground the first section covers the initial two stages of isafs mission and analyzes key issues in the mission use of provincial reconstruction teams to stabilize and rebuild the country overcoming caveats placed by individual allies on the use of their forces and managing the counternarcotics effort the next section of the report examines stages three and four of the isaf mission which cover roughly the period december 2005 to the present in this section the debate to develop refined mission statement and new organizational structure is analyzed by looking at issues that are both political and military such as securing more troops the treatment of prisoners and organization of command by late 2006 as isaf extended its responsibilities to cover all of afghanistan the allies began to realize that isaf would require greater combat capability than originally believed and the mission would have to change this adjustment in mission is discussed through the perspective of several key allies the final section of the report assesses isafs progress to date

combat the narcotics industry the resolution does not provide details of how nato should accomplish these tasks rather the allies among themselves in consultation with the afghan government have refined the resolutions provisions into active policy the international security assistance force includes troops from all 26 member states of the na to alliance and has included troops from several non nato nations such as australia new zealand sweden jordan and azerbaijan over time nato commanders laid out and implemented four stages designed to bring all of afghanistan under natos operational responsibility in stage one in 20032004 nato moved into the northern part of the country french and german forces predominate in these areas stage two began in may 2005 when nato moved into western

southern region of afghanistan where us british canadian and dutch forces predominate stage four began in october 2006 when isaf extended its geographic area of responsibility to include the entire country issues from the beginning of natos command of isaf political leaders and local commanders have had to deal with several significant issues which have influenced the implementation of the isaf

importantly however significant problem has been how some of those forces actually provided would operate once deployed many allies have committed forces to the nato operation then imposed restrictionsnational caveatson tasks those forces could undertake it is reported that almost half the forces in isaf have some form of caveats national caveats or restrictions that lied governments or their parliaments place on the use of their forces continue to trouble isaf while caveats in themselves do not generally prohibit the kinds of operations nato forces can engage in caveats do pose difficult problems for commanders who seek maximum flexibility in utilizing troops under their command some governments troops lack the appropriate equipment to function with other na to forces some nations will not permit their troops to deploy to other parts of afghanistan still others prohibit their troops from participating in combat operations unless in selfdefense na to commanders have willingly accepted troops from some 40 governments but have had to shape the conduct of the mission to fit the capabilities of and caveats on those troops nato commanders have long sought to minimize the number of caveats on forces dedicated to isaf an effort that has met with mixed ccess in september 2006 former nato saceur general james jones expressed frustration at the limitations that some allies placed on their troops its not enough he said to simply provide forces if those forces have restrictions on them that limit them from being effective 12 12 nato commander asks member nations to

political leaders sought to reduce the caveats placed on forces in afghanistan the united states canada britain and the netherlands which have forces in the highly unsettled areas of southern and eastern afghanistan appealed to other governments to release combat forces to assist them in moments of danger some progress has been made over time in persuading nato members to adopt more flexible rules of engagement but those nations whose forces continue to bear higher burden of risk continue to appeal to their partners for relief at the bucharest summit in april 2008 nato leaders again pledged to continue to work to remove the limitations placed on their troops some allies had singled out germany for special criticism given that germany has large cont ingent of over 3000 troops most of which are deployed in what has been relatively quiet area of northern afghanistan german troops reportedly patrol only in armored personnel carriers and do not leave their bases at night 13 this has led some to suggest that the implementation of excess force protection measures by the germans has made their work even in safe area far less effective former nato saceur general jones complained about german restrictions after he had specifically requested that germany send some of its force in northern afghanistan into the south to help combat taliban activity request the german government initially refused since then however germany has allowed some of its forces to respond in emergency situations the french government has somewhat reduced its caveats and agreed to allow its forces in kabul and elsewhere come to the assistance of other nato forces in an emergency the italian and spanish governments have said that their force commanders in the field could make the decision to send forces to assist in an urgent situation it remains unclear whether and when these commanders would have to request permission from their capitals to do so complicating factor that could delay decision turkey in contrast has not changed its proscription against its forces use in combat while there have been criticisms of natos role in afghanistan many natoisaf forces do engage in offensive operations since 2006 natoisaf combat forces have launched several operations including operation medusa in 2006 aimed at ousting taliban forces in kandahar province in 2007 nato and afghan forces retook the town of musa qala in helmand province and conducted operations achilles and silicon against taliban forces in 2008 in reaction to increased operations by the taliban nato forces have increased the number of offensive operations they have engaged in the concern over the impact of national caveats has spread even beyond na to itself on july 9 2008 the european parliament debated and voted on report on afghanistan presented by its committee on foreign affairs one of the provisions in the report emphasized that major strengthening of political will and commitment is necessary and that this should be followed up not only by willingness to provide additional combat troops in the most difficult areas unrestricted by national caveats 14 13 interviews at the nato defense college

varying sizes designed to extend the authority of the central government into the countryside provide security and undertake projects such as infrastructure development and the delivery of basic

2008 the czech republic established prt in lowgar province south korea has taken over the usrun prt at bagram air base there also has been move to turn over the lead in the usrun prts to civilians rather than military personnel presumably state department or usaid officials that process began in early 2006 with the establishment of civilianled usrun prt in the panjshir valley 15 there is established model for prts and many are dominated by military forces rather than civilian technicians by most accounts those serving in prts make an effort to move about surrounding territory engage the local governments and citizens and demonstrate that the international presence is bringing tangible results despite general support for prts they receive mixed reviews and there have been criticisms of the overall prt initiative some observers believe the prts operate without an overarching concept of operations do not provide common range of services do not have unified chain of command and often do not coordinate with each other or exchange information on best practices 16 another problem that has risen for prts in some areas is that civilian relief organizations do not want to be too closely associated with the military forces assigned to the prts because they feel their own security is endangered as well as their perceived neutrality on september 10 2009 15 katzman op

services committee stated that absent broader international and interagency approach to the problems there amount of troops in amount of time can ever achieve all the objectives we seek in afghanistan he went on to say that afghanistan doesnt just need more boots on the ground it needs more trucks teachers judges foreign investment alternative crops sound governance and rule of law these are the keys to success in afghanistan armed force anywhere matter how good can deliver these keys alone 17 although us and isaf prts share the same mission there are reportedly considerable differences in structure us prts are composed of military personnel civil affairs officers representatives of the us and other government agencies focused on reconstruction and afghan government personnel some observers believe us prts are too heavily weighted with military personnel who lack the expertise to assist in developing important elements of the economy 18 others believe that there is lack of qualified civilian personnel to accomplish key tasks for instance some claim that there is critical shortage of us agricultural specialists on the ground in afghanistan19 the united states government controls the funds for its prts in part to ensure that the money does not disappear through the hands of corrupt officials in the provinces or in kabul and that it goes directly to designated projects isaf prts generally have fewer personnel as well as different mix of military forces and civilian experts some us officials believe that europeanled prts are too hesitant in their engagement of the afghan population some eu ropeanled prts are minimally funded or provide little supervision of how their funds are managed and dispensed20 the dutch for instance give their funding for prt reconstruction activities directly to the afghan central government mainly through and world bank channels the dutch argue that the karzai government itself must undertake responsibility for planning and implementation of projects to rebuild the country by contrast the french have declined to lead prt and have questioned natos role in the prts in hearings before the 110 th congress witnesses urged steps to strengthen the prts some witnesses argued that the administration should increase funding for the state department aid and the us department of agriculture three parts of the government able to provide needed expertise in the prts witnesses also repeatedly called for model for isaf prts that might provide guideposts to best practices to ensure higher quality of assistance to the afghan population 21 the new administration has begun to discuss more enhanced role for the department of state in tasks such as those required in afghanistan and it is likely the 111th congress will continue to press for more coherent reconstruction effort 17 statement of defense secretary robert gates before the house armed services committee september 10 2008 18 provincial reconstruction teams

worlds opium in 2007 poppy farmers are heavily concentrated in the south of the country and the crop is major factor in the economic life and stability of the country the drug trade is also major source of funding for the insurgency as according to some estimates the taliban draw an estimated 40 or close to 100 million of their funds annually from this industry the natoisaf mission from its inception was not authorized to play direct role in the counternarcotics effort such as destroying poppy fields or processing facilities nevertheless nato commanders had been instructed to provide assistance to the local counternarcotics authorities britain leads the international effort to coordinate the counternarcotics assistance the allies provide training intelligence and logistics to afghan army units and police who destroy poppy fields and opium labs 22 one former regional commander believed that the afghan governments destruction of poppy fields was too random to be effective and that the government has not taken decisive action to end warlord involvement in the narcotics trade there are also reports that the government primarily destroys the crops of the poorest farmers and leaves those of more influential families whose support is needed by the government23 the bush administration had initially urged the karzai government to consider spraying herbicide on the poppy fields however the afghan government decided against this proposal because of possible effects of herbicide on public health and the environment other ally reportedly supported aerial spraying largely for fear of alienating the local populations that rely on poppy cultivation for income24 on september 3 2008 the executive director of the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc antonio maria costa briefed the rth atlantic council nac on the counter narcotics effort in afghanistan mr costa suggested that afghan army and police efforts in the counternarcotics strategy have largely been ineffective and that isaf should consider expanding its support of the afghanistan governments counterdrug effort by including the destruction of opium labs and the interdiction of drug distributi on networks as part of the isaf mission he also suggested that isaf focus on major drug traffi ckers and the drug trade along afghanistans borders on october 9 2008 at an informal mee ting of nato defense ministers in budapest nato leaders agreed to authorize its isaf forces to act with afghan forces against opium labs and other facilities that use drugs to finance the taliban however according to an article in the december 23 2008 edition of the new york times there appears to be ongoing objections by some nations that their laws do not permit their soldiers to engage in counternarcotics operations25 the repercussions of afghanistans poppy crop for the future of the country and for isaf operations are extensive and complex the afghan government lacks the law enforcement apparatus including wellfunctioning judicial system to combat the narcotics trade 22 testimony of director negroponte annual threat assessment senate select committee on intelligence january 11 2007 house

g343g342g561successfully narcotics traffickers can exploit the countrys primitive transportation network as an extensive road system is not needed to move opium to market small load of opium can yield high financial return the opium trade has corrosive effect on afghan society former cia director john negroponte told congress in january 2007 that the drug trade contributes to endemic corruption at all levels of government and undercuts public confidence dangerous nexus exists between drugs and insurgents and warlords who derive funds from cultivation and trafficking at the same time farmers in parts of the country view the poppy as their only source of income one component of the counternarcotics effort is to persuade farmers to switch to alternative crops many crops however cannot compete with poppies income from hectare of poppies can reach 4600 year while wheat one of the suggested substitute crops can bring only 390 orchards might bring more money but they require years to develop more extensive market infrastructure is necessary as well eradication of the industry without substitute source of income would throw these farmers into destitution and they would viol ently resist any effort to destroy their crops another component in this effort is the status of the police and judicial systems some western officials in afghanistan note that the police remain corrupt and distrusted by the population they lack extensive training and experience as well as transport the police could play key role in afghanistans stabilization because they along with the afghan army have primary responsibility for destroying poppy fields and opium labs 26 police training was initially the responsibility of the germans the task was daunting one given the low pay provided by the afghan government and the modest numbers of police used to cover broad territory however difficulties in recruiting german police trainers and subpar performance of the training program necessitated change part of the problem may have been the lack of authority of the german government to order police to afghanistan unlike its military forces german police must volunteer for such an assignment 27 some us and european officials were critical of the manner in which germany managed its task of training the afghan police force anp at the same time former saceur general jones said that while training of the afghan army was one of the bright stories one of the notsogood stories is the inadequacy to bring similar progress to police reform which is the responsibility of germany in may 2007 the eu accepted request by nato to take the lead in training afghanistans police the european police eupol training mission began in june 2007 with the addition of some 120 eu police trainers who joined the 41 german trainers that remained in the program in september 2007 the german general heading the eu police training mission reportedly quit in frustration over complications with the program and the corruption encountered in dealing with the karzai government 28 in february 2008 report by isaf to the nato noted that the afghan police still fall behind the desired level of capability29 in march

consolidated its responsibilities to cover all of afghanistan initially in late 2005 the allies believed that stages three and four would emulate stages one and two by seeing replacement of oef forces by nato forces in stabilizing environment the allies nonetheless knew that there would be several significant new challenges in both stages the taliban originated in the south in kandahar province and they retain their most active network there poppy farming is widespread in the south particularly in helmand province where british troops operate and in uruzgan province where dutch troops predominate stage three came into force on july 31 2006 after having been postponed several times due to insurgent violence and an effort to secure pledge s of additional troops from allied

contending that such combat operations were oefs task that the resolution governing isaf called for stabilization operation only and that in some cases the allies did not have forces available for the counterinsurgency and counterterror tasks 32 in december 2005 the allies announced mission statement for isafs stages three and four in the form of communiqué they pledged to work to extend the authority of the afghan government primarily through development of prts they also committed themselves to training the afghan army and police an effort in state building meant to provide kabul

also agreed upon guidelines for dealing with prisoners the mission statement reflected european and canadian views that stages three and four operations should concentrate on reconstruction and

from increasing their force levels in afghanistan allied government officials stated privately that their populations were reluctant to follow the bush administratio n largely due to the us invasion

replace norwegian contingent in the north in february 2008 the us deployed the 24th marine expeditionary unit meu to southern afghanistan the debate in the dutch parliament over assigning troops to isaf was also contentious the dutch population initially opposed sending forces into combat operation ultimately the netherlands designated 1700 troops for duty in isafs stage three and stage four operations despite these pledges the upturn in violence in 2007 and 2008 led us and nato commanders in afghanistan to conclude that they needed about three more brigades 20000 troops to be able to stabilize the still restive southern sector at the april 2008 nato summit at bucharest key objective of several allies with combat contingents in afghanistan was to persuade other governments to send more forces when the allies issued their strategic vision statement on afghanistan the allies agreed to shared long term commitment something that some allies had theretofore resisted stating publicly but they did not promise to contribute an equitable share of combat forces part of this inequity is attributable to na tos own budget rules when member state agrees to deploy troops to nato operation that nation must pay the costs associated with that deployment thus there is built in disincentive for nations to agree to commit any troops to mission or to increase the number of troops already deployed this problem complicates attempts by leaders of fragile governments or coalition governments to convince their legislatures and publics to support deployment and the costs associated with that commitment in 2008 the canadian government threatened to withdraw its forces in 2009 if commitment of at least 1000 new combat troops was not made by the allies president bush pledged to increase us forces in afghanistan by 5000 additional troops by the end of 2008 france agreed to send 720 combat troops germany agreed to deploy an additional 1000 troops to the northern sector pending approval by the german parliament in october when the current german mandate was to have expired poland the czech republic and several other allies pledged smaller contingents allaying canadian concerns to some degree howeve r allies with forces in harms way continued to criticize other allies that will not send combat forces or commit them to areas where the taliban are more active as the perception of deterioration in afghanistan continued it was reported in september 2008 that both the us military and nato were conducting number of different strategy reviews among the issues under review was how to prevent the movement of militants across the afghanistanpakistan border although some of the reviews have been completed it is unclear if or when any major changes in policy would be initiated us officials at the time said more us and partner forces were needed and us officials were trying to identify more forces to go to afghanistan in september 2008 president bush announced that at least 5000 more us forces would be sent to afghanistan by early 2009 ho wever isaf commander general mckiernan recently suggested that the effort still needed about 20000 additional troops the incoming obama administration has suggested that an additional 20000 30000 us troops will ultimately be deployed to afghanistan

us administration has already hinted that it will ask other partner countries to contribute additional forces to the isaf mission however in sign of how stretched some allies are or how reluctant others will be uk prime minister gordon brown on december 16 indicated that he could only contribute an additional 300 british troops in 2009 in november us house congressional delegation visiting italy was told that the italian troop commitment to afghanistan could not be increased further also in november the spanish foreign minister told meeting of the nato parliamentary assembly in valencia that spain would not send additional troops to afghanistan the reluctance of the nato allies to commit additional troops to the isaf mission is being driven in part by the opposition of many of europes citizens who see little progress in afghanistan and in part by the realities of the global economic crisis that is currently having negative impact on national budgets this could complicate attempts by the new us administration to create the kinds of conditions in afghanistan that could lead to greater stabilization of the country the nato allies are expecting president obama to ask for more allied troops and are preparing for that discussion at the april 4 na to summit in germany and france these additional troops would be used to train the afghan security forces to try to stabilize the still restive southern sector and reverse the deterioration of the eastern sector and the areas around kabul some equate this to the afghanistan equivalent of the us troop surge that has been credited with greatly reducing violence in iraq for some the concern over the troop issue means that the extra forces will likely be contributed almost entirely by the us this could further add to the americanization of the conflict in afghanistan and could provide less of an incentive for nato allies to send additional troops this development could result in an increase in negative criticism of nato and europe within the united states some critics of the alliance counter with the argument that if every one of the nato member countries with the exception of the united states contributed just 200 additional troops the isaf commander would have 5000 new assets to deploy similarly just 400 troops per nation would provide isaf with 10000 troops even eliminating the request for additional troops from those nation already deploying t housands of troops commitment of somewhere between 200 and 400 troops by the rest of the alliance would provide sufficient new force these critics point to countries such as bulgaria romania the czech republic and hungary that have large armed forces but contribute less than 500 troops each similarly critics ask why nation such as turkey that deploys 20000 troops in northern cyprus can only provide 800 troops as their commitment to the alliance mission

criticism to the us detention policy at guantanamo bay where some prisoners captured in afghanistan had been sent since 2001 these allies contended that the bush administration was ignoring the geneva

natos discussion over the command structure for stages three and four in afghanistan had reflected the us desire to see the allies more fully embrace counterinsurgency tasks reluctance on the part of some european governments to clash with the taliban and warlords was evident during these discussions although the allies agree on isafs mission they differ on how to accomplish it from at least 2004 the former bush administration had consistently urged the allies to assume more responsibilities in the fight against insurgents and terrorists in afghanistan by late 2005 the administration was urging that isaf and oef be merged under one command britain germany and france were the principal allies opposing the us idea to merge the commands they did so for differing reasons britain and germany wished to preserve isaf as stabilization and not combat mission and because german forces in isaf were trained only for stabilization and not for counterinsurgency operations britain leading the isaf antinarcotics effort wished to ensure that the initiative remained in the political sphere the french view was somewhat different the french government was close to the administration view that some combat operations against the taliban and other elements would be necessary at the same time france was concer ned that the administration after having us commander in place to guide all military activity in afghanistan might use nato as toolbox to accomplish washingtons broader global objectives specifically paris was concerned that the administration would designate more us units from afghanistan to be sent to iraq and leave the allies to stabilize afghanistan administration officials insisted publicly and privately that they had intention of sharply reducing forces in afghanistan and in fact had increased us forces there 46 nevertheless the government of president nicolas sarkozy as noted earlier decided to increase its combat contingent in afghanistan in attempting to resolve the issue of command structure the allies sought to address practical problems for the two operations isaf and oef operate in contiguous areas but there has been clear dividing

agreed to send troops to other parts of the country to assist allied forces in emergency situations as noted above in june 2008 berlin announced that it would seek approval to increase troop levels in

that additional troops beyond the additional 1000 would be approved and that special forces troops would be assigned to the oef counterinsurgency operation the additional troops are expected to boost

dutch forces numbering approximately 1700 are concentrated in the south in uruzgan province one of afghanistans most unstable regions and an area that has seen considerable taliban activity since the spring of 2006 the debate in the dutch parliament over assigning troops to isaf was contentious the abu ghraib prison scandal and us treatment of prisoners at guantanamo were important issues in the dutch debate over afghanistan dutch officials say that the rules of the road in fighting terrorism are not clearly agreed upon in the alliance for this reason dutch officials were initially reluctant to have their forces closely associated with us forces in afghanistan the netherlands was the principal proponent of the section of the december 2005 nato communiqué detailing allied treatment of prisoners in afghanistan54 the dutch population initially opposed sending forces into combat operation ultimately the netherlands deployed significant troop levels for duty in isafs operations dutch troops have grown increasingly engaged in providing secur ity in tandem with an active and wellfunded reconstruction effort in december 2007 the dutch parliament agreed to keep troops in afghanistan but to begin withdrawal in augu st 2010 until all dutch forces are withdrawn by december 1 2010 the parliament expressed dismay that more allies have not been forthcoming in providing forces for southern afghanistan in the dutch view isafs purpose is to provide secure and stable environment for reconstruction the governments policy has been that measures of defense diplomacy and development are key to isafs success when necessary dutch troops will use force to subdue the taliban to build stability so that reconstruction projects may take hold growing number of combat engagements occasionally along with u s troops has occurred since late summer 2006 and dutch forces have suffered casualties 55 the netherlands endorsed the synergy of isaf and oef commands and has made available four f 16s for missions in both isaf and oef the aircraft may be used for missions from intelligence gathering to close air support dutch officials offer strategic approach to afghanistans problems they believe that the alliance must make more concerted effort to engage regional countriesabove all pakistan india and iranto bring stability to the country view given increasing attention in some

without security the taliban must be cleared out before reconstruction can proceed many in the isaf command share the dutch view that nato should build roads and other economic infrastructure to help create an economy to give afghans promise of future 57 as stated previously the dutch give their funding for prt reconstruction activities directly to the afghan central government mainly through and world bank channels dutch officials note the contrast with the us approach which is to bring in turnkey operation in which us officials are trained to undertake reconstruction projects using us manpower and equipment the dutch argue that the karzai government itself must undertake responsibility for planning and implementation of projects to rebuild the country only in this way the dutch believe can the afghans learn good governance and management of their own affairs the dutch are directly involved in some projects providing clean water to villages and almond trees and seeds to farmers for alternative crops for example some us officials believe that the dutch practice of providing assistance funds directly to the afghan government has led to the money being spent on other governmental purposes or landing in the pockets of corrupt afghan officials 58

the governments of the united states britain and canada share similar views on how isaf should fulfil its mission they have sent combat forces to afghanistan maintain prts in the most unstable parts

ongoing debate in the pentagon over whether possible drawdown of us forces in iraq could open the door for more us forces in afghanistan former president bush agreed to increase us forces in

qaeda these officials concede that the line between the two operations is blurred given that oef has been fighting both an insurgency led by the taliban and searching for qaeda60 some allied governments believe that the us combat effort is overly aggressive and in some instances has been counterproductive president karzai has said that air strikes have sometimes been poorly targeted and have carelessly killed civilians which he believes may be alienating the population in some areas of the country in july 2007 nato announced new policy isaf would postpone combat response wh ere possible when civilians are present near the taliban in addition isaf aircraft will use smaller bombs to limit damage to an area 61 in october 2008 natoisaf further refined that policy by suggesting that nato forces would disengage when the need for air strikes could endanger local civilian populations the british view largely mirrors the us view of natos role in afghanistan from cautious position on isafs mission in early 2006 the british government has adopted more aggressive stance as result of the increase in taliban activity in southern afghanistan britain has isaf and oef contingents and its combat aircraft support both missions most of britains isaf troops numbering approximately 8700 are locate d throughout the country with approximately 4200 in the south british forces in the south are largely in helmand province the principal poppygrowing region in the country british forces have an inkblot strategy in which they clear an area of taliban then undertake reconstruction projects such as road building moving out from village into the countryside 62 britain has clearly vested interest in isafs stabilization mission not only out of concern that terrorist activity has emanated from south asia but because most of the heroin found in the united kingdom comes from afghanistan us officials believe that britains prt in helmand province is wellfunded and concentrates on local governance and economic development63 at the same time debate over the proper balance between combat missions and reconstruction continues in britain prime minister browns government now reportedly believes that more emphasis must be given to an effort to reconcile elements of the insurgency with the karzai government the british government reportedly believes that there are hardcore taliban elements incapable of accepting the karzai government but that there are other levels of taliban not affiliated with islamic extremism that can be persuaded to lay down their arms key component of such an approach would be successful reconstruction effort that would provide jobs and broadened economic growth 64 britain had reportedly hoped to increase its force contingent at the bucharest summit but increased violence in iraq has kept combat elements tied down there after the bucharest summit in april 2008 the brown government came under increasing political and economic strain the opposition has called for general elections earlier than those scheduled for 2010 some in browns own government had ggested he step down as leader of the labor party brown has

french parliament at the insistence of the socialists debated the continued presence of french military forces in afghanistan by large margins both the national assembly and the senate voted to continue to support french participation in afghanistan after the vote president sarkozy announced that an additional 100 troops would be sent to afghanistan along with helicopters and ariel drones

point that the taliban is too disjointed of movement to provide any realistic political settlement the declining fortunes of the karzai government also present difficult obstacle nato is attempting both to respect the policies of nascent representative government and to urge it forward to better governance the karzai governments own problems are apparent discontented warlords endemic corruption vigorous drug tr ade the taliban and rudimentary economy and infrastructure in the view of former nato deputy commander general eikenberry the enemy we face is not particularly strong but the institutions of the afghan state remain relatively weak79 there is widespread view that president karzai is losing the confidence of the afghan people he blames the slow pace of reconstruction and insufficient financial support from the international community general ed butler the former commander of british forces in afghanistan said back in may 2006 this year we need to be seen to be making difference it is real danger that if people do not feel safer we may lose their consent in his view poor governance and not the taliban insurgency was the countrys central problem view widely reflected by other officials from nato governments 80 nato in this view must prepare to deal with successive governments of unknown co mposition and policies should the karzai government fail to endure new presidential elections will be held in 2009 and several candidates have already declared their intention to oppose president karzais reelection us and nato political and military leaders must be prepared to walk fine line during the election campaign as they continue to prosecute the war effort and work with the existing government natos effort to assist the karzai government in weakening the narcotics trade demonstrates central dilemma of isafs mission the allies must fight an insurgency tied to the opium industry with forceful means while at the same time attempt to win the confidence of the afghan people through reconstruction of the country and by providing poppy farmers alternative ways to make living in this view breaking down suspecte d insurgents doors in the morning makes it difficult to build bridges in the afternoon 81 while nato officials state publicly that allied forces have not been burning poppy fields depending instead on the afghan army and police to do the job farmers are well aware that it is isaf that supplies the intelligence training and logistics enabling government security forces to attack the industry the lifeline of many poor afghans 82 natos training of afghan officials has made measured progress in some areas and very little in others although the karzai government has complained that nato is not building sufficiently large army fast enough most allies believe that substantial progress has been made in developing professional and reliable force that will eventually equal approximately 125000 troops since the beginning of stage three british french and canadian troops have reportedly given more and more responsibility to the ana in joint operations 83 as of september 2008 the ana had 70000 troops 79 house

more substantial effort to reform the judicial system and build an effective police force italy has successfully urged donor nations to provide more funding to build judicial system and to begin implementation of specific programs using the funds the eu has assumed responsibility for training the police and put professional trainers on the ground in june 2007 an effort yet to bear significant fruit nato faces complex issues in its own ranks and on the ground in afghanistan that are likely to concern isaf over the next several years although the allies agree on their overall mission to stabilize the country they often differ on the means to reach that objective and on the amount of resources to be made available as result na to commanders continue to have difficulty persuading allies to contribute forces to isaf or to provide nato forces the appropriate equipment for their tasks despite past pleas for more troops and an anticipated new effort by the us administration to secure commitments for additional troops it does not seem likely that significant troop increases will come from nato member countries the obama administration is likely to continue to work behind the scenes to have nato leaders announce at least symbolic contribution of additional troops when the alliance meets in april for its 60 th anniversary summit the issue of military equipment continues to remain an unresolved problem many allied forces lack nightvision equipment or the technology necessary to detect roadside bombs the current global economic crisis has made it difficult for some militaries to even consider buying the requisite equipment some nato governments send forces inappropriate for the task forces that are heavy on support functions but light on combat capability these governments tend to be reluctant to send their forces into the field to confront the taliban and to control warlords and their militias the result in this view has been that british canadian dutch danish french and us forces bear disproportionate share of the most dangerous tasks 84 for some allies it is clear that fighting the taliban warlords and the narcotics trade can prevent the return of the taliban qaeda other or radical islamic groups inimical to western interests for others the sooner the afghan government and the civil sector can win the hearts and minds of the general population through economic development and the efficient provision of services the faster stability will take hold the allies had long reached consensus that reconstruction is the key to building viable functioning afghan state officials in allied governments repeatedly point to the need for more road building to extend the reach of kabul and to provide the infrastructure to diversify and strengthen the economy of country lacking the capacity to develop enduring market practices us general eikenberry former deputy commander in afghanistan when asked by congressional committee what he needed to build stable society responded would i prefer to have another infantry battalion on the ground of 600 us soldiers or would i prefer to have 50 million for roads id say 50 million for roads 85 his view has been echoed by calls from the nato secretary general for allies and international institutions to provide more funds for reconstruction political differences within the alliance over how to manage afghanistans future are apparent in isafs operations the allies description of prts as the leading edge of their stabilization effort masks divergent reality some prts are clearly effective building needed infrastructure 84 ibid 85 house armed services committee june 28 2006 op cit

populations others in the view of some us and european officials are more than showcases aimed more at demonstrating an allys desire to participate in an important na to mission than at producing concrete results for the stabilization plan the united states has made an evident effort through its prts to engage local afghan leaders and the general population to convince them of the worth of isafs mission while some progress has clearly been made several us officials have not ed that afghanistan is society where personal contact and developed relationships are critical in building trust and in persuading afghans to pursue better governance the short rotations of some allied forces impede this effort some allied governments however are now sending troops into afghanistan for twoyear rotations which provide better opportunity to gain the confidence of the population some observers have indicated that while some governments have pledged money in the past many have not yet contributed to the reconstruction effort at an international conference to support afghanistan convened in paris in june 2008 delegates pledged 20 billion to support the afghanistan national development strategy key allied governments say that they are committed to staying for period of years to stabilize the c ountry some eu officials believe that five years or more will be necessary to build market economy and proficient governance 86 some allies that were reluctant to commit additional troops to the isaf mission had suggested that they may be willing to contribute additional financial or technical support through the eu effort in afghanistan or the however the recent global economic crisis has forced most of those nations to pull back from making significant financial contributions cohesiveness of command is another lingering issue while the allies reached agreement on command structure linking isaf and oef some observers believe that national commands will preserve the authority to make final decisions about use of their forces the dutch parliamentary debate clearly signaled this inclination an additional problem for many of the allies is growing feeling of an outofarea fatigue in afghanistan and lack of public support for continued involvement in the isaf mission many of the allies have difficult enough problem trying to address the issues of troop commitments and national caveats for their troops already in afghanistan now however many are facing growing restlessness among the public who see little accomplishment and who are calling for bringing the seven year war to an end or at least withdrawing troops from the theater many europeans longer see afghanistan as threat to europe and in the wake of the russian conflict with georgia in the summer of 2008 believe nato needs to refocus its responsibilities for their part the allies desire to stabilize the country and to prevent the return of terrorist state has led to an ongoing general consensus that if afghanistan cannot be stabilized and made more secure the future credibility and relevance of nato will come into question press reports state that the allies produced classified document at the bucharest summit that lays out fiveyear plan for isaf to stabilize the country and turn most combat operations over to the afghan national army 87 subsequently in september 2008 the new commander of the us central command general david patreus indicated that he was conducting total review of the afghanistan war strategy with the intention of developing more comprehensive

mission if ultimately successful isaf can help to build state that is relatively stable longer source of international terrorism and one that attempts to diminish narcotics trade that is threat to european societies isaf may be having residual positive effect on the militaries of some nato members particularly new member states us military personnel say that true reform of new members militaries can best take place in the field under difficult conditions and through operations with more experienced nato militaries by several accounts this experience is being gained in afghanistan 88 g18g155g152g156g153g142g140g157g156g561 the afghanistan mission is an important test of natos outofarea capability in view of growing prevalence afghanistan exemplifies conditions in which extreme belief systems unstable and intolerant societies strategic crime and the globalization of commodities and communications combine to create multidimens ional threat transcending geography function and capability 89 as previously suggested the nato allies have maintained basic unity of purpose in afghanistan their desire to stabilize the country and to prevent the return of terrorist state has led to an ongoing general consensus that isaf can help to build state that is relatively stable and longer source of international terrorism on the other hand the growing level of violence carried out by what some perceive to be resurgent taliban reinforced by the growing num ber of qaeda and other foreign fighters and the perception that the afghan government has not made tangible progress in extending its authority could lead to some wavering among the allies with respect to long term commitment to remain in afghanistan many observers predict that isafs efforts to stabilize afghanistan will require at least five more years or longer this prospect has exacerbated an existing problem that several allied governments already face with respect to declining support among their general populations as the years wear on and the situation on the ground shows little progress and more violence some policymakers believe that the fiveplus years timeframe could ultimately lead to new public pressure on na to member parliaments to consider downgrading support or at least reducing the military commitments to the afghan mission in public opinion survey released by the german marshall fund in september 2008 only 43 of those europeans polled supported combat operations against the taliban 90 as was pointed out by the atlantic council in its march 2008 issue brief the stalemate in afghanistan poses great dilemma for nato how can the 26 nato governments convince their public to support longterm effort in afghanistan without clear indications of real progress either in the security or reconstruction sectors those allies with substantial forces fighting in afghanistan are already fatigued by the political battles at home as adverse domestic opinion challenges the

opinion within some allied nations could be directly attributable to an overall negative opinion of the foreign policy of the previous bush administration especially its iraq policy these observers suggest that the new us administration could have more positive effect on the international stage and could serve to help reverse some of the prevailing skepticism for some observers however renewed emphasis on afghanistan by the obama administration could result in increased pressure on the nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan and lift their restrictive national caveats they argue that more secure environment will allow more rapid development of the afghan infrastructure the economy and government institutions such as the military police and judiciary on the other hand some believe that increased military engagement could lead to more combat operations more violence and more casualties prospect many nato allies would be reluctant to have to explain to their public should the new administration fail to secure even modest new troop commitments from the allies and does eventually send upwards of 30000 additional us soldiers some believe the alliance will face the dual problem of their publics longer willing to support the american war in afghanistan and th us public turning sour view toward europe and nato natos exit strategy for afghanistan requires supporting the development of the economic foundations of the country and providing the security for fledgling government to find stable political footing that excludes violence reduces corruption and creates climate conducive to representative institutions external factors will affect realization of this exit strategy stabilization of afghanistan is closely linked to developments in and the intentions of neighboring iran and pakistan situation that many in the alliance believe demands continuing us presence 92 us leadership of the alliance appears to be at key moment the allies believe that the success of the mission will also be test of the united states ability and commitment to lead nato even if they do not always agree with every element of us policy in the country the united states and its nato allies have greater unity of purpose in afghanistan for now the ultimate outcome of na tos effort to stabilize afghanista n and us leadership of that effort may well affect the cohesiveness
