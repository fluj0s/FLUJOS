entitlement by unog the audit covered expend iture of us 178 million for the academic years 20012002 and 20022003 overall assessment education grant related activities of unog were ade quately administered and the majority of key controls were being applied howeve r the application of certain important controls lacked consistency andor effect iveness in order not to compromise the overall system of internal control timely corr ective action by management is required audit findings and recommendations in oios opinion the regulations and rules conc erning the education grant entitlement as result of educational trends and technological developments such as distance and elearning do not fully reflect what is currently considered postsecondary education oios recommended that unog advocate re vision of the education grant entitlement to bring it uptodate and to allow mor convenient and flexible education arrangements for staff members children unog concurred with oios recommendation oios assessed that unog expeditiously processed edu cation grant advances and claims only few exceptions were found moreover possibl because of the workload which is intense at certain periods there were few errors in processing oios was pleased to note however that prompt action was taken to corr ect any errors found although the number of cases was limited unog had n ot applied the administrative instruction on recovery of overpayments made to st aff members stai200011 in consistent manner oios recommended oneoff reco very of excess education grant advances paid it is not appropriate that the recov ery of advances is treated in the same manner as the recovery of overpayments action is being taken and an information circular will be issued the certification of education grant claims was not always consistent meaning that staff were not treated fairly to ensure more consisten t approach oios recommended that consideration be given by the human resources manag ement service hrms to centralizing the certification of the education gra nt claims for complex cases including special education grant claims and prorated educat ion grant claims in oios opinion the administrative instructions r elating to the eligibility for the 100 per cent reimbursement of special education need to be reviewed and clarified to ensure staff are treated equally some officers certifi ed 100 per cent reimbursement of all the school fees whilst others only certified 100 p er cent of the special educational arrangements provided oios recommended that unog r aise the issue of special education grant with the office of human resources management ohrm and the office of legal affairs to clarify the applicable provisions also there is need to obtain clearer definition of disabled child and or disability and to ensure that these are henceforth applied in fair and consistent man ner unog concurred with oios observations and indicated that they will seek clar ification from ohrm oios found several staff members of french national ity who claimed and received education grant based on their alleged residence in switzerland while actually residing in france oios recommended that before obtaining educ ation grant staff members of french nationality be requested to submit proof of residence in switzerland unog claimed in view of the particular geographical situ ation of geneva staff members can establish residence in either or both countries and easily obtain two certificates of residence an indepth screening of all attestation scertificates would be

general payments unit gpu of frms 5 in september 2000 oios issued proactive investigation report proactive investigation of the education grant entitlement a55352 it was found that the processing and administration of education grant wa s cumbersome and consideration should be given to simplifying it 2 6 draft of this report was shared with the director of the division of administration on 13 august 2004 whose comments have been reflect ed in the report in italics the unog division of administration has accepted most f the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 7 the main objectives of the audit were to assess the administration of the education grant titlement at unog evaluate the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls evaluate whether adequate guidance and procedures re in place determine the reliability and integrity of the data available from the present systems ensure compliance with regulations rules polic ies and procedures iii audit scope and methodology 8 the audit focused on education grant entitl ements covering the period of years 2001 to 2003 in addition for specific cases an i ndepth review was conducted of staff members claims going beyond the 2001 to 2003 period the expenditure related to education grant was us 178 million during 2001 to 2003 the number of staff members and their children benefiting from the education gr ant entitlement during the same period was 728 and 1179 respectively 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of the internal control systems interviews with staff an analysis of appl icable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records as normal udit procedure third party confirmation was performed by contacting the school s concerned on randomly selected education grants claims 10 education grant for unhcr staff members wa s excluded from the audit scope as an audit of the unhcr education grant entitlement h ad been conducted in 2003 iv audit findings and recommendations regulations rules and administrative instructio ns 11 distance learning has been mainstream thod of postsecondary education for over 40 years yet stai20042 dated 24 june 200 4 considers correspondence courses including internetbased courses as nonadmissible except where such courses are th only available substitute for fulltime attendance at school of type not available at the duty station or where such courses are related to academic subjects that are not included in the regular school curriculum but are required for the childs subsequent education section 35 c 12 today distance learning is considered as an alternative approach to more 3 conventional teaching methods and several universi ties offer this in addition to their normal fulltime attendance curriculum it is parti cularly pertinent in todays society where technological developments have made synchronous m ultisite teaching facilities increasingly viable further the internet has brou ght dramatic changes to the learning environment and has led to the development of virt ual learning or elearning there is an increase in the number of students enrolling in suc h courses which is cost effective option in comparison to traditional postsecondary education 13 oios noted that distance learning courses are already eligible for reimbursement under who rules and procedures and unog contrary to the present rules has already exceptionally approved the reimbursement of such course to staff member oios would recommend more active involvement of unog in advo cating and promoting the revision of the education grant entitlement with the office of human resources management ohrm to bring it uptodate with current trends nd developments and to allow more convenient and flexible educational arrangements fo r staff members children recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should advocate and promote revision of the education grant entitleme nt with the office of human resources management to bring it up todate with current trends and developments and to allow m ore convenient and flexible educational arrangements for staff mem bers children rec 01 14 the unog division of administration accepted the re commendation concurring that education grant entitlements should be brought uptodate with current trends and technical developments and take distance and virtua l learning into consideration b geneva school tax reimbursement 15 based on information circular icgeneva3 277 geneva school tax dated 11 november 1985 unog continues to reimburse general service staff an education levy imposed by the canton of geneva on staff members c hildren who attend local secondary schools or the university of geneva although the instruction refers specifically to geneva unog has expanded its scope of application and has reimbursed education levies imposed elsewhere in switzerland moreover the rei mbursable amounts outlined in the circular are outdated in the 80s there was much debate on the tax but action has been taken in recent years nor to oios understanding have unogs concerns over this special levy been raised recently with the swiss authoritie s although the amount of money and number of staff involved are not significant about chf 30000 and 40 staff members per school year respectively considering the passage of time 19 years this issue needs to be readdressed 4 recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should readdress with the swiss authorities the education levies imposed on u n staff members by the canton of geneva and other cantons based on the result of these discussions unog should review and update the information circular icgeneva3277 geneva school tax dated 11 november 1985 rec 02 16 the unog division of administration agreed to imple ment the recommendation c education grant advanceclaims and recovery proc essing 17 oios assessed that unog expeditiously pro cessed education grant advances and claims only few exceptions were found moreover possibly because of the workload which is intense at certain periods during the year there were few errors found in relation with the processing corrective action was subseque ntly taken 18 in general any advances exceeding the ac tual expenditures incurred were recovered timely after the end of the school year the procedures adopted however were not consistently applied nor were they in oios op inion compliant with established procedures for instance there were repeated postp onements in the recovery process on the intervention of hrms the reasons and justification of which were not clear or documented 19 further although the number of cases was limited unog had not applied the administrative instruction on recovery of overpaym ents made to staff members stai200011 in consistent manner when an edu cation grant advance was to be recovered in full unog considered it as an advanc and recovered it in one instalment however when the recovery was the result of an edu cation grant claim settlement unog treated it as an overpayment that was to be reco vered as soon as possible whilst reducing the staff members monthly salary by more than 2 0 per cent per month subject to the staff member having contract of sufficient durati on to allow such an approach this means in practice that recoveries were usually made in several monthly deductions 20 in oios opinion there should be one off recovery of education grant advances oios would like to point out that it is t he responsibility of the staff member to report the payment of excessive advances since hr ms deals with such cases favourably at present in essence by granting staff members an interest free loan they are sending wrong message moreover at time when the is t rying to streamline and make efficiencies such practice generates more admini strative work for frms recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should inform s taff of their responsibilities in refunding excess amounts advanc ed for 5 education grant staff should also be informed that in the future any excess advances will be recovered at once and i n full and not be treated in the same manner as overpayments rec 03 21 the unog division of administration agreed with the recommendation and indicated that they have already implemented the cond part of the recommendation all amounts of outstanding education grant advances wh ether because of nonreceipt of claim or resulting from overpayment are now being recovered in full via payroll deduction unog intends to issue an information cir cular to staff on the reimbursement procedure 22 oios would advocate improved communication between hrms and the different parts of frms to ensure that information flows more smoothly for example the recovery of an education grant advance of staff member who was on special leave without pay slwop was initiated only when the staff member di d not submit the education grant claim the staff members in the gpu dealing with ed ucation grant were generally found to be proficient and knowledgeable on the related r egulations rules and procedures oios observed that they often advised hrms to ensur conformity in the application of the rules and procedures particularly with referen ce to the admissible and nonadmissible costs 23 in its report dated 1 september 2000 proa ctive investigation of the education grant entitlement a55352 oios recommended that seri ous consideration be given to the suggestion that the education grant entitlement be provided on lumpsum basis for each country in which school is located oios apprecia tes that developing suitable lump sum approach may take time but would be in accord with hrms suggestion of simplifying some of the eligible costs such as the textbook all owance in many cases hrms indicated that it had to spend considerable time to determine if books are eligible or not for reimbursement alternatively a55352 recommended to ensure sistency the centralization of the processing of the education g rant within one office at each of the duty stations unog had accepted this but has not initi ated any action to centralize the administration of education grant apart from takin g over the administration of project personnel while it may not be practical to central ize the processing of all claims consideration should be given to centralizing the c ertification of complex cases as well as those relating to special education grant claims an d prorated education grant claims this will ensure consistency and fair treatment of all staff recommendation head2right the unog human resources management service should centralise the certification of education grant cla ims for complex cases as well as those relating to special educatio n grant claims and prorated education grant claims to ensure consiste nt application of the entitlement rec 04 24 the unog human resources management service has est ablished an to z organisational system of work to ensure hr assistan ts are required to become familiar 6 with all types of claims it was not clear from the response to oios recom mendation as to whether steps will be taken to centralize the certi fication function for certain complex cases d special education grant 25 in oios opinion the administrative instr uctions relating to the eligibility for the 100 per cent reimbursement of special education nee d to be reviewed and clarified the present provisions are vague and ambiguous paragra ph 54 of stic20025 leaves the interpretation of the definition of disabled child to the medical director or designated medical officer who will determine based on pre vailing medical standards the acceptability of the certificate attesting to the disability of the child for the purpose of the special education grant moreover various hrms human resources officers were applying the provision differently some officers certified 100 per cent reimbursement of all the school fees whilst others only certified 1 00 per cent of the special educational arrangements provided oios noted one case where limit erroneously was set at the country threshold of normal education grant meanin g that the staff member was not reimbursed the full amount for special education gr ant 26 this issue has been discussed on number of occasions the medical director requested recommendation from the former administ rative committee on coordination acc in 1998 to determine whether children classi fied as having learning disabilities lds or attention deficit disorder add qualify s disabled the aac did not directly take stand in the issue as it did not consider it appropriate to impose views over those of the medical directors in the medical determination of disability oios did not find any followup on this issue 27 furthermore it is interesting to note in this regard that the medical director referred to steady increase of requests for child ren classified as having lds or add forming 42 per cent of the beneficiaries of the spe cial education grant in headquarters in 1997 the medical director stated that these ditions are relatively common affecting as much as 15 per cent of the population and that the diagnosis is not made on medical findings but on the basis of psychometric tests and psychological evaluations affected children have normal or superior intelligence and in the medical directors opinion do not require special tutoring but rather such measures s placement in the front row of the classroom and in classes with smaller number of chi ldren allotment of longer periods of time to take examinations etc at unog out of th 20 cases concerning special education grant that oios selected for review some 50 per ce nt related to children that were registered as having learning difficulties 28 oios discussed the differences between the coverage of special education grant and medical insurance in the case of learning difficult ies with both the joint medical service jms and the united nations staff mutual insurance society in accordance with section 151 in relation with 132 of stai19994 and graph 55 of stic20025 the staff member is required to provide evidence that he or s he has exhausted all other sources of benefits that may be available for the education an d training of the child including those that may be obtained from state and local governmen ts and from the contributory 7 medical insurance plans despite this 1998 genev based working group decided that the education grant entitlement should reimburse all co sts related to learning difficulties 29 oios would like to highlight that this dec ision has financial impact on the and means that staff members are not treated fairly for example if staff member needs to obtain expert help from outside the education sy stem which may be necessary for children with severe learning difficulties they ar only eligible for 75 per cent of the school fees those that need remedial or extra tuition w hich is provided by specialized teachers at normal school can benefit from the 100 per ce nt reimbursement 30 more attention is required by hrms to ensu re that an uptodate medical certification is obtained and appropriately filed b efore certifying eligibility to special education grant the applicable provisions requi re that the education grant claim must be accompanied by medical certificate which shou ld be submitted to the medical director or designated medical officer for determ ining the acceptability of the claim nevertheless oios found one case index 28708 where hrms had exceptionally accepted the provision of the special education gra nt without any such medical certificate oios also found case index 282604 where the staff members file contained certification from the jms only for the school year 19992000 though the staff member received special education grant continuously until the school year 20022003 oios further enquired after the apparently missing certi fications from jms and was told that jms had certified special education grant for the s chool years 20012002 and 20022003 as well the copies of these certificates had however not been attached to the staff members file apart from that the staff member received sp ecial education grant for the school year 20002001 without any certification from the jms recommendations head2right the unog division of administration should raise th issue of special education grant with the office of human re sources management to clarify the applicable provisions in particular with regard to the definition of disabled child ndor disability as well as the costs to be reimbursed under medic insurance andor special education grant and to ensure that these are henceforth applied in fair equal and consistent manner rec 05 head2right the unog human resources management service should not provide special education grant without submission of medical certificate section 151 of stai19994 in relati on with paragraph 54 of stic20025 and without evidence of exhaust ions of other sources section 151 in relation with 132 of sta i19994 and paragraph 55 of stic20025 rec 06 31 the unog division of administration accepted the re commendations they will seek clarification from ohrm they also indicated t hat what constitutes evidence of the exhaustion of other sources will be clarified as we ll as the type and number of sources available may vary from one country to the other 8 p41 form 32 as normal audit procedure and to obtain independent third party confirmation oios contacted number of schools to verify the co mpleteness and correctness of the education grant amounts claimed by staff members oios found that the contact information recorded on the certificate of attenda nce and costs and receipt for payments form p41 which is normally filled ut and certified by the educational institution was not adequate for this kind of foll owup for instance the form does not require email andor web site addresses of the sch ools concerned this made contacting the schools cumbersome process as other means of contact such as telephone fax and regular mail had to be used 33 the confirmations oios got from the school s were mostly consistent with the information given on the p41 forms there were som differences in the indication whether the school had provided books for free or n ot oios also noted that in some cases public schools in geneva indicated that books were not provided for free to simplify matters oios would recommend that unog obtain dire ctly from the canton of geneva list of those schools providing books free of charg for reference to mitigate errors made in filling the p41 form 34 oios encountered problems with some school s that refused to provide the information requested on the basis of privacy and c onfidentiality laws though the p41 form already contains clause for independent conf irmation requests by auditors and other relevant staff it is vaguely formulated oios discussed this issue with unogs senior legal officer who agreed that the particula r clause should be clarified and revised he suggested including clause on the p41 form t hat would request explicit written consent from the staff member as well as commitmen t from the school to provide the with any information related to the education of th child the clause could read by signing this form all the parties the staff member the student and the educational institution agree to make available all informatio n required by the in order to obtain confirmation of the information provided by this fo rm unog will need to raise this issue with ola and ohrm recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should raise wi th the office of human resources management and the office of leg affairs the issue of including in the p41 form clause nabling the to obtain all information needed for verification and confirmation purposes and waiving any conflicting privacyconfid entiality requirements rec 07 35 the unog division of administration accepted the re commendation adding that unog intended to review the existing form p41 and the related procedure in order to simplify them they further elaborated that by acce pting the attestations issued by some schools in lieu of the p41 provided the required information is supplied hrms had 9 already gone one step in this direction f information system support 36 from the systems used imis and paradox it was not always easy to reconcile the details to the claim moreover due to the limitati ons of imis and the difficulties some staff experience in using the system number of errors were noted for example an overpayment of nearly eur 3000 was made because th option school at duty station was not selected in addition oios observed numer ous cases where unogs general payments unit had advised certifying officers to re vise different options to ensure the correct outcome unog has taken action to initiate recoveries of ove rpayments 37 apart from that number of calculation rrors were noted in particular in those cases where child attended two educational instit utes during the same school year imis cannot cope with such situation and therefore th reimbursements need to be calculated manually and put into imis thereafter 38 the guidance in relation to the amount eli gible for reimbursement when child attends two educational institutions within one yea r is not clear particularly if this relates to different countries with different thresholds in oios opinion the eligible reimbursement should be prorated in accordance with the time spent at each institution and the maximum education grant level should be determi ned prorating the respective country thresholds but this was not always found to be the case recommendations head2right the unog division of administration should request an upgrade of imis to accommodate the different options necess ary to properly process education grant claims rec 08 head2right the unog human resources management service should seek clarification from the office of human resources ma nagement on the appropriate method to calculate education grant in cases where child attends two educational institutions in di fferent countries with different thresholds within one school year rec 09 39 the unog division of administration accepted the re commendations but accentuated that the issue raised of the programmes of studies abroad implying that the child attends two educational institutions in diffe rent countries has been addressed by ohrm in guideline included in the administrative handbook unog intends to prepare similar guideline for the benefit of hrms and frm s staff oios had already noted this but as it was limited to students studying in the u nited states who attend an exchange year abroad and are invoiced by their regular institute in us dollars it gives only limited clarification to the issued raised in this report oios however welcomes the initiative of unog to issue guideline and would like to emphas ize the overall need for clarification of the prorating method not only in the case of mporary exchange programs or studies abroad but also in the case of change of education institute due to for example the staff 10 members change of duty station it needs to be cl arified as to whether the two school attendances are prorated separately against the nor mal school years in each country or in proportion to the attendance of the child during to tal school year the prorating principles need to be clearly stipulated and hence consistentl applied g other issues education grant for french nationals 40 some 65 per cent of the staff members t unog including french nationals reside in france according to staff rule 10320 b i staff members are entitled to an education grant in respect of each of their childre n if they are regarded as an international recruit under rule 1047 and reside and serve at duty station which is outside their home country staff rule 10320 iii defines home country as the country of home leave of the staff member under staff rule 1053 concernin g home leave staff rule 1053 d specifies the staff members country of home leave by stating that it shall be the country of the staff members nationality french nationa ls who serve in geneva and reside in france are therefore not entitled to receive educat ion grant 41 oios found one case where french nationa l staff member index 323012 who is living in france according to imis neverthel ess received education grant in addition to this oios found case where the staff member had the french nationality but stated his home country to be another country inde x 555434 this then led to the provision of education grant 42 in light of the staff rules as mentioned b efore it is clear that staff members home country is in principle the country of his or her n ationality only in exceptional and compelling cases the secretarygeneral may authoriz country other than the staff members country of nationality as his or her home country for the purposes of this home leave rule staff rule 1053 d iii in any such case the staff member will have to provide satisfactory evidence of the fact that h or she maintained normal residence in such other country for prolonged period preceding his or her appointment that he or she continues to have close family and personal ties in that country and that the staff members home leave there would not be inconsistent with the purposes and intent of staff regulation 53 since this provision is limitative and most of the staff members concerned reside in france the country of their nationality at presen t it is important that the unog administration obtains copy of the satisfactory vidence as mentioned above before education grant andor other benefits are provided to the staff members concerned 43 oios came across several cases where staf f members who were actually residing in france claimed and received education grant on the basis of their alleged residence in switzerland when going through the pages jaunes et blanches of both switzerland and france oios found that several staff members have an address in both france and switzerland index 69823 86480 310873 86422 in at least one of these cases the address of the child was used as the staff members swiss residence index 767286 others only have an address in france index 6 97759 367140 469188 in most of these cases the address details in imis did not cor respond with any of the actual addresses 11 found an education grant was nevertheless granted in all of these cases 44 during discussions with hrms it became cl ear that the understanding of the applicable rules in this regard for some staff memb ers seemed to be that french national staff members who reside in france but whose childr attend schools in switzerland are entitled to education grant oios would stress tha t this is not the case since the staff members residence is decisive element for eligib ility unog should request french nationals to submit proof of residence with their nnual education grant claim in accordance with staff rule 1044 the address information in imis should also be updated on regular basis and correspond to the ad dress details as provided in the personnel status and the carte légitimation fi recommendations head2right the unog division of administration should request french nationals to submit an up to date attestation of r esidence with their annual education grant claim in accordance with st aff rule 1044 unog administration should update imis and per sonnel files accordingly rec 10 head2right the unog division of administration should review t he cases which raise doubts about staff members residence in switzerland and should recover any amounts of educ ation grant incorrectly paid rec 11 45 the unog division of administration did not accept recommendation 10 claiming that what constitutes valid proof of residence sh ould be clearly defined they further justified that in view of the particular geographic situation of the duty station staff members can establish residence in either or both c ountries and easily obtain two certificates of residence one for each country n indepth screening of all attestationscertificates would be extremely timec onsuming and not necessarily conclusive oios reemphasizes the importance of the recommen dation and trusts that the unog division of administration is able to define cceptable proof of residence using for example documentation similar to that required for rental subsidy as reference oios would like to point out that once the staff member s are given the chance to update and clarify their residential status and as long as hr ms makes sure that personnel status files carte légitimation files and imis details corr espond and are updated on regular basis the burden of proof rests with the staff member hen ceforth staff regulation 11 b in relation with staff rule 1044 b 1 appropriate disciplinary action will be undertaken against those staff members found to hav submitted false declaration in this regard 1 please note that the last two sentences of the pplication for carte légitimation in respect of staff member form read i hereby certify that the abov ementioned statements are true and that i am not f swiss nationality i shall notify the personnel service of any change in my status as described above 12 46 the unog division of administration accepted recomm endation 11 and stated that unog is currently reviewing the cases mentione d in the report and will take corrective measures if appropriate b mother tongue tuition 47 for mother tongue tuition oios noticed th at the hourly rates paid to teachers differed quite substantially and were sometimes ex cessive in one case the tuition was as much as chf 120 per hour more than one and half times the hourly rate paid for shortterm language staff oios also observed that the credentials for the teachers varied and not all the teachers supplied information perta ining to their qualifications while appreciating that there is threshold for the paym ent of language tuition consideration should be given to limiting the hourly rate reimbur sable to that paid to shortterm language teachers recommendation head2right the unog human resources management service should limit the maximum reimbursement for mother tongue tuition to the hourly rates paid to shortterm language teacher s also amounts should only be reimbursed on evidence that the language training has been provided by an appropriately qual ified teacher rec 12 48 the unog division of administration did not
