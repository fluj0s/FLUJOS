outcomes fina lly there is wide consensus that rcts are particularly well suited for answer ing certain types of questions but not others compared to other evaluation research designs for example rcts typically do not assess how and why impacts occur how program might be modified to improve program results or programs costeffectiveness rcts also typically do not provide full pict ure of whether

application of sbrr to the reading first pr ogram for example robert slavin of the success for all program has argued that the nclbas requirement that interventions be based on sbr does not di fferentiate between programs that have themselves been rigorously evaluated and those programs that have not been rigorously evaluated for effi cacy but can cite sbr that supports their interventions the success for all foundation also argues in letter to the office of the inspector general of the us dept of ducation oig that ed has inappropriately narrowed the definition of scientifically based research in its implementation of the reading first program in essence through the implemen tation of reading first the us department of education has narrowed the definition of sbrr to the five essential components of reading as identified by the national reading panel research on program efficacy has been ignored because reading first was so closely managed by the us department of education and becaus it contains such strong focus on the use of scientifically based research it is paving the way for how states districts and school s are coming to understand the meaning of sbr and how they will apply it to other federal programs23 as consequence of the alleged narro wing of the definition of sbrr states have been unnecessarily limited in their choices of reading programs assessments and

in tervention each report scribes the intervention for example program product practice or policy and has brief description of each outcome study the report also presents in single table the findings from the wwcvetted studies these reports are released as soon as they are produced typically at the same time as the topic report intervention reports cannot be prepared for interventions whose studies do not pass wwc standards topic reports each topic report briefly descri bes the topic and each intervention that the wwc reviewed the report covers only interventions that had studies passing wwcstandards topic reports are usually released at the same time as intervention reports because each topic level report provides compilation of completed intervention reports the topic report describes how the wwc search ed the literature describes the key features of interventions at the time they were studie d and presents the findings the topic report also notes the overall strength of the resear ch base for each intervention providing an accessible picture of interventions that met wwc evidence standards the topic report links to all related intervention reports the what works evidence standards identify st udies that provide the strongest evidence of effects primarily well conducted randomized controlled trials and regressiondiscontinuity studies and secondarily quasiexperimental studies of especially strong design in addition the standards rate other important characteristics of study design such as intervention fidelity outcome measures and generalizabilityin its spring 2003 edition of learning point call for evidence responding to the new emphasis on scientific ally based research these resources are however not all cen tralized in one cation and relatively few provide analysis of speci fic educational instruction or assessment packages that might meet the sbr requirements of the nclb it can be difficult for states and leas to sift through the volume of inform ation that is available and find what they need to chose effective curriculum and assessment programs ellen lagemann was interviewed by education week on the topic of sbr while working for the spencer foundation she stated we have tended to think that if you do research and get results that will be useful to practitioners theres an intermediary step you have to take the results of research and build it into toys t ools tests and texts you have to build it into things that practitioners can use they cant use the conclusions of study27 eds ies created what works clearing house wwc to address this need for clear userfriendly information on sbr including evaluations of specific educational interventions the wwc publishes reviews of educational inte rventions that have sbr to back up their efficacy claims on education topics that the wwc has identified as priorities initially the wwc intended to issue only topic reports but in may of 2006 the wwc modified its webs ite to include new intervention reports28 these intervention reports have been introduced so that potentially usefulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33246crs14 29 see http wwwedgovprogram

center for read ing first technical assistance to provide training to states and districts to assist with reading first31 according to ed in its march 1 2004 issue of the achiever administrators and teachers will receive tr aining in scientifically based reading research and instruction assistance in reviewing reading programs and assessments critiques of reading first subgrant applications and methods of scoring them and training in using assessment data to improve student reading performance technical assistance will be provided through range of learning opportun ities including national

perhaps in part because of the difficulties in finding specific information on sbrr based edu cational interventions that meet the requirements of the nclba many states have chosen to rely upon limited numbe r of instructional assessment and professi onal training programs this has raised concerns by some about what they call the overprescriptiv eness of eds application of sbrr to reading first and the potential infringemen t on states and leas ability to choosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33246crs15 33 elementary and secondary education act of 1965 section 9527 34 the state audits were issued on october 3 2005 alabama october 20 2006 wisconsin november 3 2006 new york and january 18 2007 georgiacurricula some argue that this overprescriptiveness is not consistent with section 9527 of the child left behind act this section states the following general prohibition nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the federal government to mandate direct or control state local educational ag ency or schools curriculum program of instruction or allocation of state or local resources or mandate state or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this act b prohibition on endorsement of curriculum notwithstanding any other prohibition of federal law funds provided to the department under this act may be used by the department to endorse approve or sanction any curriculum designed to be used in an elementary school or secondary school33 the 2005 cep study discussed earlier in th is report did find that states were remarkably consistent in their choice of programs for example the 2005 cep study found that many states were require d to revise their initial application for reading first before it was accepted cep found that in their final accepted applications almost all states incl uded dibels on their list of approved assessments and used the consumers guide to evaluate and choose reading curriculum additionally the cep study found that state recommendations of specific reading programs appear to have influenced districts choice of reading programs the survey of districts recei ving reading first funds found that half changed the reading programs used by the district to qualify for grant from their state office of the inspector general audits three groups representing different readin g programs filed parate complaints with eds oig asking that the reading first program be investigated the three groups that filed complaints are dr c upps readers and journal writers success for all and the reading recovery council of rth america in response the oig has conducted several audits of the reading first program it issued its first report on the federal reading first program specifically on reading firsts grant application process in september of 2006 in additi on several audits of state reading first programs have been issue d and audits have been c onducted on eds administration of the reading first program and on the rm c research corporations reading first contract34 these three reports essentially valid ated many of the concerns that had been raised in complaints filed with the oig ed concurred with the oigs recommendations in all three reports and has addressed the recommendationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33246crs16 35 all of the discussion contained in this sec tion is based on the oigs inspection report and from eds responses to the oig report included as attachments to the report us dept of education office of inspector general the reading first programs grant application process final inspection report september 2006oig final inspection report the reading first programs grant appli cation process the oig report on the reading first app lication process was highly critical of eds implementation of the reading first program the major findings included in this report are summarized below the oig found that the expert revi ew panel that reviewed state applications for reading first grants was not selected as required by the nclba section 1203c2a of the nclba requires the peer review panel to include at minimum three individuals selected by each of the following agencies the secretary of the us department of educati on the national institute for literacy nifl the national research council of the national academy of sciences nas and three individuals selected by the national institute of child health and human developmen t ed created 16 subpanels to review state applications and according to the oig majority of the panelists on 15 out of the 16 subpane ls had been nominated by ed in addition none of the subpanels included nominee from each of the other organizations specified in section 1203c2a of the nclba and the oig found evidence that the subpanels met to review applications as whole before recommending that the secretary approve or disapprove states application the oigs report states that because the department did not meet the requirements at sections 1203c2a it raises the question of whether any of the applications were approved in compliance with the law35 although not required to do so by law ed screened potential panelists for conflicts of interest however the screening process used was ineffective according to the oig the oig reviewed resumes provided to ed by 25 r eading first panelists and found that six of the panelists had sign ificant professiona l connections to specific reading program ed failed to follow its own guidance reviewer guidance for the reading first program for conducting the peer review process the oig found that the review panelists provide d constructive comments in the panel chair summaries submitted to ed that would have been useful to states whose applications we re not approved in making needed modifications to their applications however ed did not share these panel summaries with the states instead the reading first director and his assistant used these panel summaries to write their own reports which were then provided to stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33246crs17 according to the oig these reports did not always accurately reflect the panel chair summaries sometimes the reading first director and his assistant changed or omitted panelists comments and sometimes they added their own comments as consequence states sometimes lacked adequate information to correct their applications and were required to submit amended applications several times before they were pproved in addition the oig found that five state applications we re approved wit hout documentation that these states had met the requi red criteria or that the subpanels had approved these applications some of the criteria required by the department for panelists to approve states application were not based on requirements included in the nclba ed pr ovided panelists with 25 criteria to be rated in each state application reading first criteria for review of state applications three rating categories were established for each criterion exemplary meets standard and does not meet standard the meets standard category was the bar all states were expected to meet for application approval the exemplary category was applied to conditions above and beyond meets standard that were belie ved would result in the highest quality programs however the oig found that some of requirements in the meets standard category were not requirements contained in the nclb and as consequence state applications were reviewed ba sed upon standards that were not required by statute finally the oig found that program officials tried to purposely obscure the content of the statute the esea and otherwise took actions to disregard congress dir ection and intent the oig also found that eds actions demonstr ate that the program officials failed to maintain controlled environment that exemplifies management integrity and accountab ility further the oig found that eds actions may have violat ed prohibitions in the department of education organization act deoa and the esea against federal endorseme nt of particular curricula the oig recommended that the assistant secretary of eds office of elementary and secondary education oese take the following actions implement procedures to ensure oese staff know when to solicit advice from the office of the gene ral counsel ogc as well as procedures to resolve disputes that might arise between oese staff and the ogc to ensure that programs are managed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in consultation with the ogc make improvements to strengthen procedures for evaluating potential conflicts of interest in panel review processeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33246crs18 review all reading first applications to ensure all necessary criteria were met make changes as appropriate to the management and staff structure of the reading first program to ensure that reading firsts implementation is consistent with nclba requirements ask the ogc to provide guidance on what is prohibited by section 3403b of the department of education organization act rely upon an internal advisory committee which includes representatives from oese programs the ogc and eds risk management team to ensure that future initiatives are appropriately implemented and c oordinated with ot her ed programs request that the internal advisory committee evaluate whether the implementation of reading first harmed the federal interest and whether any remedial ac tions are required in addition request that the internal advisory committee ensure that ed has internal controls in place so that future progra ms do not have problems similar to those that occurred with reading first establish discussion with state and local education representatives to discuss issues with reading first as part of the reauthorization process the secretary of the us department of education ed responded in writing that she agreed with all of the recommendations of the oig and would take immediate action to implement these recommendations however ed also responded that it did not agree with all of the findings reached by the oig ed noted that it has information to indicate that its peer review process adversely affected any state it also noted that screening fo r conflicts of interest was not required but it took this extra effort and made reasona ble efforts to adapt conflictofinterest procedures to the reading first program regarding its screening of panelists ed stated that we know that while additional steps could have been taken the steps we took were effective and more than what was required by w ed also indicated that the statute did not specify the role of peer review comments and that it had not replaced process required by the nclba in addition its further review of reading first staff summaries of these comments f ound that overall the summaries did not deviate significantly from the reviewers comments ed also stated that the peer review panel was advisory and that it was not practical to have the panel review every resubmitted state application in ddition ed noted that the reading first criteria it issued to panelists was intended to encourage highquality projects that go beyond the minimum standards of the statute ed stated that overall the reading first guidance has proven to be helpful and it is consistent with the law and consistent with helping ensure the submission of high quality applications finally ed stated that we are not aware of information showing inappropriate actions to require particular prog rams or approacheshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33246crs19 36 all of the discussion contained in this ction is based on the oigs audit

assistance centers to assist in providing technical assistance to seas and leas in the program impleme ntation phase the oigs major findings are summarized below rmc did not adequately monitor its
