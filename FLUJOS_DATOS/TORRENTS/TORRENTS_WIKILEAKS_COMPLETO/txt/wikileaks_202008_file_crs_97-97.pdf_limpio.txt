education act of 1970 pl 91516 established an office of environmental education in the department of health educatio n and welfare to award grants for developing environmental curricula and training teachers congress moved the office to the newly formed department of education in 1979 however in response to the reagan administrations efforts to transfer the federal role in many programs to the states congress eliminated the office of environmental education in 1981 several years later the 101 st congress enacted the national environmental education act of 1990 pl 101619 to renew the federal role in environmental education and reestablish an office of environmental education within epa in the laws findings the 101st congress stated that existing federal programs to educate the public about environmental problems and train environmental professionals were inadequate at that time and that increasing the federal role in this area was therefore necessary pl 101619 authorizes epa to work with educational institutions nonprofit organizations the private sector tribal governments and state and local environmental agencies to educate the public about environmental problems and encourage students to pursue environmental careers environmental education involves learning ecological concepts to understand the relationships between human behavior and environmental quality and developing the knowledge and skills to analyze environmental problems and create solutions the goal of epas environmental education program is to increase public knowledge about environmental issues and provide the public with the skills necessary to make informed decisions and take responsible actions to protect the environment the program supports activities to achieve these goals primarily through the awarding of grants since the beginning of the program in fy1992 epa has awarded grants for environmental education projects in each of the 50 states the district of columbia and us territories for educating elementary and secondary school students training teachers purchasing textbooks developing curricula and other educational activities this report summarizes major provisions

continued to fund the program since then through the annual appropriations process without enacting reauthorizing legislation congress has appropriated approximately 9 million annually in recent years with the exception of 56 million in fy2007 congress returned funding to previous leve ls in fy2008 appropriating 89 million although funding for the program has continued the president has proposed to eliminate its funding in his annual budget requests each year since fy2003 including his fy2009 budget request the president has used the environmental education programs performance rating by the office of management and budget omb as the main justification for his recurring proposal to eliminate the programs funding omb has repeatedly given the program results not demonstrated rating as part

performance metrics for grant activities supported by the environmental education program makes it difficult to determine whether the program is achieving its goal of improving the quality of environmental education opponents of the presidents proposal to eliminate the programs funding have noted that there are longstanding disagreements among educators ab out how to evaluate the quality of education and that the lack of performance metrics for educational activities is not unique to epas environmental education program such critics have countered ombs characterization of the programs effectiveness by arguing that grant aw ards have had national impact with small amount of funding relative to epa s total budget the activities supported by these grants also have generated significant state and local support in response congress has continued the programs funding each year

elementary and secondary school students train teachers increase understanding of environmental issues and accomplish related goals educational institutions state and local agencies tribal governments and nonprofit organizations are eligible to apply for these grants section 6 of the act requires epa to reserve 38 of the environmental education programs annual funding to support these grants the act limits single grant to 250000 and requires epa to award 25 of the grants for amounts of 5000 or less to ensure greater number of grant awards among recipients notably fulfilling this latter requirement with respect to smaller grants has become increasingly impractical as the dollar amount of proposed grants has risen with inflation and price increases over time since the 1990 enactment of the statute the act also requires each grant recipient to provide at least 25 of projects costs in matching funds but grants epa the discretion to provide up to full federal funding under certain circumstances in practice epa reports that many of its grant recipients now provide more than the minimum 25 in matching funds underscoring local commitments to funded projects since the first year of the grant program in fy1992 epa has awarded nearly 42 million in grants for more than 3200 environmental education projects in all 50 states the district of columbia and us territories 3

members of congress have broadly supported the role of the federal government in environmental education on bipartisan basis there has been continuing controversy over its role in the classroom there appears to be general consensus that educating students in the natural and social sciences to examine the potential impacts of human behavior on the environment is appropriate for instruction however some critics argue that certain textbooks and curricula misinform students by advocating specific measures to address environmental problems or by presenting unbalanced or scientifically inaccurate data in response epa has issued guidelines specifying that the environmental education grants it awards cannot be used for projects that would recommend specific course of action or advocate particular viewpoint and that activities must be based on objective and scientifically sound information to be eligible for funding howeve r the national environmental education act does 4 for the

to these guidelines whether to include such requirements in federal statute has been an issue interest in the federal governments role in environmental education has become broader in response to public desire for better understanding of complex environmental issues affecting human health sustainability of natural resources biological diversity and other societal objectives the complexity of such issues and the ability of schools to address them have motivated some educators to question whether epa or other federal agencies should play more prominent role in environmental education in the 110 th congress at least two bills would broadly address the federal role in environmental education as introduced on august 2 2007 the child left inside act of 2007 s 1981 would expand the federal role in environmental education by creating an office of environmental education within the department of education to administer new grant programs intended to supplement epas existing program as passed by the house on september 18 2008 the child left inside act of 2008 hr 3036 would directly amend the national environmental education act of 1990 for similar purpose of authorizing new grant program within the department of education to supplement epas ex isting efforts this new grant program would differ from epas current program by focusing more on the outcome of environmental education in terms of achieving academic standards and demonstrating environmental literacy three amendments to the bill were agreed to in house floor debate that would expand the eligibility of recipients of the new grants to include municipalities to make instruction in environmental justice issues an eligible use of grant funds and to specify the eligibility of activities that involve partnering with state and local park and recreation departments in addition to creating new role for the partment of education hr 3036 would further amend the national environmental education act of 1990 to reauthorize funding for epas existing program in fy2009 and to require the integration of certain activities into epas teacher training program such as scientifically valid research as defined in the bill technologybased teaching interdisciplinary instruction and outdoor learning although these activities would become required elements current law does not necessarily preclude their integration
