international relations foreign affairs defense and trade division the population fund background and the us funding debate summary the united nations population fund unfpa established in 1969 is the worlds largest source of population and reproductive health programs and the principal unit within the united nations for global population issues in 2006 the organization provided services in some 154 developing and transition countries with funds totaling 6055 million drawn exclusively from voluntary contributions made by 180 nations and some foundations the united states with strong support from congress was an important actor in the launch of unfpa in 1969 during the midtolate 1960s congress began to express heightened concern over the impact of rapid population growth on development prospects in poor countries in 1967 congress earmarked funds for population assistance programs urging the united states to channel family planning resources through the united nations and other international organizations in its first 25 years unfpa moved from an organization focused on statistical collection and analysis to an agency providing maternal and child healthfamily planning assistance unfpa played large role in shaping the 1994 international conference on population and development icpd held in cairo the cairo conference marked turning point in the international debate over the impact of population issues on global development and established policy framework called the plan of action that continues to guide current family planning and reproductive health policies including the work of unfpa the plan integrated population concerns into the broad context of development concluding that education and health including reproductive health were prerequisites for sustainable development during the past two decades there has been continuing and contentious debate within the united states and especially within congress as to whether the united states should financially support unfpa the issue has centered on the extent to which if any unfpa aids chinas coercive family planning programs and policies in 15 of the past 24 years the united states has not contributed to the organization as result of executive branch determinations that unfpas program in china was in violation of the kempkasten amendment banning us aid to organizations involved in the management of coercive family planning programs on june 26 2008 the administration announced that unfpa was ineligible for fy2008 funding under the kempkasten amendment for fy2009 the bush administration requested that 25 million be made available for unfpa if it is determined eligible under the kempkasten amendment the appropriated funds would be drawn from the child survival and health programs account while unfpa receives voluntary contributions from many countries and some private foundations most of its income comes from handful of donors the netherlands and japan recently

began operations in 1969 as the fund for population activities is the worlds largest source of population and reproductive health programs and the principal unit within the united nations for global population issues in 2006 the year for which the most recent figures are available the organization provided services in some 154 developing and transition countries with funds totaling 565 million drawn exclusively from voluntary contributions made by 171 nations and some foundations during the past two and half decades there has been continuing and contentious debate within the united states and especially within congress as to whether the us should financially support the organization the issue has centered on the extent to which if any unfpa aids chinas coercive family planning programs and policies in 9 of the past 24 years the united states has been one of the leading contributors to unfpa for the other 15 years however the united states has not made voluntary contributions to the organization as result of executive branch determinations that unfpa supported coercive chinese practices or because of legislative prohibitions for the past seven years the bush administration has found unfpa ineligible for us funding and transferred proposed annual contributions to other foreign aid activities future us contributions to unfpa may be considered during the 110th congress as part of the debate on the annual foreign operations appropriation bill and other foreign policy legislation this report provides an overview of the population fund its current mission and operations and recent funding trends it further discusses the role of the united states in supporting unfpa programs the varying interpretations by several administrations of legislative authorities pertaining to unfpas eligibility for american resources and congressional debates over how much and under what conditions the united states should voluntarily contribute to unfpa operations finally it reviews the findings of several private and us government investigations of chinas family planning programs and the role unfpa plays in their implementation unfpa its origins and operations the united nations since its earliest days has maintained an interest in population issues in 1947 the united nations established population commission that collected and analyzed global population data and supported member government efforts to examine information about national populations following crs2 several years of debate over the rapid rise of the worlds population the general assembly approved resolution in 1966 calling on the united nations and other international organizations to extend technical assistance on population matters in 1967 the secretarygeneral created trust fund for population activities which in 1969 was renamed the fund for population activities unfpa initially unfpa was administered by the united nations development program undp the organizations primary international development organ within few years at the direction of the general assembly unfpa had expanded its operations beyond statistical collection and analysis to the provision of maternal and child healthfamily planning communication and education and population policy assistance by 1972 unfpa was operating in 78 countries with budget of over 30 million with such rapid growth in the funds scope and programs unfpa became separate entity under the direct authority of the general assembly with the same status as undp and the childrens fund unicef1 in these initial years the united states provided the majority of unfpa funding through voluntary contributions in 1968 and 1969 when seven governments extended financial support the 4 million transfer by the united states represented nearly 80 of total contributions by 1972 the number of donors had grown to 52 but the united states remained by far the largest source of funds with 46 of the total over the next decade the us share declined to about 25 as other nations increased their contributions see table 1 unfpa and world population conferences 1974 and 1984 unfpa played significant role in the world population conferences held decade apart in bucharest 1974 and mexico city 1984 following the 1974 meeting of 133 nations the general assembly called for the expansion of international population assistance with unfpa taking lead role to implement the plan of action endorsed at the bucharest conference partially due to the growing attention on world population issues unfpa operations expanded rapidly during this period the scope of unfpas work also broadened so that by the early 1980s the organization focused on eight primary areas family planning including delivery systems and fertility regulation techniques data collection formulation and evaluation of population policies and programs communications and education population dynamics including demographic projections and their analysis implementation of policies and programs including efforts beyond family planning related to law and population status of women and economic policies 1 unfpa what it is what it does 1983 and unfpa at 30 years fact sheets october 26 1999 hereafter cited as unfpa what it is what it does crs3 special programs focusing on women children the elderly the disabled and programs to promote social justice and multisector activities including support for population conferences and training2 the 1994 cairo conference and unfpas changing mandate unfpa was major catalyst in organizing financing and implementing outcomes of the 1994 international conference on population and development icpd held in cairo the cairo conference marked turning point in the international debate over the impact of population issues on global development and established policy framework that continues to guide current family planning and reproductive health policies the plan of action that emerged from the cairo conference to much greater extent than before integrated population concerns into the broad context of development concluding that education and health including reproductive health were prerequisites for sustainable development the conference shifted population program strategies away from demographic goals and toward human welfare and poverty reduction objectives the conference further focused far more attention on the status and empowerment of women moving beyond strictly health issues the conference endorsed programs to promote expanded opportunities for the education of women and girls to end gender discrimination and violence against women and to strengthen womens grassroots activist organizations3 since the cairo conference unfpa programs have and continue to be guided by the icpds program of action which contains the following goals universal access to reproductive health services by 2015 universal primary education and closing the gender gap in education by 2015 reducing maternal mortality by 75 by 2015 reducing infant mortality and increasing life expectancy in 1999 an additional goal reducing hiv infection rates in persons 1524 years of age by 25 in the mostaffected countries by 2005 and by 25 globally by 2010 was incorporated into the program of action and integrated into unfpas work4 2 unfpa what it is what it does 1983 3 see crs report 94533 population and

are focused in seven program areas that support the broad strategy of improving reproductive health preventing hivaids promoting safer sexual behavior among young people ensuring that condoms are available and widely and correctly used empowering women to protect themselves and their children and encouraging men to take responsibility for preventing the spread of hivaids making motherhood safer expanding the availability of emergency obstetric care for women who develop complications having skilled workers available and meeting unmet needs for contraceptive services supporting young people providing accurate information counseling and services to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases promoting gender equality promoting legal and policy reforms supporting gendersensitive data collection and backing programs that empower women economically assisting in emergencies providing supplies and services to protect reproductive health during disasters securing reproductive health supplies coordinating the delivery of supplies forecasting needs and building logistical capacity at the country level and preventing and treating fistula5 providing access to medical care increasing education and family planning services postponing pregnancy for young girls improving girls nutrition and repairing physical and emotional damage 5 obstetric fistula occurs from prolonged child labor particularly when labor lasts two days or more when woman or girl is unable to push her baby out the pressure from the babys head can interrupt blood flow to tissues in the pelvic area ultimately the woman passes the baby after it dies as the decomposed body is smaller than the live one this can cause incontinence nerve damage and chronic pain which can make walking

million annually in recent years in 2006 unfpa contributed approximately 37 million to projects in china us policy towards unfpa the united states was an important actor in the launch of unfpa in 1969 during the midtolate 1960s congress began to express heightened concern over the impact of rapid population growth on development prospects in poor countries noting that the worlds population was growing by about 2 annually compared with only 1 growth in food production in 1967 for the first time congress amended the foreign assistance act of 1961 to specifically authorize and earmark funds for population assistance programs urging the united states especially to channel family planning resources through the united nations and other international organizations some members believed that such earmarks were necessary because the state department and the us agency for international development usaid had not been giving the issue adequate attention7 these initial us contributions however were conditioned on the requirement that other donors match the american payment in an equal amount this incentive helped unfpa exceed its 1970 projected resource goal when 22 other countries contributed combined 77 million in 1971 with the same matching requirement tied to the us pledge of 15 million unfpa received donations of 145 million from 45 nations8 as shown in table 3 us contributions continued to climb throughout the 1970s and early 1980s peaking in 1984 at 382 million at the same time however the number and size of transfers from other donors rose faster so that the share of unfpa resources from the united states declined from 50 to around 27 the largest unfpa contribution earmarked by congress 46 million was enacted in the fy1985 foreign aid appropriation pl 98461 however only portion of these funds 36 million was transferred to the organization as us policy and its support for unfpa shifted 1984 review of us funding for unfpa in august 1984 government

department of state and crs percentage calculations since 1985 also at the 1984 mexico city conference the reagan administration announced it would establish requirements for unfpa to provide assurances that the 9 for discussion of the mexico city policy and its eligibility requirements see crs report rl30830 international family planning the mexico city policy by larry nowels crs9 organization was not engaged in or was not providing funds for abortion or coercive family planning programs concerns focused on unfpas activities related to chinas coercive family planning practices unfpa had launched its first program in china in 1980 focusing largely on increasing beijings capacity for data collection and improving maternal and child health and family planning services at the time the administration reportedly held up 19 million of 38 million allocated for unfpa for fy1984 until the organization could provide the necessary assurances these funds were released later in fy1984 following the mexico city conference attention returned to the fy1985 unfpa earmark of 46 million and how much the united states should transfer given the new white house policy aid which at the time maintained responsibility for managing unfpa contributions undertook review in early 1985 of unfpas program especially in china to determine whether the organization was involved in any way with involuntary abortions10 in march 1985 that review found that unfpa did not include involuntary abortion as part of its programs and therefore did not violate legislative restrictions or conditions announced at the mexico city conference on funding organizations engaged in involuntary practices11 as result unfpa remained eligible for us support but did not receive the full earmarked amount of 46 million on march 30 1985 aid contributed 36 million to unfpa withholding 10 million to express united states disapproval of coercion in the implementation of the china population control program12 the 10 million matched roughly the amount unfpa spent annually in china because aid wanted to reprogram the 10 million for other bilateral population assistance programs the administration needed to overcome the specific legislative earmark of 46 million in the fy1985 appropriation accordingly the white house requested authority as part of an fy1985 supplemental appropriation submission to shift 10 million from unfpa to other population aid groups the kempkasten amendment rather than approve administrations request for authority to transfer the 10 million from unfpa congress agreed to the kempkasten13 amendment as part of 10 more recently responsibility for unfpa voluntary contributions has shifted to the state department and the bureau of population refugees and migration 11 action memorandum for the administratoracting director of idca 1985 funding for the united nations fund for population activities unfpa september 25 1985 p 1 12 ibid 13 initially the amendment was referred to as the kempinouye provision so named after its original sponsors representative jack kemp ranking member of the house foreign assistance appropriations subcommittee and senator daniel inouye ranking member of the senate foreign assistance appropriations subcommittee senator inouye later opposed the administrations decision not to fund unfpa as well as the fact that the decision was delegated from the president to the secretary of state to the administrator for usaid for the next several years senator bob kasten chairmanranking minority member of the foreign assistance subcommittee was strong supporter of the amendment and the continued crs10 the fy1985 supplemental appropriations bill hr 2577 the amendment states that us funds would not be made available to any organization or program which as determined by the president supports or participates in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization14 the house appropriations committee did not provide details on what was meant by the phrase support or participate in the management of program however in the additional views section of the committee report representative jack kemp stated that management of coercive programs may include providing resources to collect and analyze data necessary to the enforcement of such program training of the individuals who plan manage and carry out such program education and publicity about the programs assistance to the official bodies of government that are charged with developing and implementing such program and other such assistance15 congressman kemp also stated that the amendment would most likely affect us funding of the unfpa because of its involvement with the program of coercive abortion in the peoples republic of china16 the kempkasten amendment was enacted on august 15 1985 as part of the fy1985 supplemental appropriations act pl 9988 implementation and court challenges despite the directive from the amendment that the president or alternatively the secretary of state issue any determination regarding the kempkasten amendment president reagan delegated his authority to the secretary of state on september 19 198517 who in turn authorized the redelegation of this authority to the director of the international development cooperation agency idca18 on september 25 1985 idca administrator peter mcpherson announced the administrations determination that unfpa because of its activities in china was participating in the management of program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization in letters to congressional leaders administrator mcpherson cited representative kemps interpretation as set out in his additional views in hrept 99142 of what characterized the participation of an organization in coercive abortion program 13 continued provision came to be referred to as kempkasten 14 samdt 338 to hr 2577 99th congress june 20 1985 enacted as pl 9988 15 us house committee on appropriations supplemental appropriations 1985 hrept 99142 may 22 1985 p 86 16 ibid 17 usaid memorandum drafted at the time noted that the administration did not view congressional expectations that the president or if delegated the secretary of state should make the determination for unfpa funding as legally binding however it was considered significant by the executive branch 18 idca had been established by congress as government entity to oversee and coordinate the activities of all us foreign aid agencies and the idca director served simultaneously as the usaid administrator crs11 the administrator concluded that chinas onechild percouple policy has resulted in coerced abortion and involuntary sterilization19 the administrator further announced that since the kempkasten amendment and his determination under it now superceded the 46 million unfpa earmark for fy1985 usaid would reprogram 10 million for voluntary family planning programs for use elsewhere in the world he also stated that if kempinouye was enacted again in fy1986 see footnote 13 unfpa could receive funds under only three conditions 1 unfpa withdraws its program from china 2 china would begin to punish abuses concerning coercive abortion and involuntary sterilizations or 3 unfpa radically changes its program in china such as by supplying only contraceptive materials20 almost immediately the population institute an ngo filed suit against administrator mcpherson and the us government to block the redirection of unfpa funds and invalidate the determination on august 12 1986 the court upheld the administrations decision to withhold unfpa funding from 1986 to 1992 usaid continued to request funds for unfpa although with the understanding that decision on whether to transfer the money would be reviewed under the terms of the kempkasten amendment which congress also continued to enact each year in the foreign assistance appropriations in each year usaid found that unfpa was ineligible for us support reinterpretation of kempkasten by the clinton administration as one of his first acts as chief executive president clinton reversed the mexico city policy of presidents reagan and bush and issued determination finding that unfpa programs in china did not violate the terms of kempkasten the policy reversal was based on several factors including ambiguity of the kempkasten language the administration noted that the court of appeals in considering the case brought by the population institute deferred to the usaid interpretation of kempkasten because it was reasonable reading of an ambiguous provision and did not otherwise conflict with the expressed intention of congress the administration argued that because of this ambiguity the new administration had right to interpret kemp kasten for itself overreliance on the 1985 statements by representative kemp the administration pointed especially to the 1985 court of appeals opinion that questioned the relevance of the additional views of representative kemp interpreting the kempinouye amendment the court observed that although the administration considered representative kemps remarks as the clearest 19 letter from idca acting director peter mcpherson to senator hatfield chairman of the senate appropriations committee september 25 1985 p 2 20 ibid p 2 crs12 explanation of an ambiguous term congressman kemp could not convince his colleagues to adopt his views in the committee report itself focus should be on the terms coercive and involuntary and the intent of the organization in question the clinton administration believed that it was reasonable to apply the kemp kasten restrictions only in cases where the organization knowingly and intentionally provided direct support for or helped manage people or agencies who were clearly engaged in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization the administration concluded that although it remained concerned about coercive practices in china it believed that unfpa did not knowingly or intentionally support directly such practices21 the issue of coercive practices within chinas family planning program and the role of unfpa remained controversial throughout the clinton administration and during the first year of the george w bush presidency congress continued to include kempkasten language in foreign operations appropriations acts and in most years attached additional conditions on unfpa contributions that required the organization to 1 keep us funds in separate account 2 not spend us money in china and 3 to forego transfers from the united states equal to the amount unfpa allocated for its china program in some years the united states withheld about 35 million from unfpa an amount that approximated the size of unfpas expenditures in china for brief period in 1997 the controversy over whether to fund unfpa subsided when unfpas program in china expired and new activities did not resume immediately nevertheless despite opposition from the united states unfpa reestablished program in china and in fy1999 appropriation legislation congress prohibited all us contributions to the organization congress restored funding the following year but with the requirement that an amount equal to unfpa expenditures in china be withheld this resulted in 35 million deduction in fy2000 and fy2001 for details on administration actions and legislative restrictions regarding unfpa funding 19852009 see appendix george w bush administration reviews kempkasten the first budget submitted by president bush for fy2002 included proposed 25 million us contribution to unfpa while the new administration reinstated the socalled mexico city policy restrictions that applied to bilateral family planning funds there was indication of change in policy regarding unfpa and the kempkasten conditions attached to us contributions subsequently in the fy2002 foreign operations appropriations congress provided not more than 34 million for unfpa although such language represented ceiling for the amount of funds for unfpa as opposed to floor or minimum amount that must be 21 these policy views are drawn from letters of usaid administrator brian atwood to senator helms dated august 6 and september 10 1993 crs13 provided the language was similar to prior year foreign operations bills that had been fulfilled by the clinton administration minus the withholding requirement however in the face of the conflicting evidence released in late 2001 by the guy and biegman investigation teams see section unfpa and china for further details on the groups findings in midjanuary 2002 the white house placed hold on us contributions to unfpa pending review of the organizations program in china in statement before the senate foreign relations committee on february 27 2002 assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration arthur dewey noted that the legislative text regarding unfpa funding not more than 34 million gave the administration considerable discretion over exactly how much to provide unfpa while stating that the united states supported unfpas work worldwide to provide safe and voluntary family planning enhance maternal and infant health and prevent the spread of hivaids the administration remained concerned about periodic reports of abuse and coercion in chinas family planning program given new information and the requirements of the kempkasten amendment assistant secretary dewey argued that the state department was obligated to investigate the matter further before releasing any funds in fy200222 state department assessment and findings the state department sent an investigation team to china for twoweek review of unfpa programs on may 13 2002 the team was led by former ambassador william brown and included bonnie glick former state department official and dr theodore tong public health professor at the university of arizona the state departments assessment team filed its report with secretary powell on may 29 making series of findings and recommendations23 the group found that there was evidence that unfpa has knowingly supported or participated in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china despite some relaxation of government restrictions in counties where unfpa operates china maintained coercive elements in its population programs in law and practice and chinese leaders viewed population control as high priority and remained concerned over implications for socioeconomic change on the basis of these findings ambassador brown and his colleagues recommended that the united states should release not more than 34 million of previously appropriated funds to unfpa 22 senate committee on foreign relations us funding for the population fund the effect on womens lives committee hearings february 2002 23 report of the china population fund unfpa independent assessment team released by the department of state on may 29 2002 see httpwwwstategovgprmrls rpt200212122htm for the reports full text crs14 until china ends all forms of coercion in law and practice us government funds should be allocated to population programs in china and appropriate resources possibly from the united states should be allocated to monitor and evaluate chinese population control programs unfpa found in violation of kempkasten subsequent to the findings and recommendations of the brown investigation on july 22 2002 secretary of state powell to whom the president had delegated the decision announced that unfpa remained in violation of kempkasten and ineligible for us funding the state departments analysis of the secretarys determination found that even though unfpa did not knowingly support or participate in coercive practice that alone would not preclude the application of kempkasten instead finding that the recipient of us funds in this case unfpa simply supports or participates in such program whether knowingly or unknowingly would trigger the restriction the assessment team found that the chinese government imposes fines and penalties on families social compensation fees that have children exceeding the number approved by the government the department further noted that unfpa had funded computers and dataprocessing equipment that had helped strengthen the management of the chinese state family planning commission beyond the legitimate uses of these and other items financed by unfpa such equipment facilitated in the view of the state department chinas ability to impose social compensation fees or perform abortions by coercion the state department analysis concluded that unfpas involvement in chinas family planning program allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion24 subsequent administration reviews and legislative action fy2009 administration request the administration

that has been debated among many members of congress and past and current administrations involves whether and to what extent unfpa programs in china violate the kempkasten amendment as previously mentioned initial unfpa programs in china concentrated on bolstering chinas capacity for data collection and analysis and maternal and child healthfamily planning activities following the cairo population conference in 1994 and the conclusion of unfpas third chinese program unfpa and beijing officials began to discuss significant changes for fourth agreement that would more closely follow the principles set out in cairo the subsequent unfpa program launched in 1998 concentrated efforts in 32 counties where birth targets and quotas had been eliminated by the chinese government the fourth program shifted from more administrative family planning approach focusing on population control and imposed contraceptive methods and orders to an integrated clientoriented reproductive health approach in the project counties that included education and counseling regarding informed choice of contraceptive methods and reproductive health rights according to unfpa service delivery points were upgraded to offer integrated reproductive health services in both the chinese state family planning commission and the ministry of health unfpa said that there had been downward trend in the abortion ratio in these counties and that the organization had played catalytic role in introducing comprehensive voluntary reproductive health approach that included rigorous monitoring of the projects30 the fifth program covering the period 20032005 expanded many of the earlier initiatives in june 2005 unfpa approved sixth program for china that began in 2006 and is to span five years the 27 million program is to build on the policy changes made in 1998 and includes two components the reproductive health element seeks to increase the utilization of highquality clientcentered gendersensitive reproductive health and family planning services and to reduce the vulnerability and risk behavior associated with hivaids among migrants young people and other vulnerable groups the population and development component centers on strengthening the governments capacity for addressing populationrelated policies especially those regarding gender migration and aging issues and enhancing the governments ability to collect and apply surveillance data particularly data related to hivaids31 30 unfpa country programme outline for china dpfpacpochn5 july 12 2002 unfpa report of the international review team on the unfpa china country programme october 2001 31 unfpa country programme document for china dpfpacpdchn6 october 10 2005 crs18 investigations of unfpa programs in china during implementation of the fourth and fifth programs unfpas operations in china have been closely scrutinized by several investigatory teams including one dispatched by the state department in 2002 most of these groups concluded that unfpa was not involved in supporting coercive or involuntary family planning programs in china although one sponsored by the population research institute pri concluded otherwise these conflicting reports together with continuing reviews of unfpa practices in china and varying interpretations by us officials sparked renewed controversy and extensive congressional debate beginning in 2001 over the appropriate role of the united states in financially supporting unfpa operations worldwide the four nonus government sponsored investigations came to the following conclusions the population research institute pris report concluded that unfpa directly supports coercive family planning with funding and through its complicity with the implementation of policies which are fundamentally coercive in principle and practice the pri team led by josephine guy spent four days in sihui county guangdong province in late september 2001 conducting numerous interviews with alleged victims and witnesses of coercive practices according to the teams interview notes and videos nonvoluntary abortions and use of iuds mandatory examinations and punishment for noncompliance both imprisonment and economic fines continued in this county which was among the 32 in which unfpa supported programs32 the biegman group this team found that unfpa plays positive and important catalytic role in the reform of reproductive health and family planning services in china and in moving china away from coercive family planning practices and abuses it recommended that unfpa continue its program in china and expand its scope and resources in the future33 this unfpasponsored review team led by ambassador nicolaas biegman former dutch ambassador to the and including diplomats from honduras the czech republic and botswana conducted sixday investigation in october 2001 interviewing officials and visiting sites in beijing and in sihui and qianjiang counties british allparty parliamentary group on population development and reproductive health the british parliamentary team found that although problems remain in some parts of china regarding reproductive rights

and offering women choice over their own lives34 the interfaith delegation to china this group returned from september 2003 visit finding among other things that the chinese government was taking steps to end coercive family planning practices that unfpa was major force in chinas transition to voluntary policies and that unfpa did not support or participate in managing chinas family planning program while the group acknowledged that in such brief trip it could not gain comprehensive view of chinas family planning activities or the work of unfpa it felt confident in recommending that the united states should maintain policy of constructive engagement with china regarding family planning matters and that us funding for unfpa should be restored and the kempkasten amendment revised the ninemember mission was sponsored by catholics for free choice35 kempkasten application beyond unfpa critics of the administration policy including some members of congress have expressed concern over what they perceive to be shift in the interpretation of kempkasten restrictions related to unfpa and other international organizations they point to usaid notification to the global health council that the agency would not provide funding for the councils 31st annual meeting in june 2004 because unfpa would be participant some believe that this represented state department warning to unicef the world health organization and other organizations that continued involvement in joint programs with unfpa might jeopardize their funding support from the united states36 in 2003 the state department decided that it would fund 1 million hivaids program supporting african and asian refugees only if the implementing ngo group reproductive health for refugees consortium did not include marie stopes international among its members marie stopes international is britishbased reproductive health organization that is also major implementing partner of unfpa in china the state department while not making legal determination under the kempkasten amendment felt that an action not to fund marie stopes international would be the approach most consistent with us 34 china mission report by uk mps 1st
