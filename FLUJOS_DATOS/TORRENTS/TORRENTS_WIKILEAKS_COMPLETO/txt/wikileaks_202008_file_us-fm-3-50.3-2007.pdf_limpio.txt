to be searched routes d use brush ridges ditches and rocks to keep from forming paths to holeuphide site be wary of natural hazards such as flash floods in ravines and canyons f conceal with minimal to preparation g ensure overhead concealment h attempt to return the area to its original stat before you start your movement 4 movement moving object is easy to spot if travel is necessary 1 mask with natural cover 2 stay off ridgelines use the military crest 23 of the way up of hill 3 restrict to periods of low light bad weather wind or reduced enemy activity 4 avoid silhouetting 5 at irregular intervals stop at point of concealment b look listen and smell for signs of human or animal activity watch for trip wires or booby traps and void leaving evidence of travel peripher vision is more effective for recognizing movement at night and twilight 20 march 2007 fm 3503nttp 3503afttpi 3226 i3 b camouflage evidence of trav route selection requires detailed planning and special tec hniques irregular routezigzag c concealing evidence of travel 1 do not break branches leaves or grass use walking stick to part vegetation and push it back to its original po sition 2 do not grab small trees or brus h this may scuff the bark or create movement that is easily spotted in snow country this creates path of snowless vegetation 3 pick firm footing try not to overturn ground cover rocks and sticks b scuff bark on logs and sticks c make noise by breaking sticks cloth wrapped around feet helps muffle noise d mangle grass and bushes that normally spring back 4 mask unavoidable tracks in soft footing place tracks in the shadows of vegetation downed logs and snowdrifts b move before and during pr ecipitation allows tracks to fill in c travel during windy periods d take advantage of solid surfaces leaving less evidence of travel tie cloth or vegetation to feet or brush pat out tracks lightly to speed their break down or make them look old 5 secure trash and loose equipment hide or bury discarded items 6 if pursued by dogs concent rate on defeating the handler travel downwind of doghandler if possible b travel over rough terrain andor through dense vegetation to slow the handler c travel downstream through fast moving water d zigzag route if possible consider loopbacks and j hooks d penetrate obstacles as follows 1 enter deep ditches feet first to avoid injury fm 3503nttp 3503afttpi 3226 20 march 2007 i4 2 go around chainlink and wire fences go under fence if unavoidable crossing at damaged ar eas do not touch fence look for electrical insulato rs or security devices 3 penetrate rail fences passing under or between lower rails if this is impractical go over the top presenting as low silhouette as possible 4 cross roads after observa tion from concealment to determine enemy activity cross at points offering concealment such as bushes shadows or bend in road cross in manner leaving footprints parallel to the road do this by stepping sideways 5 use same method of observation for railroad tracks as used for roads then lower your body to the ground aligni ng parallel to the tracks with face down cross the tracks using semipushup motion moving sideways warning if there are three rails one may be electrified urban considerations 1 look for and move to friendly controlled location or stronghold point 2 avoid movement into markettype areas and crowds 3 avoid high rise buildings 4 head to concealment to break visual contact 5 if seen change direction radically 6 use caution when passing windows and doors try to avoid 7 use cloth

dictated by the threat 2 certain of your location and your destination and you are able to get there 3 able to reach water food shelter andor help 4 convinced rescue is not coming b if you decide to move 1 follow your epa 2 determine which direction to travel and why 3 decide what equipment to take cache or destroy 4 it is usually better to move at night because of the concealment darkness offers except ions to such movement would be when moving through hazardous terrain or dense vegetation eg jungle or mountai nous terrain stop movement with sufficient time to find concealment and shelter prior to sunrise c avoid compromising information when using map in combat environment 1 do not write on the map 2 do not soil the map by touc hing the destination 3 do not fold in manner providing travel information d considerations for noncombat 1 stay in place eg with vehicle 2 if you do not stay in place leave information at your starting point that includes destination and route of travel b

if there is compass orient map using cardinal direction obtained by the stick and shadow method or the celestial aids stars method d determine specific location be prepared to give coordinates and datum to rescue forces if asked 1 using gps and map more sky better accuracy and quicker position acquisition b more frequent position fixes shorter time to acquire next position c watch for jamming and interference gps satellite signals are very susceptible to jamming and interference indications include continuous onedir ectional marching receiver shows continuous marchi ng of latitude or longitude for example the value continuously incr eases or decreases in single direction obviously incorr ect position data you know your rough position but ur gps receiver shows location that is 20 march 2007 fm 3503nttp 3503afttpi 3226 ii5 significantly and obviously incorrect for example you know you are in iraq but your receiver show s 0 degrees latitude and 5 degrees longitude jumping position data receiver position jumps between significantly different positions for example more than tenth of degree at time unexpected loss of position lock receiver has good view of the sky and good power supply and is op erating normally but cannot maintain position lock or is unexpectedly knocked off position lock d protect against jamming and interference determine relative location of jamming and block jamming by using bodystructure shielding from ja mming signal placing gps receiver in hole 16x12 or buildi ng wall 18x14 between gps receiver and jammer conserve gps battery life 2 triangulation resection with compass figure ii6 try to use three or more azimuths between 30 and 130 degrees apart b positively identify major land feature and determine line of position lop c check

and 90degree offset 3 straightline heading maintain heading until reaching destination b track number of paces tr aveled to monitor progress one pace is the distance covered each time the same foot touches the ground distances measured by paces are approximate for example in open terrain 65 pa ces per 100 meters average in rough terrain or night 90 to 100 paces per 100 meters keep track of your pace count pebbles in pocket or knots in string per 100 meters c use pace count with terrain evaluation and heading to determine location individual pace varies because of factors such as steep terrain daynight travel or injureduninjured condition adjust estimation of distance traveled against these factors to get relative accu racy when using pace count 4 deliberate offset use when finding point on linear feature that is road or river b intentionally navigate to left or right of target so you know which way to turn at the linear feature 5 pointtopoint same as straight line pick out
