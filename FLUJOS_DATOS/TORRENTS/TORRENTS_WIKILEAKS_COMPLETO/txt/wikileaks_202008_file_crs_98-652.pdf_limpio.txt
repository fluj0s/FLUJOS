of defense dod program designed to help military reservists protect themselves from financial loss during an involuntary order to federal active duty though intended to be selffinancing pr ogram the rrmiip became insolvent soon after its debut in 1996 due to low enrollme nt and severe adverse selection the program was terminated by congress onl year later and congress eventually appropriated total of 119 million to pay off insurance claims associated with the rrmiip the failure of the rrmiip diminished interest in mobilization insurance both in congress and dod but there has been continuing pressure by some reservists and various reservist intere st groups to implement new program this report examines the creation and failure of the rrmiip and analyzes some possible options

report on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 1the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program background the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program rrmiip was instituted in response to growing concer ns about the reporte d financial losses incurred by some reservists1 who were activated for the persian gulf war operation desert stormshield 19901991 although th soldiers and sailors civil relief act sscra2 has long given reservists some protection against financial loss due to mobilization one survey sponsored by the department of defense dod indicated that as many as twothirds of the re servists activated during operation desert shieldstorm suffered economic loss as result of their deployment3 these losses occurred due to differences between the reservists military and civilian pay expenses incurred by reservists because of mobilization and the decline in business experienced by selfemployed reservists during and after release from active duty another dodsponsored survey indicated that the potential for income loss during an activation was major concern for bot h officers and enlisted personnel in the reserves4 given dods increasing reliance on the reserve components dod was especially concerned that this potential for financial loss would have negative impact on recruiting and retention in the re serves thereby undermining the readiness of the reserve component and its ab ility to carry out future missions in 1996 congress directed dod to blish an optional income insurance program for reservists who were involuntar ily ordered to active duty for more thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs2 5p l 104106 section 512 february 10 1996 na tional defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 110 stat 299305 6the notification and enrollment process was decentralized occurring at the unit level thus the actual date on which individual reserv ists received notification starting the 60day clock varied from unit to unit 7the term covered service means active duty performed by member of reserve component under an order to active duty for more than 30 days which specifies that the members service is in support of an operation mission for which members of the reserve components have been ordered to ac tive duty without their consent or b is in support of forces activated during period of war declared by congress or period of national emergency declared by the pr esident or congress 10 usc 12521 2 8these statistics refer only to members of the selected reserve subelement of the ready reserve which contains those units and indi viduals most essential to wartime missions selected reservists generally perform one weekend of training each month for which they receive monthly paycheck and two weeks of tr aining each year for which they receive separate paycheck another subelement of the ready reserve is the individual ready reserve which contains manpower pool of pretrained individuals who have already served in the active component or the selected reserve but who are not required to train regularly like the selected reserve members of the selected reserve about 900000 individuals were the primary target of the rrmiip although members of the individual ready reserve about 500000 individuals were also eligible to enroll 30 days5 dod implemented the program on october 1 1996 under the name ready reserve mobilization income insurance program after being notified of the program6 current reservists were given 60 day window in which to enroll in the program if they so desired upon join ing the reserves new reservists were automatically enrolled for 1000 worth of income insurance but were given the option to alter or eliminate the coverage within 60 days program participants were required to pay 1220 per month for each 1000 of coverage up to maximum of 6100 per month for 5000 of coverage af ter 30 days of covered service7 the insured reservists were titled to receive monthly be nefit payment equivalent to the amount of coverage purchased for up to twelve months out of any eighteen month period the program was meant to be selffinancing w ith benefits to be completely financed by the premiums paid into the system by enrolled reservists the rrmiip ran into difficulties almost from the moment it started first reservists signed up for the program at much lower rate than anticipated on the basis of survey research dod anticipated that about 40 percent of reservists8 or approximately 360000 individuals would enro ll in the program in actuality only about 3 percent of reservists roughly 26000 individuals chose to enroll this dramatically reduced the amount of money which was paid into the system second the rrmiip suffered from severe adverse selection adverse selection occurs when those most likely to suffer loss are covere d in greater proportion than others this can create situation where the actual losses incurred by the insurer are much greater than the losses originally anticipated as insurance premiums are based on anticipated losses the accumulated premiums in the insurance f und prove insufficient to pay for losses

hearing on 8 may 1997 concerning the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program rrmiip may 8 1997 12a certain amount of adverse selecti on was inevitable due to commonly known information about the recent patterns of re serve mobilization re servists in certain military specialties which have been in high demand in postcold war us military operations such as military police or civil affairs or in units with high readiness ratings could reasonably conc lude based on recent mobiliza tion patterns that their risk of mobilization was relatively high nd therefore opt to purchase mobilization insurance reservists in military specialties or units less likely to be activated based on recent experience such as infantry or armor or in units with low readiness ratings could similarly conclude that their risk of mobilization was minimal and opt not to purchase mobilization insurance dod recognized this risk of adverse selection and attemp ted to adjust the mobilization insurance premium accordingly9 however different and more severe form of adverse selection occurred due to the unfortunate timing of the programs debut the rrmiip was initiated at the same time the clinton administration decided to extend the us presence in bosnia beyond december of 1996 as result the enrollment period for the rrmiip occurred at the same time many reservists were being mobilized for the third rotation10 of operation joint endeavor the bosnian peacekeeping mission thus many of those who signed up for the rrm iip were people who suspected or knew that they were about to be deployed in striking contrast to the 3 percent of the general reserve population who signed up for mobilization insurance some 85 percent of those activated for the third bosnia rotation enrolled in the program in most instances these reservists opted for the maximum bene fit coverage of 5000 per month11 as result the insurance prog ram had to respond to large benefit claims almost immediately however due to the low enrollment rate and the short time it had been in operation the progra m had not received sufficient premium payments to cover those claims this problem was not unforeseen th

believed that callup during the startup period for the mobilization insurance program while risk was considered manageable in view of the premium income projected from overall enrollment13 the premium income which dod projected however failed to materialize due tothe low level of overall enrollment in the program by december of 1996 1568033 was needed to cover insurance claims from about 500

would only be able to pay eligible reserv ists 4 percent of their mont hly benefit payment although they promised that full payment would even tually be made the funds deficit passed 40 million in may 1997 and tinued to grow rapidly15 in june 1997 congress approved an emergency supplemental ppropriation of 72 million to cover the programs liab ility in the 1997 emergency supplemental appropriations act16 soon thereafter in the fy 1998 national defens authorization act congress terminated the program17 in terminating the program congress agreed to provide benefits to any enrolled reservist who on

nefits under the program have not been paid to the member18 however the enrollments of all other reservists in the insurance program were terminated as of that date thus reservists who received orders calling them to active duty after n ovember 18 1997 were not eligible for any benefits additionally provision was ma to refund the premiums of thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs5 19there was some disagreement about whether or not to refund premiums dod reportedly favored policy of refunding premiums due to the quick collapse of the fund the senate agreed and in its version of the defense au thorization act for fi scal year 1998 s 924 required the secretary of defense to refund premiums paid by reservists who had not received benefits under the program the house version contained such provision reflecting the view that mobilization insuran ce was similar to fire or auto insurance premiums are not refunded simply because the insured never files claim the house view prevailed in

in the 1998 supplemental appropriations and recissions act20 in order to pay everyone still owed benefits and to close the books on the program current issues in terminating the rrmiip congress left the door open for dod to study and propose options for new mobilization in surance program however informal contacts with dod personnel and congressional committee staffers indicate that there is little inclination within dod or congress to push for new mobilization insurance program at the current time the failure of the rrmiip and the intense criticism which accompanied that failure is still fresh in the minds of many key policymakers nonetheless there is continuing pressure by some reservists and interest groups which represent some reservists to implement new mobilization insurance program still the experience of the rrm iip raises some serious questions about the mobilization insurance concept which are discussed below is there real need for mobilization insurance an issue when considering any new propos for mobilization insurance is the level of demand for such program among reservists the willingness of reservists to participate in such program is vital to its success however as the rrmiip demonstrated accurately ssessing the demand for mob ilization insurance may not be an easy task according to former assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs deborah lee years of study showed that the potential income loss resulting from involuntary activation was the number one concern for reserve personnel21 moreover an analysis conducted by the rand corporation under contract to dod indicated that most reservists were w illing to purchase mob ilization insurance in order to protect themselves from income loss according to lee rand reported that over 67 percent of enlisted pers onnel and 55 percent of officers said theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs6 22us congress house of representatives committee on national security subcommittee on military personnel prepared st atement of assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs deborah r lee status report on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 1 23the disparity between rands estimate and dods estimate is perplexing considering that both estimates were apparently derived from the same information 24us congress house of representatives committee on national security subcommittee on military personnel statement of mark gebicke director military operations and capabilities issues national security and international affairs division general accounting office observations on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 6would buy mobilization insurance if the monthly cost were 100 per 100 of coverage22 yet the actual experience of the rrmiip contradicted the survey research the enrollment rate of 3 percent came nowhere near the 67 and 55 percent mentioned by assistant secretary lee nor did it come anywhere near the more conservative 40 percent enrollment rate anticipated by dod23 one explanation of this huge discrepancy is that the survey research drastically overstated the demand for mobilization insurance among reservists those questioned about mobilization insurance may have supported it in principle but when actually required to pay for the insurance many reservists may have concluded that their risk of mobilization was minimal and therefore declined to participate such decision may have been quite rational in light of recent mob ilization patterns alternatively the survey data which was collected in 19911992 may have been obsolete by the time the program was implemented in 1996 the passage of time may have diminished the recollection of financial loss among those reservists who rved during the gulf war and the natural turnover of personnel betw een 1991 and 1996 brought s ubstantial number of new reservists into the reserve component s who had experience whatsoever with mobilization and the financ ial troubles it could cause another possible explanation is that the program was poorly marketed rand telephone surveys conducted af ter the start up of the program found that 27 percent of reservists stated they were never info rmed of the program another 16 percent stated that they were informed but did not have sufficient information or time to make decision about enrolling24 however these survey responses also confirm that demand for mobilization insurance was much lower than anticipated for among the 57 percent of reserv ists who apparently were aware of the program and had sufficient information and time to make decision only small percentage chose to enroll recruiting and retention rates in the re serve components also seem to indicate that the problem of income loss is not as great concern as previously anticipated presumably if the risk of income loss associated with mobilization was serious problem for reservists recru iting and retention rates woul d suffer yet according to dod recruiting and retention rates for the reserve components ve remained stablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs7 25department of defense office of the secretary of defense for reserve affairs questions and answers for hnsc manpower personne l sc hearing on 8 may 1997 concerning the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program rrmiip may 8 1997 14 26us congress house of representatives committee on national security subcommittee on military personnel oral stat ement of assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs deborah r lee status report on the ready reserve mobilization income insurance program may 8 1997 3since the persian gulf war25 assistant secretary of defense lee conceded that the widespread recruiting and retention problems which were widely predicted from increased use of the guard and re serve have simply not occurred26 in light of this experience an argument can be made that there is not sufficient demand among reservists for mobilization insurance to warrant the creation of new program thus one policy option is to do nothing this option would be logical response to low interest among reservis ts for mobilization insurance and would eliminate the possibility of taxpayer dollars being used for another insurance fund bailout on the other hand maintaining current po licy means that number of reservists will experience financial problems during an future reserve mobilization for even if there is little demand for mobilization insurance among reservists in general there may be great demand for it by speci fic individuals nd among specific categories of reservists for example those reservists who hold exceptionally high paying jobs in their civilian life doctors lawyers pilots business owners would likely experience dramatic reduction in in come during mobilization although constituting small percentage of the total number of reservists their financial losses would nonetheless be real nd owing to the critical skills these reservists often possess of concern to military and civilian leaders if demand for mobilization insurance is primarily concentrated among certain types of reservists then smaller more focused program might be considered rather than broad all inclusive program such narrowly tailored program could however be criticized for protecting wealthier reservists while doing little to help middle and low income reservists wealthier reservists critics might point out may suffer substantial losses durin g mobilization but they of ten have greater financial resources with which to cushion their losses lower income reservists may suffer smaller losses than their wea lthier counterparts but they often have lower levels of saving or other resources with which to protect themselves another factor when assessing the need for mobilization insurance is the future utilization of the reserve components w ith the drawdown of active duty forces the military is increasingly relying on the reserves to augment the active force not only for major combat operations like desert storm but for smaller peacekeeping and nationbuilding operations like bosnia and haiti thus the past experience with the rrmiip may not be good guide to the current and future needs of reserve personnel to the extent that reservists come to view mobilizations as routine occurrence rather than rarity their interest in mobilization insurance might increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs8 can the problems experienced by the rrmiip be avoided in new program the principal problems experienced by the rrmiip were low enrollment and adverse selection perhaps most importantly the problem of adverse selection was severely exacerbated by the coincidence of some bosnia mobiliza tion orders with the beginning of the mobilization insurance program these problems could certainly be hedged against or even eliminated by various policy options several of these policy options are discussed below add waiting period or exclude an ongoing event an insurance program similar to the rrmiip could be set up with provi sion that coverage would not become effective for period of time say six or nine months after enrollment or with provision that precludes coverage for any military operation in progress at the time of enrollment this would eliminate the severe adverse selection which occurred under the rrmiip when reservis ts with knowledge of their imminent mobilization were offered mobilization insura nce however this would not solve the more general problem of adverse selection reserv ists have some valuable knowledge of their relative risk of bein g deployed and would certainly use this knowledge in deciding whether to purchase income insurance or not nonetheless this type of adverse selec tion would be less severe than that encountered by the original rrmiip and might be compensate d for by somewhat higher insurance premiums adding waiting period or excluding an ongoing event would do nothing to reduce the problem of low enrollment experienced by the rrmiip restricting eligibility for benefits in these ways could even decrease interest in the program b make mobilization insurance mandatory perhaps the most direct way to address the issues of adverse selection and low enrollment in administrative terms would be to make the mobilization insurance mandatory by enrolling all reservists automatically the two problems that plagued the rrmiip would be greatly mitigated additionally mandatory enrollment would substantially lower the cost of coverage currently simila r policy is in place with respect to life insurance for reservists known as servicemembers group li fe insurance or sgli all reservists are automatically enrolled in sgli for 200000 worth of coverage they can opt for less coverage or c overage at all but the default coverage if the service member does nothing is 200000 mandatory enrollment would also stre ngthen the insurance funds ability to respond to the problem encountered by the rrmiip where the rrmiips liabilities were greater than its accumulated assets producing insolvency by providing the fund with guaranteed income stream mandatory enrollment would facilitate borrowing from the treasury to maintain solvency any such loan could then be paid back over time out of the stream of income flowing into the fund the biggest stumbling block to this pproach would likely be the reaction of reservists to mandatory enrollment in program that would cost them money each month many reservists would probably judge their possibility of being mobilized to be so remote as to make this coverage waste of their money of course an opt out provision similar to that available for sgli coverage could mitigate such ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs9 271000 per month for 1000 of coverage is slightly lower than the 1220 per month charged by the rrmiip mandatory coverage would produce lower premiums because every reservist would have to pay premiu ms even those with almost chance of mobilization 28assumes the fund invests in private markets and those investments earn ten percent compound interest rate 29assumes that as with the rrmiip benefits are paid for the first month of servicenegative reaction but if substantial num ber of reservists chose to optout the problems of adverse selection and low enrollment might reappear another point to consider would be the size of the liability which could be incurred under mandatory enrollment policy if every member of the selected reserve were enrolled in the mobilization insurance program and the united states became involved in major conflict necess itating the mobilization of several hundred thousand reservists the monthly cost of pr oviding insurance benefits would be very substantial for example assume that every selected re servist bout 900000 individuals was enrolled for 1000 worth of mobilization insurance coverage and paid 1000 per month27 in premiums this would generate 9 million in income for the fund every month in fi ve years the fund would accumulate little more than 702 million28 yet mobilization of 250000 rese rvists would create liability of 250 million per month thus if the fund had been in existence for five years at the time of the mobilization it would be in solvent by the fourth month of the mobilization29 of course if the fund were in existen ce for longer period of time before major mobilization occurred it might have sufficient assets to pay off the claims even if it did not have sufficient assets the fixed stream of income provided by mandatory enrollment might make it easie r for the fund to borrow money from the treasury to cover these losses alternatively congress might be willing to appropriate money to c over the shortage as part of th cost of the war however it is important to note the potential for extraordinary demand on the fund under this policy option mandatory mobilization insu rance coupled with major reserve mobilization could produce an unfunded liability much larger than that encountered by the rrmiip c make the insurance program loss based rather than value based the rrmiip was value based policy as participants purchased insurance with set value say 1000 per month whether they actually experienced income loss or not they received benefits equal to that amount each month under loss based policy also known as an indemnity policy reservists would onl be eligible for benefits to the extent that they could demonstrate financial loss caused by their mobilization such policy would eliminat the incentive to purchase mobilization insurance when financial loss was anticip ated as result of mobilization while this policy would not eliminate adverse selecti on it could help reduce it to more manageable level as many of those who anticipate being mobilized might nonetheless decline coveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs10 significant downside of this policy op tion is that it would entail burdensome administrative requirements for verifying th amount of loss especially among those who are selfemployed this could have the effect of delaying payments to mobilized reservists at time when they need benefits most additionally this policy option would do little to address the issue of w enrollment and could produce even lower enrollment than that experienced under th rrmiip finally the people most likely to enroll in lossbased program would be those with the largest differential between civilian and military incomes doctors lawyers and pilots for example an insurance program whose benefits flow pr imarily to these groups would probably be subject to criticism as perk for the rich are there other ways to help reserv ists protect themselves against income loss besides new mo bilization insurance program there are other ways to address the income loss problems associated with mobilizati on but they tend to be expensive ither for the government or for the individual one of the great virtues of insurance is that it is relatively inexpensive way for the individual to prot ect himself or herself against the risk of future loss nonetheless there are other options some of which are outlined below individual saving and investment one set of policy options clusters around the notion that the individual reservis t is primarily res ponsible for managing his own financial affairs in lig ht of his status as reserv ist from this perspective mobilization is an obvious risk associated w ith reserve service those who join the reserve components receive compensation ch as cash educational benefits and other privileges in return for accepting this risk therefore it is in large part the reservists responsibility to ensure that he she has sufficient sa vings or investments to carry himself or herself through mobilization although the government can certainly implement policies which ssist the individual in doing so for example the government could allow reservists to set aside certain amount of money each year in special savings account similar to an individual retirement account ira contributions and accumulated inte rest could be tax free allowing the reservist to build up fund that could be accessed during mobilization upon discharge or retiremen t from the reserve components the funds could be rolled over into an ira or made available for any use alternatively the account could be structured more like the thrift savings plan tsp for federal civilian employees whereby the reservists contributions are matched in whole or in part by the federal government while these ideas may have merit there are some drawbacks to them as well first of all as mentioned previously they are relatively expensive costing substantially more than mobilization insurance policy would for example reservist who anticipated an income ss of 1000 per month during deployment would have to put aside 9000 to cover hi s anticipated loss for standard 270 day mobilization even if the reservist made regular contributions over five year period with interest accruing tax free th reservist would still have to contributehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs11 30assuming ten percent compound interest rate 31the 03 paygrade is the paygrade of navy nd coast guard lieutena nts and army air force and marine

33the weekend drill pay figures reflect base pay only they do not reflect any special pays nor do they incorporate deductions for taxes or life insurance premiums the typical drill weekend referred to is also known as muta 4 usually two full days of training conducted on saturday and sundayabout 115 per month30 in order to accumulate 9000 for many reservists the amount of money required to be put asid in such an account could prove to be unrealistically high for example in 1998 an officer in the reserves in the 03 paygrade31 with seven years of service made 433 for typical week end drill an enlisted reservist in the e4 paygrade32 with four years of service ma 184 for typical weekend drill33 setting aside 115 per month would consum 265 percent and 625 percent of their monthly paychecks respectively rather than set aside such large portion of their reserve paychecks every month for years on end to cover potential future loss many reservists would likely choose to ignore th eir risk and thereby leave themselves in financially precarious situ ation upon mobilization or lternatively to quit the reserves additionally such savings and investment plan even if generously subsidized by the government with matching contributions would do little to help mobilized reservists who had only recently joined the reserves unlike their longer serving comrades they would not have had sufficient time to accumulate any significant savings final point to consider would be the cost of any incentives offered by the government to stimulate saving and investment among reservists the tax benefits offered under an ira or tsp type progra m would decrease revenue to the treasury and the matching contributions offere d under tsp type program would require direct government expenditure although the total cost to the government would depend on how the program was structured and how popular it was among reservists it could be substantial b government reimbursement of loss another alternative to mobilization insurance would be direct government re imbursement of income loss under such policy reservist who suffered loss in income could file claim for the loss and be reimbursed by the governme nt either in full or in part such policy would be ideal from the perspective of the financially injured reservist it would require advance financial planning nor any direct cost however there are clear problems with such policy first of all it likely would prove to be quite expensive to the government in time of tight budget c onstraints such generous government program could be extemely di fficult to justify secondly there would be problem of equity if the federal government directly reimbursed any income loss some mobilized reservists could be paid dramatically more than their active dutyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98652crs12 34of course this same objection can be raised against the concept of mobilization insurance certain reservists with mobilization insuranc policies would make dramatically more than their active duty counterparts or other mobilized reservists without insurance policies for doing the exact same job however in the case of mobilization insurance there would probably be perception that the extra pa was the result of the individuals prudent financial management while in the case of di rect government reimbursement there would probably be perception that the extra pay was simply extra paycounterparts and other mobilized reserv ists for doing the exact same job34 such divergence could possibly cause dissension and hostility within the military finally such policy would require substantial administrative effort in order to verify the amount of loss especially among those w ho are selfemployed this could have the effect of delaying payments to mobilized reservists at time when they need their benefits most as well as adding to the overall cost of the program c private insurance another option would be encouraging private companies to offer reservists an insura nce product similar to mobilization insurance if successful such policy option woul d capitalize on the expertise of successful insurance companies relieve the
