modern processes lecture given on 25 june 1963 thank you well i see we are increasing in size we are increasing in size and those few of you who are about to go home are illadvisedvery illadvised for various reasons whats the date audience 25th twentyfifth 25 june ad 13 saint hill special briefing course now theres very happy note today in processinga very happy note indeed the differences of processes as they have come out one way or the other have been regulated by two things the name of this lecture is modern processes two things one has been the ability of the auditor to do them and the other is efficacy on various levels of casesin other words ability of the auditorefficacy in advancing the state of case now that is what monitors by and large process its not monitored by how bright i am but sometimes im amazed at how i can overlook some few things you know but trying to fit the jigsaw puzzle together requires that these two factors be joined in other words these two factors have got to mesh thats very important very important if we solely went on the basis of efficacy of processes on that alone and we went on nothing else we would very soon find ourselves with auditors thats very interesting because they wouldnt apply this material broadly or generally or uniformly enough to give them wins and ive meant for several lectures to give you the definition of wins and loses and this youll find of some value what is win and what is lose in terms of thetan behavior now these are very very diffident type words these arethese win losethis is terrific thlah wonderful significance you know one of these emptyheaded significances you know that everybody knows well beware of these everybody knows things because they dont open up to an achievement so you have to get an action definition to these things before you know exactly what is win what is lose and then you could get wins or know when you hadnt had them its very funny but its odd how you have to take some of these things apartthe reductio ad absurdum of an idiocy you know and if we dont know the anatomy of these things what do we mean when we say an auditor has to have win or the auditor got lose or the pc got lose or the pc got win well if you dont know the anatomy of win or lose how would you know how to give pc win or lose you might want to give pc lose sometime you might befind someyou might find the thetan that started the helatrobus implants or something like that you know and now in these two things win and lose we find in actual fact very fundamental fundamental on the subject of entrapment degradation all the rest of these things add up into these definitions but theyre idiotidiotically simple definitions took very very long time to find out what they were and right away the second i tell you these you see youll say oh yes of course and that will be the end of that so of course i have to give it buildup but win is intending to do something and doing it or intending not to do something and not doing it and that is win and lose is intending to do something and not doing it and intending not to do something and doing it now you notice that lose gives you disagreement you see theres ridge forms between those two thingsnice ridge sitting right there you intend to do something and what is the consequence of this not doing it well therefore intending to do it and not doing it are statement in disagreement one with the other and so you get ridge that is bit of entrapped energy dont you see and so that will read on an emeter see an emeter registers disagreements basically all right there are those four conditions and they are covered even though you intend not to do nothing and do nothing dont you see thatyoure adding significance you see to the basic definition all thats included in there see intending to do something and doing it thats win intending not to do something and not doing it thats win all right how do these apply in processing you intend to improve this case and you dont improve it that gives you lose i notice sad little black shadow floats across some of the people present you intended not to arc break the pc and you did it you intended not to make the pc worse and you feel you made him worse thats big lose now lets look at it from the pcs side the pc intends to do something and doesnt do it the pc doesnt intend to do something and does it now therefore those would be pc loses pc losesbang bang lets say the pc sets goals for the session in this session i wish to become an ot and he doesnt do it unreal though that may be that is still lose see unreal though it may be now the question of reality and achievability dont happen to be included in the basic definition of win and lose theres effort to modify them to that degree but when you apply them to auditing you get some additional factors which are quite interesting this auditors idea of win is not to arc break the pc and the auditor arc breaks the pc and then thathe realizes then that hes had an auditing lose maybe that was all he intended to do was to not do something all right so theres auditor attitude or auditor viewpoint of the situation you see get through this session without any arc breaks or blowups see thats an auditor intention you see auditor doesnt make it gets lose youd be surprised how often that is the auditors single intention the basic most quivering intention is to somehow or another get this pc smoothly through this session and out the other sidenot to do anything to the pc or anything but just not to do anything damaging to the pc see just somehow or another in spite of this stuff get the pc to the other side of the sessionuhhhh made it pc didnt have an arc break whew what win well actually thats kind of unreal but nevertheless its within an auditors frame of action all right thats in the auditors frame of action see short of processing youre not going to do anything for this auditor well this makes demand of process that it works regardless of that intention well thats heck of thing to have to demand of process isnt it but these are factors which i work with all the time factors as oblique as this the process has to work regardless of the intention well thats sure putting strain on an automaticity if you want my candid statement and you would be very very surprised how often that is truehow often that is true and i have eventually begun to carry that as one of the crosses my mockup has to bear see process has got to work regardless now thats an awful strain to put on process isnt it if the auditor will just do certain actions and not exceed those actions then certain results will occur and that is just about the safest base on which you can lay process and any process you have today is based and constructed on that base now thats interesting isnt it in the first place that might seem at first glance to be downgrade of you as an auditor but it actually is not downgrade as you as an auditor your skill is in completing an auditing cycle your skill is sitting there handling and keeping the form and running the session you actually do have somebody sitting across from you who has oblique and crisscrossed ideas well i figure its just about enough for you to do that without inventing process as you go along i find thats too much now i myself auditing many many many years ago used to actually dream up the process and handle the pc all at the same time now this is feasible this is feasible but is only necessary if you dont have the answers and i found out that the moment i had the answers i laid that asidedreaming up the process while auditing the pc i laid it aside because it was unnecessary to approach the problem it put an awful strain on the session and it basically gave too many loses see i ran too many sessions in which there was vast gain on the part of the pc so therefore i started reducing even from my own auditing viewpoint the number of factors of cases and the number of difficulties of cases down to nearirreducible minimum and having reduced them then adhered to them dont you find today working out process carefully and then when i have some confidence in it using it in an auditing session theres great deal of test goes into processes now the way to get around this problem is to know the fundamentals of cases and to have processes adapted to those fundamentals now there are differences of eases just as there are differences of auditors and what we expect of an auditor is to be able to complete an auditing cycleyou know with the question and the acknowledgment and so forthhold the session form together and take care of this particular pcs session unformness see all pcs are trying to bolt out of session one way or the other you know they do something else besides the auditing command and they fail to do the auditing command and youve got to have the good sense to know when to straighten out session that is running badly and leave session alone that is running fairly well see this is all in the field of an auditors skill and that happens to be the irreducible minimum for an auditor you cant go any lower than thatcant go any lower than that you get any lower than that and you havent got an auditor more then of randomness will be introduced into the session and into the pc than order theres tremendous importance to this thing called the auditing cycle it is too often overlooked if an auditor quote unquote auditor cannot perform the auditing cycle but absolutely must q and amust do this must do that gets all scattered and dispersed gives the auditing command in seven different version in seven different commands you see havewhat affinity has been rejected what affinitys been refused has any affinity been refused would an affinity be refused well would emotion be refused then well what would be rejected anyway that an inability to duplicate all right thats perfectly obvious to you that person who could never master repetitive statement of the command couldnt ever classify as an auditor now that doesnt mean youwhen youre upset and tired something like that and busy auditing like madyou suddenly flub you skid you skid on the bank you know youre supposed to be saying what affinity has been rejected and you suddenly say what affinity has been refused see correct it and so forth but you notice that the mistakes you make in that department are absolutely minimal theyre very very few weve mastered that in auditing so that you think its even ridiculous to be touching on that well run coaudit someday now your next action of the auditing cycle is to be able to acknowledge and some auditors get on very thin edge on this line and they think all you have to do is say thank you matter what the pc says they dont bother to understand what the pc says they think if they interrupt the pc and make the pc say it again because they didnt understand it it will upset the pc they get lot of considerations of this particular character and vary this or when the pc says something theyre startled out of their wits and justify what they just did you know the pcs saying well i thought you were awfyou looked awfully bad today and the auditor says well ii really dont look bad ii just didnt have much sleep last night you see now hes actually broken down the auditing cycle at that point and the session will suffer to that degree again that isnt very serious and again every now and then you make that break auditor including is proof against being startlednot absolutely proof against being startled because pc says well this is why i tried to commit suicide last night see something like that you say what outside of your zone of reality at once you see you didnt know anything about this and youve been running half session and didnt find it out you know blow your brains out see something like that and sometimes youre auditing somebody and something awfully personal comes up or something like this and you hear yourselfwith some horrorsuddenly justifying it or something like this you know grab yourself tight and well these things happen we can continue to seek for perfection in these things and we know how it should go but it doesnt disqualify an auditor as an auditor that sort of thing will go along but if an auditor cant cure himself of qing and aing it gets pretty serious because this is very damaging the pc volunteerspcwell ill give you the most common action meter echoing the pc volunteers suppress you know i just realized i just suppressed this engram and the auditor says in this session has anything been suppressed has anything else been suppressed on the engram well blow your brains out man that was an origin tr 4 flunk flunk flunk flunk see nothing drives pc round the bend faster than this echo metering see works in dating the pc says you know i think the incident was five minutes long oh oh was the incident five minutes long thats q and man its an invalidation the pc says i think the incidents five minutes long you say okay the incidents five minutes long thats that thats the end of your dating the most precious thing your pcs got is the ability to estimate time and youll find out that pc whos smoothly audited on engrams after while gets out of dating entirely give him lot of hours of very good auditing on the new running engrams by chains and he all of sudden will behell be saying well and hell say well the incidents at 84964643972 and one minuteat and look at his watch and youve got to be quick on the ball see write it down sometimes it takes you by storm you dont reallyyou say whatd you say again too badtoo badthat pc might not be able to repeat it in exactly that order and hell start questioning it so you have to be on the ball youre hereyoure over here on your meter see youre over here on your meter now is it more than hundred trillion or less than well its eightyfour trillion nine hundred sixtyfive billion and youve got to be right there man the pcthats one of his most precious abilities the other one is the ability to go earlier and to return now thats very interesting but any echo metering is q and pc says the duration isdurations about 725 years i think its around 725 years well now you get to the borderline question do you now verify it on the meter you dont it is around 725 years that isthat is period see it is around 725 years makes difficulty and you say move through the incident to point around 725 years later is very imprecise so you get around this by saying move through the incident to point 750 years later which puts him well beyond the end of the incident you get the idea or you could even say 725 doesnt matter as long as you dont qanda thats all under the heading of the auditing cycle thats how far the auditing cycle goes youve asked the pc even though you were dating on the meter how long ago was this incident if the pc says how long ago it was matter what youre doing with the machinery the pc has answered the auditing question so that all you have left at this point is record and an acknowledge thats all youve got left otherwise youre qingandaing and youll be injuring the pcs ability to date and you mustnt injure that its like in mid ruds pc saysyoure running youre running protest on the big mid ruds see youre clear on out to protest and the pc all of sudden says you know i just suppressedi just realized i just suppressed the whole thing while ago ah interesting question youll find the auditor who cannot do an auditing cycle asking is there anything else you suppressed that is q and the auditors action is tr 4 only and go on with his protest see origin now were getting down to some of the weakest points of auditing what is q and its to question the pcs answer ill show you how marvelous q and can be how adroit it can be how far afield it can be and still be q and youve run the engram on the pcyouve run the engram the pc didnt get anything so you realize theres an earlier beginning so you say to the pc is there an earlier beginning on this incident its very interesting because you earlier told him to return to the beginning of the incidentyou told the somatic strip toand the fact that five ten fifteen minutes later you say is there an earlier beginning on this incident questions the action of the somatic strip ten or fifteen minutes before now were really getting down to fine points of auditing were getting very nice but it still fits within that same framework even thing like are you sure you answered the auditing question see an invalidation its also q and the basis of this is youve done something about what the pc has done you said to the pc spit the pc spat you say did you spit youve done something dont you see the essence of all q and is doing something because the pc has done somethingdeparting from the auditing cycle with new doingness because the pc has added new doingness you then if you understand that completely you can break yourself of it but sometimes an auditor doesnt recognize what he is doing in this and he doesnt realize hes breaking down his auditing cycle now these are very neat points these are getting very very neat and any auditor goofs on one of these every once in while the worst one is the pc is trying to originate something and the auditor continues to answer it i said how long is it going to be to the end of the session and the auditor says another fifteen minutes the pc has alrthis is something that has gone on before see and the pc says but i said i only said how long would it be to the end of the session and the auditor says well another fifteen minutes eventually it gets through the auditors head that hes not acknowledged an origin because it sounded like question and he stacks up four five six seven eight nine ten origins right in row none of which are acknowledged i said the engram was long time ago thats what i said yes well i know iii know i know thats what you said and were still trying to get it yeah butbut i saidi saidi said that the engram wasi justthats all i said was the engram was long time ago i know im still trying to find it you dont understand i said you get the idea all of sudden the auditor says oh my god ive missed withhold here on the basis that he simply meant it as comment and he wasnt questioning the dating or anything he justand i ever since that time have never acknowledged it yet boy you talk about something wrapping itself around the telegraph pole when that one gets going it has many horrible cunning covert versions that can crawl out of some edge of the session some place and just drop ink all over everything and you can really get one of these things going its wild and sometimes they are so adroit theyre so incomprehensible that you dont wake up to whats going on and that applies to any auditor theres always one so adroit that you wont catch italways youre trying to get some items or something out of pc and the pc makes some remark that sounds exactly like something else and the auditor takes it up and here we 90 just caught off guard dont you see itsthats only unforgivable if you never catch it you know you can miss withhold on pcnow to show you how important the auditing cycle is just about the worst situation you can get into is the immediate bypassed charge in the session immediate bypassed charge the immediate and thats the same example that ive just been giving you pc originated something and you bypassed it as charge by taking it up and doing something elseor do it you do something about what the pc said theres only one actual way to clarify thisif you think youre understandmisunderstanding it in some way ask the pc to clarify it you know and in some eases its enough to say is that request is that request that youre making and so forth that takes it out of the sameof the category you see and you get clarification of it because very often the pc isnt making request pc says its chilly and the auditor obligingly says ill close the door or well shut the windows or something well oddly enough the pc didnt mean that see thats then basically q and now remember theres always certain misunderstanding can occur between an auditor and pc the question is can the auditor put it right and that is the final demand of an auditor and thats why youre there if it goes wrong can you put it right it isnt so much as are you perfect as an auditor we can attempt to achieve that but its an absolute which is unobtainable i can get pretty good on practicing process of some kind or another i can get pretty good at it but i would never strain my brains to the point of trying to get perfect i can get just as good as you can get and then not go to bed and cry all night because i wasnt perfect you see the question isis can you straighten it out or are you going to sit there in miserable flub unable to make the thing come out right at session end and that i should say is the final test of an auditor can he make it all come out right anyway you know session wrapped itself around the telegraph pole well can the auditor bring the session off anyway well that comes under the heading of technical skill and observance of the auditing cycle now modern auditing has paid great deal of attention to this so that today we have process known as routine 2h now this is brandnewat the moment its mentioned here but it very shortly will not be brandnew with you the main difficulty in the handling of engrams the main difficulty is the complexity of the action its been reduced now to very rote procedure as you see particularly when you study the steps one by one you will see that they dont depart into lot of well theres always lot of something else youve also got to do see as far as the procedure is concerned it just isnt in that category it is rote procedure its as rote procedure as repetitive processes practically now thats pretty much something to demand of processes and yet there it is now it runs engrams better than ive ever run engrams so thats all im demanding of it and thats plenty because i was never ablei would think theres only been couple of cases that ive ever had my hands on and couldnt run an engram on or get him through or straighten him out by reason of running an engram sounds pretty wild but this runs engrams better than that runs them smoother its what im using with variations right now ive been testing it and testing it and testing it and this is very george indeed and thats quite triumph thats been some thirteensome years in manufacture longer than that actually but lots of failures tremendous tremendous numbers of failures in getting auditors to do it and that became so great as far as i was concerned at one time that i abandoned it and it stayed abandoned for many years the failure there was intending auditors to run engrams and not achieving it and you go give another failure like that and ill turn in your thetan to the local headquarters great deal had to be known data to move the thing into this particular category of rote engram procedure which is r3r that is r3r that is not running engrams book one now one of the things that is necessary is running engrams on pc is place to learn how to run engrams on pc of all processes that is the one that is not learned by doing it on the pc if you have command of the time track of knowledge of the time trackdoesnt mean your own time track thats just the basics of time track what are these thingsyoure going to tangle foot inevitably even though youre given rote procedure you wont have even hazy notion of knowing where you are but more important than that dating is an interestingly exact skill and in engram running dating is combined withas another dating meter action with time in itduration the hardest step is duration and that is the only one that is left in actual engram running to learn while you are running engrams if youve got dating down first duration is hard to get it is tough to get duration you will succeed in getting the proper duration for an engram time after time and then all of sudden you will hit bearcat you will lay yourself gorgeous ostrich egg and get all tangled up and not know whether youre coming or going and on that rote procedure duration is everything so i should think any nervousness that you have in running engrams should be relegated just to this one department of duration and your skill should already be very great in the other departments before you tackle it some of you are learning this the hard way right now well ill give you some problems of duration had one the other nightalmost knocked own head off the duration of the engram was split second please note that that is not covered by the question is the duration seconds minutes hours days weeks months years please note nothing reaches split second the auditor was working on it for an hour meantime the pc skidded into another engram see fantastic problems can occur under the heading of duration if your pc doesnt know what the incident is all about youve got the duration wrong and thats howthats all there is to that there are variations to that why now youre right here in present time let call to your attention that you cannot at this moment tell the total length of your time track but you can tell the length of this life notice that all right very good you can always see the back end of the incident then in other words you can get the duration of the part of the incident that is pointed toward pt in other words the later part of the incident is always durationable you see that so youve got this fellow and youve got this fantastic situation where hehes sitting there in the dark and he can see the light coming in from window and you run the engram again by rote and hes sitting there in the dark with the light coming in the window and you run it again and hes sitting there in the dark with the light coming in at the window well fortunately for you we dont have to depart from rote engram running i finally got thisi just got this cracked in all such cases the duration is wrong he could reach in terms of reality on meter reading the last fifteen minutes of the tenhour engram which was sitting in the dark with the impression of window and this is quite interesting because you see thats the part thats closest to present time so he can see the back end of it so you get the duration of the back end of it you get the minor incident inside the major incident which was sitting in the dark looking at the window so every time you find the pc sitting in the dark and having been run through it once cannot tell you about it the duration is wrong and you simply redo the duration step isnt that easy you dont vary from rote procedure at all you dont have to do anything at all you just redate your duration you tell the pc go to the beginning of the incident all by rote see all right move through the incident to the pointwhatever it wasfifteen minutes later bang thats all pc comes up at the other end and he says what happensand you say what happened and the pc says i dont know i was sitting in the dark and i see this impression of the window and you say all right thank you very much and you say all right were going to see if we cant get better duration on this incident now get another duration all right youve got duration now of five hours had duration of fifteen minutes before got duration now of five hours dont consider that your first duration was wrong youve just got more incident now so you say all right return to the beginning of the incident he goes to five hours he goes five hours from the end move through the incident to point five hours later ynnnaaasome trees and then there was this window and thats all i know about it all right thank you very much so much for that going to redo the duration of the incident see seems like its about thousand years and you say thats fine dont nag the pc dont introduce any other commands you dont have to do anything else you just say all right move to the beginning of the incident all right the pcs therebang youll see your meter go when the pc arrives at the beginning of the incidentit always goes bang your meter flicks he doesnt have to say hes there and you say all right move through this incident to point one thousand years later zoom he goes oh well you see its like this its like this i was an aeronaut and i got tangled up with these astronauts you see and they were trying to plant ostriches on this planet and you finally find out the end of it hetelling you the end of ithe was sitting in dentists chair he was saying at the end of it he wasnt sitting in dentists chair at the end of the thing that was ship spinning quietly down into very hot sun you see that sort of flash that he kept reporting on the end was the crash didnt have anything to do with anything he thought it had anything to do with until you finally get the beginning of it you got it all you reyou just redo the duration step if the pc doesnt know about the incident you redo the duration step thatsits just simple its very easy for you and very good thing for you that it worked out that way so i can now of course release the procedure and it wasnotwasnt that so much i was waiting for but i thought wed have to doctor this up you know minor incident inside of major incident and all this sort of thing well thats too much fortunately it works out mechanically to be the pc will always go to the beginning of that part of the incident which he can now reach and he always goes to that always and he always goes to the beginning of the duration from some point at the end so you dont have to worry about it at all you just repeat the duration step very lucky for you says i says i and you will say so too very uncomplicated of course hes gotten charge off the end of it by moving through it once see every time he moves through the end section just that little end section one more time hes unburdened some charge whether he likes it or not you could stay there and grind and put him through it about nine times and you could turn it all bright and hed have visio on it engram running longer is barred out by the black ease not at all not at all now thats quite interesting thats quite interesting because it opens the doors it opens the doors to lot of things been long and arduous task trying to get pcs toup the line because the only thing there is there to run is engrams whatever else they think theres there theres only engrams and the machinery and so forth connected with them even gpm is just an engram of peculiar type which needs form to run it with but its still just an engram so all this is very interesting the main trouble an auditor is going to have then is dating and curing arc breaks because arc breaks occur in engram handling and if you dont handle them and if you continue to give the pc orders after the pc has expressed an arc breaky action you are going to mess up the case and thats the only way you can mess up case running engrams i found one other thing that may be of some importance to you before i tell you some more about that you know most people think the mind is very confused affair well ibm does not build computer of the same reliability or comparable accuracy of the reactive mind it just doesnt build one that good and far from being confused affair when addressed by the proper technology the mind is an automatic cardfile system of incidents all stretched out on the track beautifully which has comparable counterpart in the physical universe it is not confused mess at all if theres anything it is too idiotically orderly you always get the engram you ask for the pc always moves to the point theres nothing confused about it that may be brandnew point of view for you youve looked at the mind as being mass of confusion confusion isnt in the mind the pc looking at this file system and unable to grab onto the proper file catalog thinks it looks very confused but how would you like to go into the archives of some space opera society all of which is delivered to your handand these by the way are quite interesting as archives operated one about 612 million years ago something like that which was quite interesting cardfile systems were all stored in basement and i think the basement of that computer room was about the size of chicago and the machines which read that occupied an areajust the machines which read itthats you know the final results appeared on and so forthlooked like seven or eight grand central stations you know just the banks of machines and the reanalysis machines on that were all composed in little hut that was about thousand feet long by about four hundred feet wide and everything was all done on automatic card shuttles and pneumatic tubes and comparisons and these ibm machines down here look something like childs hurdygurdy or something compared to one of these other machines these machines could get the finest tiniest difference between umph and umph and then they could get all things that had the tiniest association with umph and umph you talk about your smallest and your largest magnitude of comparisontremendous see if youd wandered into that without knowing how it worked seeing these tremendous rows of variedcolored machines and buttons and tapes and the wastebaskets around there just used to flood and you would have said the devil himself cant operate this thing actually all the operation it required was one single machine on little platform and you simply asked what you wanted to know on that machine and then it mastered the master machines which mastered the master machines which mastered the files its very simple you wanted to know how many stripes does zebra have on the planet xnu in the year brfrumph of wuf zoom how do you make zebra what is the name of the ot who originally designed zebras for this particular consolidation coordination and what were the basic faults of the design how many zebras survived after 10000 years in the environment of the planet path are lions actually the best answer to zebra overpopulation all of this is statistical information dont you see all statistical well if you tried to build machinery that would answer up youve got it in dianetics evolution of science the size of the machinerysomething like thatitd take niagara falls to cool the vacuum tubes it would itd burn up enough fuel to light city if the mind was on computer basis fortunately it isnt it achieves this fantastic and marvelous accuracy because yo4 are quite fantastic and quite marvelous and so is the pc thats about all there is to that its simply theits the recorded protests of time and this stuff all wheels off and its all timed beautifully and so forth and youre looking not at necessarily complicated arrangement youre looking with the procedure youre just looking at the master keyboard and all youve got to do is punch the master keyboard it always delivers the answer the most things wrong with engram running is auditors dont think its delivered the answer how many auditors say go to the beginning of the incident are you there what the hells the matter with him doesnt he think hes in charge of the machineid hate to have that guy driving you know he gives the wheel big yank you see and gives the wheel big yank and then he says to the automobile did you turn the corner i dont know why hes asking the automobile if it turned the corner the automobile cant tell him if it turned the corner the automobile can only turn corner some people try to treat the reactive bank like an ouija board and youll find some of the darnedest ouija board questions being addressed will you be clear after ive run another 300 engrams see its misapprehension of the device youre operating its not an ouija board you tell it to movewell you can get your dates quite grossly you can say move to the incident at approximately 849 trillion trillion years ago and the pc says to himselfsays eightynine point four jesus you know what laugh you know gosh thats terrific date though and so forth and you say all right it doesnt matter what the pc did see and you say all right whats the duration of the incident and you finally get it on the meter and it says eighteen trillion years and the pc says eighteen trillion years and you say all right move to the beginning of the incident clank the meter goes and you say okay now move through the incident to point eighteen trillion years later and sit back and quietly make your notes and so forth pc says jesus christ eighteen trillion years god almighty yaaww you dont do anything else and youre not excited about it and so forth pc finally says oh well hell i might as well look at it and shuts his eyes there it is going by man there it is going by its only when you say go to the beginning of the incident which is at the end of the incident because the incident is eighteen trillion years long move through the incident now to point two seconds later at the end of the incident and the machine goes i had one the other evening movemove thirty seconds before the incident begins move through the incident to point thirty seconds later you cant do it you know you cant do it its not possible wouldnt have mattered if the incident was thousandth of second long you still couldnt have executed that auditing command and the somatic strip will not execute that auditing command itll lock up at that point now youre in real trouble youve done something extraordinary this is very very orderly machine youre operatingvery orderlyidiotically so only the pc gets in your road the pc very often says eighteen trillion years long in this goddamn thing see you know and the pc says oh thatsthats terrible well close your eyes and watch it go by you dont even have to say that he will inevitably its almost beyond his power to stop properly managed somatic strip he couldnt stop it he sometimes keeps on chattering at you the incident is running right on off youre actually handling very easily handleable thing providing you dont get incomprehensible about it you know like movedouble commandmove twenty years later to the end of the incident pc youd be surprised very often does thistries to do it imagine your embarrassment short time later when you redate this thing reduration it and find out that its eightytwo years long so you see he just cant manage thatdouble ordersthat sort of thing well this is all taken care of in your rote handling of engrams the biggest problem that an auditor hasthe biggest problem that an auditor has is one dating including duration and the other one is arc breaks now most auditors are afraid of arc breaks to some degree and if he tries to learn dating on pc or handle arc breaks of pc who is in the middle of the living lightning you know these two worldsand because the pc has made mistake and pushed the wrong buttonthese two worlds are now at war and hes just now being shot having been courtmartialed while the whole place is being bombed at the same time this is nothes in the middle of all this you seethis is not the time definitely to learn how to assess an arc break if he arc breaks let see how do you assess an arc break you say youre in the middle of this and guns are goingyes i know lets see howwheres that bulletin lets see it says here it says herei dont know i dont seem to have the assessment sheet and so forth wheres the assessment sheet im afraid thats not the time to learn that youll get loses youll get loses your loses will be so catastrophic that you next thing you know wont run engrams anymore thats what ive got to watch you see dating is difficultfinding the times of things and datingand if you cant pick up the arc break quickly why youre just licked if you cant do an arc break assessment for engram running youre just licked right there and the violence of the arc break while the pc is running engrams is catastrophic as far as the auditors concernedif the auditor is at all allergic to arc breaksbecause he is now being taught that he has had lose he meant to have session with arc breaks and here hes got an arc break or he intended to get the pc through two more engrams and the pc isnt going through two more engramsheres the pc with horrendous arc break see the difficulties the auditor loses and theres where routinenow understand its designated routine 2hcomes in and its arc breaks by assessment and youre going to consider this training process until youve run it or had it run successfully on you and then you all of sudden wont consider it training process anymore you will realize that it is superior to arc break straightwire quite interesting and you will have that bulletin tomorrow now im not going to try to give you an outline of that process because the bulletin is coming right out but what it does is just ask the pc for an arc breakyou take the arc break and you find the bypassed charge and then you ask the pc for an arc break and you find the arc break and you assess for the bypassed chargelocate it and indicate it and give it to the pc and youll find all of sudden this pc starts to fly very complex auditing but its very simple in its result line and you very rapidly discover then that finding arc breaks is very very easy and puts you as master of arc breaks and so you longer need to be scared of them and it gives you dating lots of dating practice on stuff that the pc isnt necessarily very nervy about you know the postman scolded them he said you always are asking why i dont bring you mail see thats the totality of the incident well the pc can hang around that for long time without having anything happen to him and yet you can find its date and you can find the bypassed charge by assessment and there is special assessment for that type of arc break which i dreamed up and run ive tested and gotten this thing organized and gotten the bulletin written before im telling you about it because theres the bestthe best news youve had in some time theres practiced skill and youll all of sudden get very very cocky on the subject of arc breaks now the action of handling an arc break during engram running is just another assessment its simply got other questions connected with it and if youve already got this dusted off then the biggest liability to engram running is shut right off right there right now in other words ten minutes later you havent got any situation at all the pcs happy and carrying forward and you know exactly what went wrong there isnt any dragging the heels on this the pc isnt left in the middle of an arc break and your sessions dont end in debacle that is the most damaging thing not being able to handle an arc break not being able to date and not being able to handle the time track nobody can handle engrams nobody can run engrams now who can engrams be run on well we have our scale of cases that ive been telling you about and then of course case that has level 6 type bankpretty difficult to run any engrams but you can run arc breaks on that pc and you can boost them up and stabilize the bank one way or the other you can do various things with this pc and so forth but factually engram running goes long way if you dont necessarily call it engram running but call it r3r dont keep specializing in engrams because couple of you unbeknownst to youto my shame im sureyou dont know what it isare running secondary chains on your pcs youre not running engrams on your pcs youre running secondaries you assessed for secondaries and youre running secondaries perfectly all right perfectly feasible nothing wrong except please dont think youre running engrams when youre running secondaries see because thats the misemotional moment that depends on the engram for its charge so heres the engram chain and youre running the chain right up here perfectly fine wonderful your pcs getting off bunch of misemotion and that sort of thing marvelous set the pc up most remarkably well great nothing wrong with that except if you think youre running engrams youre of course making basic technical error which is going to make you very puzzled sooner or later about all this some others are running chains that havent been assessed properly at least one other and of course the thing theyre being running not being assessed is now branching trying to get over to the proper chain you know youve taken an arbitrary chainyoure running an arbitrary chain on the pc and this thing is trying to go around the corner and get over to the right chain so youre not really running chain of engrams at all you started out on one chain and the meter is pushing it over to the chain you should be running well thats perfectly all right but dont think youre running one chain youre runningtwo chains happening dont you see so to prevent this sort of thing and to maketo put engram running into the hands of far more pcs you shouldnt in the first place believe you can run engrams until you can run engrams just because its awful simple and so forth got training process for it nowyoud better master some of these points and get cocky about the thing before you tackle this because youre going the whole hill and theres process beyond this and you dont want to tie somebodys time track up so running of engrams however has great deal more flexibility because you can also run secondaries you can also run locks and they all run on the same procedure so this gives us very shallowshallow looks at cases you can take case then that cant stand up to an engram and you can still use r3r and you can get marvelously forward with the whole thing providing you do your assessment properly now proper assessment of course is list completed list under the rules of listing of 212 and 212a those rules of listing are observed in that first list dont get an incomplete list not forever list but just list it until youve got clean needle and you can dip further by assessing the eighteen buttons of the old prepcheck you assess the eighteen buttons and youll be able to get people who are notisingwho are far beyond being able to protest they cant protestand youll get such things as suppress and then youll get list of what theyve suppressed and your list is in this lifetime and you make complete list out of what theyve suppressed in this lifetime and you will get chain of somethingwhether locks secondaries or engrams we know not whichbut you will get chain that you can go down and it will release charge and will give you tone arm action and then it reaches lot further south than you might suspect of course when you run into the helatrobus implants with dull crash youve got to shift off r3h and go on to r3n and if you run into some other type of gpm goal that nobody ever heard of youve got to shift over to r3n2 see so youve got the types of processes that handle those and youre all of sudden dimly aware of the fact this pc is saying lets see theres something here that says nixnix vomica yes vomica nix vomica i think theres some poles they go crack funny engram my heads getting very hot you say oh well yes thats very fine thatsthats good that was near one because youre going to have to run that engram with your specialized procedures which run gpms get your difference thing for you about it is to be smart about the dates of those the dates go from 38 to 52 trillion years ago the earliest one i know of like that is at 315 trillion there were some little early gags some of the early eager beavers were in there trying to donot the same pattern but positivenegative type of gpm you dont find many of them but youll find that as basic on the chain on some pcs some earlier positivenegative thing you know createnot create that seemed to get into fashion some time about thenabout 315 trillion years ago anyway to make up what im telling you here your modern process depends to very marked degree on the auditor and the pc both getting win and if the auditor and the pc both cant get win with the process then the process is not with us long so ive been working very hard to make these two points mesh with one another and i think ive got it in there pretty close and i think that you will have some good runs on this sort of thing and i want to make this point very strongly processing has not necessarily done tremendous changeroo or shift on its knowhow but its being rearranged because of its target area i want to make sure you understand that the approach of processingthe approach to processinghas been upgraded because its target has been upgraded were shooting the moon were shooting the moon to use colloquial expression we are not interested in clearing anybody were only interested in ots and thats what you had been watching here for some months my problem was simply this the united states governmenthaand the government of australiahuhdecided to cut up rough and you have some crazy lunkheads in the kremlin and some other birds on the other side of the world who are trying to form dichotomy expressed with atomic fission the time is narrowing down rapidly the ability of governments to govern is degenerating at great rate of speed youre going to see nothing but chaos here in very short period of time im an old hand at watching these things go to pieces and i start to watch the square of the deterioration thah so when das federal fascist state jumped us for emeters i jumped them with ot and i said the only thing we could do was hold the ground legally which we are doing very successfullyeven winning bit hold that line and then upgrade the processing target and ive been working since january to do that and this has been very rough period its particularly rough on you students because its given you shifting quicksand of checksheets stuffthe ink is dry on it so it must be out of fashion you see but ive been moving you up very very rapidly and ive been holding on to you more or less for the good reason i did not want your training to be antiquated as rapidly you seeyou just more than get trained you go home and your training is outofdate so ive been holding on to you on stable plateau basis and this has been bit of touch and go what i needed was something that could run engrams very successfully and include all of these gpms and training procedure that could do thatcould lead person up to being able to run engrams that was still therapeutic processand then processes which got to cases which werent making advance on the upperlevel things but which would move those cases up to those and what im announcing here is ive achieved this definite goal of mine with regard to this and itsthe only target the only target that i accept as an auditing target now is ot and its right within your grasp its coming straight up the line and our campaigns for planet earth im afraid has had to be speeded up considerably and although some of you may shudder under that consideration others will probably say well thank god ron finally woke up you know that sort of thing wed probably get mixture of answers about the whole thing but the shells and shellfire thats been coming our way is not just coming our way its coming in the way of this civilization its lights are going out very rapidly and sitting back and reading the newspapers which tell you very little you might not recognize this quite as clearly so as far as im concerned weve beat the run lot of this now is up to you so dont fool around with it and dont be lackadaisical about it lets press on lets get the job done thank you
