patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 snf summary prime minister syed yousuf raza gilani will be anxious to prove that he is committed to fighting pakistans war on terrorism and will outline the gops partial response to the july demands presented by cjcs mullenddcia kappes gilani will publicly support the coalitons negotiations first counterterrorism strategy and defend pakistani sovereignty in the face of reported plans for unilateral us action privately he will agree that force is sometimes necessary and assert he is prepared to use it however coalition strains and governance gridlock are limiting gilanis ability to coordinate either security or economic policy he likely will repeat requests for actionable intelligence and suggest the need for increased usisaf operations on the afghan side of the border we should maintain pressure for specific counterterrorism ct action and condition future foreign military financing fmf assistance on pakistani agreement to training that will increase its counterinsurgency capabilities 2 cnf summary continued pakistan muslim leaguenawaz pmln leader nawaz sharif has used his go musharraf go campaign to become pakistans most popular leader today to bolster his sagging pakistan peoples party ppp popularity pm gilani may ask for quiet support of dignified exit resignation for president musharraf in contrast musharraf has asked that we reaffirm us support for him as president musharraf continues to debate dissolving the national assembly step we believe will lead to widespread unrest and increase calls for his departure 3 cnf summary continued gilani likely will ask for faster delivery of coalition support fund csf reimbursements endorse the bidenlugar bill to double economic aid to pakistan and support passage of reconstruction opportunity zone roz legislation he will welcome offers of food security and energy assistance to help overcome rising food and fuel inflation and rolling power blackouts he may ask for support to convince riyadh to agree to pakistans request to defer 59 billion in oil payments gilani fully supports efforts to repair strained relations with afghanistan and india end summary filling leadership vacuum 4 cnf prime minister yousuf gilani is wellmeaning proamerican and anxious to convince us that he is committed to fighting pakistans war against terrorism the challenge is turning good intentions into sustainable action gilani presides over fragile coalition mired in governance gridlock over the issue of president musharrafs future the real centers of power ppp cochair asif zardari and pmln leader nawaz sharif sit outside government fighting for political supremacy gilani supports what has been improving ministry of interior ct cooperation but he has limited power to force the army and the intelligence services interservices intelligence isi to battle growing militant insurgency his visit to the white house may well empower him to do more with the withdrawal of nawaz sharifs economic ministers the coalition lacks the expertise to tackle spiraling debt food and fuel inflation capital flight and rolling blackouts 5 cnf gilani will be seeking public assurances that the us supports pakistans new civilian government but the uneasy zardarinawaz marriage of convenience may not last much longer when the coalition breaks apart zardari will need to bolster his slim parliamentary majority with other partners president musharraf believes his party can be one of those partners and we agree but his go musharraf go campaign has made nawaz sharif the most popular leader in pakistan today zardari and gilani fear they cannot politically afford to continue working with musharraf and may raise this in washington in contrast musharraf has asked that the usg make it clear to gilani that the us continues to support him as president chief of army staff general kayani prefers to remain out of politics if for other reason than reluctance to take on twin security and economic crises we believe he will support musharrafs resignation with dignity if the prospect of impeachment becomes real 6 cnf musharraf continues to debate the possibility of dissolving the national assembly and imposing technocratic government we believe this scenario will provoke unrest and increase calls for musharrafs departure we should support gilani now and through coalition breakup nawaz currently does not have the votes to bring down the coalition fulfilling promises 7 snf we have learned since 911 that pakistan responds periodically to us pressure on counterterrorism we should continue to press for action on specific agenda items the gop has responded to the cjcs mullenddcia kappes visit in july by arresting several taliban shura members in quetta signed an agreement to install cellphone towers in the tribal areas fata is initiating an army operation in north waziristan and we expect they will allow another b300 surveillance aircraft to operate these steps will help disrupt crossborder attacks and improve our intelligence capabilities 8 snf however the gop has not targeted siraj haqqani or his network nor have they arrested commander nazir or gulbaddin hekmatyar these militants are responsible for much of the 40 percent increase in crossborder attacks on our troops in afghanistan this year the armyisi can do the job but they cling to old think the belief that it is better to manipulate militants through infiltration payoffs and divide and conquer strategy than fight extremists on the battlefield they fear military action would provoke tribal war they cannot control but the gop strategy has failed and the government is losing territory to extremists every day while acknowledging that elements of isi may be out of control musharraf and kayani remain reluctant to replace isi director nadeem taj bolstering ct strategy 9 cnf gilani will proudly explain the gops threepronged ct strategy political engagement economic development and force when needed he likely will claim recent minimal frontier corps action in the tribal areas hangu and bara and weak coalition concensus as evidence of gop resolve to execute that strategy we should acknowledge pakistani sacrifices in the war on terror gilani believes the coalition must build popular support for military action and general kayani agrees but we should stress that militants are exploiting the coalitions negotiations first policy to plan and launch attacks against pakistani and us targets 10 snf gilani will repeat gop requests for actionable intelligence and may suggest that the us and isaf beef up border patrols and stop the drug trade in afghanistan that finances arms and militant operations we should respond that the gop knows better than we do the location of haqqani nazir and hekmatyar most qaeda and taliban sanctuaries are in pakistan not afghanistan if gilani suggests improved regional especially gulf intelligence sharing we should welcome that initiative zardari has just proposed to us september conference hosted by the uae with pakistan india afghanistan the uk the us and nato observers to discuss the situation in the tribal areas and along the border this idea has merit too 11 cnf gilani will thank the us for its fiveyear 750 million fata development program and may ask for more despite security challenges usaid is implementing small projects in five of the seven fata agencies that will eventually create 120000 shortterm jobs for young pashtuns who otherwise would be tempted to join the taliban usaid is developing program to preposition relief packages to deliver in the gops name to villages after military action we should encourage the gop to increase its own civilmilitary programs to provide relief as part of its counterinsurgency coin strategy 12 cnf largely because of pride the pakistani army remains reluctant to accept coin training for itself or the badly trained and underequipped frontier corps we should tell gilani that future fmf support will be conditioned on the gops willingness to accept coin and close air support training we should assure gilani that we will continue current efforts to train and equip paramilitary forces like the levies and push him to accept pending training for the frontier corps pakistan now has six military officers working in the tripartite torkham border coordination center bcc we should press for gilanis concurrence to identify two bcc sites in pakistan gilani may raise the pakistani request to use fmf for f16 midlife upgrades we currently are seeking congressional support for this request fixing the economy 13 cnf economic growth for the current fiscal year is expected to be 58 percent well below the target of 72 percent the fiscal deficit is projected to be 7 percent of gdp versus target of 4 percent gop borrowing from the state bank of pakistan sbp has reached an alltime high of usd 8 billion pakistans trade deficit rose to usd 17 billion up from usd 11 billion last year as lackluster export growth fell far short of increasing imports savings and foreign investment both declined pakistans rupee has lost 168 percent of its value since january and is at record lows we support approval of pending usd 500 million world bank loan for pakistan conditioned on coherent plan for reducing food and energy subisidies gilani may ask for speedier delivery of coalition support fund reimbursements approximately usd 1 billion per year and endorse the recently introduced bidenlugar bill to double economic aid to pakistan 14 sbu not single megawatt of electricity has been added to the national grid since 2000 despite population growth and economic expansion industrial production is threatened by blackouts and unemployment is rising petroleum and electricity subsidies account for the bulk of the fiscal deficit and have continued to rise with skyrocketing international oil prices the gop is paying usd 554 million per month for subsidies on petroleum and will attempt to reduce these subsidies despite the intense popularity of such measures energy accounts for 293 percent of pakistans imports and growth in exports cannot cover the increases in international commodity prices saudi arabia is considering pakistani request to defer 59 billion in oil payments gilani may request help in convincing riyadh to agree usaid will launch three year program to assist with energy policy issues and energy efficiency and we are offering to fund usgs mapping survey to identify commercial mineral deposits and potential energy sources gilani will attend in washington world bank investment roundtable focused on developing pakistans thar coal field reserves 15 u gilani will welcome the usg offer of food assistance he estimates that pakistan needs help obtaining 35 million metric tons of wheat to stave off shortages this year pakistanis have suffered monthly double digit food price inflation since september 2007 over 100 million pakistanis live on less than 2 dollars per day including 25 million living on less than one dollar per day the world food program recently identified pakistan as one of 40 countries at risk of food insecurity and recently raised its estimate of atrisk individuals from 60 to 77 million or 48 percent of pakistans population repairing regional security 16 cnf zardari strongly supports improved ties with india irrespective of progress on kashmir gilani called indian pm singh this week and has agreed to meet with both singh and president karzai in sri lanka following the washington trip gilani has approved the list of pakistani participants to the minijirga with afghanistan india and pakistan initiated the fifth round of their composite dialogue in july and agreed to expand confidence building measures in kashmir gilani may ask for more pressure on congress for passage of reconstruction opportunity zone legislation which would benefit both afghanistan and pakistan 17 cnf however increased allegations of isi involvement in the july 7 bombing of the indian embassy in kabul have undermined regional relations india and pakistan are investigating the incident we are working with kabul to restart pakafghan economic and military meetings cancelled in the wake of the bombing if asked gilani will state that pakistan will not impede approval of the indiaiaea safeguards agreement but pakistan clearly would like similar usg assistance to develop its own civilian nuclear capability to meet growing energy demand negotiations continue on the proposed iranpakistanindia gas pipeline 18 cnf we were disappointed that the islamabad high court increased personal freedoms for pakistani nuclear scientist aq khan if asked gilani will say that the gop continues to closely monitor khans activities
