criminal jurisdiction legislation in the 109th congress introduction subject matter jurisdiction over criminal offense is usually matter of the law of the place where the offe nse occurs number of federal criminal statutes however enjoy extraterritorial applicati on the most obvious include statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction the courts ve held that the overseas reach of certain other statutes that have such expre ssed statement must nevertheless be implied lest the intent of congre ss be honored only imperfectly1 in recent years congress included statements of extraterritorial jurisdiction in its criminal statutes with increasing regularity the trend continued in the 109th congress proposals introduced during the 109th congress that contain extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction components took severa l forms some created or would have created new crimes with an overseas element others created or would have created new crimes and simply stated that they ar to have overseas pplication still others created or would have created new crimes and articulated specific circumstances under which they apply abroad and ye t others would have expand existing statements of extraterritorial jurisdiction for existing crimes to enlarge the circumstances under which they apply background some of the first federal criminal laws proscribed conduct occurring beyond the territorial confines of the united states the first treason provision condemned that offense when committed within the united states or elsewhere2 those early federal crimes also included murder manslaughter maiming and larceny when committed within what we know today as the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states3 the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states refers to those areas such as federal enclaves ove r which the united states has exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction to the territorial waters of the

application of which is beyond the scope of this report 17 united states v bowman 260 us 94 9798 102 1922 we have in this case question of statutory cons truction the necessary locus when not specifically defined depends upon the purpose of congress as evinced by the description and nature of the crime and upon the territorial limitations upon the power and jurisdiction of government to punish crime under the law of nations crimes against private individuals or their property like assaults murder burglary larceny robbery arson embezzlement and frauds of allto ships of american registry4 when crime has been committed by or against an american the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states also includes 1 any place outside the jurisdicti on of any other country 2 any foreign vessel scheduled to depart fro m or to arrive in the united states and 3 any overseas federal installation or residence of pe rsonnel assigned to an overseas federal installation other than those covered by the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act5 when committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states federal law

outlaws misconduct committed outside the united states by member of the united states armed forces longer subject to court martial juri sdiction or by anyone employed by or accompanying the united states armed for ces if the misconduct would constitute an offense punishable imprisonment for more than one year had it been committed within the special maritime and territori jurisdiction of the united states16 when the vitality of statute defining federal crime doe s not depend upon the place where the crime is committed such as in federal enclave the supreme court held in bowman v united states that statute which makes statement as to its overseas application may overcome the pres umption of purely domestic application if the failure to do so would frustrate the purpose for which congress enacted the statute17 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33658crs3 kinds which affect the peace and good order of the community must of course be committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the government where it may properly exercise it if punishment of them is to be extended to include those committed outside the strict territorial jurisdiction it is natural for c ongress to say so in the statute and failure to do so will negate the purpose of congress in this regard we have an example of this in the attempted application of the prohibitions of the antitrust law to acts done by citizens of the united states against other such citizens in foreign country american banana co v united fruit co 213 us 347 that was civil case but as the statute is criminal as well as civil it presents an analogy but the same rule of interpretation should not be applied to criminal statutes which are as class not logically dependent on th eir locality for the governments jurisdiction but are enacted because of the right of the gove rnment to defend itself against obstruction or fraud wherever perpetrated especially if committed by its own citizens officers or agents some such offenses can only be committed w ithin the territorial jurisdiction of the government because of the local acts required to constitute them others are such that to limit their locus to the strictly territorial jurisdicti on would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute and leave open large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries as at home in such cases congress has not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the high seas and foreign countries but allows it to be inferred from the nature of the offense bowman involved the scheme of americans to defraud the united states overseas 18 ford v united states 273 us 593 623 1927 man who outside of country willfully puts in motion force to take eff ect in it is answerable at the place where the evil is done ford involved foreign rum runners seized on the high seas while on board british ship hovering just outside us territorial waters 19 eg united states v villanueva 408 f3d 193 19798 5th cir 2005congressional intent can be inferred when limiting the locus of statute to us territory would greatly curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute and leave open large immunity for frauds that are as easily committed by citizens extraterritorially as at home 20 united states v vasquezvelasco 15 f3d 833 839 9th cir 1994in determining whether statute applies extraterritorially we also presume that congress does not intent to violate principles of international lawthe court later held in ford v united states that similarly silent statute will be thought to have extrate rritorial application where its violation has the statutorily anticipated impact within the united states18 based on bowman and ford the lower federal courts have concluded that federal criminal statute may be applied extraterritorially if it meets either of those standards19 yet they have also concluded that absent an explicit indication to the contrary congress intends questions of the overseas application of federal criminal law to be resolved consistent with the principles of international law20 particularly in the earlier cases the courts looked to wh ether application woul d satisfy one of the five international principl under which extraterritorial application of criminal law had been recognized those principles will allow the application of the criminal laws of one country within the territory of another when the misconduct occurs in part within the territory of the proscribing country the territorial principle httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33658crs4 21 an analysis discloses five genera l principles on which more or less extensive penal jurisdiction is claimed by states at the pr esent time these five general principles are first the territorial principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the place where the offence is committed second the nationality principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the nationality or national charac ter of the person committing the offence third the protective principle determining jurisdiction by referenc to the national interest injured by the offence fourth the universality principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the custody of the person committing the offence and fifth the passive personality principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the nationality or national character of the person injured by the offence of these fi ve principles the first is everywhere regarded as of primary importance and of fundamental ch aracter the second is universally accepted though there are striking differences in the exte nt to which it is used in different national systems the third is claimed by most stat regarded with misgivings in few and generally ranked as the basis for an auxiliary competence the fourth is widely though by means universally accepted as the basis of an auxiliary competence except for the offence of piracy with respect to which it is the generally recognized principle of jurisdiction the fifth asserted in some fo rm by considerable number of states and contested by others is admittedly auxiliary in character and is probably not essential for any state if the ends served are adequately provid ed for on other principles harvard research in international law jurisdiction with respect to crime 29 merican journal of international law supp 439 445 1935 emphasis added 22 united states v macallister 160 f3d 1304 1308 n8 11th cir 1998on authority of bowman courts have routinely inferred congressiona l intent to provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign offenses that cause domestic harm united states v delgado garcia 374 f3d 1 337 1346 dc cir 2004in reachin g its conclusion that the fraud statute before it in bowman applied extraterritorially the supreme court recited several other statutes not expressly rritorial but which might by the very nature of the crime outlawed be supposed to apply extraterritorially among these chief justice taft for the court noted the punishment of consul who knowingly certified false invoice the forging or altering of ships papers the enticing of desertions from naval service and the bribing of united states officer in civil military naval service 23 united states v layton 855 f 2d 1388 1395397 9th cir 1988 at the time of the murder of congressman ryan for which layton was convicted the statute was silent as to the misconduct is that of national of the proscribing country the nationality principle the proscription applies to misconduct committed against the nationals of the proscribing country the passive personality principle the misconduct has an impact within th proscribing country the protective principle and the misconduct is universally conde mned the universal principle21 the lower federal courts have read these principles and the bowman and ford decisions to suggest that american extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction includes wide range of statutes designed to prot ect federal officers employees and property to prevent smuggling and to deter the obstruction or corruption of the overseas activities of federal departments and agencies22 they have held for instance that the statute outlawing the assassination of members of congre ss may be applied against an

one of the bases for jurisdiction is under 402 is present state may not exercise jurisdiction to prescribe law with respect to person or activity having connections with another state wh the exercise of such jurisdiction is unreasonable 2 whether exercise of jurisdic tion over person or activity is unreasonable is determined by evaluating all relevant fact ors including where appropriate the link of the activity to the territory of the regulating state ie the extent to which the activity takes place within the territory or has substa ntial direct and foreseeable effect upon or in the territory b the connections such as nationality residence or economic activity between the regulating state and the person pr incipally responsible for the activity to be regulated or between that state and those whom the regulation is designed to protect c the character of the activity to be regulated the importance of regulation to the regulating state the extent to which other states regulate such activities and the degree to which the desirability for such regulation is generally accepted d the existence of justified expectations that might be protected or hurt by the regulation the importance of the regulation to the international political legal or economic system f the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the traditions of the international system g the extent to which another state may have an interest in regulating the activity and h the likelihood of conflict with regulation by another state 35 united states v clark 435 f3d 1100 1106 9th cir 2006the legal presumption that congress ordinarily intends federal statutes to have only domestic application is easily overcome in clarks case because the text of 2423c is explicit as to its application outside the united states united states v yousef 327 f3d 56 91 2d cir 2003united states law is not subordinate to customary internati onal law or necessarily subordinate to treaty based international law and in fact may conflict with bothin the more contemporary cases the courts often also referred to the summary of the law portrayed in the restatement32 that provides not only somewhat different formulation of extraterritorial principles33 but also list of factors to be considered in order to determine how the prin ciples should be reasonably applied34 the presumptions of domestic applicati on and consistency with the principles of international law how ever operate as interpretative guides they cannot overcome clear expression of cong ressional intent to the contrary35 explicit

territory of any country or within country which is signatory to the operative treaty or agreement37 several proposals in the 109th congress followed this model numbered among them were several immigrationrelated proposals that would have amended the alien smuggling prohibitions in section 274 of the immigration and nationality act 8 usc 1324 and added this ty pe of general statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction to it proposed 8 usc 1324a4 the bills in question were comprehensive immigration reform act s 2611 as agreed to by the senate border protection antiterrorism and illegal immigration control act hr 4437 as passed by the house border security and interior enforcement improvement act s 2377 border security and interior enforcement improvement act s 2368 and securing americas borders act s 2454 even in the absence of statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction the courts seem likely to conclude that the statute was intended to have extraterritorial application and that such application constitutes affront to the principles of international law smuggling aliens into the united states has an impact within the united states and thus comes within the territorial principle in fact the appellate courts to consider the questi on to date have conc luded the section is extraterritorially applicable38 general statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction also appears in the telephone records and privacy protection act p l 109476 hr 4709 that outlaws the purchase or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce of fraudulently obtained confidential tele phone record s

states those of covered entity ie telecommunications carriers and any provider of ip enabled voice service proposed 1039bh the bill appears to be limited to the records of service provided within the united states because for among other reasons the definition of carriers is ta ken from the communications act of 1934 47 usc 153 that regulates communications services provided within the united states 47 usc 152 without an express statement of exterr itorial jurisdiction the federal wiretap law 18 usc 25102522 that now affords certain privacy protections for telephone communications has been held to ve extraterritorial application40 on the other hand the similarly silent wire fraud statute has been held to apply to at least some overseas violations41 with the express statement the proposed prohibition would appear to apply overseas where the offender is an american nationality principle or the records relate to services provided in the united states territorial and passive personality principles general statement proposal appeared as well in two bills that would have condemned certain forms of fraud by govern ment contractors the war profiteering prevention act s 2356 proposed 18 usc 1039b the honest leadership and accountability in contracting act s 2361 proposed 18 usc 1039b and the real security act s 3875 proposed 18 us c 1039b as in the case of the alien smuggling offenses the courts have recognized extraterritorial jurisdiction over similar offenses previously even in the absence of any explicit statutory statement42 possible ambiguity in the bills prohibitions make it difficult to describe the intendedreach of their statements of extraterritorial jurisdiction with any confidence both bills would have outlawed government contractor schemes to defraud the united states but then would have gone on to pr oscribe various forms of price gouging and deception without indicating what nexus to the united states if any would have been required for this second set of crimes assuming these latter offenses encompassed contractor abuse in any war or military conflict and except for jurisdictional purposes regardless of the victim the proposed general statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction would have permitted prosecution at minimum when 1 the offense was committed in part within the united states territorial principle 2 the offense was committed by an american nationality principle or 3 the offense was committed against the united states protective principlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33658crs9 43 the proposed offenses in chapter 75

1546 immigration and visa fraud 1547 marriage fraud 1548 attempt and conspiracyif free standing statements at least as often as congress uses general statement of extrate rritorial jurisdiction it will st ate in separate clause subsection or section that there is extraterr itorial jurisdiction over particular offense under certain designated circ umstances for instance 50 usc 424 declares there is jurisdiction over an offense under section 421 of this title relating to disclosure of the identity of covert agents committed outside the united states if the individual committing the offense is citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent reside nce as defined in section 1101a2 of title 8emphasis added statemen ts of this kind serve to rebut any presumptions as to the purely domestic intent of congress or as to the intent to conform to any conflicting principles of in ternational law on the other hand by listing specific jurisdictional factors congress may be thoug ht to have rejected application on the basis of unmentioned factors that might ot herwise have been c onstrued to support claim of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the 109th congress the immigration reform proposals exemplified this approach the comprehensive immigration re form act s 2611 as agreed to by the senate the comprehensiv immigration reform act s 2612 and the securing americas borders act s 2454 would ve rewritten 18 usc ch 75 relating to passport and visa offenses and among othe r changes add new section governing the extraterritorial application of

the two remaining sections are more ex pansive the first section 960ab2 becomes operable if either the predicate drug trafficking or the predicate terrorism offense occur in or affect the interstate

piracy war crimes and crimes against humanity does not provide basis for universal jurisdiction58 but found the exercise of jurisdiction justifie d on the basis of the protective principle59 section 960ab5 codifies universal principle for the na rcoterrorism offense ie there is extraterritorial jurisdiction if the offender is later brought to or travels to the united states the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act has another example of extraterritorial jurisdiction defined by the existence of specific jurisdictional factors it outlaws the dest ruction of vessels and maritime facilities 18 usc 2290 and confers extraterritorial ju risdiction if the offender or the victim is an american b an american is aboard targeted vessel or c the target vessel is an american vessel60 all of which would be consistent with the nationality and passive personality principles and under some circumstances with the territorial and protective principles the trafficking victims protection reau thorization act pl 109164 uses comparable style when it creates new ffense that prohibits anyone employed by or accompanying the federal government overseas from engaging in conduct that would violate 18 usc ch 77 relating to peonage61 or 18 usc ch 117 relating to travel for sexual purposes62 if committed within the united states or the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 3271httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33658crs14 the military extraterritorial jurisdic tion act already holds accountable for overseas special maritime and territorial felonies anyone employed by or accompanying the armed forces of the united states 18 usc 3261 hr 5212 would have amended section 3261 so that the act would have applied not only to felonies but to range sexu offenses the act does not cover those employed by or accompanying federal entities other than the military departments or agencies and it does not cover misdemea nors crimes punishable by maximum term of imprisonment of one year or less id the definition of special maritime and terr itorial jurisdiction fills some of the gaps 18 usc 79 it makes the special maritime and territorial offenses applicable when committed by americans on overseas federal installations or in the residences of personnel assigned to such facilities id the focus of 18 usc 3271 appears to be the misc onduct which neither section 79 nor the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act can reach 1 peonage and sexual transportation offenses committed overseas by foreign nationals employed by or accompanying federal entities other than the us armed forces and 2 such offenses committed overseas by americans employed by or accompanying such entities when committed in locations other than federal facilities or related residences rather than create new crime but to much the same effect the federal contractor extraterritorial jurisdiction for human trafficking offenses act s 1226 would have added jurisdic tional statement to end of chapter 77 that would have prohibited government contractors from gaging in conduct that would violate 18 usc ch 77 relating to peonage if committed within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the united st ates proposed 18 usc 1596 the result would have been much the same as under pl 109164 extraterritorial jurisdiction would have existed over 1 peonage offenses committed overseas by foreign nationals employed by or accompanying fe deral entities other than the us armed forces and 2 such offenses committed overseas by americans employed by or accompanying such entities when committed in locations other than federal facilities or related residences proposed 18 usc 1596 another proposal would have amended rather than created separate jurisdictional statement in its present form the statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction in money laundering cases ex tends to cases involving more than 10000 and either united states citizen or c onduct occurring in part within the united states 18 usc 1956f1 s 2402 would have amended the section so it extends to cases involving more than 10000 nd either united states citizen conduct occurring in part within the united states or conduct having an effect in the united states proposed 18 usc 1956f1 interwoven statements as matter of style the statements of extraterritorial jurisdiction are often inte rwoven among the elements of the offense rather than parsed out as separate clau subsection or section thus for instance the treason statute outlaws treason when committed within the united states or elsewhere the usa patriot improveme nt and reauthorization act supplies samples of this type of statute as well it creates two new transportation offenses one condemns anyone who knowingly
