arc breaks and generalities lecture given on 30 march 1965 well all right all right well i see nothings wrongnothings wrong with your morale at all nothings wrong with your morale at all all right this is the what of the which audience march 30th ad 15 well good when we used to run whole track you used to get some very remarkable dates this is the 30th of march what year audience ad 151965 ad 15 thats better somebody over here said 1965 thats out of style good enough good enough well theres all sorts of things i could tell you about today tremendous number of things i could have told you about the conditions formulas and i could have told you about the new org board andthe wildest thing thats happened in long timeand so forth so i just wondered what condition you were in well actually youre in condition of moralegood morale you seeso i probably shouldnt talk to you about the one i chose out to talk to you about arc breaks i could talk to you about the new levels and theyre pretty well taped and theres all sorts ofall sorts of data i actuallyactually my pen finger is the jam on the line right now because i cant get the stuff out by transcription that usuallythat transcription line breaks down i overload it and it jams like mad and at least when i write it out its there on piece of paper and it doesnt have to be transcribed you see before somebody can find out what it is and the mimeograph line is pretty fast so it gets out all right but its simply the proposition of having enough hours in day and i keep looking up and finding these 24hour days and i wish theyd stop it lousy 24hour days well thats what you get being on little tiny pipsqueak periphery planet dont you see thats way out in the twelfth magnitude sun you know in the skimscum of the galaxy thats the way it is anyhow thats all right were still making it we probably wouldnt make it at all if we were any closer in man somebody would have noticed this now the general pace of operations is quite rapid and organizations were moving right up very very nicely through last year and when i went down to palmas for few weeks vacation and so forth shift of my position and so forth was adequate to put little discouragement on the line now were busy picking that up again they went into slight decline now theyre coming back up again but whats very interesting is justthis is not apropos to the lecture im going to give youbut whats very interesting isis the number of data which you can get which are completely false which throw you terrific curve you get people coming around and givingthis is not ungermane to the lecture by the wayget people coming around telling you everybody thinks and everybody says and the field says and they say you know these terrific resounding blahhh and theres been one bird said it dont you see so that is then pretended to beby some chaos merchant you seethats pretended to be everybody in the whole universe thinks this see its the way they run democracy or newspaper but the point is that we were thrown couple of curves last year and one of them was the gradation program and we were thrown very bad curve it was reported to from at least two sources that should have known that the gradation program was unpopular and do you know something it alone was responsible for the resurge of organizations last year i just spent last night doing nothing but working on it and isolating it and thats what i finally came up with there was only one thing thrown on the plate last year that was new and strange people have been hearing talk about clears for years see so nothing about whether we were making it or not would have had too much influence on anything some influence yes but not all that influence and the only thing which was new and strange was the gradation program and that was brandnew whoever heard of that before see and you dont climb in the top storyi used to say thisyou dont take the pc into the top of the empire state building when you havent entered the front door at street level you see butand the truth of it is that the gradation program was responsible for continuous rise in growth and when i wobbled the gradation program acting on the very good authority that had been given as an everybody and an anybody and they you know and monitored it and modified it slightly the decline set inand the steady increase ceased and its just traceable to those two factors now there was price shift at the first of the year most people think it was the price shift to show you how bad the data is in this it was the way it was presented by the local organizations and registrars and the reason why this must be true is saint hill went along without any price shifts dont you see and its curves are just on steady increase and they keep right on increasing and there was price shift in organizations in the field and that brought about completeoh very steep declinebut that was coincident with my having left for vacation and it wasnt therefore totally assignable to this price shift so we went in to try to take look at what this was and we found out that unwittingly registrars and so forth had apparently used the confusion which was possible in the change of price to just lock the doors of the organizations tight and shut now confirming data is necessary in this but apparently people were being denied auditing in the first place what they did was sell tremendous quantity of auditing on the basis that prices were going to rise see they did that uniformly well of course the organization has already said prices will be unpayable in one month and then they are very surprised when the public finds them unpayable in that month do you follow audience mmm yes so nobody need be amazed about this you see theyve already said buy it now because its all going to go up to some prohibitive figure in thirty days well everybody bought it now and of course did just what the org said and didnt buy it thirty days later do you see that what they did was really advertise that people would not be able to get audited in thirty days do you follow that audience mmm hm so that was very very bad piece of promotional handling to use this as promotion gimmick and then the next point that was catastrophic and so on was to confuse the public with what they could get with what and to present this in completely cloudy way to the people who walked into the organization see now lets see oh you say mr zilch that you want some auditing ah well lets see now theres the internationali think its the lilithethe lifetime memberno uhthatthatexcuse uhif youif youvery few people can have membership uhyou sure you wouldnt want to pay full public price because its just too hard to figure these memberships out of course im gagging it up but we have seen letter written by the washington registrar that was just as bad as that some poor woman wanted auditing and thats all she was asking for and she got membership discount confusion and that was not what she wanted so it didnt answer the auditing question did it the auditors question in this ease was more or less when can i come in for some auditing and the answer to the question is of course well actually its all so confusing that uhuh further qualification its just all confusing and the person responded as though she had been refused auditing now actually if you sorted through all thesethese linesif you sorted through all these lines and looked at them very carefully you eventually probably could have figured out what it was and how much it was if you had pencil paper and an ibm computer handy and it upset her considerably so she sent the letter in here not complaining but sort of pathetically you know how can i get some auditing you see so theres the front door you see of the orgs locked closed key turned with number of empty cardboard boxes wooden boxes and these spikes that they used to have that horsemen couldnt get through you know when they were attacking castle chevauxdefrise they called them you know they were fence of spikes sticking straight out to the public and they were marked we dont know if you can have it or not because were not sure exactly how much it is ourselves do you follow that because the truth of the matter is the prices didnt rise in one area they declined thats surprise isnt it prices in the united states dropped from 625 for an intensive or course to 500 but the united states promoted it that there was going to be price rise i dont think its told anybody yet that there was price drop do you follow now this is what it takes to lock the door what it takes to lock the door is locking the door and what it takes to unlock the door is the key to how the door got locked in this particular character it was sufficiently broad and gruesome and so forth and it was so obvious that it was written all over everything in red paint saying this is the barrier to the door dont you see so that was very simple we just pulled all the boxes out of the way and threw them all aside and tore down the barricades and removed the chevauxdefrise those spikes and said what you do when you buy auditing or an intensive is you go to the accounts cashier who is the first door past reception and reception is there and reception says there is the cashier do you see the glass will be so fixed youll see itill see that it happens toowill be so fixed that person going into an org will have to bend over very uncomfortably to talk through hole so theres invitation there for anything and the exact data of what its all about is hanging over to the side of the window simple elementary and that there will be credit membership so all you have to do is sign an invoice oh you want ayou want course your name is jones all right you want course your name is jones jones jones jones jones jones youre not here on any discrepancy list and so forth oneone coursethere and the guy reaches through and signs jones on it he takes the slip up to the d of t and goes into the course thats all total now somebody comes into the org and says whats this scientology and the registrar says theres the book go over to the accounts cashier pay them two dollars and seventyfive cents and theres your answers when youve read the book why come back dont give them some weird idea well in your past life you probably lets notlets not do that see see so the key is somebody stumbles in and says what is scientology see theres book but if somebody stumbles in and says i want some auditing or i want some training even though they havent read book you say theres the cashiers window get your accounts clearance all right you got your slip of paper all right now go up to the second floor and youll see on the door director of training all right ill take you up there all right you turn them over to the director of training and theyre in course got it barricades now this is going to get worse and worse because there could be then cash payment there could bethey could pay for it in cash or they can get it on total credit if their credits good the credit discount is not as great as the cash discountcosts little more to buy one on credit thats all and you get better discount after your credit is proven good thats all its justcosts less youre notthe orgs neck isnt out now supporting bad credit risk in other words itwell work it out so that somebody feels they need an intensive all theyve got to do is go down to the org sign their name and go to the hgc and sit down and be audited period and that was what was the matter with central orgs now i always knew there was something peculiar about central orgs and organizations and auditors and that sort of thing i knew they did something that i didnt do and i wasnever could put my finger on it i never never never could put my finger on it and its the fact that i never talked about money i dont think youve ever heard mention course fee i never talked about money i myself dont have problems with money so it never occurs to to wish money problem off on anybody but somebody who is having lot of personal problems on the subject of money would of course think of money the first time somebody popped up they walk intheyre thinking of auditingso the person who has problems with money of course says to them you now have problem with money oh you want some auditing well you now have problem with money i dont care what else you were worried about youre now worried about money just gratuitously hand them problem i dont think ever in my life i even ever held out my hand for fee i dont ever mention it ive even acted sometimes as registrar for an organization that didnt have anything to do with money and people would walk in occasionally and throw some money on the desk and id invoice it so they could have receipt i gave it to them so they could have receipt not so i could have any money now thats about the wildest look you ever saw i remember auditing some people in the early days and we never talked about money and they got embarrassed after while and they gave several thousand dollars thats reverse look isnt it look why are we shutting it off because if our processing on the individual works of course hes more capable of having money but hes not more capable of having money before he has processing do you follow i mean we havewe have actually the wide open marvelous open sesame of taking joe jones any joe jones anyplace in the society and waving the magic wand and he can now make money and were worried about money well youd have to have the door closed and locked and with federal marshals outside of it and spikes and manholes and tiger traps and signs up at the other end of the avenue pointing go the other way something over the entrance say abandon ye all hope who enter here you know itd take production and i think it has i think it has taken production because this is something that never occurred to in all the days i was auditing well justjustactually yesterday afternoon i got report that they hadnt donei asked all the d of ps in the worldi do this once in whilei asked all the d of ps in the world to give reports on what they had done with clay table auditing theyre very clever people and they knew very well that that was wideopen trap in the road laid by ron because they promptly told each and every one that they were being good boyexcept one he fell inthat they were good boys and were only auditing people on the levels and so didnt have any current experience with clay table clearing but when they were running it earlier before it was laid out on levels they had the following experiences but one says well i just gave it to couple next door and they were doing it out in the yard with lot of people standing around now we know now we know we know that scientology is working out of the magnetism of this auditor cant be working out of its good sense you see scientology canis so good that you can do it wrong and get someplace thats fact fact fact you dont get very far very fast but you can often do it wrong you have to do it viciously wrong in order to not get any results i mean you have to work at that but you just slip and skid little bit and youll still get some results well im just mentioning this because they ran testone of these ds of ps had run test recentlyhe just passed it in actionbut the process had been successful because the person that it was run on had at once gone out and gotten five thousanddollarayear increase in wage this is in casual report just last nights report see well if you can do things like that why the hell are you worried about money do you realize the end of the roadi hate to tell you this because i sound like some new has student that is now selling it to his motherthe end of the road is to hold out your mockedup hand with some perfectly good twenty dollar bills in it that just appeared thats the end of the road in other words the creation direct creation of money now i dont know whether that money is counterfeit or not now an americanan american ot will have to be very careful in mocking up gold he will have to be very very careful in mocking up gold because an american is not supposed to have gold according to the united states government so i think hell have to practicmock upwell hell have tohell have to settle for diamonds only but south african ot you see will not dare mock up diamonds because the idb will be after him and there have to settle for gold and i can see right there tremendous trade developing between the american ot and the south african ot going from the ridiculous to the sublime that isthat is actually what you are facing you have the tools by which people can make money and now were going to worry about money now frankly every time an organization turns around they write income is much better these days we have just run the registrar on the debility to have money now our income is up i wonder if theres any coordination well why should they have to run the registrar on that it must be that the registrar is talking lot about money must be that the registrar is being pestered by the org to make some money and the registrar pesters everybody who walks in about some money dont you see so well leave it up to the registrar to go ahead and get the money but we wont permit the registrar anymore to interview people now you say how are you going to do that i think we will do it easier than the other way since i myself have never had the experience of registraring anything since i never found it necessary to do so we find out that that is an additive system that must have come into scientology somewhere along the line that i myself never did and i have begun to be leery over the years of duplicating something or putting something into the machinery on successful line you know which didnt need improvement and believe thethe early line on the subject of money in dianetics and scientology didnt need any improvement it was very very good indeed so it must have been something added on the line that suppressed it and it must have been our system of selling that suppressed it dont you see audience mmhm now supposing supposing we got all you who will be going home and waving the magic wand over auditors so that they auditsupposing we got all you soso streamlined and so forth that you would go ahead and audit somebody straight end of sentence you know additives you know you just audit them im going to tell you how in minute but you just audit them see and let nature take its course without any personal consideration of how the person should be checked in his forward progress or anything im being nasty now arent i ive been training students too long its soured by temper not true joke ive found actually you always did and tried like mad to do anything i asked you to do and i have to be very very careful to ask youwhen i ask you to do something to tell you very elementarily in way that can be misinterpreted dont you see because its actually the communication line which winds you up in doing something different so i very ofteni used to have system which i more or less abandoned when study came outand i think my system was very goodand that was i explained it any datum at least nine times in lecture in different ways and fashions and that way it walked around all the misunderstood words dont you see and it was quite system i used you listen to an old tape you can just almost count the number of times i have put the important datum into the tape nine timesits there its woven in and out its stated differently and that way but once in while student will get very cross with metheyve taken it down the first time in their notebook dont you see and then the next time they didnt take it down the next time they didnt take it down and they get flunked on the examination of the tape because they didnt give the generalized statement of it because its in there nine times in nine different wordings did you ever realize that that was hazard because its the concept youre being taught not the verbs and syllables and objects see but i was very successful this way but in training auditors straight up and directly why i actually have to be very careful to just make my communication clear because i find out that you are as good as i have clarified the communication to you and itscomes home to roost so i have business making crack about your doing it wrong but sometimes you will do this where i have left gap why youll throw couple of anvils in there its mybasically my fault i left gap dont you seebut once in while i will find very remarkable departures in the middle of it and ill find goofs of various kind whatsoever but they always are appearing in gaps that have been left in instruction so instruction is basically trying to cover all of it very very carefully so as not to make you feel like an idiot see so elementary that you feel idiotic in going over it that many times and yet not leaving anything out that can be left to chance and when we have had process for quite while that has been trained for quite while it is invariable done very well but when we havent had process very long why that process will be done very oddly in other words all the gaps of how you do it and all the possible misinterpretations havent been ironed out of it yet dont you see thats the difference between new process and an old process now that were in the business of relaying an awful lot of old processes nowthe new levels are just composed nothing of but old processeswhy were in clover because most of these jumps have been gotten around and if you really got too curious about how something was run why just go back over the fifteen or twenty different periods of dianetics and scientology when the same one was presented and take out the one that seemed to work for you best you know that could be gotten around to this degree because its been gone over and gone over and gone over in other words you basically do very well now in ain an approach to auditing in general if you did this if you did the processes that work on case after case after case you see and you just did those and reeled them off and got them done and you never qed andaed with somebody for instance people got remarkable idea these days that class vi auditor only audits class vi processes you see we have class vi auditor i heard an organizationi shouldnt be tooso general and say an organizationlos angeles i read letter the other day off the lines that wasnt to mesees all knows all you know and to the see all and know all you add crystal ball and quite bit of information comes my wayand this wasthis was actually stated this actually stated this was actually stated that we have class vi auditor but we dont have anything for her to do yet because nobody is ready for class vi direct quote i have the letter caow the reason the public would want class vi auditor is because hed sure know how to run class 0 in the first place class vi auditor would not run class vinot run class 0 without an emeter hed use an emeter at class 0 sounds real weird its only class 0 auditor who doesnt use an emeter at class 0 class vi auditor would use an emeter at class 0 of course only he wouldnt do anything different at class 0 but he wouldnt have any canned list in his hand hed go pocketapocketapocketa down possibilities of this and that and he would do an assessment which of course lies down there around iv and iii dont you see and hed do redhot fast assessment and hed say oh communication process oa theres the assessment bzmmmmmmmm youheres the auditing question bang thrprp clear weve had clears at level 0 run this way so class vi auditor is worth pearls dont you see because naturally hes classed all the way up the line so he can run the exact process of the level with the command of anything he has now he cant run things on the pc which the pc hasnt got command of thats the only thing thats different in other words he cant run the pc on clay table the pc doesnt have any command of clay table see he cant run the pc on the book of case remedies straight off the bat because how the hell does he know this pc can even talk do you follow he wouldnt do perception and indication steps of the environment or something like that again when he didnt know the pc could talk but the processes which are exactly found at the levels and so forth of course can be run with all the tools the auditor has to hand which is an emeter he can run them with good and bad indicators why if some guy who was educated at class vi to indicate whether or not the pc has got the wrong item certainly would never run five minutes too long on having found the wrong terminal do you see that because his indicators would be up so of course class vi auditor should get more money than class 0 auditor now of course iif i wereif i were somebodysomebody charged up to and wanted to audit them at that particular level or stage and so forth iyou want to audit you you sure all right all right ill audit you and id go ahead and audit them and id run level 0 on them ive learned my lesson its the pc that cant do it not well now after id audited them for while why he could make more money and hed pay do you follow because i know very well if iif i ran level 0 on somebodyjust straight level 0i know i wouldnt goof on the indicators or the terminals id make the right terminals and so forth run level i on somebody id run level 1 and finish all the tone arm action on level i what do you mean tone arm action on level i yeah just that doesnt have an emeter when awhen level igrade i pc is run by class i auditor you havent got an emeter there dont you see well they can make it thats whats weird dont you see dont you see that itd be an enormously faster procedure if somebody was sitting there saying all right now lets see what have we got here were going to run touch assist on you and youve got onehand electrode on the guy you see so he can point and everything what are we trying to do here something about youruhyou say you hurt your foot recently huh your foot your head you hurt your foot your head your shoulder back oh noticed when you came in your hand washand hurt your hand recently huh and the fellow said i hurt my foot and you say all right very good and what happened with your hand oh that was just beforeid forgotten about that it was just before that well its well now so why run the touch assist hed forgotten he hurt his hand do you follow you all of sudden blew memory into view im giving you very sloppy forward progress but it would just be on the basis of guiding his attention here or there while watching the needle on the meter you know very rapidly touch assist touch assist how would you do touch assist if you were class vi auditor i dont think id just do touch assist on somebody i think id look him over id find out if there are any bruises or scars to touch assist even if i didnt have meter dont you see and id also find out that it was different two sides of the body id know that probably it was hung up on one side and i just did one by the way i think last night touch assist id found out it wasnt going away indicator burn area was ceasit was not ceasing to be red in my experience it should cease to be red very rapidly it wasnt ceasing to be red so i tried to find out why well how did i try to find out why well i just wasnt getting any you might say tone arm action i didnt have the pc on the tone arm but there couldnt have been any tone arm action if the burn area was not getting well there couldnt have been any action there so i was running process with tone arm action regardless of whether i had the pc on meter or not so i look this over and i said there must be something here i dont know about there must be something the pc doesnt know about the pcs obviously in very good communication with so it isnt level 0 thats hanging up this pc you know brrrrrrrrrrrrrr know my stuff in other words you see ah well hehwhen the pc did this i wonder if the pc had withhold well heres rationale that comes from up at your next level up see heres rationale from higher level pc must have had withhold must have had something must be an overt connected with it there must be something connected with this thing yeah but how do you run this out at the lower level you cant go running what have you done what have you withheld or something like that see youre just running locational type processes well there is one thatll blow it into view if it exists all right where did it happen where are you now where did it happen where are you now where did it happen where are you now where did it happen you see point to where it happened is the exact auditing command there point to where it happened point to where you are now point see its sort of touch assist on the environment knowing the thing probably is held up on the environment and all of sudden pc tells i was hiding when i burned myself looking for an overt and found withhold you know how much withhold can you have withholding the entire body what was very remarkable is is the whole incident then blew into view i came back and finished the touch assist i flattened the tone arm action on the other process you see id already run by all the rules id taken the tone arm action out as far as it would go out on the touch assist but itdif it wasnt getting well then there must have been something wrong so the tone arm action was gone as far as i was concerned now well do something else to give it booster now well run the tone arm action out of that and when i sayusing that word tone arm action very advisedly because the pc is not on meter dont you see doing it by comm lagthree commands see or cognition pcd gotten well at that point i probably would have quit too and then come back to complete the touch assist its very remarkable the red faded out of the burn just bzzzzzzzzz but it was also held up for moment it stayed pinktoward the end it was pinkso i knew there was something here i wasnt doing and i suddenly found out i wasnt touchingit wasnt right leg left leg right leg left leg but it was back of the leg front of the leg and back of the left leg and front of the left leg it was the front of the leg where the charge was stopped you get the idea well theres also not only two sides to body but two sides to leg and there are two sides to two legs making four sides so i just ran my touch assist on fourway and boooooom and that was the end of the red spot the blister didnt entirely go but i never expect the blister to entirely disappear and what do you want for nickel miracle but the tone arm wasaction was flat the pc had come up to cognition the pc was very very cheerful and very very good in communication so we gave the pc the win and ended the session well thats quite remarkable but thats highlevel class auditing lowlevel process see you use everything you know without making the pc run something different than the pc would run at that level see quite allowable at that low level for pc to sto point where he was and point where he is thats just locational you know as long as hes pointing its objective see he isnt doing it in his skull hes doing it out here you get the idea audience mmmhm so of course class vi auditor would be worth his weight in gold at level 0 do you follow so thatsanybodythe public charging in saying oh youre class vi auditor youve got to run on gpms you say id be very glad to run you on gpms never refuse auditing it will however take you quite few intensives i must warn you at that particular stage ill be very happy to audit you on gpms and its going to take quite few intensives well how many would you say well im not prepared to say how many it would take you well itsits going to take you quite while and youve got to start in and the thing for you to do is to start in on it yes illill eventually audit gpms on you but i cant of course start with that now because youve got to go quite ways ill eventually audit gpms on you if you want to when we get there but of course you may want somebody else to by the time we get there we never know well all right all right thats all right with him oh okay now are you all set now ill have to take you to exactly what im supposed to audit on you so as to get you up to being audited in the hgc fine fine all right level 0 you follow it doesnt take forever to go up those levels might take few intensives might take saint hill course but youll eventually get to gpms now the datum that was very vital that we missed last year and that curve was thrown at us on is that the gradation program was not popular with the public ive now compared some other data and i have found out that the public whatever the public is included more people who told oh thank god i know where im going now than it did oh thats horrible you mean have to be trained some toin order to get processed in fact member of the public told so but two different people on communication lines did who themselves had opinion on it and they reported to that the public had said so and one of them attributed tremendous decline in an organization to the fact that the public didnt like the gradation program when the organization in actual fact on inspection was found not to have declined now thats the wildest one well the reason were having this tremendous emergency and moneys coming in and the telephone calls come in and people theyre so confused they cant sign up in the hgc and the reason were having this tremendous emergency up here and so forth is this gradation program and nobody can possibly understand any part of it and so forth and theyre just having an awful time and thats why were in slump and youve got to do something about this fast and last night i remembered this and i went back and looked at the graphs of that organization and that was steady continual rise through that whole period now boy thats sabotage theres place where stupidity ends and sabotage begins so there you are ive just got through checking through this on the basis of the fallacy of ever accepting rumor as the final fact rumor may be enough to cause an investigation of something but it would never be enough to cause anyto base any action or decision on rumor is something that you must never base any action or decision on because you can do more damage basing an action or decision on rumor than anything else i know of so it reduces us down to the point that weve got to operate on statistics and what are statistics statistics are particularities and we find out that an organization will cause arc breaks amongst its staff if you cant get statistic on everybody presentweek in week out statistic my god it sounds like slave factory statisticterrible you mean the letterthe letter registrar is first thing you think of oh well the letter registrar has to get out so many letters during the week and thats the statistic yes thats the statistic thats fine the letter registrars department has to get out so many letters during the week thats the statistics brother thats rumor why is it rumor because it doesnt staticize every person in the department the typing pool got out 1000 letters perfectly useless datum completely useless datum you now know nothing first place youd have to know how many they got out last week thatd beadd little meaning to it in the next place is who in the typing poolwhos the typing pool you very often find out on very ambitious org boards and so forth that one little girl is the typing pool well thats all right but shes been wrongly staticized then hasnt she shes been called the typing pool instead of letter registrars typist im afraid youd have to be able to look through the entire registration department and find the statistic on every personnel there otherwise you would start rumors and upsets and all sort of things to take gross income of an organizationthis is the way businesses runaw business i dont know how theyre alive it takes singular genius see you know to which we add little bit of scientology and we can get fabulous situation see but frankly i dont know how these businesses are here ive been writing up this sort of thing and developing the various philosophies and administrative procedures and so forth and its becoming more and more incredible to how are they here how do they live at all and the answer is they dont they dont how do people live at all they dont how does the civilization exist it doesnt unless you consider the civilization on the basis of the life of mayflywhich is just about what they have here on this planetmayfly type civilizations you see three hundred and fifty years thousand yearsgone see they usually dont even last that long see thats long civilization here on this planet on the whole tracksorry to go whole track on youbut on the whole track i was studying the org boards and so forth that i had known in going over org boards and methods of putting together org boards and lot of things like this and i suddenly remembered relatively successful org board and it had lasted for eighty trillion years and i considered that was fair that was pretty good it was galactic confederation org board and it was very nice board and then i took the board apart and find out what made the organization collapse and i found it and i found it they made provision of any kind whatsoever for the alteration or improvement of anything and there was place on their org board where anybody could suggest an improvement and that was why they collapsed eighty trillion years so that was pretty good so that must have been fair org board it actually only had one principal element missing from it it was by the way an interesting org board very interesting org board there were about two billion staff members in its central organization lot huh that was just one org that wasnt theirthat wasnt their district offices you see that wasnt their continental office or system offices or something like that you might be amused the datum on the thing that it was in projectors multieyed projectors that looked like flys eye you know flys eye with thousand lenses these things were on tracks in back of huge screen and they repeated the internal parts of the organizations schematic and thered be several of these projectors and they would interlock the image would be interlocked dont you see now if you wanted to change one of those what you did was bring it forward till there was only one of this type of unit and that was the one showing and you wrote it on the front screen and it held that in memory and you erased it on your front screen and it held it in memory on its screen and then you shoved it back on the track again and its thousand eyes would project it onto this huge screen making that one notation repeat all over the galactic system making each office the same isnt that interesting gimmickry and havingremembering this elaborate machinery and remembering what it took to make an org board and remembering how many people it took to keep one up and remembering how many communication lines were simply devoted to the org board i said im being asked to do one here on two dimensions you say whats that got to do with our org board well let tell you an org board would be good at all if it wouldnt go up to two billion staff members it wouldnt be any good at all itd be useless why because sooner or later up the line its design is going to trip the expansion of an organization might only youd get it to two hundred people before itd trip the whole expansion by having fault in it but if you could blow it up easily without confusion to two billion staff members that would be fine so i had the problem of blowing it up to two billion staff members and blowing it down to one guy and that was the problem i set myself i had one for while that could bean organization could be reduced on this org board to three people and it could go up to about hundred and fifty people and i thought that was pretty good that was more than we had and then i finally got it from one person to two billion itll slide all the way up and down without an alteration which i thought was pretty fair but galactic civilization of course had flaw in its board and so it only lasted eighty trillion years and we cant take that chance we mustnt have these germs of destruction around well thats little bit of space opera but very interesting space opera happens to be true but the mainthe main thingthe main thing that were interested in with regard to this is that if you cant staticizethat is assign the figure not to its units not to its departments or sections or groups but to the people who are therethen youre going to get some kind of an authoritarian atmosphere and theres going to be injustice and theres going to be weird things happening and people are going to be cutting each others throats and the organization is going to be tiny little bit arc broke and so forth why because its entered into generality the data is generality now if we assign as they commonly do in business the entire success of the organization to its chairman of the board or its general managerthe entire success of the businesswell only be about 70 percent right 60 percent right this guy must have had some ideas and he must have been on the ball but what about those other 30 or 40 percent well thats margin for error we could say gestetner limited is making its way very well because its managing director is theis very good man and then we go around and in some 30 or 40 percent of the time well find managing directornot of gestetner limited necessarily i dont even know manbut he spends all of his time raising cactus plants on balcony and never even reads report and we find out that gestetner limited had nothing to do with this man at all in other words theres 30 or 40 percent error that can enter into it you see if 50 60 percent of the time you see 50 60 70 percent of the time we might be able to say this we say its good ship because its got good captain see well its got errors in it its potentially false see its right often enough to almost operate and so that datum is practically worshipped in this civilization at this particular time gyah ta dya tyah tyahoh my god i mean get down and burn the incense and joss to that datum thats practically the senior administrative datum of this whole organization macarthur won the war i dont know if he did or noti was there in sort of divided frame of mind about having saved australia at the present timetheyll never quite live that down im afraid i was demanding some data the other day from melbourne and i got bunch of papers in about the inquiry i was looking for statistics by which to pick the organization up and thats what i got back i got data about the inquiry it was very useful because it said at least they were mailing things that they still knew our address oh im being cruel actually they cabled the other day on compliance so i shouldnt be too mean but i was actually expecting other things than bunch of legal papers dont you see and in theyin came all the legal papers macarthur didnt win the war he was fairly bright cookie and so on and he probably had lot on the ball but i notice he didnt win the korean war so therehe must have done something just enough wrong in world war ii so that when this showed up again in the korean war why it went by the boards and we find out what he did wrong he wasnt good politician he couldnt take mr truman and chuck him under the chin and throw him the right brand of missouri corn thats right thats right actually he was talking to man who wasnt military man who must have been incited against the whole thing before he took crack at macarthur my god here was practically americas hero number one and he mowed himtruman mowed him down well what did he do wrong well he was in an emergency called the korean war and he didnt promote thats all he probably tried to reorganize before he tried to promote i mean ifhe disobeyed condition formula ill tell you about those someday theyre very interesting see but he should have promoted he should have promoted macarthur he should have promoted the record he should have done promotion of new idea one of the ways you do that kind of thingim very well accustomed to handling political figures in some spheres and so forth i have an enviable record in this direction in some areas on the backtrackenviable absolutely guy could inspect the whole area and never learn damn thing you know and go away thinking everything was beautiful when everything was falling to pieces but it sure did keep interference because all politician can do being generally inept depending on the generality the will of the people which of course doesnt exist either this bird all heall he can peddle is interference and if youve got situation somewhat under control and its very difficult to handle it some politician coming in and interfering with things can knock it all in cocked hat in first place he doesnt know his job now if theydif theyd send you somebody who was an expert on this kind of thing you could sit there you know and you could go chitterchatter with him and get ideas and hed get ideas and youd toss them back and forth and youd come out and youd wrap this thing up dont you see that would be different proposition but so whatyoure going to get some unknowledgeable personnel around who has tremendous amountunlimited power and so forth it takes great skill yougreat skill in handling this bird and it is skill for instance you pass through the word that the pilots of his plane who also are attached to your outfit and so forth feed him the data the rumor line as he is flying along and you fix it up so the hostess or the wac that goes along there she feeds him the rumor line and your customs officers all feed him the rumor linehes all inspected the place before he ever gets there nice how well things are running in syria isnt it mr truman you know boy were sure going great guns in korea these days yessir yessir macarthur is doing good job over there isnt he mr truman public opinion whats it made out of somebodys hat give you the idea then the politician arrives and he says well im glad you got it all in hand you see as he goes around thinking hes looking at things glad you got it all in hand he knows its all well in hand because hes got his favorite liquor in his hand he goes away and does what you want in fact if you rig it right hell insist you carry outhell advise and insist upon and dream up the exact campaign which your strategists have just got off the drawing board week before he arrived hell insist on this and threaten you with courtmartial unless you do it whats all this what are we getting at here what am i talking about to you anyhow im telling you that theres troubles of various kinds arent i im trying to show you theres little problems around whats the common denominator of all these problems how does it apply to you theres great moral to be learned in all this generalities when you try to explain condition with themsee not all generalities are badbut when you try to explain condition with generalities which do not apply to parts and bits and piece particularparticularities you muck up the whole situation i mean you could muck it up at will thats what propaganda minister is in russia i know now by the way that russia is going to take the united states like the united states once took the south they got better propagandist in charge thats the wildest dopiest stuff i ever saw in my life russian walking outside of damned satellite why what is the scientific value all they did was needlessly risk mans life they should have tossed dummy out dont you see but you could have put birds in ain an airless tank or something like that how do you know that athat metal bolt head or something like that wouldnt have fractured that was holding that line and so forth well wing walkers have been known in flying circuses since world war i so they put wing walker in space it wasnt even awasnt even clever idea im afraid to my shame that i probably would have turned it down if it had been okayed by as being too stupid actually i would have turned it down on the basis that it was risking somebodys life needlessly but i probably would have come back with better one but they got better propaganda minister and theyre promoting communism and whos promoting democracy nobody mr wilson i think his name is and mr johnson i think his name isthese are rather obscure people im talking to you about who will soon be gone from history so i might as well immortalize them by mentioning them on tape greater contempt i could not think these birds are reorganizing coan economy during period of decline and according to the condition of emergency the order is promote change the things that are pulling you down economize and prepare to deliver something thats the formula for being in an emergency and both of these countries are in an emergency and theyve both forgotten to promote theyre not promoting there isnt anybody over there sayingoverseas at the present moment sayingi dont know exporting something you know rahrah big advertising program you know i beti bet the british government hasnt bought pennys worth of american tv time promotion but lot of economy crisis were having crisis all theyre doing is advertising crisis well dont gods sake our accounts departments sometime or another are just going to get into serious collision with because they every once in while tell you or tell staff member or tell somebody that they cant have that because were broke and you know that very often they say that with thousands of pounds sitting in the bank account it just isnt true its lie not only is it the wrong thing to say but its lie and in condition of emergency accountss always saying well were very poor thats the wrong thing to say because its the postulate that theyre poor and theyll get poorer if you dont want to be something dont postulate it thats all its as sensible as that and whats going to happen to you if youre broke and you owe lot of bills and you rush around to all of your creditors saying gee im awful sorry im so broke but i have couple of cents i can give you whats he going to do he gonna call up his lawyer and he gonna sue what did you do you didnt promote you advertised the crisis and this wilson up here great man great man hes done nothing but export crises thats englands primary export today is crises it inevitably lowered the pound and so forth good propagandist in the right position or good manager who really knew his business wouldnt have exported crisis hed have promoted like mad something that he could deliversomething he could eventually deliver and hed have promoted it like mad and then he would have cut downhe would have made the changes on things that had pulled him down right now and then he would take good solid look at his economy and he would have quietly put that back together again so that it worked functionally and then he would have stood there and prepared to deliver what he had promised in the promotion and thats what he would have doneone two three four bang thats the short formula by the way there is slightly longer formula that merely takes those same steps and expands them slightly thats the proper action in an emergency thatswhether its personal emergency or not doesnt matter the other thing you can do is toafter youre out of the emergency period to act like youre still in the emergency period when youre actually in another condition and apply this emergency formula to an entirely different condition that can get you in lot of trouble too the united states never does anything but apply an emergency formulato its own internal businesses and so it never of course really gets up to normal operation for the excellent reason that it never ends the emergency business firms never end the emergency they always have their salesmen on emergency programs of some kind or anotherhuge advertising budgets and that sort of thing and they never have anever have time to even out so actually what theyve adjusted to is normal emergency which drives everybody frantic and because they stay in an emergency condition after theyre actually quite capable of assuming normal operation then they actually dont expand they wonder whats all this and they never get chance to expand because in normal condition you behave quite differently quite differently you handle that with kid gloves promotions you handle with sledgehammers onthat is to say an emergency condition on promote why thats sledgehammer proposition but you dont do that in normal operating conditions you see thats the way it runs so anyway make long story short whats the longwhats the long and short of the difficulties in which people have whats thewhats this add up to whats this have anything to do with well it has to do with have to know whats going on and you never can really find out whats going on with the mass of something you can only find out whats going on with the individual bits of something because if mass is not related to anything but the mass then you never understand anything about it because it hasnt anything bigger and it hasnt anything smaller and it doesnt have anything anything so its just mess when the russian starts talking about the people if he starts to talk about the masses watch it boy watch it now he can of course compare the masses of russia to the masses of the united states dont you see why i dont know how you compare the mass of bunch of russians to the mass of bunch of americans except you can put them all in opposite colored but similar uniforms with similar weapons in their hands have them shoot at each other then you could figure it out and thats the net result of talking about the maaaaasses so anyway seems to be theres something wrong with this thing called generalization generality is very general term for generalization you generalize something that can be particularized as to its condition and you get in trouble now we in actual fact have found certain principles that men have in common and this is quite remarkable but thats only because we have studied the unit man you get what weve done and actually when i saywhen i say men i mean thetan plus body in this universe you see and its its characteristics are dont you see and to the degree that this is deadon and so forth this person with certain characteristics which are just those characteristics sit down across from you in the pcs chair and you utter certain auditing commands to that person and that person promptly responds and improves because this is because we know person do you follow that now the closer we get the closer we get to know that personhe isnt the average personhe couldnt be anything else but that person because thetan is that thing and body is that thing so to this degree we could generalize but look how wrong you could get in generalizing on the character of man itd have to be the character of an individual one of the things very interesting is scientologists who attempt to approach groups to do anything with the groups with scientology quite normally fall on their faces but you can approach almost any individual with scientology and bang well there are two reasons for this and one of them scientology is not study of maaaaasses it is study of the guy you see and we know what the map of this bird isright there but now lets make generality about generalities understanding that and we find something very interesting we find that only an arc break can worsen graph there are two data one is that if graph is unchanging there was ptppresent time problem is what keeps graph from changing this has been observed over and over many times and so forth i first observed it in 1955 in washington dc you dont get any graph change in this pchis iq doesnt go up doesnt go down nothing happens on the thing hes got present time problem and if the pcs graph worsens the only thing that can worsen pc in auditing so that his graph worsens markedly during processing is an arc break you already knew those two data but that means that of ptps and arc breaks it must be that the arc break is really bit more important than the ptp and yet oddly enough until recently we didnt know anything much about it except it was bypassed charge and it was this and it was that yes we knew its mechanisms concerning this and we knew those mechanisms were in common but we didnt exactly know precisely and bing what an arc break was an arc break is generality that should be particularity now you see theres nothing wrong with saying generality see it is that it is substituting generality for particularityand thats an arc break now you can go in reverse and substitute particularity for generality and youll get an arc break too so its this both ways doesits the same meaning dont hang up on that and thats all an arc break is its substituting generality that should beive written this up in bulletin i havent really stated it quite that well in the bulletin itll serve but youre liable to get hung up and say well when sun shines skies are blue thats generality well it isnt that kind of generality theres nothing wrong about that because it shouldnt be particularity as matter of fact itd be quite false to say when the sun shines only this sky above us is blue thats not right so theres nothing really wrong with generality im just adding that to the bulletin content that you will get shortly but its generality that should be particularity or particularity that should be generality now whats particularity well just call it single it was single it was called many see now reversewise youd think there was many that was called singlewould reverse it dont you see it was many that was called single and so forth because you so seldom run into that that you can practically neglect it and the one that youll be working with and so forth is the generality which should be particularity and thats what causes the arc break bang and the reason you dont carry arc breaks well in your fellow student is you just dont ask that next question you shortaudit it all the time you would have discovered this if youd asked the question about two or three times more and if youd known exactly what question to ask and how to ask it but you just stop short you never found the bypassed charge let give you an idea oh im all upset and soandso and soandso all right what are you upset about the instructors are mean to all right that reads on the meter im indicating to you the bypassed charge youre arc broken because the instructors mean to you the instructors mean to you all right the guy says yeah yeah you feel better now oh yeah theyre sure mean to you feel much better oh yeah jeez damn em youve seen this havent you next day hes not there hes blown or something well you eitheryou have to come to two conclusions now either arc break finding doesnt work and its not possible to find an arc break which some people stupidly come to the conclusion onwell i shouldnt use the word stupidlysillily or that you didnt find the bypassed charge one or the other and unless you knew the exact character of the bypassed charge you could still occasionally miss so youd think there wasntthere was something else wrong besides this thing called an arc break and you could still make difficulty with it dont you see that thing thats missing is that there was particularity there that was into generality it was being falsely called generality and that was what it did and if youd ask him the next questionyou see this is what i mean by short auditing himyou said well i have an arc break and that reads on the meter and the instructors are mean to you see the onethe example i just gave you shorthanding it if youd ask him who is the instructors sounds like weird english construction doesnt it and it is itsthis is the trick you have to know its very easy to do because its just relaxing and qandaing but its who see who is who is the instructors it isnt even good english you see and theyd say uh its pete well that reads and so forth and if you went into your song and dance all right youre arc broken because of pete you see hed yeah hed say yeah thats sure right ill go and find him and knock his head off thats what ill do youve just shortquestioned it you havent found it yet but youve reduced instructors to instructor now what does instructor represent and you ask this question again whatever it was well has some instructor said something to you usually ask it like that you see or has some instructor failed to answer you or something like this you see oh its not the instructors its the students bang it reads the auditor all right who is the students pc says its agnes hehheh id forgotten completely she said i was lousy auditor yesterday by the way lets go outside for smoke shall we this is the kind of response you get and youll for the first time some of you will see an arc break just fade magically before your view and this is the wildest magic you ever saw anything of now one of the things thats interesting is youd think itd work in reverse and you say what generality has been uttered see im sureim going to have to say this because somebodys going to come up with it and do it thatsim sure and the person being asked that question of course is just into the dispersal of anybody who has ever pulled generality on him and he just goes bzeee and he cant see anybody you follow people who are around saying everybody theythese wild generalities and so forthyou should do this as drill dont ever try to audit anybody on it because its murderous just ask somebody who says they who uses generalities who says everybody any such question and youll see the person because oddly enough the person has uttered dispersal you see he can always find somebody eventually but dont expect to be tremendously relieved because that person is probably generality in the mind you see of the person who did utter the generality and it probably isnt it again you follow but itthis doesnt work well when you say well this persons arc broken at home all the time all right who uses they who uses everybody this is the indicated procedure dont you see as itand it doesnt work because its too cottonpicking general generalities are too general on the track and you just asked this bird to face up to his whole bank going straight back to vi because what is basically wrong with vi all the gpms are generalities you didnt expect that one did you thats why people arc break so hard on r6 it doesnt say whos supposed to be this way or anything else see but main thing wrong with it it probably wouldnt arc break anybody then if they werent reverse generalities that one really couldnt believe theyre entheta generalities these things theyre not to be pleasant and sweet and be good girlthe type of goal we used to find on some pcs here of course its to be nasty bee that would be more in keeping not to use end words on you be blank now i dont want to swear on this tape because some young man might hear it you girls you can generally absorb that kind of conversationdont want to corrupt any young men anyway the main point here is that you have fantastic weapon in your hands for clearing up an arc break now just exactly how this produces such cataclysm i leave up to you to watch i wont try to describe all the mechanics of it ill just tell you thats the mechanicthat somebody should have used particularity and they used generality and this just arc broke the living godfrey out of this pc ill give you an idea of typical arc break the instructors tell that theyre going to put you on special unit to catch up because youre doing so badly the guy sort of caves in and its all right with him and he goes off and hes not quite sure whats happened to him he feels kind of bad about it but well person who will do that sort of thing is probably in the first place telling lie and probably nobodys mentioned it but the reverse side of the coin is if the person did say it it must have been from one instructor we cant remember four instructors or something like that all standing up in row dont you see all saying this at the same time even if all the instructors were present it would have had to have been one instructor dont you see so the thetan hearing this of course gets an insight into the fact that its impossible and while receiving it because its startling also resists it because its impossible do you see usually it violates his good sense there are lot of other little factors mixed up in it but it takes that particularitygenerality thing to trip it off you find theres normally entheta tied up in itthe degree of the arc break has to do with that its how frequent this occurred you know there are lot of other little factors but they measure intensity just the intensity of the break they dont measure the mechanics of it the mechanics are just the generality which should have been particularity now person who loses things and this also solves loss produces the reverse side of this coin which is the only other reverse side of the coin and that is when you lose pen and you cant find it it might be anywhere and so becomes generality so single pen is then generality so its generality you see which should be particularand trying to find this generality and so on one of the ways to cure yourself of an arc break by the way is remember that it can only be in one place matter how lost it is it can only be in one place its quite remarkable observation when you come right down to it it didnt become hundred billion pens just because it got lost but that is the trick the mind plays on one at such moment girl disappears guy longer sees girl now this girl might be anywhere and thats why its an arc break its not even that the girl is gone as matter of fact if you questioned him closely sometimes you find out that is quite relief but its where is she do you follow so you find that most people after theyve had breakup in their love life or something like that will develop colds and that is the direct mechanism of the lost item its an everywhere that should be particularity see so when you take particularity and make it into an everywhere when you take particularity and make it that way why you get an arc break because its lie of course and when you take this particularity that should be there and it all by itself becomes an everywhere why its againdifferent type of lieso person arc breaks and all youuns got to do as an auditor is find thatun now on r6 it is enough to sayafter you found itthat itsgpmits just bypassed charge an end word or something like that it isnt whether or not the pc can or cant remember it or anything of the sort you get the pc trying to remember itsomebody out in chicago was terribly arc broken because of the last three minutes of one of my tapes and the auditorhe was calling up washington trying to get copy of the tape to find out what the end word was on it so that he could cure the arc break well now if theyd spotted it that would have been that they wouldnt have to have known what the end word was theyd have to push his nose back into it to find out whatit was unimportant what it was if that had been the charge that caused the arc break all hed have to do is say all right it was the last three minutes of the tape thatd have been the end of that see boom you follow audience yep yes it would have gone so the test of what was the bypassed charge is when it is located does itthe pc cheer up you see thats the only test of whether or not it was the bypassed charge so having to find more about it you see immediately tells you you havent found the bypassed charge more about the bypassed charge that you have found see if you dont follow it in on the particularity and finally find the particularity that it was why itll continue to be an arc break well this is very happy view so just press it home just little further and ask your questions to turn those generalities into particularities and learn this little gag youll have bulletin out on this in the next day or so my bulletin lines little behind but the particularity find what the particularity was and you say who is the instructors see who is everybody see because youre using sort of q and toa repeater technique from dianetics if you pleaseto get the generality repeated at least once to the person so you use it back at him again its very nasty but youre in an arc break and youre not auditing anyhow so of course q and is perfectly normal and let assure you let assure you this if it isnt quite magical in the way it knocks apart arc breaks if it doesnt knock apart your pcs arc break then please look over the whole subject of particularities again and generalities and so forth and go over it real carefully because you must have missed something thisll cure an arc break in crosseyed mule this would even cure wilsons arc breaks thats right right marvelous so you wont have any trouble using that just remember what its mechanics are well all the rest of this is is the staticizing of life if you dont find out exactly what is going on in life if you cant assign values to the particular parts of life and if you cant take look at what joe is doing that is different in his production and so forth than pete why youre liable to get into sort of an arc breaky generalized condition about life and not really know very much about it while thinking you know great deal our whole observation is based upon what are the characteristics of thetani wish to point that out to youand on top of that he can build the wildest generalities you ever heard of but weve got him right where the chassis sits so then it is for us safe to indulge in these things about thetan see this is the thetan or thetanthe generalities about people and masses dont go thank you
