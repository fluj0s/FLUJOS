particularly significant in light of the5 fourth circuits reliance on lopez where the supreme court determined for the first time in sixty years that federal statute exceeded congressional power under the commerce clause in lopez the supreme court adjusted the judiciarys traditional approach t o6 commerc clause analysis maintaining that while the history of commerce claus jurisprudence represented an expansive interpre tation of federal commerce clause power the judiciary maintained the ability to enforce limits on that power specifically at issue7 was whether 18 usc 922q federal statute prohibiting the possession of firearm on school grounds exceeded congressional uthority arguing that the statute was valid exercise of commerce clause power the government contended that the possession f guns in school zones had serious impact on interstate commerce by leading to violen t crime and plethora of other social ills addressing these arguments chief justic rehnquist discussed the judici ally enforceable limits of the commerce clause delineating three categories of activity which come within its ambit first congress possesses th authority to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce second congres s may regulate the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce finally congress may also regulate activ ities which have substantial relation to and effect on interstate commerce8 in applying these standards to t he case before it the supreme court determined that 922q was neither regulation of the instrumentalities or channels of interstat commerce making the determination of the case hinge on the substantial effects test9 in conducting its analysis under this category the court identified four major problem s with the regulation at issue first it was determined that 922q was criminal statute which by its terms had connection with comme rce or any sort of economic enterprise and did not play an essential role in larger regulatory scheme secondly the suprem court also found it significant that there was juris dictional element in the statute which would ensure that firearm possession affected interstate commerce in particular case third the court stated that t he lack of congressional findings regarding the impact of the offense on the national economy detracted from any substantial relation it might have to interstate commerce finally the court held that if regulation based on such expansive reasoning was upheld it would convert congressional authority under the commerc clause to general police power of the sort retained by the states determining that10 the substantial effects doctrine delineated in lopez was controlling the fourth circuit in brzonkala first noted that 13981 could not be classified as regulation of economi c activity in particular the court explained that the statute does not regulate th manufacture transport or sale of goods the provision of services or any other sort ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20237crs3 id at 83411 id at 83412 id at 83413 id at 83514 id at 83515commercial transaction furthermore the court stated that like other forms of violence such as robbery gendermotivated violence is not even economic in any meaningfu l sense the court also determined that 13981 lacks sufficient connection with an particular identifiable economic enterprise or transaction to illustrate this point the11 court compared the provisi on to the freedom of access to clinic entrances act of 1994 which regulates protests of abortion cli nics specifically the court noted that control over the dynamics of abortion protests was directly linked with the operation of clinics tangible economic activity according to the court 13981 did not possess simila r connection with any economic activity the court went on to stress that the statut possessed an even more tenuous connection to interstate commerce than did 18 usc 922q in that while the proper functioning of schools might be seen as closely related to commerce violence arising from gender animus lacks even meaningful connection with any specific activity that might arguably be considere d economic or commercial in the loosest sense the court also determined that the statute could not be supported as part12 of larger regulatory scheme which would suffer absent regulation of intrastate gende r violence specifically the fourth circuit held that the federal patchwork of anti discrimination laws could not be construed as implementing cohesive regulatory scheme geared towards commercial or economic activity clarifying this position the cour t13 explained that 13981 could not be logically associated with other antidiscriminatio n statutes due to the fact that it addressed gendermotivated violence in all contexts providing cause of action against an alleged viol ent actor the court determined that this dynamic conflicted with title vii of the civil rights act which provides only for remedy against gender discrimination in the work place and targets the employer s opposed to specific offenders this partial and occasional overlap belied any cohesiv scheme according to the court and supported conclusion that each statute was written without regard for the concerns that animate the other14 finally the court further held that even if 13981 could be construed as part of larger regulatory scheme it would nonet heless be invalid under lopez as the statute itself had relation to economic activity the court explained that lopez did not authorize the regulation of activity lacking ny meaningful economic nexus simply because it is part of regulatory schem that also regulates economic activity in certain respects illustrating this maxim the fourth circuit pointed to the lopez courts affirmance of wickard v filburn where the supreme court ruled that the federal government could regulate the production of wheat for private intrastate use as such local activities could in th aggregate substantially affect interstate commerce in particular the fourth circui t explained that while the regulation at issue was quite broad it nonetheless possessed significant connection to economic activity15 in contrast according to the court 13981 did not possess any connection with an economic enterprise or activity and like 922q was statute unrelated to commerce or any form of economic enterprise the court further declared that the statute was eve n more tenuously related to commercial activity than the law at issue in lopez stressing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20237crs4 id at 83616 id at 83617 id at 839 18 id at 83919 id at 84020supreme courts statement that to determine otherwise would divest the word s commerce and economic of any real meaning as such the fourth circuit refused to uphold 13981 on the basis that it p ossessed an insufficient economic nexus under lopez turning to the second prong of the lopez analysis the fourth circuit noted tha t 13981 lacked an express jurisdictional element which would ensure its application to offenses with tangible connection to or effect on interstate commerce in particular the court explained that whereas the criminal provisions of the violence against women act hinged upon the crossing of state lines or some other explicit connection to interstat commerce 13981 included such standard furthermore the court stressed that the language of the statute could not possib ly be construed to constitute such jurisdictional element 16 the fourth circuit next address ed the argument that 13981 was justified in light of the fact that gendermotivated violence leads to higher medical costs and discourage s economic interaction in areas and fields seen as susceptible to such violence thereb inhibiting productivity and reducing the demand for interstate products concluding that17 the essence of the argument was identical to th at deemed unacceptable in lopez the court refused to accept such reasoning noting that such basis for regulation would imbu congress with the power to regulate almost any activity matter how trivially related to commerce to clarify this position the fourth circuit explained that the economi c impact of gendermotivated violence is only characteristic of the effect of any seriou s problem on interstate commerce specifically judge luttig stated that the effects f gender violence were qualitatively identical to violence in schoo ls violent crime generally and many other less visible though still signifi cant problems all of which result in the loss of productivity and an ultimate although indirect negative impact on the nationa l economy and presumably interstate commerce18 acknowledging that cases such as wickard were premised on sweeping an d permissive reasonin g relying upon an analysis of the aggregate effects of entire classes of activities and indulging in attenuated chains of inferences to establish substantia l effect on interstate commerce the fourth circuit stressed that lopez precluded such an approach in the present case as 13981 targeted noneconomic activity clarifying this19 distinction the fourth circuit explained that lopez established that while genera l regulatory sta tutes with substantial relation to commerce could employ such aggregate reasoning such an approach could not be used to uphold statutes with relation t commer ce or any sort of economic enterprise according to the fourth circuit such piling of inferences based upon the fact that gendermotivated violence in the aggregate has an attenuated though real effect on the economy would remove all limits on federal authority giving congress an unconstitutional general police power20 expanding upon this observation the fourth circuit noted that to allow suc h regulation of noneconomic activity would enable federal regulation of any significan thttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20237crs5 id at 840 quoting lopez 514 us at 583 kennedy j concurring21 id

effect of this intrusion according to the court would be21 to provide civil remedy for actions already proscribed by state criminal and tort law upsetting the balance between state and federal criminal authority and ultimatel effectuating reallocation of state and federal judicial and law enforcement resources22 as further evidence of 13981s intrusion into traditional state law the fourth circui t noted that under vawa civil remedy could lie regar dless of whether the act in question resulted in the filing of crim inal charges prosecution or conviction establishing federal remedy for acts state might choose to ave unpunished for reasons of state criminal law policy prosecutorial discretion or state tortlaw policy 23 the court also held the act usurped traditional state functions by disregarding th limits of state criminal and civil law purportedly in response to the states failure t enforce their criminal and tort laws against gendermotivated violent criminals specifical ly the fourth circuit found it significant that in addressing this asserted failure of state justice systems the ct targeted violent actors as opposed to providing remedy against deficient states and their officers as would valid civil rights statute the effect of this dynamic according to the court was to encroach upon the states ability t determine when and how violent crimes will be punished as well as to blur the boundary between federal and state responsibility for the deterrence and punishment of suc h crime as such the fourth circuit explained that citizens of various states would not24 be able to ascertain readily whether state or the federal government should be hel d accountable for failing to properly address claim of gendermotivated violence 25 the fourth circuit then explained further that 13981 was targeted primarily t domestic violence which has been traditionally regulated by the states withou t congressional intervention focusing on the strong state tradition of regulating suc h26 offenses the court again declared that if the regulation was upheld 13981 woul d minimize the importance of state policies related to gender violence and result in n essentially limitless congressional power the court then discussed the importance of27 congressional findin gs regarding the effects of gendermotivated violence on the national economy and interstate commerce whi noting that the legislative expertise of congress is entitled to degree of deference the fourth circuit stressed the supreme court s declaration in lopez that simply because congress may conclude that particula r activity substantially affects intersta commerce does not necessarily make it so rather accordi ng to the court legislative findings serve to clarify the relationship between th regulation at issue and interstate commerce with the stitutionality of the law ultimately hinging on the legal aspects of the substantial effects doctrine 28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20237crs6 id at 85029 see note 5 supra30 id at 91291331 id at 91332 id at 91633 id at 917 91992034applying this maxim the fourth circuit held that the congressional findings made in support of 13981 were constitutionally insuffic ient specifically the court explained that while voluminous findings were made regarding the deleterious economic effects f violence against women there was information differentiating the impact of gender motivated violence from general acts of violence against women indeed the fourt h circuit determined that the only congressional findings addressing the effects of gender motivated violence in particular consis ted of two conclusory statements by the house and senate asserting generally that gendermotivated violence substantially affects interstate commerce considering the nature of such statements the fourth circuit explained that even accepting their accuracy as factual matter the congressional findings could not be accepted as sufficient legal conclusion that gendermotivated violence substantiall affects insterstate commerce29 the dissent written by judge motz and joined by three other judges on the court disagree d with the majoritys application of lopez citing factors deemed sufficient b other courts to uphold 13981 on commerce clause grounds ju dge motz maintained that the majoritys refusal to defer to the congressional findings was improper specifically30 the dissent maintained that proper interpretation of lopez would require court defer to congressional findings which possessed rationa l basis upon analyzing the legislative31 findings made by congress the dissent maintained that sufficient showing of th substantial effect that genderb ased violence has on interstate commerce and the national economy had been made irrespective of the majoritys hol ding that the findings illustrated only the effect of general violence on women and the economy the dissent furthe r32 argued that the regulation was justified as such violence could rationally be considered as detrimental to the economy as the activity at question in wickard v filburn the dissent33 went on to fault the majoritys determination that valid commerce clause regulatio n must regulate economic activity possess jurisdictional element or bear meaningfu l connection with an eco nomic activity specifically the dissent maintained that the effects identified in the legislative findings supported commerce clause based regulation under lopez arguing that the mere fact that an effect becomes general does not render i t insufficiently substantial 34 compared with the arguments of the dissent and the contrary hol dings of other courts addressing t he issue the majoritys exhaustive opinion in brzonkala belies fundamental differenc of opinion regarding the scope of congressional power under the commerc clause given such differing interpretations regarding the validity of 13981 it seem s inevitable that the supreme court will addr ess the issue thereby clarifying the effect of its decision in lopez
