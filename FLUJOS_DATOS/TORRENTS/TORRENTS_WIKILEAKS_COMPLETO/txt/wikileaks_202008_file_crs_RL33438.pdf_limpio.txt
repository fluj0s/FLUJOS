firms value added for product is th increase in the value of that product caused by the application of the firms factors of production vat on product would be levied at all stages of production of that product vats differ in their tax treatment of purchases of cap ital plant and equipment the type of vat used by developed countries termed consump tion vat treats firms purchases of plant and equipment the same as any other purchase firms net vat liability is usually calculated by using the credit method according to this method firm determines its gross tax liability by multiplying its sales by the vat rate then the firm computes its net vat liability by subtracting vat paid on purchases from other firms from the firms gross vat liability in contrast to vat nst would be federal consumption tax collected only at the retail level by vendors nst would equal set pe rcentage of the retail price of taxable goods and services retail vendors would collect the nst and remit tax revenue to the federal gove rnment both vat and nst are frequently assumed to be ultimately paid by consumers for calendar year 2005 it is estimated broadbased vat or nst w ould have raised net reve nue of approximately 50 billion for each 1 levied the operating differences between consumption vat and nst have important policy implications on the one hand the administrative cost of vat would exceed that of nst because vat would require more information to be reported and audited also an opportunity exists for nst to be collected jointly with state sales taxes but federal vat offers readily available joint collection possibilities vat would require more time to implement than nst because vat is more complicated covers more firm s and is new tax method on the other hand consumption vat with the credit method more easily excludes inputs from double taxation than does nst consum ption vat would be easier to enforce than nst it is in the selfinterest of firm to have accura purchase invoices so that it can obtain full credit for prior vat paid tax authorities can double check the accuracy of the vat remitted by any firm because data are collected from producers at all levels of pr oduction for given year vat could have broader base than nst because vat is easier to enforce vat may be less visible to consumers than nst vat is levied at all st ages of production and policymakers have the option of not requiring the amount of vat to be shown on retail sales receipts as of february 1 2008 the following bills concerning nst or vat have been introduced hr 25 s

valueadded tax contrasted with national sales tax introduction in congress both value added tax and national sa tax have been proposed by members in the taxreform debate as replacement taxes for part or all of the nations current income tax system1 in addition there is congressional interest in using consumption tax to finance national health care2 both the vat and the nst are taxes on the consumption of goods nd services and are conceptually similar3 yet these taxes also have significant differences this report discusses some of the potential policy implications associated with these differences4 concept of valueadded tax the value added of firm is the differe nce between firms sales and firms purchases from all other firms5 in other words firms value added is simply the amount of value that firm contributes to good or serv ice by applying its factors of production land labor capita l and entrepreneurial ab ility valueadded tax is tax levied at each stage of production on firms net value added types of vats there are three types of vats they differ in their tax treatment of purchases of capital inputs plant and equipment the consumptiontype vat treats capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33438crs2 6 for comprehensive explanation and analysis of methods to calculate vat see value added tax methods of calculation by james m bickley crs general distribution memorandum available from the author 7 an exception is the final retail stage where policymakers have the option of including or excluding the vat from the retail sales slip purchases the same way as the purchase of any other input the equivalent to expensing under an income tax the other two types of vats are the income vat and the gross product vat under the income vat the vat paid on the purchases of capital inputs is amortized c redited against the firms vat liability over the expected lives of the capital inputs under the gross product vat deduction for the vat on purchases of capita l inputs is allowed against the firms vat liability the consumption vat is the only type of vat that is used in developed nations nd has been proposed for the united states consequently the consumption vat is contrasted with the nst in this report methods of calculating vat there are three alternative methods of calculating vat the credit method the subtraction method nd the addition method6 under the creditinvoice method firm would be required to show vat separately on all sales invoices7 each sale would be marked up by the amount of the vat sales invoice for seller is purchase invoice for buyer firm would calculate the vat to be remitted to the government by threestep process fi rst the firm would aggregate vat shown on its sales invoices second the firm w ould aggregate vat shown on its purchase invoices finally aggregate vat on purch ase invoices would be subtracted from aggregate vat shown on sales invoices and the difference remitted to the government the creditinvoice method is calculated on transactions basis under the subtraction method the firm calculates its va lue added by subtracting its cost of taxed inputs from its sales ne xt the firm determines its vat liability by multiplying its value added by the vat rate most flat tax proposals are modified subtraction method vats under the addition method the firm calculates its value added by adding all payments for untaxed inputs eg wages and profits next the firm multiplies its value added by the vat rate to calculate vat to be remitted to the government the creditinvoice method is used by 28 of 29 oecd nations with vats tax economists differ in their classifications of the japanese vat both the credit invoice and the subtraction methods have b een discussed for the united states the prevailing view of economists is that th creditinvoice method is superior this method requires registered firm s to maintain detailed reco rds that are cross indexed with supporting documentation vat show n on the sales invoice of one firm is the same as the vat shown on the purchase or der of another firm hence the credit invoice method allows tax auditors to cro ss check the records of firms also each firm has vested interest in insuring that the vat shown on its purchase orders is not understated so the firm can receive full credit against vat liability for vat previously paid thus the creditinvoice thod would seem to be easier to enforcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33438crs3 8 william g gale and c eugene steuerle tax policy solutions p 113 available at

creditinvoice method is probably the only feasible method if there are to be multiple tax rates national sales tax national sales tax nst would be federal consum ption tax collected only at the retail level by vendors the nst w ould equal set percen tage of the retail price of taxable goods and services re tail vendors would collect the nst and remit tax revenue to the federal government buyer of intermediate products that is inputs used to produce goods and services would register and receive an exemption certificate this buyer would present the exemption certificate to the seller and thus would be exempt from paying the retail sales tax the retail price of good or service equa ls the sum of value added at all stages of production consequently valueadded tax and na tional sales tax with the same tax rate and ta x base would yield the same am ount of revenue the operating assumption of policymakers and economists is that both taxes are fully shifted forward onto consumers that is the price to the consumer increases by the full amount of the tax wi lliam g gale of br ookings and c eugene steuerle of the urban institute estimate that each percentage point of vat could generate revenue equivalent to 04 of gross domestic product8 for calendar year 2005 us gross domestic product was 125 trillion9 thus for 2005 according to the galesteuerle estimate us vat of 5 would ve generated 250 b illion in revenue policy implications the operating differences between vat and nst have many important policy implications in eight areas administrative cost joint tax collections avoiding double taxation of intermediate goods and services enforcement broadness of tax base time required to implement visibility and experiences of other nations administrative costs under vat all firms would have to re port tax information and collect taxes under nst firms without retail sales would not report or collect taxes but the substantial majority of all firms would collect the nst since they have some retail sales under vat with credit method of collection each firm must keep invoices on all sales and purchases from other firms and these invoices would be subject to audit by tax authorities hence the valueadded tax would require more informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33438crs4 10 for an examination of the administrative costs of vat see sijbren cnossen administrative

and udited than national sales tax and conse quently vat would likely be more expensive to administer than nst10 joint tax collection since 45 states and the district of co lumbia have general sales taxes an opportunity exists for nst to be coll ected jointly with state sales taxes11 federal vat could not be jointly collected with stat sales taxes states could convert their sales taxes to vat with the federal tax base but this is unlikely since it would require that the states establish entir ely new tax systems consequently administrative costs saving would be expected from vat therefore the collection costs of vat can be expected to be higher than nst avoiding double taxation of intermediate goods and services double taxation occurs if an input is taxe d at the time of purchase and then tax is levied on the same input again when it b ecomes part of the output of the firm consumption vat with the credit method of tax computation easily excludes inputs from taxation the exclus ion of i nputs from nst would be more difficult usually firms buying inputs would have to provide sellers with exemption certificates before making their purchases at the state level procedures to exempt input purchases from state retail sales taxes ve worked imperfectly it is therefore reasonable to expect that excluding inputs from taxation would be more difficult with nst than with vat enforcement with vat firm would have financia l interest in ensuring that amounts of vat paid on input purchases are accurately reported on its purchase invoices since the firm could receive credits against its vat liability in addition the vat would provide the tax authorities with an opport unity to crosscheck the amount of vat collected because data are gathered from producers at different stages of production nonetheless some enforcement problems do exist with vat for example firms at different stages of production could coll ude to falsify invoices but the nst lacks both the selfenforcing procedure and th crosschecking opportunity of the vat hence better compliance is expected from vat than with nst12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33438crs5 13 for an analysis of the tax base for valueadded tax see crs report rs22720 taxable base of the valueadded tax by maxim shvedov 14 cnossen vat and rst comparison pp 593595 15 alan tait valueadded tax interna tional practice and problems washington international monetary fund 1988 p 357 16 ibidbroadness of tax base because of the potential for better enforcement of vat it may be possible to levy vat on more goods and services than nst13 this view is supported by the fact that vats of european nations on th average are levied on more goods and services than most state sales taxes in the united states14 for given revenue yield tax economists prefer broad tax base because the tax rate needed to raise given amount of revenue is lower lower tax rates reduce economic distortions and thus raise economic efficiency thus if vat has broader base then nst then it would be more efficient because lower tax rate would be needed to raise given amount of revenue time required to implement vat would take more time to implement than nst because vat is more complicated and would cover more firms than nst also business executives are not familiar with this form of taxation he nce the us government would face the need to conduct an educational campaign visibility the valueadded tax may be less visible to consumers than national sales tax policymakers and economists assume that 100 of both the vat and the nst are passed onto consumers but the percepti ons of many consum ers may be different about vat many consumer s may believe that vat ta x would at least partially fall on firms because the vat is collected at each stage of production since the nst is levied only at the retail level consumers may more readily believe that they would pay the entire tax furthermore po licymakers have the option as to whether the amount of vat should be stated on retail sales receipts15 new zealand gives each retailer the option of whether or not to explicitly state the amount of vat on its retail sales receipts16 the amount of nst would be explicitly stated on sales receipts the lower visibility of the vat relative to the nst may be either desirable or undesirable depending on ones political ideology it can be argued that taxes should be visible so that the costs of taxation may be compared with the benefits of government spending conversely it can be argued that people generally do not like the idea of paying taxes consequently in this view to finance public sector responsibilities it is bette r to have taxes seem as painless as possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33438crs6 17 cnossen vat and rst comparison p 583

has been the most important development in taxation over the last halfcentury limited to less than 10 countries in th late 1960s it has now been implemented by about 136 countries and in these c ountries including oecd member countries it typically accounts for onefifth of total tax revenue the recognized capacity of vat to raise revenue in neutral and transparent manner drew all oecd member countries except the unite d states to adopt this broad based consumption tax20 policy insights can be obtained by exa mining the experiences of other nations however just because other nations exhibit specific tax policy does not necessarily mean that it is appropriate for the united states to adopt this policy legislation in the 110th congress as of february 1 2008 eight bills have been
