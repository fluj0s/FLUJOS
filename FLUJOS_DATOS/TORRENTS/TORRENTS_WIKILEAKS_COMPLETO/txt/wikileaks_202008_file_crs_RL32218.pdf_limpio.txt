activities pria 2 retained the same proportional distribution for work er protection but increased the minimum to not less than 1 million63 among its efforts to enhance the re gistration process epa reported that recommendations from several intraagency workgroups led to the development of pesticide registration procedures for fronte nd processing and screening waivers and refunds f unds management improved intra and interagency coordination and enhancements to the internal registration tracking system epa also created process improvement workgroup under the auspices of the pesticide

from individual registrant companies pesticide trade associations pub lic interest groups and agency staff and it continues to address process improvement ques tions based in part on recommendations from the committee the agency continued to develop new process improvements during fy2007 and to refine those initiated during previous fiscal years epa continues to focus on several areas identified

accomplishing the periodic review of registrations the goal of these regulations shall be review of pesticides registration every 15 years such periodic review is necessary to determine if all registered pesticides continue to meet the statutory standard of unreasonable adverse effects taking into account changes in scientific capabilities for assessing risk as well as changes in policies

reregistration and tolerance reassessment programs which are nearly completed epa has indicated that as of june 19 2008 there are 722 registration review cases comprising 1135 active ingredients72 the majority of these review cases are conventional pesticides 473 cases and 630 active ingredients but also include antimicrobial pesticides biochemical pesticides and microbial pesticides to meet its goal of reviewing each registered pesticide every 15 years epa anticipates it will require decisions on at least 45 cases more than 70 pesticide active ingredients annually epa initiated imple mentation of registration review in early fy2007 opening 23 registration review case dockets by the end of the fiscal year according to the published registration review schedule for the next four years fy2008 through fy2011 epa planned to open 45 cases in fy2008 and roughly 70 pesticide dockets annually beginning in fy200973 the agency anticipates that it will continue at this annual pace through fy2017 so that mo st of the currently registered pesticides will have dockets opened by the end of that fiscal year with the exception of certain biopesticide dockets which are expected in fy2018 through fy2020 conclusion epas timely completion of the statut ory registration re registration and tolerance assessment require ments for pesticides has been concern for some members of congress epa industry nd public interest groups historically attempts to defray the increased costs of administering the pesticide program by modifying existing pesticide fee requirements through regulation and legislation have not been entirely successful the pesticide registration improvement renewal act or pria 2 pl 11094 enacted october 9 2007 reauthorized and re vised fee provisions enacted january 23 2004 pl 108199 pria 1 pria 2 continue d to address some of the key issues and concerns regarding epas pesticide re gistration reviews most notably the provisions requiring specific decision process and schedul reforms in conjunction with increased fee revenues have led to more timely completion of certain registration applications and the completion of the reregistration reviews reforming the overall process has led to accelerated implementation of stricter fqpa standards and associated improvements in the safety of pesticides in the market it has also contributed to the availability of new pr oducts potentially safer and more effective into the market sooner the prescriptive detailed schedules for the service fees included in pria 1 and pria 2 have been more commensurate w ith the specific epa actions required thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32218crs25 74 stricter standards primarily refer to requi rements introduced by fqpa in 1996 to perform more comprehensive risk assessment of pesticides and consider aggregate exposure cumulative effects from pesticides sharing common mechanism of toxicity possible increased susceptibility of vulnerable populati ons particularly infants and children and possible endocrine or estrogenic effects see crs report 96759 pesticide legislation food quality protection act of 1996 pl 104170 75 examples of epa advisory workgroups and committees for pesticide science and procedural issues are available at http wwwepagovpesticidessciencecommitteeshtmprevious legislative provisions related to registration and tolerance fees which were more generic the implementation of thes schedules has improved the efficiency in the overall process leading to the completion of reregistration reviews and the reevaluation of older tolerances the pestic ide fee provisions included in pria 1 and retained in pria 2 also provided stability for resource planning purposes stability had been lacking previously because of nnual reauthorizations of maintenance fees and administration budget proposals to modify fee authority epa reported progress in developing process imp rovements and meeting shortened registration review deadlines during the pria 1 pria became effective march 23 2004 and continue d to report improvements through the end of fy2007 further improvement in the efficiency of the epas decisionmaking process under pria 2 is dependent largely on the agencys ability to continue to establish and effectively implement reforms while maintaining the protection of human health and the environment required by the statutes to meet stricter statutory standards74 and related sound science demands epa continues to develop and refine its scientific protocols and guidelines with input from stakeholders and the scientific community through various public forums75 however as past experience has shown this is complex and timeconsuming undertaking aff ected by uncertainties and advances in technology that could enhance or inhibit further acceleration of the pesticide review process
