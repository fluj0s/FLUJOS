significant us nuclear exports for example the act required nonnuclearwea pon states to have fullscope international atomic energy agency safeguards as condition for entering into nuclear cooperation agreements with the united states for existing and future agreements the nnpa added provision for congress to review export lic enses the act also included provision for halting exports if country tested nuclear device violated safeguards agreements or continued nuclear weaponsrelated activities 2 the term special nuclear material as well as other terms used in the statute is defined in 42 usc 2014 special nuclear material means 1 plutonium uranium enriched in the isotopes 233 or 235 and any other material that is determin ed to be special nuclear material but does not include source

the aea nonproliferation requirements the president must also make written determination that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security requirements under the atomic energy act section 123 of the aea specifies the necessary steps for engaging in nuclear cooperation with another country section 123a states that the proposed agreem ent is to include the terms conditions duration nature and sc ope of cooperati on and lists nine criteria that the agreement must meet it also contains provisions for the

an exemption is necessary these include guarantees that safeguards on nuclear material and equipment transfe rred continue in perpetuity fullscope international atomic energy agency iaea safeguards

the npas and statement of his approval of the agreement and determination that it will not damage the national security interests of the united states this action begins the second period of 60 da ys of continuous session in practice the president has submitted the agreement to congress along with the unclassified npas its classified annex and hi s approval and deter mination at the beginning of the full 90 day period the 60day period has been c onsidered as following immediately upon the expiration of the 30day period if the president has not exempted the agreement from any requirements of section 123a it becomes effective at the end of the 60day period unless during that time congress adopts joint resolution disapproving the agreement and the resolution becomes law if the agreement is

by the end of 45 days it is automati cally discharged from further consideration of the measure after the joint resolution is reported or discharged congress is to consider it under expedited

123d of the aea to require joint resoluti on of approval for both exempt and nonexempt agreements within the 60day period before such agreements could go into effect7 export licensing the aea sets out procedures for licensing exports to states with whom the united states has nuclear cooperation agreemen ts sections 126 127 and 128 codified as amended at 42 usc 2155 2156 2157 each export of nuclear material equipment or technology requires speci fic export license or other authorization the nuclear regulatory commission nrc is required to meet criteria in sections 127 and 128 in authorizing export licenses these criteria are as follows application of iaea safeguards to any material or facilities proposed to be exported material or facilities previously exported and to any special nuclear material used in or produced through the use thereof these are not fullscope safeguards but safe guards required under npt article iii2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22937crs5 8 in light of the supreme courts 1983 decision in ins v chadha passing concurrent resolution could invite legal challenge because it is argu ably unconstitutional although not provided for in the aea congress could choose to pass joint resolution of disapproval or bill stating in substance it did not approvenothing exported can be used for an nuclear explosive device or for research on or development of any nuclear explosive device recipient states must have adequate physical security on such material or facilities proposed to be exported and to any special nuclear material used in or produced through the use thereof recipient states are not to retransfer exported nuclear materials facilities sensitive nuclear technology or s pecial nuclear material produced through the use of such materi without prior us approval recipient states may not reprocess or alter in form or content exported nuclear material or sp ecial nuclear material produced though the use of exported nuclear material w ithout prior us approval the foregoing conditions must be applied to any nuclear material or equipment that is produced or cons tructed under the jurisdiction of the recipient by or through the use of any exported sensitive nuclear technology section 128 requires that recipient nonnuclearweapon states must have fullscope iaea safeguards the president must judge that the pr oposed export or exemption will not be inimical to the common defense and security or that any export of that type would not be inimical to the common defense and secur ity because it lacks significance for nuclear explosive purposes the executive branch ma also consider other factors such as whether the license or exemption will mate rially advance the nonpr oliferation policy of the united states by encouraging the recipient nation to adhere to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt whether fa ilure to issue the license or grant the exemption would otherwise be seriously prej udicial to us nonproliferation objectives and whether the recipient nation has agreed to conditions identical to those laid out in section 127 section 126b 2 contains pr ovision for the president to authorize an export in the event that the nrc deems that the export would not meet section 127 and 128 criteria the president must determine that failure to approve an export would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of us nonpro liferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security in that case the president would submit his executive order along with detaile d assessment and other documen tation to congress for 60 days of continuous session after 60 days of continuous session the export would go through unless congress were to adopt c oncurrent resoluti on of disapproval8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22937crs6 9 section 129b 2 states that the prohibitions desc ribed in the previous section shall not apply to exports reexports transfers or retransfers of

hazardous materials except to the extent that such technologies equipment seal s cameras devices detectors or systems are available for use in the design or construc tion of nuclear reactors or nuclear weaponssection 128b2 contains provision for the president to waive termination of exports by notifying the congress that the st ate has adopted fullscope safeguards or that the state has made significant progress toward adopting such safeguards or that us foreign policy interests dictate reconsider ation such determination would become effective unless congress were to adopt concurrent resolu tion of disapproval within 60 days of continuous session additionally section 129b1 forbids the export of nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology to any country designated as state sponsor of terrorism9 section 129b3 allows the pres ident to waive this provision termination of cooperation section 129a of the aea requires ending exports of nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology to any nonnuclearweapon state that after march 10 1978 the president determines to ve detonated nuclear explosive device terminated or abrogated iaea safeguards materially violated an iaea safeguards agreement or engaged in activities involving source or special nuc lear material and having direct significance for the manufacture or acquisition of nuclear explosive devices and has failed to take steps whic h in the presidents judgment represent sufficient progress toward terminating such activities section 129a also requires that the unite d states halt exports to any nation the president determines to have materially violated the terms of an agreement for cooperation with the us assi sted encouraged or induced any nonnuclear weapon state to obtain nuclear explosives or the materials and technologies needed to manufacture them or retransferred or entered into an agreement for exporting reprocessing equipment materials or technology to
