organizations successful eradication program the smallpox vaccine is effective at preventing smallpox but has higher compli cation rate than any other currently used vaccine the terrorist attacks of 2001 have in creased fears that smallpox might be used as weapon of terror smallpox has severa l properties that might make it desirable by terrorists such as contagiousness and high lethality these factors and its limited availability also make it difficult for terrorist to use most experts agree that it is very unlikely that smallpox will be used as weapon but the high consequences of

accident in england in 1978 smallpox was considered to be one of the worst scourges in human history smallpox is estimated to ve killed between 300 and 500 million people in the twentieth century alone once infected the victim incubates the virus for seven to seventeen days during which the victim feels and appears normal this stage is followed by one to four days of high fever malaise headache and muscle ache often accompanied with nausea and vomiting during this time the person looks nd feels very ill but is not yet contagious after this stage the characteristic sores develop first in the mouth then over the rest of the body if the vic tim survives the sores scab over and turn to scars in three to four weeks about 30 of unvaccinated victims die some sources suggest up to 50 up to 80 of the survivors are disfigured by pockmarks or limb deformities smallpox is contagious but the centers for disease control and prevention cdc3 considers it to spread less widely and ss rapidly than chicke npox measle s whooping cough or influenza the victim is most likely to infect other people when the sores in the mouth are most active this is in the first week of the rash when virus comes out of the sores and into the saliva where they are easily aerosolized by coughing or sneezing although smallpox is usually transmitted by f ace to face contact it can also be transmitted through the air over dozens of feet and by cont aminated clothing or bedding smallpox vaccine the vaccine works by infecting person with vaccinia virus which is closely related to smallpox virus4 the vaccine triggers immunity ag ainst all closely related viruses including smallpox this immunity decreases over time however people who contract smallpox even thirty years after vaccination are much less likely to die than unvaccinated people5 interestingly the vaccine also helps reduce the severity of the disease if given to victims within few days after smallpox exposure this is the only known treatment for smallpox although several antiviral drugs have shown promise in preliminary laboratory studies although the vaccinia vaccine is very effective at preventing smallpox it is not without risks its complication rate is higher than that associated with any routinely used vaccine based on historical experience experts estimate that most vaccinees willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21288crs3 6

generalized vaccinia causes vaccinia sores over the entire body eczema vaccinatum is sometime fatal sk in infection in people who have skin disorder such as eczema or atopic dermatitis encephalitis is very serious and sometimes fatal inflammation of the brain progressive vaccinia is an inexorable rotting away of the flesh around the vaccine site that can sometimes also be fatal as result of these complications experts project 1 2 deaths per million vaccinations complications are not limited to people w ho get vaccinated people who come into contact with those who have been vaccinated within two weeks may also be exposed to the live vaccinia virus and develop complicati ons some experts estimate that up to 20 of the complications will occur in the unvacci nated contacts historically for every million people vaccinated about 65 people who we re not vaccinated b ecame infected and developed serious complication simply by coming into contact with vaccinee6 because of the high rate of vaccine compli cations in 1971 us public health authorities rescinded the recommendation for univers domestic smallpox vaccination it is likely that the numbers in table 1 underestimate the curre nt and future problem with the vaccine since these numbers were last compiled in 1968 the number of people predisposed to problems with the vaccine s increased some experts estimate that up to 25 of the population now have conditions that would make vaccination contraindicated these conditi ons include history of ecz ema or other exfoliative skin disorder pregnancy or any immunodefici ency which could be caused by aids chemotherapy or antirejection drugs following organ transplant because of the serious risk of transferring the virus to house hold member it is recommended that people who live with someone with one of the above conditions not r eceive the vaccine excluding these people is complicated by the large numbe r of people who are unaware that they have disease that will produce

only product proven to count er some of the vaccine complications is vaccinia immunoglobulin vig this is extracted from the blood of people vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine it is only effective for treatment of eczema vaccinatum and certain cases of progressive vaccinia significantly vig provides benefit in the treatment of postvaccinial encephalitis current civilian s upplies of vig are controlled by the cdc and are estimated to be enough to deal with the complications from about 27 million vaccinations the cdc is in the process of procuring more vig because the antiviral drug cidofovir has shown some antivaccinia activity in lab animals it is available for use as an investigational new dr ug when vig treatment fails threat of terrorist use although smallpox was officially declared to have been eliminated from the wild in 1980 many c ountries maintained laboratory stocks of the virus obtained during outbreaks by 1985 these stocks were supposed to have b een destroyed or transferred to one of the official repositories one in the soviet union and the other in the united states russia inherited the smallpox stewardshi p following the break up of the soviet union although only the united states and ru ssia have declared stocks of smallpox some experts have stated that although very unlikely it is possible that some other countries have undeclared stoc ks countries that may have deliberately or inadvertently retained smallpox virus from naturally ccurring outbreaks before eradication include china cuba india iran iraq israel north korea pakistan and yugoslavia7 november 2002 cia intelligence review added fr ance to this list and reportedly states high but not very high level of confidence that iraq and france have live smallpox samples and medium level of confidence that north korea does8 the highest barrier to nonst ate sponsored terrorist using smallpox is likely to be the difficulty in obtaining the virus in the fi rst place because all countries have stopped smallpox vaccination programs citizens of all countries are equa lly vulnerable to spreading epidemic therefore it is in th best interest of country with even an undeclared smallpox stock to keep it very secure despite this some fear that the russian stocks may not be sufficiently secure due to the economic collapse that accompanied the break up of the soviet union other than from government controlled st ockpile some have suggested that it may be possible to acquire the virus from the bodies of smallpox victims buried in the siberian permafrost in the 1800s however this is probably unlikely since russian experts have been unable to acquire viable virus this way despite multiple attempts9 in 2002 american scientists successfully constructed infectious polio virus

most experts claim that it would be very difficult to construct variola virus in this manner for more information on this topic see crs report rs21369 synthetic poliovirus bioterrori sm and science policy implications if terrorist organization were able to obt ain sample of virus it would also need the advanced technical knowledge skill nd facilities to maintain the virus without infecting themselves until the pl anned dissemination it is cons idered to be quite difficult to weaponize smallpox11 however in general weaponization refers to developing advanced delivery systems such as missiles artillery or bombs to cause mass casualties this technological barrier would be much wer for terrorist terrorist who was not concerned with his own survival could pot entially use his own body as the delivery system infecting dozens of people be fore succumbing to the disease in addition to the threat posed by terrori st groups it is possible that another nation may choose to use smallpox against the united states some experts suggest that of the countries that might have und eclared stocks of smallpox virus iraq may pose the most danger to the united states some experts believe that it is very unlikely that iraq has smallpox since they did not use it during the gu lf war however those who feel that iraq has the smallpox virus counter that it would not have been used because it is not well suited for battlefield deployment since it is c ontagious and likely to infect troops on both sides some experts also believe that iraq was dissuaded from using chemical or biological weapons by what could have been interpreted as thinly veiled threat of nuclear retaliation12 in the current situation of rising tensions some experts have stated that if iraq has the capability saddam hussein may unleash smallpox as weapon of last resort particularly if he can deploy it cover tly on united states soil13 in december 2002 the administration reserved the right to us nuclear weapons to respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction agains t the united states or its allies14 nonetheless most experts feel that th barriers posed by acquisition and successful deployment of smallpox virus are high enoug h to make such an attack very unlikely furthermore because of these hurdles most experts feel that terrorist organization would require state sponsor in order to ccessfully obtain and deploy smallpox policy implications although most experts deem the risk of sm allpox attack to be very low the high consequences of release have led the pres ident to

for complications howeve r the administration will not recommend vaccination for members of the general public because of the high complication rate15 scientific research may be able to further limit the threat posed by smallpox if safer smallpox vaccine could be produced for instance public health officials would be less reluctant to recommend mass vaccination the development of such vaccine is stymied by several factors one is that it is difficult to predict before making large investment whether new vaccine will be sa fer and still effective against smallpox16 another factor is the uncertain market of therapeutic agent that is designed to protect against what most experts agr ee is very unlikely event without guaranteed market the commercial sector may be reluctant to make such investments some experts suggest that in general it may be better to develop treatments rather than relying on prophylactic measures for the many potential biological agents that could be used to attack the united states they suggest that the financial and societal costs of multiple mass vaccination prog rams may make vaccines only approach impractical some scientists are working on producing antiv iral drugs as cure for smallpox and several have shown promise in preliminary studies17 however more work needs to be done to improve animal models of smallpox so that the fficacy of new therapeutics can be tested18 another potential advantage of this approach is that these drugs may be effective against other viruses and therefore might be marketable as treatments for influenza or aids the united states might be be tter equipped to defend against smallpox attack if the status of any undeclared small pox stocks could be determined with greater certainty for example if it could be determined that iraq does not have any smallpox then focus could be shifted to preventing terrorist access to other sources unfortunately it is possible that iraq could successfully hide smallpox
