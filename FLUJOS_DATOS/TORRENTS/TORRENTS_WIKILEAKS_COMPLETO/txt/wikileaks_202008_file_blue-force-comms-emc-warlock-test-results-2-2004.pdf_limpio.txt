communications node eg toc additional objectives were to determine mitigation techniques that allow simultaneous operations when both t ypes of systems were colocated 212 s criteria simultaneous operation of colocat ed ied jammers and blue force communications equipment shall not degrade blue force communications 213 s test procedures test personnel postulated that one of the most likely com

sincgars eplrsfbcb 2 and various handheld radios xts3000 and rino available for intraconvoy communications while satellite systems bftfbcb2 and spitfire were expected to be used for in traconvoy communications thei r testing was deferred to the basetoconvoy comm unications test scenario this wa s allowable because they used satellite rf links rather th an terrestrial rf links 2131 u baseline

scenario the jammers are placed in separate vehicle and st ood off some distance from the victim vehicle containing the blue force communications equipm ent the intent is to allow communications across the 2kmlong convoy while keeping the co mmunications vehicle within the protection zone provided by nearby ied jammer in differe nt vehicle standoff distances of 50 meters and 100 meters were chosen because they corre sponded to postulated convoy vehicle intervals after moving the ied jammer to another vehicle each of the above baseline performance tests were repeated while the ied jammers

mitigation method to lessen the blue force communications degradation caused by operating the ied jammers in this scenario the jammers and communications equipment are within the same vehicle the intent is to determine whether communications could be relayed over series of short less loss rf links within the 2kmlong convoy the role of the hmmwv playing the lead vehicle was changed to that of one located within the body of the convoy to support message relay capability test personnel moved the hardtop hmmwv m1026 to successively closer distances to the tail hmmwv until they could establish reliable communications on the communications system being tested after moving the vehicle to usable distance each of the above baseline performance tests was repeated while the ied jammers were

u garmi n rino frsgmrs handheld radio results are available this test was canceled due to radio hardware failure 215 u technical analysis 2151 s general discussion the major element affecting us able communications is the signaltonoise ratio sn at the radio receiver raising the sn increases receiver performance lowering it degrades performance the ratio can be increased by raising the desired signal secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 25strength or by lowering the undesi rable noise presented to the r eceivers antenna shortening the radio link in the above shortened link excursion reduces the rf path loss of the desired signal hence increases its strength at the receivers an tenna standing off the ied jammer decreases the undesired noise presented to the receivers antenna 2152 s sincgars at least three methods are readily available to allow usable com munications via sincgars w ithin the convoy scenario s frequency coordination and hopset tailoring the first which was not explored in this timeconstrained test is frequency c oordination and sincgars hopset tailoring around ied jammers frequencies after reviewing the in country hopset there ppears to be sufficient rf spectrum available to trade off frequencies for jammer use one potential problem will be the rf spectral purity and spurious signals and harmonics generated by the jammers in addition to their intended transmit frequencies this coul d be resolved by tradin g off more sincgars frequencies andor cleaning up the jammer signals via better intern filters or commercial off theshelf cots external filters another pot ential problem could be chaos within the sincgars networks if there are continuous changes to the sincgars hopsets and their distribution is not timely and t horough throughout the affected units b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the jamm ers can protect multiple vehicles c s radio repeater over shortened radio links this is probably the least desirable due to the increased hardware requirements radi and antennas manual operator message relay could also be employed but would be labor intens ive and prone to error operation at rf power amplifier power 50 w could increase the li nk distance and reduce hardware requirements 2153 s eplrsfbcb2 again at least three methods ar readily available to allow usable communications via eplrsf bcb2 within the convoy scenario s frequency coordination and eplrs channel tailoring the principles discussed in the above sincgars thod are applicable b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the ja mmers can protect multiple vehicles c s radio repeater over shortened links this option is more desirable for eplrs because every eplrs within the network automatic ally functions as re peater additionally the usable link distance is greater400 meters only five eplrs in 2kmlong convoy would be required to provide endtoend data communications positional data and sa would be supported voice communications are not supported 2154 s motorola xt s 3000 handheld radio frequency coordination and using channel whose frequency is outside the jammers band is the only readily available recom mendation 2155 s garmin rino fr sgmrs handheld radio frequency coordination and using channel whose frequency is outside the jammers band is the only readily available recommendation 2156 s additional information regarding gps plgr given the limited observation data available the most readily available thod for preventing gps position degradation is secretrel to usa

near term digital radio ntd r antenna mounted to the side of the jtrs test trailer simulated satellite downlink to the spitfire radio was created by selecting frequency in the normal downlink range of 240 270 mhz and attenuating the base site transmit signal to 85 dbm rsl at the receiving conv oy element site endtoend message quality was subjectively determined by counting the number of received voice messages of usable and understandable quality test personnel at the base site transmitted 20 voice messages to other test personnel sitting in the convoy element hmmwvs ied jammers were turned on during this scenario portion 2232 s baseline link with ied counte rmeasures colocated in same vehicle in this scenario the ied jammers and communi cations equipment are installed in the same convoy element vehicle each of the above baseline performance tests was repeated while the ied jammers were turned on one at time only one ied jammer was operational at any time the bftfbcb2 was omitted due to expired test time 2233 s baseline link with ied count ermeasures located in different vehicle this scenario was an excursion to evaluate mitigation method to lessen the blue force communications degradation cause d by operating the ied jammers in this scenario the ied jammers are placed in separate vehicle and stood off designated distances from the victim vehicle containing the blue fo rce communications equipment the intent is to allow com munications at the convoy element vehicle while keeping it within the pr otection zone provided by nearby ied jammer in di fferent vehicle sta ndoff distances of 50 meters and 100 meters were chosen because they corresponded to postu lated convoy vehicle intervals after moving the ied jammer to another vehicle each of the bove baseline performance tests was repeated while secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 29the ied jammers were turned on one at time only one ied jammer was operational at any time 224 u test findings 2241 s baseline link with ied count ermeasures colocated in same vehicle 22411 s sincgars communications across the basetoconvoy radio link were possible when either the warlockred or the ssvj was operating within the same vehicle the warlockgreen did not pr event usable communications 22412 s eplrsfbcb2 communications across the basetoconvoy radio link were possible when either the warlockred or the ssvj was operating within the same vehicle the warlockgreen did not pr event usable communications 22413 s bftfbcb2 communications across the basetoconvoy radio link were possible when the warlockred was operating within the same vehicle the warlock green and ssvj effects have not been teste d testing at ypg was canceled due to time constraints the results presented here are fr om followon testing conducted at usaepg fort huachuca 22414 s spitfire communications across the baset oconvoy radio link were not affected by operation of any of the three ied jammers 2242 s baseline link with ied count ermeasures located in different vehicle 22421 s sincgars using 50meter jammer standoff distance between the communications vehicle and the ied jammer ve hicle allowed usable communications when either the warlockred or ssvj was operated in the jammer vehicle 22422 s eplrsfbcb2 using 50meter jammer standoff distance between the communications vehicle and the ied jammer vehi cle allowed usable communications when the warlockred was operated in the jammer ve hicle the ssvj required 100meter standoff distance 22423 s bftfbcb2 using 50meter jammer sta ndoff distance between the communications vehicle and the ied jammer vehi cle allowed usable communications when the warlockred was operated in the jammer vehicle the warloc kgreen and ssvj mitigation methods have not been tested testi ng at ypg was canceled due to time constraints the results presented here are from followon testing conducted at usaepg 22424 s spitfire standoff testing required comm unications across the baseto convoy radio link were not aff ected by operation of any of the three ied jammers 225 u technical analysis 2251 s general discussion the major element affecting us able communications is the sn at the radio receiver raising the sn increa ses receiver performance lowering it degrades performance the ratio can be increased by rais ing the desired signal strength or by lowering the secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 210undesirable noise presented to th receivers antenna the only available option to increase the sn in this scenario was standing off the ied jammer to decrease the desired noise presented to the receivers antenna 2252 s sincgars at least two methods are readily available to allow usable communications via sincgars between base and convoy elements s frequency coordination and hopset tailoring the first which was not explored in this timeconstrained test is frequency c oordination and sincgars hopset tailoring around ied jammer frequencies after reviewing the inc ountry hopset there appear s to be sufficient rf spectrum available to trade off frequencies for ja mmer use one potential problem will be the rf spectral purity and spurious signals and harmonics generated by the jammers in addition to their intended transmit frequencies this could be resolved by trading off more sincgars frequencies andor cleaning up the jammers signals via better internal filters or cots external filters another potential problem could be chaos within the sincgars networks if there are continuous changes to the sincgars hopsets and their distribution is not timely and thorough throughout the affected units b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the jammers can protect multiple vehicles 2253 s eplrsfbcb2 again at least two methods are r eadily available to allow usable communications via eplrsfbcb2 between base and convoy elements s frequency coordination and eplrs channel tailoring the principles discussed in the above sincgars thod are applicable b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the jamm ers can protect multiple vehicles 2254 s bftfbcb2 the warockred was not expect ed to impact bft operation since the bft receives at much higher fr equencies than the warlockred transmit frequencies additional test ex cursions show that bft degrad ation occurs only when both the lowband and midband units are transmitting oper ation of only onehalf of the warlockred system does not impact bft commu nications possibilities are that s combined warlockred unwanted spurious emissions have sufficient band width to impact bft b s combined warlockred transmitter energy overloads the bft receiver c s combined warlockred transmitter causes intermodulation products within the active components of the bft system further testing exploring addon low pass filte ring and antenna separation options should be conducted until then jammer standoff appears to be the only viable mitigation technique assuming that the warlockred can protect multiple vehicles 2255 s spitfire use frequency coordination if an emc should occur in the near future unclassified unclassified 31section 3
