sentencing role of federal judges at the very least the decision has required alterations in the manner in which federal drug statutes and similar provisions are prosecuted and it may herald the

prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt 120 sct at 2355 the courts sharp change of direction and the slim and fragile nature of the consensus among the members of the majority make predictions perilous it is therefore perhaps not surprising that the various federal appellate courts have thus far construed apprendi narrowly winship and its progeny apprendi is the latest in line of cases that begins with winship where the court expressly confirmed that due process demands the guilt of an accused be found beyond reasonable doubt in re winship 397 us 358 364 1970 in doing so it declared that the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged id emphasis added conviction cannot be had it later explained by requiring the defendant to prove the absence of one of the elements of the crime with which he is charged thus for example state may not require an accused to prove that he acted in the heat of passion ie with an absence of malice aforethought and therefore is not guilty of murder for which malice aforethought is an element but only of manslaughter mullaney v wilbur 421 us 684 698701 1975httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20850crs2 due process in this context is focused upon the prosecutors responsibility to prove each of the crimes elements beyond reasonable doubt due process is not offended if the defendant must prove the existence of lesser crime rather than the one with which he was charged so state may outlaw the intentional killing of another as murder but allow the accused to claim guilt under less severely punished crime when he can show by preponderance of the evidence that he acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance patterson v new york 432 us 197 2057 1977 still focused upon the prosecutors responsibility to prove each of the crimes elements the court held that once the prosecution has done so denial of due process occurs simply because the defendant convicted of the crime is subject to mandatory minimum sentence based upon the prosecutions proof to the court not the jury of an additiona l sentencing factor by preponderance of the evidence and not beyond reasonable doubt mcmillan v pennsylvania 477 us 79 93 1986 moreover these sentencing factors could be used to enhance the maximum penalties as well as to establish minimum penalty thus majority of the court saw constitutional impediment in statutory scheme that raised the maximum penalty of crime from 2 years to 20 years based on the presence of particular sentencing factor to be established to the courts satisfaction by preponderance of the evidence after conviction almandareztorres v united states 523 us 224 22627 1998 even in capital punishme nt cases where due process standards are sometimes insufficient to satisfy constitutional requirements for imposition of that unique penalty the court held that the judge as well as the jury may be entrusted with the task of determining the existence of aggravating factors necessary to justify execution walton v arizona 497 us 639 647 1990 logical though it may have been in light of the courts precedents majority of the courts members became uneasy with the implications of almandareztorres almost immediately jones v united states 526 us 227 1999 presented facts similar to those in almendareztorres jones was indicted and convicted of carjacking in violation of 18 usc 2119 conviction carried sentence of imprisonment for not more 15 years 18 usc 21191 but the maximum sentence was increased to 25 years if the offense resulted in serious bodily injury 18 usc 21192 and to life imprisonment if the offense resulted in death 18 usc 21193 neither the indictment nor the instructions to the jury made any mention of bodily injury but the presentence report did and recommended sentence of 25 years which the trial court imposed the court of appeals affirmed united states v jones 60 f3d 547 9th cir 1995 the supreme court in 54 decision reversed the court concluded that the statute did not create single crime with three possible sentences instead it created three separate crimes each with its own penalty ie simple carjacking not more than 15 years carjacking where serious bodily injury results not more than 25 years and carjacking where death results life imprisonment it observed however that while we think the fairest reading of 2119 treats the fact of serious bodily harm as an element not mere enhancement we recognize the possibility of the other view any doubt that might be prompted by the arguments for that other reading should however be resolved against it under the rule repeatedly affirmed that where statute is suspectable of two constructions by one of which grave and doubtfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20850crs3 constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided our duty is to adopt the latter 526 us at 239 to find otherwise the court believed might bring it into conflict with the principle that under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt 526 us at 243 n6 apprendi apprendi confirms the constitutional suggestions in jones apprendi was convicted of shooting up the home of his africanamerican neighbors there was evidence which apprendi disputed that his crime was motivated by racial animus apprendi v new jersey 120 sct at 2351 citing apprendi v state 159 nj 7 10 731 a2d 485 486 1999 under new jersey law possession of firearm for an unlawful purpose is second degree crime njstatann 2c394a and unless otherwise provide d is punishable by imprisonment for term fixed at between 5 and 10 years njstatann 2c436a2 second degree crime however carries an extended term of imprisonment if the court finds that it was committed by defendant acting with purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race njstatann 2c443e second degree crime found to have been committed under such circumstances carries term of imprisonment fixed at between 10 and 20 years njstatann 2c437a3 apprendi plead guilty under multicount indictment which nowhere mentioned either the hate crime sentencing enhancement statute or the allegations which supported its application 120 sct at 2352 nevertheless in the plea agreement the prosecution reserved the right to seek the hate crime enhancement and apprendi reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality id the trial court sentenced apprendi to hatecrime enhanced term of 12 years on one of the unlawful possession counts which otherwise would have carried maximum term of 10 years and rejected his constitutional arguments the new jersey appellate courts affirmed apprendi v state 304 njsuper 147 698 a2d 1265 1997 affd 159 nj 7 731 a2d 485 1999 the supreme court in decision written by justice stevens and joined by justices scalia thomas souter and ginsburg reversed and remanded 120 sct 2348 the court declared that the jury trial and notification clauses of the sixth amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments embody principal that insists that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt 120 sct 2362363 justice thomas together with justice scalia agreed but issued concurrence that suggests they would have gone further justice oconnor wrote dissent in which she was joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices breyer and kennedy 120 sct at 2380 at the heart of the dissent lies the belief that the majority have announced as constitutional mandate rule that the constitution does not require justice breyer and chief justice rehnquist joined in an additional separate dissenting opinion arguing the benefits of judicial participation in sentencing 120 sct at 2396 view whose constitutional foundations justice scalia questions in separate concurrence 120 sct at 2367httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20850crs4 impact the consequences of apprendi are substantial and potentially enormous its most obvious and immediate impact is upon federal drug sentencing practices section 841a of title 21 of the united states code outlaws traffickin g in controlled substances as general rule trafficking in heroin cocaine and other schedule i or ii controlled substances is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years 21 usc 841b1c trafficking in large amounts of these controlled substances eg 100 grams of heroin can increase the maximum penalties to imprisonment for not less than 5 nor more than 40 years not less than 10 years nor more than life for repeat offenders 21 usc 841b1b and trafficking in very large amounts eg kilogram or more of heroin raises the penalties to imprisonment for not less than 20 years nor more than life 21 usc 841b1a prior to apprendi an accused was entitled to jury determination of his guilt under section 841 but questions of the amount of the substance involved were considered sentencing factors to be decided by the judge subject to few exceptions apprendi has changed all that the sentencing factors of section 841 and its equivalents are now elements of separate offenses to be charged in the indictment and found by the jury beyond reasonable doubt other than the fact of prior conviction apprendi however limits its sweep at least for the time being it creates an unmistakable recidivism exception other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury 120 sct at 2362363 emphasis added the limitation is not inadvertent but it is hardly warmly embraced both justice stevens opinion for the court and justice thomas concurrence imply that almandareztorres upon which the exception is based was probably incorrectly decided nevertheless if only for now almandarez remains the law and postapprendi courts continue to hold that recidivism is valid sentencing factor that may be used to increase defendants sentence beyond the maximum term that would otherwise apply even if the prior conviction is neither mentioned in the indictment nor presented to the jury increases the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum the second distinct limitation of the apprendi rule is its deference to the statutory maximum the restriction has obvious implications first it permits judicially determined and imposed mandatory minimum sentences as long as they do not exceed the maximum penalty imposed by statute second it leaves the federal sentencing guidelines unimpaired finally it lets stand previously imposed sentences grounded upon erroneous assumptions of law which nevertheless came to rest within the applicable statutory maximum apprendi disposes of any potential challenge to the validity of mandatory minimum sentences that do not exceed statutory ceilings by recasting mcmillan we limit mcmillans holding to cases that do not involve the imposition of sentence more severe than the statutory maximum for the offense established by the jurys verdict 120 sct at 2361 n13 the point has not been lost on subsequent federal appellate panels apprendi seems to forego coverage of the federal sentencing guidelines by setting its rule to work beyond the applicable statutory maximum knowing that the sentencinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20850crs5 guidelines operate only up to that maximum ussg 5g11a the apprendi dissenters however sense this result may be in conflict with apprendi s underlying rationale the actual principle underlying the courts decision the dissent opines may be that any fact other than prior conviction that has the effect in real terms of increasing the maximum punishment beyond an otherwise applicable range must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt 120 sct at 2391 oconnor j dissenting if so the dissenters speculate the principle thus would apply not only to schemes like new jerseys under which factual determination exposes the defendant to sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum but also to all determinatesentencing schemes in which the length of defendants sentence within the statutory range turns on specific factual determinations eg the federal sentencing guidelines id and they add justice thomas concurrence appears to endorse this construction when he essentially concedes that the rule outlined in his concurring opinion would require the invalidation of the sentencing guidelines 120 sct at 2391 oconnor j dissenting in fact neither justice stevens in his opinion for the court nor justices thomas nor scalia in their concurrences offer great deal to allay the dissents concerns the court notes that the issue was not before it and that guideline sentences must fall within the maximum prescribed by statute be that as it may the apprendi rule at least in its present form begins where the sentence guidelines end at the maximum penalty prescribed by statute later cases have rejected the contention that operation of the guidelines contravenes the apprendi rule there is one other consequence of apprendi s deference to statutory maximums federal appellate courts pointing to this aspect of apprendi have declined to overturn sentences imposed before apprendi was handed down that fall beneath the applicable statutory maximum even if they were otherwise imposed contrary to the apprendi rule capital punishment and other procedural questions although the courts capital punishment jurisprudence may sometimes call for more process than is due in due process cases apprendi does not abrogate the courts existing construction under which the constitution is said to permit assignment of the ultimate sentencing decision to either judge or jury the exception stands on two critical distinctions first in capital punishment cases the sentencing decision follows jury determination of guilt on capital offenses ie the maximum penalty for the crime of conviction is death apprendi deals with sentences that is with punishment and so it might be thought to apply to sentences in any form but not necessarily to the remedial repercussions of conviction nevertheless some consequences of conviction which might have been considered remedial such as supervised release are bound by the apprendi rule while others which might have been considered punitive such as criminal forfeiture are not retroactive application apprendi says nothing of its possible retroactive application may those already convicted claim the benefits of its new rule of constitutional interpretation judgefound sentencing factors have become feature common to both state and federal criminal justice systems must all of the sentences imposed under those systems be reexamined the answer thus far has been mixed but predictably sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20850crs6 apprendi has been found to apply to cases pending on direct appeal when it was handed down yet apprendi does not require resentencing in these cases if the defendant failed to raise the issue at trial as long as the sentenceenhancing fact withheld from the jurys appraisal was conceded indisput able or inconsequential defendants who have exhausted their direct appeals must overcome the general rule that new constitutional interpretations will not be applied in habeas corpus cases unless the interpretation either renders substantive criminal law unenforceabl or constitutes watershed interpretation of criminal procedure the obstacles for defendants who have previously filed for habeas relief are even more substantial they may proceed only with the permission of federal appellate court which may grant the petition only after the supreme court makes apprendi retroactive to cases on collateral review
