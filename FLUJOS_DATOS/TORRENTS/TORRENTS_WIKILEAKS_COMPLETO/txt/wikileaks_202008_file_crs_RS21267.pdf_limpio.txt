equipment and facilities construction mrefc account of the national science foundation nsf was established in fy1995 and supports the acquisition construction and commissioning of major research facilities and equipment that are to extend the boundaries of science and engineering major research facilities are complex in their design construction and operation and require large investment over limited period of time examples of some of the funded projects include telescopes research vessels accelerators networked hightech research platforms advanced computing resources astronomical observatories and earthquake simulators these complex projects sometime involve the participation of international partners currently the nsf provides approximately 10 billion annually in support of facilities and other infrastructure projects the funding for construction of individual facilities ranges from several tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars additional funding is required annually for operation maintenance upgrades and retooling of the facilities with the significant exception of research facilities in the antarctic the nsf does not directly design or operate research facilities rather it makes awards to other organizations such as universities consortia of universities or nonprofit organizations which have the responsibility of construction operation and management the nsf enters into cooperative agreements with these external entities and has the final responsibility for oversight of the development management and performance of the facilities during the past few years nsfs portfolio of facilities has expanded and diversified to include complex multidisciplinary projects and distributed projects because these major facility projects are multiyear their accounting management and oversight require more complexity and detail than the traditional average grant award there are concerns from congress and from some in the academic and scientific community about the adequacy of the planning and management of nsf facilities discussions have focused on how major facility projects are selected for funding other questions have centered on the types of costs to be funded through the mrefc account and nsf personnel involved in major facility projects in the fy2002 budget submission president bush directed the nsf to develop clearer policies and procedures for managing all aspects of large facility projects including funding controls and effective project management 1 the fy2002 budget document blue print for new beginnings responsible budget for america s priorities directed that nsf will develop plan to enhance its capability to estimate costs and provide oversight of project management and construction this plan should help ensure that nsf is able to meet and stick to cost and schedule commitments for major facility projects2 1 in december 2000 the office of inspector general oig of the nsf released an audit of the gemini project reporting that the gemini project had cost overruns exceeding its approved construction level of 184 million the oig further stated that the nsf had used or was planning to use approximately 528 million from the research and related activities account rra to cover the excess construction and commission costs nsf management refuted the conclusions of the oig maintaining that the excess costs were operational in nature and as result properly supported through the rra as opposed to the mrefc account 2 office of management and budget blueprint for new beginnings resp onsible

for establishing andor operating major tool or facility that will potentially benefit community of researchers andor educators project should offer the possibility of transformative knowledge and the potential to shift existing paradigms in scientific understanding engineering processes andor infrastructure technology 4a research facility is considered major if its total cost of construction andor acquisition constitutes an investment that is more than 10 of the annual budget of the sponsoring directorate or office the majority of large facility projects are funded through the mrefc but some

associated with major research facilities at the nsf these hearings resulted from concerns expressed by some in the academic and scientific community and in congress about the management and oversight of major projects selected for construction and the need for prioritization of potential projects funded in the mrefc in testimony before the subcommittee on research then nsf director rita r colwell stated that the draft of the large facility projects management and oversight plan codifies practices already in place and develops new guidelines for oversight of financial and business functions she responded to criticism that the lines of authority for project management included in the draft plan were ambiguous and that those with over sight functions for the projects were program officers who may not have the expertise necessary for overseeing complex project the plan established new positiondeputy director for large facility projects under the plan the deputy director would be responsible for implementing and managing guidelines and procedures for facility management and oversight maintaining lines of authority for facility management and providing project management training for nsf staff engaged in large facility projects there has been considerable debate concerning the selection of major research facility projects for funding in testimony before the subcommittee on research anita k jones then vice chair 3 the proposed facilities are too large to fit within the account of any one directorate or program the concern is that support for such large projects would disrupt the budgets of other programs and jeopardize nsfs traditional support of core research programs 4 national science foundation facility plan september 2005 arlington va p 6 5 since its establishment the

can be built at the time they are considered the nsb established guidelines for approving major facility projects6 she emphasized that there is prioritization process for selecting major projects one that involves the nsf and the community with the nsb actually making the priority decisions the nsb she asserted reviews the need for the facility the research that will be enabled the readiness of plans for construction and operation construction budget estimates and operations budget estimates before making its decisions another issue brought before the subcommittee was that of maintaining distinct records of spending activities in the mrefc subcommittee members questioned the types of costs to be funded through the mrefc account because the differentiation between construction and operation is not always clearly defined7 the subcommittee noted that internal mechanisms needed to be created in order to prevent the combining of mrefc and rra funds

report noted that the current policy for major research equipment and facilities projects is limited to only the mrefc and does not include major facilities for other programs in nsf in addition the existing guidelines stipulate single financial review and do not offer directives on how the review should be conducted also according to the audit the current policies did not provide direction to nsf program mangers on how to address the problem of potential cost overruns while federal guidelines require that the total cost of major research facilities be tracked through all stages of project nsfs policies and procedures did not provide full accounting costs in its financial reports in accordance with federal standards because of nsfs inconsistencies in tracking costs and funding sources of its major research facilities the oig recommended that nsf revise its policies and procedures by complying with the directives that were detailed in the fy2002 appropriation bill

setting priorities for large research facility projects supported by the national science foundation10 at an october 2004 meeting of the nsb the nsf was directed to begin implementation of the proposed large facility project review and prioritization process outlined in the report the report revealed that in addition to there being backlog of approved but unfunded projects there was lack of support for disciplines conducting ideagenerating activities and lack of funding for conceptual development planning and design

things project definition intellectual justification connection to nsf strategic goals and priorities lifecycle cost profile partnerships and project management plans schedules and reviews based on the review the mrefc panel submits to the nsf director its recommendation on the projects relative importance eligibility and readiness with readiness defined as its ability to be included in the upcoming budget request the director then makes the selection of projects based on 1 strength and substance of the information 2 the appropriate balance among various fields disciplines or directorates and 3 opportunities to leverage mrefc funds the director submits his selections to the nsb for pr oject approval after the nsb approves project for future budget cycle funding it prioritizes among the projects 12 on an annual basis the nsb reviews all nsbapproved projects that have not been funded as yet to determine if any changes are necessary to the priority order of the projects13 if project is not approved or if projects plans are longer determined to be clearly and fully construction ready the project will be returned to the preliminary designreadiness phase for additional work project can be resubmitted to the nsb the following year while the nsb may approve project for inclusion in future budget request it does not necessarily mean that it will receive funding in the upcoming budget request it does indicate that the project is to be considered for inclusion depending on current budget levels and constraints in february 2008 nsf released its third annual facility plan 14 the plan covers readiness stage projects through those projects that are in the process of completion in addition the report includes nsfs support for major research

make certain that large facility is both constructed properly and is the appropriate facility to build the facility plan is consistent with the vision detailed in the nsf strategic plan investing in america s future fy2006 fy2011 15 the projects under construction and those being considered for construction are indicative of nsfs longterm investment priori ties for new capabilities and nextgeneration facilities that will transform research in science and engineering the nsf states that as in any sort of exploration the horizon keeps moving every year new opportunities will arise and new priorities will assert themselves as result roster of potential projects is ever final this process of identification and selection is and must be continuously repeated 16 the 2008 facility plan describes team approach and details the cooperation between the scientific and technical staff and the business operations staff all projects seeking funding in the mrefc move through progressive sequence of increasingly detailed development and assessment steps in order to be considered for construction support17 the lines of authority and responsibility are defined for the nsf director the participating division director the nsf program manager and the awardees project director in every large facility project the nsf program manager with the support of the participating division director has primary responsibility for all aspects of management in addition the nsf program manager is responsible for determining whether the project director and project management staff have the necessary training and skills for working on the project

project rsvp was initially nsbapproved for funding in october 2000 and was included in the fy2005 budget request as new construction project while the rsvp was in the design phase an analysis revealed that there could be significant increases in construction and operating costs the cost overruns generated interest from congress and the international scientific community an evaluation was conducted by scientific personnel internal and external to nsf in an attempt to resolve the cost increases in various elements of the project in august 2005 on the recommendation from nsf management the nsb terminated the rsvp nsf determined that continued support fo r the rsvp would cause unacceptable loss of research opportunities in elementary particle physics and other areas of science 18 the rsvp

instituted tighter standards and requir ements for receiving funding in this account included in the more stringent procedures was the implementation of cost overrun policy for major projects all projects seeking funding in the mrefc must move through progressive sequence of increasingly detailed development and assessment steps in order to be considered for construction support19 the cost estimates for projects developed at the preliminary design phase must include adequate contingencies in the absence of such contingencies any cost increase would result in reduction in scope for the
