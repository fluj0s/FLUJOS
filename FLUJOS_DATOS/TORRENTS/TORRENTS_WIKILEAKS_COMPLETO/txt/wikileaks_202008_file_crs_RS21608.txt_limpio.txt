resources science and industry division october 11 2005 abstract the environmental protection agency epa final rule on clarifying the definition of routine maintenance under its new source review nsr process exempts industrial facilities from undergoing nsr if they are replacing safety reliability and efficiency rated components with new functionally equivalent equipment and if the cost of the replacement components is under 2025 of the replacement value of the process unit essentially the rule permits owners of existing units to maintain and operate their units at their original design specifications without having to undergo nsr process that could require source to meet potentially expensive pollution control requirements the rule is controversial and being litigated in december 2003 threejudge panel of the dc circuit court of appeals blocked implementation of the rule until it can make final determination about the case legislation being considered in the 109th congress

larry parker specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21608 the environmental protection agency epa final rule on clarifying the definition of routine maintenance under its new source review nsr process exempts industrial facilities from undergoing nsr if they are replacing safety reliability and efficiency rated components with new functionally equivalent equipment and if the cost of the replacement components is under 2025 of the replacement value of the process unit essentially the rule permits owners of existing units to maintain and operate their units at their original design specifications without having to undergo nsr process that could require source to meet potentially expensive pollution control requirements the rule is controversial and being litigated in december 2003 threejudge panel of the dc circuit court of appeals blocked implementation of the rule until it can make final determination about the case legislation being considered in the 109th congress would permit the rule to go into effect this paper will be updated as events warrant the controversy over new source review nsr with respect to power generation focuses on existing facilities and the conditions under which facility modifications trigger nsr requirements to install pollution control equipment retrofitting and operating equipment designed to meet nsr requirements for existing facilities can be expensive and utilities have opposed recent efforts by the environmental protection agency epa to enforce nsr on existing powerplants in particular utilities have argued that modifications to their facilities reflect current maintenance practices and therefore are not modifications under the meaning of the clean air act caa on august 27 2003 the epa issued final rule1 on clarifying the definition of routine maintenance under nsr focused on existing sources the final rule exempts industrial facilities such as refineries and powerplants from undergoing nsr for replacing safety reliability and efficiency rated components with new functionally equivalent equipment if the cost of the replacement components is under 20 of the replacement 1 68 federal register 6124761280 october 27 2003 the equipment replacement provision is codified at 40 cfr 51166y for the psdnsr program and at 40 cfr 51165h for the non attainmentnsr program stayed indefinitely by court order december 24 2004 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 value of the facilitys process unit2 if the replacement activity exceeds this threshold casebycase determination will be made as to whether the plant undergoes nsr basically the final rule permits owners of existing facilities to maintain and operate their units at their basic design parameters defined in terms of maximum heat input and fuel consumption specifications without having to undergo nsr as stated in the rule by not imposing time limitation on permissible replacement activities the erp equipment replacement provision allows replacement activities to be driven by consideration of economic efficiency rather than artificial regulatory constraints3 the decision is highly controversial critics see the new regulation as permanently grandfathering older more polluting facilities from ever having to meet the clean air standards required of newer plants in october 2003 12 states and several major cities petitioned the dc circuit court of appeals to review the rule4 in december 2003 threejudge panel of the dc circuit court of appeals issued summary order blocking implementation of the rule until it can make final determination the court accepted the states argument that they would suffer irreparable harm if the rule was implemented and that the states also showed likelihood of success when the case is heard5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21608 the controversy has also led to congressional initiatives on september 28 2005 the house energy and commerce committee approved hr 3893 which would among other things amend the clean air act to codify by reference the new definition however the provision was removed from the bill before house passage october 9 20056 background to new source review the caa requires preconstruction review of and permit for almost any modification of an air polluting source or any major new source this preconstruction review process called nsr is triggered for any new source that potentially could emit 100 tons annually less in some areas of any criteria air pollutant and by any modification of an existing source that will cause significant increase in annual emissions the specific nsr requirements for affected sources depend on whether the sources are subject to prevention of significant deterioration psd or nonattainment provisions7 if covered by psd the source is required to install best available control technology bact which is determined on casebycase basis and which cannot be 2 process unit is basically everything from the coalhandling equipment to the smokestack with the exception of pollution control equipment 3 68 federal register 61255 october 27 2003 4

as being regulation in effect on december 31 2004 whether stayed regulation meets that criterion is unclear 7 see clean air act part c prevention of significant deterioration of air quality sections 160169 and part d plan requirements for nonattainment areas sections 171178 crs3 less stringent than the federally determined new source performance standard nsps for that pollutant if covered by nonattainment provisions the source is required to install lowest achievable emission rate laer and obtain applicable offsets for that particular area laer must not be less stringent than the federal nsps as defined under the 1970 caa modification is any physical change in or change in the method of operation of stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emittedsection 111a4 in subsequent regulations issued in 1975 with respect to nsps epa defined modification as any physical or operational change that resulted in any increase in the maximum hourly emission rate of any controlled air pollutant8 epa regulations also stated that any replacement of existing components that exceeded 50 of the fixed capital costs of building new facility placed the plant under nsps regardless of any change in emissions9 with the advent of national ambient air quality standards nonattainment provisions part d psd provisions part c and nsr in 1977 different approach to defining modification was appropriate as the focus was shifted from enforcing nsps emission rates to achieving attainment and compliance with psd in promulgating regulations for the psd and non httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21608 attainment programs epa defined significant increase in emissions in terms of tons per year emitted by major source for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the threshold is 40 tons per year10 facilities exceeding that threshold are subject to nsr fundamental to the debate on nsr enforcement with respect to existing facilities is the notion of routine maintenance in promulgating implementing regulations epa exempted certain activities from the definition of physical or operational change among those activities exempted was maintenance repair and replacement which the administrator determines to be routine for source category11 in addition increases in production rates that do not involve capital expenditures do not constitute modification responding to this situation utilities began to spread out their life extension efforts in an attempt to make them fit into their routine maintenance schedules12 the term life extension has fallen out of the professional literature13 the 8 40 cfr 6014a 1975 9 40 cfr 6015 1975 10 for psd see 40 cfr 5221b23i for nonattainment see 40 cfr 5224f10 11 40 cfr 6014e1 12 as observed by robert smock editor power plant life extension trend takes new directions power engineering february 1989 there are signs that many utilities will not use the term life extension to describe their spending on old power plants even though extended life is one of the major goals of the spending program the reason for the aversion to the term lies in the 1970 clean air act that federal law requires all power plants constructed after august 1971 to restrict emissions of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide plants built prior to 1971 are exempt which includes most of the early candidates for life extensions the problem is that the law also says that grandfathered plants can lose their exemption if they are modified or reconstructed in major way and emission of proscribed pollutants are increased p 21 13 robert g presnak and bock h yee life extension the benefits are real power engineering december 1993 pp 2527 crs4 commonly used term currently is rehabilitation program14 by spreading out the life extension efforts and integrating them into facilities operation and maintenance schedules the distinction between modification and routine maintenance is effectively blurred and arguably eliminated rehabilitation programs utilities initiated in the 1980s and continuing to the present have dramatically reduced the aging process of coalfired facilities the issue is whether this activity violates the modification definition of nsr if routine maintenance is defined in terms of average industry maintenance practice at the time of the 1970 or 1977 clean air act amendments then strong case can be made that it is major components are being replaced or upgraded that would not have been under average industry maintenance practices of that time yet if routine maintenance is interpreted to mean industry practices currently then one can argue that rehabilitation has become routine over the past 20 years and thus does not represent modification this is fundamental to the way one views epas new definition of routine maintenance if one believes that epas routine maintenance exemption as enunciated in the 1970s was delimited and not license to rehabilitate existing facilities then one httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21608 would conclude that many of the industrys maintenance activities of the last 20 years go beyond what nsr allows this perspective challenges the administrations argument that its nsr revision will reduce emissions beyond that required under current law the viewpoint that applying the nsr requirement to rehabilitation projects would reduce emissions is consistent with the enforcement initiative of the clinton administration for which the bush administration has stated support in contrast if one believes that an exemption for routine maintenance is appropriate and should be defined in terms of current industry practices then one would conclude that the potential threat of nsr and the installation of bact or laer prevents owners from making costeffective improvements in the overall performance and efficiency of their existing facilities thereby foregoing opportunities to conserve energy this perspective that nsr discourages energy efficiency is reflected in the bush administrations revisions to routine maintenance proposed in december 200215 and promulgated in august 2003 discussion as finalized epas definition of routine maintenance will permit current utility rehabilitation practices to continue without the threat of triggering nsr the changes to the definition of routine maintenance are focused on energy policy considerations not environmental considerations epa contends the changes will have significant impact on emissions epas logic for the new definition contains three parts 14 for current view of managing existing facilities see jason makansi rehab get the most from the existing asset base power june 1999 pp 3040 15 67 federal register 8029080314 december 31 2002 see crs report rl31757 clean air new source review policies and proposals by larry parker crs5 first epa believes nsr should apply when activities involve the total replacement of an existing entire process16 however the final rule with its 20 cost trigger with time constraints would in effect permit activities that would replace the entire process over time at least for power plants as stated in the final rule data indicate that most typical replacement activities will fall within the 20percent threshold17 second epa believes modification includes any activity that upgrades facility beyond its original maximum fuel use design parameters but upgrading an existing unit to its original specifications even if actual emissions increase is allowed an equipment replacement that improves process units efficiency and thereby enables the unit to return to its design parameters can quality as rmrr routine maintenance repair and replacement even if current actual emissions increase as result18 third while epa believes that complete reconstruction should not be allowed it also believes that the breadth of exclusion permitted by any definition of routine maintenance is irrelevant in terms of reducing powerplant emissions in qualitative discussion of utility behavior and the potential emissions impact of narrow definition of routine maintenance epa states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21608 narrow rmrr exclusion that is clearly established is not expected to achieve significant reduction in historic emission levels and might even lead to area wide emissions increases most facilities would take lawful steps to avoid having to obtain an nsr permit that would impose strict limitations even when replacements would be found under this narrow exclusion to be nonroutine19 if the breadth of definition does not affect emissions it is not clear why it matters whether utility can completely reconstruct facility or why 20 threshold is better than 50 threshold if epas concerns are primarily energy policy driven and focused on providing industry with clear parameters simple cost trigger without any functional restraint is well within the rationales presented in epas final rule these perceptions of nsr contrast strongly with those held during the clinton administration in announcing series of nsr suits in 1999 the epa administrator stated that controlling the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from these plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction respectively in these pollutants20 based on her statement this would reduce so2 emissions by 187 million tons and nox emissions by 063 million tons also given the widespread nature of life extension efforts it is reasonable to assume that further reductions would be achieved as other utilities either installed bact or retired their offending facilities it would appear that very substantial 16 68 federal register 61256 october 27 2003 17 68 federal register 61257 october

prepared for delivery clean air enforcement press conference washington dc november 3 1999 crs6 emissions reductions could be achieved by rigorous enforcement of nsr using the previous definition of routine maintenance rather than epas new one the best analysis of future possibilities under previous nsr regulations is by the energy information administration eia21 the three relevant scenarios are 1 reference enforcement including halting current lawsuits 2 nsr 32 enforcement limited to the current lawsuits and 3 nsr all enforcement expanded to include all coalfired plants over 25 megawatts the projected 2010 so2 and nox results under these three scenarios are presented in table 1 as indicated depending on ones expectation with respect to nsr enforcement in lieu of the epa final rule on routine maintenance the difference in emissions could be on the order of factor of five table 1 eias 2010 nsr reference cases emissions from coalfired electric generating facilities nox emissions so2

table 20 in its final rule epa dismisses this scenario using the argument identified above epa also notes that there are other clean air act programs particularly title iv that control sulfur dioxide emissions from powerplants indeed the current epa argues that title iv results in net reductions in emission from nsr actions because any reductions achieved could be sold under the title iv allowance program to other facilities in fact however epa has resolved this problem in all of its settlements under its enforcement by requiring the utility to retire the so2 allowances freed up22 the rules issuance and subsequent stay by the court has engendered debate hr 3893 as introduced by representative barton contained provision that would have amended the clean air act to codify the new regulations for all industrial sources in addition hr 3893 would also have extended to all industrial categories the nsr provisions exempting existing power plant modifications that do not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any regulated pollutant however these provisions were removed from the bill before the house passed it on october 9 2005 potential senate action on such provisions is
