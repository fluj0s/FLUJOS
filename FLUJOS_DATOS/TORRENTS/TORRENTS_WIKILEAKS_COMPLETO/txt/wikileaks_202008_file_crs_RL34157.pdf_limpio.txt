threat posed by muslim extremists in the caribbean according to this view while there are doubts that the accused had the resour ces and expertise to carry out the plot the very presence of such

countries with employers often unwilling to hire deportees because of the perception that they are hardened criminals that cannot be trusted caribbean officials often fuel the stigma by contending
