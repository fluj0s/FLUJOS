richard s beth specialist in the legislative process government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135nuclear waste repository siting expedited procedures for congressional approval summary the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa as amended establishes process for the federal govern ment to designate site for permanent repository for civilian nuclear waste in february 2002 this process culminated in presidential recommendation for repository at yucca m ountain nevada on april 8 the state of nevada exercised its aut hority under nwpa to disapprove the site as result of this state disapproval the site may be pproved only if joint resolution of repository siting approval becomes law after being passed by congress during the first period of 90 days of continuous session after the disapproval this period appears likely to terminate just after the august recess the act establishes an expedited pro cedure for congressiona l consideration of this approval resolution purs uant to this expedited pr ocedure approval resolutions were introduced in both houses and referred to the respective committees of jurisdiction which had until the 60th day of continuous session after the state disapproval to report or be discharged the house committee reported on may 1 and the senate committee on june 10 in the house once an approval resolution has been on the calendar for 5 legislative days supporter may call it up if the speaker recognizes him or her for the purpose after 2 hours of debate the house then votes on the resolution without amendment or other intervening motion the house passed its resolution on may 8 in the senate once such resolution is on the calendar any senator may make nondebatable motion to proceed to consider it normally such motion would be offered by the majority leader if reject ed the motion may be repeated if adopted the senate debates the resolution fo r 10 hours which may be reduced by nondebatable motion after wh ich final vote occurs the statutory procedure forestalls filibusters against the resolution by prohibiting most intervening motions or other actions but does not on its face preclude amendment of the resolution an attempt to consider the measure in the senate was expected in early july after one house passes an approval reso lution the other takes up and debates its own measure but takes final vote on the measure received from the first house this procedure facilitates clearing the re solution for presidential action the act provides for this action to occur only if the two measures are identical as the present house and senate measures are if th senate resolution we re to be amended however the terms of the act would apparently make this clearance procedure unavailable an amended measure also would cease to have the form prescribed by the nwpa for an approval resolution nd accordingly might fail to qualify for further action under the expedited procedure either house might overcome such diffi culties by using its constitutional power over its own rules to alter the procedur by which it considered an approval resolution if an approval resolution were enacted in diffe rent form from that prescribed by the nwpa however it might arguably fail to meet the requirements of the act for permitting construction of the repositoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135contents background 1 pr c ss

federal government to establish d eep underground geologic repository for permanent storage of radioactive waste from civilian nuclear power plants pursuant to the nwpa and subsequent amendments consideration of location for this repository focused on site at yucca mount ain nevada the partment of energy issued preliminary recommendation of itability for the yucca mountain site on september 21 2001 and on february 15 2002 president bush recommended the site to congress2 these actions culminated series of recent developments that have led to current congressi onal action on the subject3 the nwpa provides that when the president recommends repository site the state in which it is located may within 60 days submit to congress notice of disapproval4 the state of nevada exercised this disapproval authority on april 8 once this action occurs the act provide s that the designation cannot become effective unless resolution of repository siting approval in effect overriding the state disapproval is enacted into law within specified period of time5 as detailed below it appears that in the present instance this period will probably terminate just after congress reconvenes fro m its

jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives of the united states one hundred seventh congress hdoc 106320 106th cong 2nd sess prepared by charles w johnson parliamentarian washington gpo 2001 sec 1130the act establishes an expedited pro cedure for congressiona l consideration of this joint resolution this report descri bes salient features of this expedited procedure and discusses some questions that may become significant in the course of its implementation it also notes actions so far taken in congress pursuant to this statutory procedure in rela tion to the yucca mountain site general purposes of statut ory expedite d procedures in purpose and general form the exped ited procedure of the nwpa resembles the several dozen other expedited procedur contained in existing law relating to various policy areas6 each of these expedited pro cedures is set of statutory provisions governing congressional consider ation of specified kind of measure most regulate consideration of joint resolutions either 1 to disapprove some action that the statute authorizes the president or an agency of the executive branch to take only if congress does not disa pprove or 2 to approve so action that statute authorizes to be taken only if congre ss approves specific request to do so the purpose of an expedited procedure is to facilitate the ability of congress to dispose of the matter speci fied in timely and defi nitive way to this nd it establishes means for congress to take up and complete action on the resolution of approval or disapprova l within limited period of time for this reason expedited procedures are also known as fast track procedures they often include provisions for automatic introduction of the re solution fixed time periods for co mmittee and floor action automatic or pr ivileged discharge of committ ees if they do not report automatic or privileged floor consider ation prohibitions on amendment and automatic or expedited final action to send measure to the president the expedited procedure of the nwpa incorporates most of these elements elements of the expedited procedure the expedited procedure for resolutions of repository siting approval which appears at 42 usc 10135 gene rally conforms to the mode l just sketched the act sets forth procedures for the house nd senate separately but the following discussion treats both together at each stage of the legislative process this treatment permits emphasis on possible re lations between actions in each chamber the only exception is the floor consideration stage where the procedures prescribed by statute for house and senate are adapted to the di vergent general rules of the two chambershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs3 7 42 usc sec 10135c 8 42 usc sec 10136b2 9 42 usc sec 10135f 10

service johnny h killian and george costello coeditors washington gpo 1996 pp 121122 hereafter cited as constitution annotated 11 42 usc sec 10135foverall schedule for action the act permits congress to override state notice of disapproval only if it passes joint resolution of repository siting approval during the first period of 90 days of continuous session after receiving the notice7 the notice is deemed received by congress on the day the state tran smits it to the speaker of the house and president pro tempore of the senate and the 90day period begins on that day8 days of continuous s ession days of continuous session include all calendar days except those on which either house is adjourned for more than three days9 under this definition the 90day peri od will be the same for both chambers even if the days on which each is in r ecess differ the constitution mandates that neither house adjourn for more than 3 da ys without the consent of the other10 pursuant to this mandate each house recesse s its session for more than 3 days only under authority of an adjournment resolu tion which is concurrent resolution adopted by both houses as result the days not counted in the 90day period will be only and exactly those included in an session recess of either house that is authorized by an adjournment resolution it is evident from this definition that actual days of continuous session can be counted with certainty only after the fact prospectively the count can be only an estimate based on the recess periods that have occurred so far in 2002 and the announced congressional schedule for the rema inder of the year however it currently appears that 90 days of continuous sessi on after april 8 will expire on or about wednesday september 4 the senate is scheduled to return from its august recess the preceding tuesday and the house on the wednesday continuing action in new session if congress adjourns its session sine die before the 90day period expires tinuity of session is broken meaning that new period of continuous session be gins with the convening of the next session11 as result if state notice of disapproval were to be received less than 90 days of continuous session before sine die adjournment congress would have until the 90th day of continuous session in the fo llowing session to complete action under the statute because c ongress is not scheduled to conclude its current session within 90 days of session from the april 8 notice these provisions are unlikely to come into play in the present instancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs4 12 42 usc sec 10135c 13 42 usc sec 10135a 14 42 usc sec 10135b and 10135cthese provisions could come into play if congress were to receive disapproval notice late in session of congress if the notice were received late in first session and if congress did not complete action on an approval resolution during that session the same resolu tion would remain available for further action during the full renewed 90day period in the second ssion by contrast if the notice were received late in second session the follo wing session would be the first session of the next congress for this reason if congress did not complete action on an approval resolution during th earlier session the legisl ation would have to be introduced anew in the new congress and proceed through the full legislative process novo during the first 90 days of tinuous session of that new congress enactment to become effective the joint resolution of approval must become law after congress passes it in ot her words the site is approved only if either 1 the president signs the approval resolution or allows it to become law without his signature or 2 congress ove rrides his veto these actions however do not have to occur within the 90day period but can be completed after its expiration12 form of approval resolution the nwpa narrowly specifies the form resolution of repository siting approval must take the measure must be joint resolution and the statute prescribes all the wording except for 1 the identification of the site 2 the name of the disapproving state nd 3 the date of disapproval13 these requirements doubtless suffice to ensure that any compan ion house and senate measures relating to the same site would be substantially similar thoug h not necessarily entirely identical any resolution that did not m eet these statutory requirements would not be eligible for the expedited consideration prescribed by the act in the present instance only one resolution was introduced in each house hjres 87 and sjres 34 and the two are identical in wording the terms of the nwpa also specify that state disapproval of site designation can be overridden only by enactment of resolution of repository siting approval having the form prescribed by the act and considered under the expedited procedure14 in principle of course cong ress could also enact legislation superseding the nwpa and directing constr uction of the repository under its regular legislative procedures introduction and referral introduction the statutory procedures for introduction of resolutions of repository siting approval differ between the house and senate for the senate the act mandates that the chair of the co mmittee of jurisdiction or his designee introduce an approval resolution by the ne xt day of session after congress receiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs5 15 42 usc sec 10135d2a 16 42 usc sec 10135e2 17 42 usc sec 10135d2b and 10135e2 the senate language additionally specifies that all

and 10135d3 senate the disapproval notice15 the corresponding house provision contains requirement that an approval resoluti on be introduced although other provisions assume that one will be16 as result it is possible for an approval resolution not to be introduced in the house at all or to be introduced only at later date the current process realizes this last possibility in the senate the chair of the committee on energy and natural resources introduced sjres 34 by request on april 9 consistent with the statutory dir ective in the house the chair of the subcommittee on energy and air quality of the committee on energy and commerce introduced hjres 87 on april 11 for each chamber the language of th act presupposes that several approval resolutions might be introduced in relation to single site disapproval even though all such measures would have to be either identical or substantially so such additional resolutions have been introduced in relation to the yucca mountain site referral for each chamber the act requires approval resolutions to be referred upon introduction to the appropriate committee or committees17 sjres 34 was referred to the senate committee on energy and natural resources and hjres 87 to the committee on energy and commerce like most if not all expedited procedure statutes the act leaves the question of subcommittee referral to the practices of the respective committees hjres 87 was referred to the subcommittee on energy and air quality sjres 34 received subcommittee referral committee action requirement for re port or discharge although the language governing committee consideration of resolutions of repository siting approval differs between the house and senate the effects are similar the committee or committees of referral have 60 days of c ontinuous session defined in the same way as for the 90 day period to report an pproval resolution if committee did not report by the end of the 60day period it would automatically be discharg ed and the resolution placed on the appropriate cal endar of its house18 the statutory 60day period by the end of which the committee must report or be discharged begins in each chamber with the introduction of the first approval resolution in the house this point woul d have been reached on or about june 18 but the committee on energy and commerce reported hjres 87 on april 25 in the senate the automatic di scharge date would have b een reached on or about junehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs6 19 for the house see sec 2 of calendars in william holmes brown house practice guide to

gpo 1992 p 1183 20 42 usc sec 10135e3 21 as noted earlier it is possible that reso lutions approving the same site may not be completely identical in text the wording of the act does not explicitly preclude discharge of an approval resolution that is substantivel equivalent but not identical to one that has been reported 22 42 usc sec 10135d316 but the committee on energy and natural resources reported sjres 34 on june 10 although the house committee reported the measure favorably the statute does not require favorable report under contemporary practice measure in the senate or privileged measure in the house reported adversely or without recommendation is still placed on the cale ndar as eligible for consideration19 resolution of repository siting approval is privileged measure in the house in that it is to be considered unde r an expedited procedure action may be limited to one resolution for each chamber the expedited procedure includes mechanism to ensure that even if more than one repository siting resolution is introduced onl one will reach the calendar inasmuch as only one resolution relative to the yu cca mountain site appeared in each house these procedures have not come in to play during the present process for the house the statute specifies that the committee may be discharged only from the first approval resolution introduced and the committee can avoid this occurrence by reporting either that re solution or an identical resolution20 if several identical resolutions are submitted and the committee reports any one of them it is not discharged from any of the others21 if several resolutions are introduced approving the same site and the committee reports none of them it is apparently discharged from only the first one introduced even if the others are not identical on the other hand if the co mmittee reports resolution that is not identical to the first one introduced it apparently will also be discharged from that first one so that in this case both measures would reach the calendar for the senate the statute specifies that the resolution from which the committee is to be discharged is the one that was automatically introduced when notice of the state disapproval was receive d however the act also provides for discharge to occur in the absence of the automatically introduced resolution22 this provision might come into play only in renewed 90day peri od in new congress when the automatically introduced resolution would have died with the sine die adjournment of the old congress in th at situation if committee does not report an approval resolution by the 60th day of continuous session in the new congress it will be discharged from all approval resoluti ons introduced in that house in the new congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs7 23 42 usc sec 10135e4 legislative day begins each time the house convenes after adjourning because the house normally adjourns at the end of each days session legislative days are normally equal to days of session in new congress discharge and other components of the expedited procedure presumably could occur in each chamber only if new approval resolution has been introduced floor action under the expedited procedure and its alternatives the expedited procedure of the nwpa tablishes terms for floor consideration of resolutions of repository siting approva l in each chamber like other statutes establishing expedited procedures however the act also reserves the right of each house to alter or amend those procedures th rough the application of its general power under the constitution over its own rules as result it always remains possible that either house could consider any particular siting appr oval resolution under other terms than those provided by the statute the ways in which each house may make such alterations and some possible implications and alternatives of its doing so are discussed in later section of this report the house in par ticular has not infrequently ta ken up measures eligible for expedited consideration not under the stat utory procedures but instead pursuant to special rule or motion to suspend the rules in the present instance however the house took up and passed hjres 87 pursuan t to the statutory procedure on may 8 house floor action discretion of speaker many expedited procedure statutes protect the ability of members to call up the measures whose consideration they govern once they reach the calendar the expedited procedure of the nwpa by contrast leaves control over when and whether the house will consider an approval resolution in the hands of the majority party leadership this situation is more in harmony with house scheduling practices generally once the resolution has been on the calendar for 5 legislative days the speaker may recognize member to call it up23 because the act accords the speaker discretion over whether to recognize for this purpose he would be able to keep siting approval resolution from the floor by declining to do so conversely the act provides that when an approval reso lution is called up the house proceeds immediately to consider it this provision tends to ensure that as long as the speaker does choose to recognize member to call the resolution up consideration will occur terms of debate when the house takes up an approval resolution the speaker recognizes the member calling it up and an opponent for 2 hours of debatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs8 24 42 usc sec 10135e4 25 42 usc sec 10135e4 26 although the prohibition on amendment appear s among the provisions on floor procedure it also implies that the committee would repor t amendment because any such committee amendment would not be in order on the floor anywayequally divided and controlled24 the act requires the member calling up the resolution to be supporter of it and the opposing manager to be an opponent under the general practice of the house the managers of measure would typically be the chair and ranking minority member of the reporting committee or their designees these members would normally be the ones recognized to manage an approval resolution as long as they qualified as supporting and opposing it respectively it would be consistent with the customary practice of the house for the speaker to ask each prospective manager at the outse t of consideration if he or she supported or opposed the resolution if either c ould not answer appropriately the speaker would most likely recognize another senior member of the reporting committee who did take the appropriate position for exam ple if the resolution was not reported but reached the calendar by discharg the committee chair might well oppose it the chair then would not be entitled to recogn ition to call the measure up but would most likely be accorded the time in opposition if he sought it in the present instance the chair of the committee on energy and commerce managed hjres 87 and the ranking minor ity member of one of its subcommittees managed the measure for opponents prohibition on amendm ent and motions the act directs that at the end of the 2 hours debate in the house the previous question be automatically ordered and the house proceed to vote on adopting the resolution it also prohibits the intervention of any motion between the conclusion of deba and the vote on adoption finally it explicitly prohibits amendment of an approval resolution25 these procedures are clearly designed to insure that the house vote on adoption will be on the resolution in its original fo rm without amendment in their absence an amendment might be offered 1 during the two hours debate but only if one of the managers yielded for the purpose 2 if the house voted not to order the previous question or 3 through amendatory instructions in motion to recommit26 motion to recommit is normally in order at the conclusion of c onsideration but under the expedited procedure of the nwpa as just mentioned an intervening motion at that point is prohibited finally the act also prohibits motion to reconsider the vote on an approval resolution like the provisions to bring about the report or discharge of only one approval resolution this prohib ition helps to ensure that the expedited procedure willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs9 27 42 usc sec 10135e4if more than one approval resolution were to r each

procedures that became available for senate floor consideration 19872000 by richard s beth 30 42 usc sec 10135d4anormally give the house one and only one opportunity to act on resolution to approve any given repository site27 senate floor action control of motion to proceed in the senate the expedited procedure provides that once an approval resolution is on the calendar any senator may move to proceed to its consideration28 if the senate disagrees to this motion the act provides that it may be repeated and if more than one approval resolution reaches the calendar the motion also might be offered with respect to each by early july it was expected that supporters of sjres 34 might offer motion to proceed to its consideration before the middle of the month in the absence of earlier action by the majority leader some discussion has occurred over whether it would be inappropriate fo r any senator other than the majority leader or his designee to offer motion to proceed to consider the resolution pursuant to the statute in practice the senate normally concedes to its majority leader the prerogative of making motions to proceed to consider pursuant to the standing rules although the standing rules in principle pe rmit any senator to offer this motion the senate accords the majority leader the function of managing the floor agenda and considers control of the motion to procee d key tool in the discharge of that function some accordingly argue that th same prerogative should be extended to motion to proceed to consider offered pursuant to the statute others contend that the statutory provision is evidently intended to insure that the measure can reach the floor whether or not the leader ship determines to call it up29 regulation of motion to proceed normally motion to proceed to consider in the senate is debatable but the act provides that on resolution of repository siting approval it is nondebatable the act pr ovides as well that this motion may neither be amende d nor superseded by motion to consider something else and its considera tion may not be postponed30 these provisions help ensure that an attempt to take up an approval resolu tion could not be bloc ked by filibustering that is protracted debate or other actions with dilato ry or obstructive intent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs10 31 42 usc sec 10135d4a 32 42 usc sec 10135d4b 33 42 usc sec

business until disposed of31 this provision is designed to help ensure that once the senate takes up an approval resolution it will be able to reach final vote all of these provisions are common f eatures of expedited procedures governing senate floor consideration terms of debate and regulation of motions provisions for floor consideration also include many feat ures common among senate expedited procedures designed to prevent the approval resolution fro m being blocked by filibuster in particul ar total debate on the re solution is limited to 10 hours32 such time limitation is requisite for precluding filibusters for senate rules establish neither general time limit on debate nor any procedure other than cloture to impose such limit the time is to be equally divided betw een supporters and opponents normally the senate accomplishes th is end by placing the equally divided time under the control of managers the ma nagers would typically be the chair and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction if they take opposed positions on the resolution at the conclu sion of debate the vote on the resolution must occur quorum call but other action may intervene33 as with the house the expedited procedure also prohib its motion to reconsider the vote34 the act specifies that the 10hour limit includes any deba on debatable motions offered during consider ation of the resolution it also specifies that any appeal of ruling of the chair in connection with consideration shall not be debatable35 the act permits as well nonde batable motion to reduce the time available for debate and this motion like the motion to proceed to consider may neither be superseded by motion to cons ider something else nor amended nor may its consideration be postponed36 potential for amendment although the statutory procedure prohibits amendment of the motion to proceed to c onsider an approval re solution and of the motion to reduce the time for debating one it contains provision precluding amendment of the approval resolution itself the act does forbid motion to recommit the resolution which might have included amendatory instructions37 but does not explicitly prohibit the offering of an amendment by other means either from the floor or by recommendation of the reporting committee it is unclear whether this omission was deliberate though it may be noteworthy that congress found it appropriate to include an explicit prohibition against amendment for the house but not for the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs11 38 for further analysis see crs c ongressional distribution memoranda legislative history of provision permitting senate amendment to approval resolution under expedited procedure of nuclear waste policy act and how the nuclear waste policy act and other expedited procedures regulate amendment in the senate by richard s beth 39 42 usc sec 10135d5 senate and 10135e5 houseon the other hand it can be argued that the legislative history of the nwpa as well as the overall purposes of expedited procedures generally imply that the approval resolution wa s intended not to be subject to amendment in either house the close specification made by the act for the language of resolution of repository siting approval might be cited in support of the same conclusion if the senate took such view many of the questions ra ised in this section would not arise38 if the senate took the view that s iting approval resoluti on could be amended the potential consequences of adopting an amendment to the resolution are also unclear it might be argued that if the resolution were amended it would cease to meet the description required by 42 usc sec 10135a for resolution of repository siting approval it might thereby become ineligible for further consideration under the expedite d procedure for example if the senate adopted an amendment to an approval resolution it might be possible for senator to raise point of order that the amended measure was longer subject to the limits on debate that the act establishes as part of th expedited procedures for considering an approval resolution if the chair sustained ch point of order further consideration would presumably have to occur under th general rules of the senate potentially making the resolution subject to dilatory action final action resolution received from other house the expedited procedure for each house contains provisi on identical except for reversing the names of the chambers to ensure that both will take final action on the same measure and single approval resolution will be cleared for pres idential action these provisions together direct that when either house passes an approval resolution the other house is not to refer it to committee but is to hold it at the desk this action maintains the resolution passed by the other house in convenient st atus for the r eceiving house to act on it floor consideration in the receiving house is to occur on its own approval resolution with respect to the same site but the final vote is to occur on the one received from the other house39 in the present instance after the senate finishes considering sjres 34 it will presumab ly vote on the housepassed hjres 87 which it has already received unless perhaps sjres 34 has by then been amended mechanism like this is part of many expedited procedure statutes that provide for the resolutions considered by each hous to be substantively similar in effect under these conditions it is ppropriate to substitute one fo r the other as convenient means to expedite final action each house must first consider own measure unlike some other expedited procedures that of the nwpa provides for floor consideration in eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs12 house to occur only on resolution of that house it affords means by which either house might instead initially take up and consid er an approval resolution received from the other yet it does not requi re that any separate approval resolution be introduced in the house or in either chamber during renewed 90day period in new congress the consequence is th at approval resolution can be enacted under the expedited procedure unless some member of the house or in renewed 90day period in new congress members of both houses chooses to introduce one requirement for identity the provision for final action contains two different phrases whose langua ge seems create conflict the first phrase states that the provision applies to any situation in which both houses pa ss approval resolutions with respect to the same site the second phrase however permits the automatic substitution of one resolution for the other only where the text is identical the second phrase unlike the first appears to afford an automatic mechanism for final congressional action only if th approval resolutions of both houses are identical in text the language includes provision for automatic final action if the two resolutions are merely substantively similar in effect strict interpretation of this language might be used to raise point of order in whichever house acts second at the time of final vote if the text of its approval resolution differed in any way from the one received from the other house such point of order could assert that the act did not permit the approval resolution originating in that house to be automatically laid aside after bate and final action to be taken on the one recei ved because th act authorizes this proceeding only if the two are identical if the chair sustained this interpretation the house in question would presumably ve to take its final vote instead on its own resolution the act however establishes further pr ocedure by which either house could then clear for presidential action an approval resolution received from the other instead this final clearing action might have to occur under the general rules of each house so that it might become possible for opponents to subject this action to dilatory or obstructive tactics in the present situation the texts of th only two resolutions of repository siting approval that have been introduced are identical as long as that identity persists the difference in language between the two phrases in the expedited procedure would presumably generate difficulties difference in text between the house and senate measures might still arise however if the senate amended its measure in the course of its proceedings or possibly if an additional measure with slightly different wording were to be introduced reporte d in lieu of sjres 34 called up for consideration and adopted in that form if the senate were ultimate ly to adopt repository siting resolution measure with text different from that of hjres 87 as passed by the house senator might conceivably be able to raise point of or der against invoking th statutory procedure for clearing the measure for pr esidential action if this poi nt of order were sustained action to clear the measure would have to take place under the general rules of the senate which could entail debatable motions considered without statutory time limitations these proceedings could delay final actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs13 40 42 usc sec 10135d1 senate and 10135e1 house constitution article i section 5 in constitution annotated p 123congressional power to alter statutory procedures the preceding discussion identifies numbe r of difficulties that might arise in the course of considerati on of resolution of reposit ory siting approval under the expedited procedure of the nwpa in particular the sena might amend its approval resolution in such way that its text longer met the statutory requirements for resolution of repository siting approval the amended measure might accordingly be held ineligible for further consideration under the expedited procedure also because of such amendment or for other reasons the texts of the approval resolutions originating in the house and the senate might differ this situation might make the automatic procedure to clear an approval resolution for the president unavailable in either chamber the congressional rulemaking power the constitutional power of each house to make its own rules could afford means for dealing with such complications it is well established that this power extends to procedural provisions contained in statute as well as to the procedural rules each chamber establishes for itself further the expedited procedure of the nwpa like most explicitly declares that the procedural provisions applicable to each house are enacted as an exercise of that constituti onal power and are subject to change by action of that house alone as further exercise of the same power40 it is also well established in each house that this constitutional rulemaking power may be exercised in various ways rules may be adopt ed or altered on permanent basis they may also be wa ived suspended or modified in their application to specific situation finally the power to make rules is implicitly understood to include the power to interpret th em or to decide what they mean in specific situation by its own action pursuant to the rule making power accordingly either house could modify or alter provisions of the ex pedited procedure ither permanently and generally with respect to c onsideration of any future pproval resolution or for the purpose of considering specific approva l resolution presum ably eith er house could provide either 1 that resolution of siting approval as defined by the act be considered other than under the expedited pr ocedure or that 2 some other form of measure to authorize construction of the repository be considered under procedures equivalent to the statutor expedited procedure ways of applying the rulemaking power amendment of rules each house establishes nd amends its general rules by adopting resolutions because each house retains authority ove r its own respective rules such resolutions require adoption only in the house affected in principlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs14 either house could use such resolution to effect permanent ch ange in statutory expedited procedure as well for example the senate could supplement the statutory procedure of the nwpa by adopting re solution explicitly prohibiting amendment of siting approval resolution in the same way either house could extend the mechanism for automatic final action on an approval resolution received from the other chamber to all cases in which both resolutions address the same site even if their texts are not identical in practice this approach would likely be more feasible in the house than in the senate in the house resolution to ch ange the rules would normally be reported by the committee on rules which typically operates in cooperati on with the majority party leadership on such matters such resolutions are considered under procedures that permit the house by vote to termin ate debate after one hour and to prohibit amendment in the senate such reso lution either would be reported by the committee on rules and adminis tration or in the abse nce of objection could be brought directly to the floor by the major ity leader however it would be considered under the general rules of the senate meaning that it coul d be subjected to extended debate amendment and other potentially dilatory actions modification suspension or waiver of rules each house possesses various established procedures permitting it to alter the application of its rules to specific measure or in sp ecific situation the house often does so by adopting special rule for consideration of speci fied measure just before consideration begins like permanent change in rule s special rule takes the form of resolution that the committee on rules has jurisdiction to report and is considered under procedures that permit the house to vote to terminate debate and preclude amendment after one hour in the past the majority party l eadership and committee on rules have often preferre d that measures eligible for expedited procedures be considered instead under special rules th is form of consideration preserves to greater degree the normal control of the leadership over floor action special rule for consideration of siting approval resolution could provide that after consideration of the house meas ure an automatic final vote occur on any senate measure approving the same site that the house might already have received or even on one that it might later receive alternatively it also would be within the scope of normal practice for special rule to provide that the approval resolution be considered under an entirely different proce dure from that specified in the act special rule might for example provide that the resolution be called up immediately or in the discretion of the speaker provi for or prohibit amendment shorten or lengthen the time for debate alter the division and control of that time or permit or waive the application of certain points of order as the leadership and the committee found appropriate the house also often supersedes the pr ocedures otherwise applicable to the consideration of specific measure by considering the measure pursuant to motion to suspend the rules motion to suspend the rules and pass measure is subject to 40 minutes debate precludes floor amendment and requires twothirds vote finally the house could consider an appr oval resolution by unanimous consent and the unanimous consent request might include specification of terms of considerationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs15 41 the senate also permits motion to waive certain procedural requirements by majority or in some cases threefifths vote but this mechanism is applicable only to requirements imposed by specified provisions of the congressional budget actthe senate normally establishes modifi ed or altered procedures for the consideration of specific measure only by unanimous consent it is normally considered the prerogative of the major ity leader to propound requests for unanimous consent for such purposes the senate of ten uses unanimous consent agreements of this kind to restrict or even prohibit amendments to specified measure and sometimes to provide that final action on companion measure received from the house occur automatically in contentious situations such as may likely accompany consideration of siting approval resolution however unanimous consent to an agreement regulating consideration in ch ways may be difficult to obtain senate rules also include proce dure little known today for suspending specified rules in relation to action on given measure although such motion could presumably be used in relation to statutory provisions operating as rules it appears ill adapted for this purpose senate rules impose time limit on consideration of motion to suspend the rules so that it could be subjected to filibuster delaying or bloc king the attempt to establish any modified procedure for acting on the approval resolution as in the house suspension of the rules in the senate requires twothirds vote41 interpreting rules through application in recent times the senate has more often exercised its power to determine the intent and effect of its rules by voting on procedural questions either submitted to it by the chair or arising through appeals of rulings of the chair if floor ame ndment were offered to an approval resolution for example the senate might decide on appeal that the statute implicitly forbade such amendments if an amendment to th resolution were adopt ed the senate might in the same way decide that the ame nded statute still qualified for further consideration under the ex pedited procedure this course of action would presumably not be subject to filibuster because the statute requires that all appeals on ques tions raised during consideration of an approval resolution be settled without bate action of the nate in this form however would not merely determine the application of the rule in the particular situation in which the question was rais ed because the nate possesses ultimate authority to determine its own rules its decision on question such as this would establish precedent it would conclusively establish the general meaning of the statutory provision subject to revision only by subsequent action of the senate itself in principle the house might engage in similar proceedings but in practice that chamber has strong tradition of deferring to the rulings of its speaker on procedural questions point of order might be raise d for example that th statutory procedure for automatic final action on an approval resolution was intended to apply whenever received senate companion would approve the same repository site as the house measure even if the text is not identical if the speaker sustained the point of order the house would in all probability accept such ruling or at least sustain it if it were appealed subsequently the house w ould doubt accept this ruling as precedenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs16 controlling the meaning of the provision for any future uses of the expedited procedure additional statutory requirements for site approval the previous section addresses whether if an approval re solution were to be amended into form other than that pres cribed by the nwpa it would continue to be eligible for consideration under the xpedited procedure of the act certain provisions of the act however suggest that if the measure were enacted in such form it might raise additional questions as well pursuant to this language it might be argued that unless measure had the form prescribed for an approval resolution it might not suffice to authorize construc tion of the repository related passages could be used to argue that even if the measure had the prescribed form it might not achieve its purpose if congress did not pa ss it during the prescribed 90day period requirements of form and timing expedited procedure statutes commonly permit congress to approve or disapprove specified action by using the expedited procedure to enact the measure for which the statute provides they do not purport to require congress to use for this purpose the means of approval or di sapproval they provide the language of the nwpa appears to reflect an intent to go farther and prohibit construction of civilian nuclear waste repository unless congress enacts the resolution of approval in the prescribed form within the specified 90day period specifically subsection b of 42 usc section 10135 states that once state notice of disapproval has been submitted the designation of such site shall not be effective except as provided under subsection c subsection c provides that under these conditions the site shall be disapproved unless during the prescribed 90day period the congress passes resolution of repository siting approval in accordance with this subsection approving this site italics added throughout the text that resolution of repository siting pproval must possess is prescribed as already noted by subsection by statutory language of course could congress vitiate its own capacity subsequently to pass any legislation within its constitutional power it could hardly be questioned that if inde pendent of the provisions of the nwpa legislation were enacted specifically providing that reposito ry be constructed at given site the enactment would legally suffice for the purpos any conceivable uncertainty could be removed if the enabling statute explicitly superseded or repealed pertinent provisions of the nwpa an argument might be raised however th at outside the context of the statutory procedure measure containing the langua ge prescribed for an approval resolution would not suffice for this purpose resolution of repository siting approval is to state only that there hereby is approved the site specified the act requires this approval in order for the site designation to become effective it gives meaning tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs17 42 42 usc sec 10134bthis term by directing that when the site designation is effective the secretary of energy is to apply to the nuclear regulatory commission for authorization to construct the site42 on this basis it might be argued that only in context of the act does approval have specific meaning in relation to establishment of the repository by this argument if resolution was couched in the terms required by the act but also had been amended to include othe r language or was not passed within the required 90day period it might not constitute statutory authorization to proceed with establishment of the repository instea d it might be conte nded the process of establishing the repository cannot go forw ard unless congress pa sses either 1 the approval resolution in the form and within the time required by the nwpa or 2 legislation independent of the requirements of the act and explicitly directing that the repository be constructed or for example that the secretary apply for the construction authorization contrary interpretation of the lang uage of the statute might hold that congressional approval of site designa tion entails authorization to proceed with the repository even independently of th statutory mechanism of the nwpa to preclude such contentions altogether how ever any approval re solution passed either in amended form or outside the statutory time frame or both might have to be amended also to contain language explicitly authorizing construction or application for authorization to construct and perhaps explicitly superseding the statutory process of the nwpa as well relation of statutory requireme nts to expedited procedure these questions of the potential force nd effect of an pproval resolution under the nwpa are separate from those that might be raised about the eligibility of the resolution for consideration under the expe dited procedure of the act the nwpa attempts to require that an approval resolution must be passed in specified form and within specified time constraints in order to permit establishment of the repository to go forward it does not requi re that the approval resolution be enacted in accordance with the expedited procedur itself the provisions of section 10135 quoted earlier require action in accordance with subsections b and c but not with subsections d and which set forth the expedited procedure it accordingly appears that for example the senate might amend its approval resolution then continue considering the m easure without regard to the constraints of the expedited procedure on debate and other procedural actions and ultimately pass in lieu thereof an unamended companion previously received from the house this process would result in an approval resolution becoming law in the form prescribed by statute but not in accordance with the expedited procedure the language of the act would not seem to cast any doubt on the force and effect of resolution of siting approval enacted under those conditions similarly as long as congress passed an approval resolution having the prescribed form within the required 90 days of continuous session the measure would apparently suffice tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31135crs18 approve the site designation even if congress did not consider it in accordance with the expedited procedure it is in any case most doubtful that statute could effectively require action pursuant to specified expedited procedure as condition of the effectiveness of an approval resolution if eith er house departed from the prescribed procedures in its consideration of the resolution its acti on presumably would amount to an implicit exercise of the chambers power to alter the expedited procedure in its application to the specific instance such alterations in statutory procedures are implicitly understood as authorized by the rulemaking clause of the constitution even where not explicitly authorized by the rulemaking language of the statute itself conversely however it does not appear th at congress could in any way use the rulemaking power to establish the effectiv eness of an approval resolution that did not meet the statutory requirements of form and timing the act gives the status of congressional rules only to the provisions of subsections d and that govern congressional action on an approval resolution from in troduction through final action the provisions of subsections through c which specify the required wording and timing of an approval resolution and establish its effects are not declared to have this status nor is it clear that they could be appropriately construed as having this status for their effects go beyond proce dural implications internal to congress accordingly if an approva l resolution did not meet the statutory requirements of form and timing then congress might prefer to include in the resolution an explicit statement of its intended force and effect in order to ensure that it would have that force and effect finally if congress determined to aut horize construction of nuclear waste repository by means of legislation that di d not meet the require ments of form and timing provided by the nwpa that legislation would presumably be ineligible under the statute for consideration under th expedited procedure the act makes that procedure available only for measures meeting the statutory requirements of form for resolution of repository siting approval presumably as result approval legislation of any alternate kind would not be subject to the restrictions imposed by the statute on committee action calling up deba amendment and other procedural actions it would instead have to be c onsidered under the general procedures of each house it could accordingly be considered under procedures equivalent to the expedited procedure but only if each house using its general practices of making procedural decisions so determined
