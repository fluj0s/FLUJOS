and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care issues profiles summary over the past two decades congress has considered variety of proposals to improve the financing and delivery of longterm care one such approach is to better coordinate the acute and longterm care services needed by many of the 7 million medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid these dual eligibles are not only disproportionately poor but are also more likely than other beneficiaries to be age 85 or older under age 65 and disabled nonwhite female alone in only fair or poor health cognitively and functionally impaired and suffering from many chronic ailments and diseases the 106 billion in public spending attributed to this population in 1995 was onethird of all spending by medicare and medicaid combined dual eligibles are served by two financing programs medicare and medicaid administered under different authorities the federal and state governments that for the most part cover different services acute and longterm care many believe that this bifurcation of responsibility has helped create fragmented service delivery system fraught with administrative inefficiencies and incentives to shift costs to achieve integration most federal and state initiatives have relied on managed care organizations to directly provide or arrange to provide health and social services through affiliated providers for prepaid fixed monthly payment or capitation the intent is to use managed care mechanisms as vehicles for integrating financing service delivery and administration the program for allinclusive care of the elderly pace is an example of federal initiative that capitates both medicare and medicaid minnesota senior health options the wisconsin partnership program and the continuing care network demonstration are examples of state initiatives that do the same other federal initiatives include the social hmo shmo demonstration which capitates medicare acute and longterm care services and everc are which coordinates with medicaid but capitates medicare only while comprehensive reform has been considered congress has primarily taken an incremental approach to longterm care though medicaremedicaid integration programs serve comparatively small number of dual eligibles they provide options congress may consider when formulating future policy possibilities for congressional consideration may include streamlining the federal waiver approval process necessary for programs relaxing medicare and other impediments to state programs developing new care coordination mechanisms and payment methodologies facilitating unified medicare and medicaid program administration and supporting care management in feeforservice medicare and medicaid though the number of integration programs has grown there are variety of reasons why states might exclude dual eligibles from their medicaid managed care efforts and why dual eligible enrollment in medic are hmos has been quite low these include doubts about managed cares appropriateness for vulnerable populations lack of plan availability selective enrollment inadequate risk adjustment and statutory and

information see crs report rl30254 longterm care the presidents fy2001 budget proposals and related legislation by carol oshaughnessy bob lyke carolyn merckfederal and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care issues and profiles introduction congress has considered variety of proposals to improve the financing and delivery of longterm care while comprehensive reform has been considered congress has primarily taken an increm ental approach when addressing longterm care issues recent proposals for example would provide tax credits for families of individuals with longterm care needs offer tax deductions for individuals who purchase private longterm care insurance fund caregiver support services through the older americans act and link the provision of additional federal nursing home dollars to quality of care improvements1 another strategy supported by congress as well as the clinton administration and the states has been the development and implementation of programs that integrate acute and longterm care services for frail elders and disabled adults this report discusses such efforts with an eye toward providing congress with the necessary information with which to consider future action in this area federal and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care usually focus on medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid ie the dual eligibles compared to other beneficiaries the nations approximately 7 million dual eligibles are especially vulnerable and have high medical care costs they also face additional problems that arise from their being served by two separate programs medicare and medicaid administered under two different authorities the federal and state governments that for the most part cover two different types of services acute and longterm care many believe that the bifurcation of responsibility in caring for dual eligibles has resulted in fragmen ted health services delivery system fraught with administrative inefficiencies and incentives to shift costs they argue that reform is necessary if this population is going to be served more costeffectively the primary vehicles suggested for reform are managed care organizations that 1 directly provide or arrange to provide health and longterm care services through affiliated providers and 2 receive prepaid fixed monthly payment or capitation in exchange for assuming full responsibility for all covered benefits although these entities often include health maintenance organizations hmos that have traditionally covered only acute health care services the general goal of reform is to use managedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs2 2the shmo program also has the authority to capitate medicaid covered benefits though this occurs in limited circumstancescare mechanisms to integrate medicare and medicaid financing through prepaid fixed monthly payments or capitations and broad flexible benefits service delivery through comprehensive provider networ ks and care coordination and administration through unified program requirements and oversight care management without capitation has also been proposed as an approach to achieving integration in exploring integration of acute and long term care this report begins by characterizing the dually eligible population and describing the problems associated with meeting their health and social service needs in an uncoordinated system it continues by analyzing the advantages of using capitation and care management as the vehicle for integrating those services and by discussing concerns about care integration strategies it concludes by profiling nine federal and state programs that to varying degrees integrate the acute and longterm care services that medicare medicaid dual eligibles often require these are federal initiatives such as the program for allinclusive care of the elderly pace which capitates both medicare and medicaid acute and longterm care services for dual eligibles and the socialhealth maintenance organ ization shmo and evercare demonstrations which capitate medicare benefits only2 comprehensive state demonstration s such as minnesota senior health options the wisconsin partnership program and the continuing care network demonstration of monroe county new york which like pace capitates both medicare and medicaid benefits and capitated state medicaid demonstrati ons such as the arizona longterm care system oregon health plan and floridas communitybased diversion pilot project which capitate medicaid only but actively pursue various medicare coordination strategies proposals that explore using care management techniques to integrate medicare and medicaid service delivery without capitation are also discussed briefly the report concludes with the observation that although federal and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care for dual eligibles only serve relatively small percentage of this population they provide set of options which congress may want to examine when formulating longterm care policy in the future dual eligibles defined the term dual eligibles refers to individuals who qualify for both medicare and medicaid persons qualify for medicare because they are either age 65 or older or under age 65 and disabled and receiving social security disability insurance ssdi for 2 years persons qualify for medicaid because they are either aged blind or disabled and meet the income and asset requirements for supplemental securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs3 3in 2001 an individual qualifying for ssi must have countable income less than 530 per month and assets of less than 2000 4qmbs have monthly incomes below 100 of the federal poverty level and assets less than 4000 and receive medicaid coverage for medicare part b premiums as well as for any medicare deductibles and coinsurance slmb s have incomes below 120 of the federal poverty level and assets less than 4000 and receive coverage for their medicare part b premiums only qdwis lost their medicare part benefits due to return to work but have monthly incomes below 200 of the poverty level and receive medicaid coverage of their part premiums qi1s have monthly incomes below 135 of the federal poverty level and can receive coverage for their medicare part b premiums qi2s have monthly incomes below 175 of the federal poverty level and receive coverage for portion of their medicare part b premiums the qi1 and qi2 categories were introduced by the balanced budget act of 1997 which placed an annual cap on the amount of money available to fund premiums state is only required to cover the number of persons to bring its spending on these groups in year up to its allocation the continuation of coverage for these latter two groups is authorized in law through the end of 2002 5instrumental activities of daily living are tasks necessary for independent community living and include the following shopping light housework telephoning money management and meal preparation activities of daily living are activities necessary to carry out basic human functions and include the following bathing dressing eating toileting and transferring from bed to chairincome ssi assistance3 or because they are medical ly needy having spent down their income and assets to pay for their medical or longterm care costs

million disabled individuals under age 65 128 of the 70 million 175 medicare beneficiaries who were also eligible for full medicaid benefits andor for medicaid payment of medicare costsharing requirements 49 million 713 were over age 65 data from the 1998 medicare current beneficiary survey indicate that dually eligible medicare beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable compared to persons who qualify for medicare only see table 1 not only are they disproportionately poor by definition but they are more likely than nond ually eligible medicare beneficiaries to be frail elders age 85 and over and disabled individuals under age 65 they are also more likely to be minority female unmarried institutionalized alone less educated report fair or poor health and suffer from functional and cognitive impairments such as limitations in instrumental and basic activities of daily living5 except for arthrit is and cancer dually eligible beneficiaries are also more likely to suffer from most

of an aging population testimony by june oneill director congressional budget office march 13 1996 12the longterm care financing model the lewin group inc 2000the share of state medicaid budgets consumed by the dual eligibles can be very dramatic in 1995 for example the percentage of total state medicaid spending devoted to dual eligibles in each of the six new england states far exceeded their percentage of each states medicaid population in connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire for instance dual eligibles constituted approximately 20 of each states medicaid recipients but accounted for more than half of spending8 in 1999 medicaid longterm care expenditures for the total medicaid population reached 632 billion or 352 of total medicaid expenditures9 most of that spending 74 was devoted to institutional services ie nursing home care plus intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded much less 26 was directed toward communitybased services ie personal care home and communitybased waiver services hcbs and home health care these 1999 figures represent only the latest point in decade of unprecedented medicaid program growth between 1988 and 1999 the annual compound rate of growth in medicaid expenditures was 120 for all of medicaid and 95 for medic aid longterm care10 though medicaid program growth has been driven largely by factors such as inflation in medical care costs eligibility expansions and the provision of additional services the aging of the population and the higher rate of chronic disease and disability that it entails has also played small but increasingly significant role in driving program expenditures the graying of the baby boom generation 76 million strong will only exacerbate this trend projections june oneill former director of the congressional budget office cbo has argued that increased longevity together with large increase in the size of the retired population and slow growth in the number of workers will dramatically expand the burden of federal longterm care expenditures in the coming decades11 between 2000 and 2020 the number of individuals age 65 and older is projected to increase by almost 50 from 355 to 526 million while the number of individuals age 85 and older is projected to increase by 26 from 46 to 58 million reaching more than 14 million by 205012 at the same time the number of disabled elderly persons with at least one adl or iadl limitation is expected to grow by 42 from 52 to74 million in large part due to the dramatic growth in the number of individuals 85 and older based on

longterm care consists of assistance with basic activities and routines of daily living such as bathing dressing meal preparation and housekeeping it may also include skilled and therapeutic care for the treatment and management of chronic conditions13 different programs and levels of government have been assigned primary responsibility for financing planning and administering the care that dual eligibles require dual eligibles in particular are served by two programs medicare and medicaid administered under different rules by different authorities the federal and state governments that for these persons cover different categories of services acute and longterm care delivery of these two basic types of services moreover has been delegated to different organizations and delivery systems whereas most acute care services are provided within hospitals and physicians offices most federal and state funded longterm care services are provided by nursing homes and communitybased health and

older persons 9704 aarp public policy institute washington dc september 1997financing administration hcfa administers both programs at the federal level states have been grant ed primary administrative responsibility for the medicaid program while medicaid provides coverage for both acute and longterm care services medicaid longterm care coverage is especially significant largely because dual eligibles can rely on medicare as the primary payer for acute care services the basic problem some argue is that neither medicare nor medicaid has responsibility for the entire system medicare for dual eligibles medicare is the main payer for primary and acute care services it is federally financed and administered by hcfa and consists of part the hospital insurance program and part b the supplementary medical insurance program part provides coverage for inpatient hospital services up to 100 days of post acute care in skilled nursing facility following hospital stay home health services for persons who need skilled nursing care andor therapy services and hospice services part b provides coverage for physicians services outpatient hospital services laboratory services durable medical equipment some home health care and other medical care unlike medicaid medicares role in funding longterm care is very limited medicaid for the majority of dual eligibles who receive full benefits medicaid provides coverage for acute care and other services not included in the medicare benefits package eg prescription drugs and medical transportation more importantly though for chronically ill and disabled population medicaid provides coverage for longterm care including nursing home care and home and community based services because of substantial flexibility granted to states in implementing medicaid there are essentially 56 separate medicaid programs covering each of the 50 states us territories and the district of columbia other programs variety of other federal programs also support longterm care services including home and communitybased services funded through the older americans act the social services block grant the department of veterans affairs and various housing programs administered by the department of housing and urban development there are also additional state programs all but two states alabama and mississippi had stateonly funded home and communitybased care programs for older persons in 1996 for instance14 though not nearly as large as medicare or medicaid these additional programs play role in serving the longterm care needs of dual eligibles and others who do not meet the eligibility criteria of medicare andor medicaid they make care coordination even more difficult howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs8 15according to the 1995 medicare current beneficiary survey dual eligibles were less likely than other medicare beneficiaries to report seeing particular doctor and more likely to report using the emergency room see

175184 based on claims from 1992 and 1993 for 1 sample of beneficiariesdivided responsibility implications many believe that the bifurcation of responsibility for caring for dual eligibles between medicare and medicaid and sometimes other programs has helped create fragmented service delivery system fraught with administrative inefficienci and incentives to shift costs from one payer to the other fragmentation because of their greater degree of disability and frailty dual eligibles often must access multiple health and social services from both the acute and longterm care sectors some argue however that the separate funding and service delivery systems of medicare and medicaid typically require that patients and their families try to obtain care from confusing assortment of badly coordinated providers and care settings which have incentives to interact given divided financing responsibility inconsistent practices and poor communication along with separate medical record systems pose significant barriers to meeting the total care needs of individual patients seldom does one provider assume responsibility for coordinating care and assuring its continuity thus despite their greater need for continuity dual eligibles are less likely than other medicare beneficiaries to report having consistent source of care15 according to study published in 1993 they are also less likely to receive specific types of preventive care followup and testing and though they use more health services generally they are less likely to receive timely appropriate care relative to diseasespecific standards16 in addition to its implications for patient health fragmentation may also increase system costs by complicating coordination across service providers and care settings for example patient discharges from expensive acute care facilities may be delayed unnecessarily because appropriate care in nursing facility or patients home could not be arranged some moreover believe that incentives built into the current system promote the overutilization of expensive institutional care and the underutilization of less expen sive home and communitybased care services which are also more preferred by beneficiaries administrative inefficiency federal and state administrative rules for contracting enrollment marketing reimbursement oversight data collection and quality standards are different for medicare and medicaid the resulting inconsistencies and overlapping requirements some argue compl icate caring for dually eligible beneficiaries as providers and payers must maintain parallel administrative systems for the two programs in particular providers often need to conduct multiple assessments develop multiple protocols and establish multiple records for single patient during single episode of carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs9 17liu korbin sharon k long and cynthia aragon does health status explain higher medicare costs of medicaid enrollees health care financing review v 20 2 1998 p 3954though difficult to measure some researchers have indirectly estimated the costs of such administrative inefficiencies for example one group of investigators found that most of the higher medicare costs of dual eligibles relative to other beneficiaries was due to demographic health and disability factors controlling for these factors reduced the cost gap from 282 to 45 of the average beneficiarys costs the authors suggest that much of the remaining difference 45 could be attributable to the inefficiencies associated with providing care under two separate programs17 costshifting it has long been widely acknowledged that overlap in coverage between two programs serving the same population creates opportu nities for cost shifting as way for each program to limit its financial liability because medicare is entirely federally funded for example states have incentives to ensure medicare is billed for as many services as possible practice known as medicare maximization that states say is consistent with medicares role as the primary payer of physician and other acute care services for those services for which both medicare and medicaid are major payers moreover such as nursing facility and home care opportunities and incentives for costshifting by provid ers are particularly strong as they seek to maximize payment or limit their liabilities incentives such as these may have contributed to the explosive growth in medicare home health expenditures between 1988 and 1997 which has been attributed in part to home health care agencies first billing medicare for needed care before turning to medicaid others fear that where two programs cover the same population and single entity is accountable for all patient care reimbursement incentives may play disproportionate role in influencing treatment decisions at the expense of the patients best interests to maximize reimbursement under medicares prospective payment system pps for instance which pays hospitals fixed amount for each episode of patient care facilities have an incentive to discharge patients as quickly as possible to longterm care settings in the home or nursing home which are eventually paid for by medicaid medicaremedicaid system reform goals in view of perceived problems in the way acute and longterm care services for medicaremedicaid dual eligibles are financed administered and delivered some observers argue that reform of the health care delivery system is required if this population is going to be served more costeffectively among the most commonly articulated goals of reform are to eliminate fragmented service delivery while promoting enhanced continuity of care and more simplified access to services develop communitybased options that promote beneficiary independence through the use of the most costeffective least restrictive care settings ie reduce institutional care in favor of home and communitybased carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs10 18wiener joshua m and jason skaggs current approaches to integrating acute and long term care financing and servicing 9516 public policy institute aarp december

on costbased reimbursement systems managed care as vehicle for integration integration means different things to different people for purposes of this report it refers to the process of unifying two previously separate systems into one in this case acute and longterm care financing administration and service delivery for dual eligibles from the perspective of beneficiaries fully integrated system would provide easier access to appropriate seamless care with acute care providers coordinating with longterm care providers and vice versa18 what are now multiple systems would look and act as one perhaps the most frequently proposed vehicle for integration has been managed care managed care basics recent crs report defined managed care as payment system or delivery arrangement through which health plans attempt to control or coordinate the use of service s by their enrollees19 particular managed care arrangements range from managed feeforservice systems using case management utilization review and other utilization control strategies to managed care organizations that combine utilization management activities with variety of risksharing arrangements while traditional unmanaged feeforservice plans simply reimburse independently operating providers for services rendered managed care organizations directly provide or arrange to provide for health care services through affiliated physicians hospitals and other providers managed care organizations also assume varying degrees of risk for the care that they provide those assuming full risk receive prepaid fixed monthly payment or capitation rate in exchange for which they are responsible for all member services unlike feeforservice systems that create incentives for providers to order additional possibly unnecessary excessive and duplicative services managed care organizations typically rely on prospective reimbursement which creates incentives for providers to minimize spending by theoretically controlling inappropriate utilization and promoting early intervention common utilization management activities employedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs11 20pernice kaye n and c pelletier h eds national academy

hmos preferred provider organizations ppos provider sponsored organizations psos and host of other managed health care plans though not nearly as common enrollment of medicare and medicaid recipients in managed care has also grown over the course of the last decade dual eligibles may enroll in managed care through either medicare medicaid or both medicaid managed care enrollment states generally rely on two types of managed care under their medicaid plans including riskbased programs in which health plans assume full or partial risk for at least some medicaid covered services and primary care case management programs pccms in which states pay individual health care providers physician or other licensed health professional small monthly fee in return for managing health care services for defined population according to survey by the national academy for state health policy by 1998 544 of all medicaid recipients 167 million were enrolled in managed care up from 230 in 1994 with approximately three times as many medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in riskba sed as opposed to pccm programs20 the scope of services covered under risk contract in particular may range from single service such as mental health to comprehen sive package that includes all medicaid covered benefits fortyeight states all but alaska and wyoming and the district of columbia had some form of managed care program that year while the number of states with riskbased programs grew from 27 to 45 between 1990 and 1998 the number of states with pccm programs grew from 19 to 2921 medicaid law prohibits states from requiring dual eligibles to enroll in managed care compared to other eligible groups eg povertylevel pregnant women and children populations with complex needs are less likely to be enrolled in managed care enrollment of dual eligibles in medicaid managed care depends in part on individual state medicaid program policies in 1998 for instance only 23 of 45 states with comprehensiv risk programs enrolled communitybased elderly medicaid recipients22 of these 23 states only nine operated statewide programs that included this population medicaremedicaid dual eligibles and medicaid longterm care recipients are much more likely than other groups not to be enrolled in managed care ie excluded or permitted to disenroll from an otherwise mandatory program

excluded or exempted dual eligibles 31 and 4 respectively 82 excluded or exempted communitybased longterm care recipients 36 and 3 respectively and 87 excluded or exempted institutionallybased longterm care recipients 39 and 1 respectively medicare managed care enrollment medicare beneficiaries are entitled to enroll in medicarechoice23 plans as long as they live in areas served by those plans in september 2000 164 of medicare beneficiaries 62 million were enrolled in one of 261 medicarechoice plans up from 33 in 199024 while medicare hmo enrollment has grown it still lags behind medicaid which has more than 50 of its beneficiaries enrolled in managed care unlike states which may make medicaid managed care enrollment mandatory for most populations or acquire special waivers to do so for others eg dual eligibles the federal government cannot require medicare beneficiary enrollment in managed care this is because medicare beneficiaries have statutory right under the social security act to choose the providers from which they receive care requirement that cannot be waived relative to other medicare beneficiaries however dual eligible enrollment has especially lagged only 47 of dual eligibles enrolled in medicare hmo in 1998 compared to 174 of nonduals25 managed care approach to integration despite state reluctance to enroll dual eligibles in managed care most initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care for this population build on existing managed care arrangements to meld together components of the medicare and medicaid progra ms including financing benefits providers administration and oversight this report considers three broad policy goals articulated by system reform advocates financial integration service delivery integration and administrative integration26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs13 26continued report the categories used by booth et are compressed according to booth et fully integrated systems are those that provide for integrated financing broad and flexible benefits farreaching delivery systems care integration unified program administration and overarching quality systemsfinancial integration for financial integration to take place the funds used to pay for care need to be pooled together the most common approach suggested for doing so is capitation which as stated earlier pays contracting entities fixed fee in advance to provide range of services in fully integrated system serving dual eligible s single contractor would receive combined medicare and medicaid capitation payments in exchange for assuming complete responsibility for the full range of medicare and medicaid acute and longterm care benefits unlike feefor service systems which pays for each covered benefit provided fully capitated entities woul d in theory have the financial incentive to coordinateintegrate delivery of all needed acute and longterm care services advocates also argue that because managed care organizations are at risk financially they would have an incentive to emphasize preventive services to reduce hospitalization and to substitute lowcost settings for highcost settings when appropriate eg nursing facility care for hospital care community care for nursing home care in fact some believe that savings resulting from reduced acute care utilization ie hospitalization could be used to fund expanded longterm care benefits and that full capitation would also eliminate incentives to shift costs because the use of fixed payment to cover all services eliminates the need to consider which program is paying service delivery integration for full integration to take place service delivery integration is also required as first step proponents suggest the development of comprehensive delivery systems with access to the complete array of health and social services necessary to meet the comp lex needs of dual eligibles ideally an integrated network would combine traditional health care providers such as physici ans hospitals and nursing homes with communitybased organizations with experience caring for the chronically ill and infirm at home or in the community supportive residential options such as assisted living might also be included advocates point out howe ver that simply forming an expanded provider network does not guarantee that services will be integrated additional steps need to be taken to ensure that coordination takes place possible strategies include 1 case management systems that facilitate communication and promote smooth transitions across providers and settings 2 assignment of primary care provider or team leader through whom beneficiaries access additional network services 3 interdisciplinary care teams that possess the varying skills required to meet the diverse needs of individual members and 4 centralized member records that ensure timely access to beneficiary information administrative integration for advocates the last piece of the integration puzzle is to eliminate the administrative inefficiencies associated with using multiple payers and delivery sources in an uncoordinated system administrative integration in particular would involve single set of medicare and medicaid program requirements including the way contracts are administered enrollment takes placehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs14 27the shmo program also has the authority to capitate medicaid covered benefits though this only occurs in limited circumstancesdata are reported and quality management and oversight occur rather than requiring plans to enter into separate contracts with medicare and medicaid for example fully integrated program would employ single contract for plans serving participants in both programs in addition to helping to create single point of accountability for all medicaid and medicare benefits use of single contract would reduce duplication and resolve important differences across the two programs to minimize the amount of paperwork and confusion resulting from separate medicare and medicaid membership in the same plan an integrated system would also collapse the enrollment systems of the two programs into single process for the beneficiary moreover to better track utilization across payment sources administrative integration would authorize the collection of complete set of encounterlevel data ie data gathered each time the beneficiary is seen matter what the funding source through more consistent standards fewer redundant requirements and better coordination among overlapping overs ight authorities medicare and medicaid quality management activities would also be rationalized federal and state initiatives serving medicaremedicaid dual eligibles the federal government and several states have develope d number of pilot initiatives aimed at integrating acute and longterm care services for medicare medicaid dual eligibles nine are reviewed in this report see appendix and b for detailed program profiles they include federal initiatives such as the program for allinclusive care of the elderly pace which capitates medicare and medicaid as well as the evercare demonstration and social health maintenance organization demonstration shmo which capitates medicare only27 comprehensive state demonstrations such as minnesota senior health options the wisconsin partnership program and the continuing care network demonstration of monroe county new york which like pace capitates both medicare and medicaid benefits and capitated state medicaid demonstrations such as the arizona longterm care system oregon health plan and floridas communitybased diversion pilot project which capitate medicaid only but actively pursue various medicare coordination strategies implementation of dual eligible programs such as these require hcfa approval of waivers of certain medicaid and medicare program rules medicaid waiver in particular allows states to waive certain federal requirements in order to operate specific kinds of programs the medicaid requirements that may be waived are statewideness requirement that services be available statewide comparability of services requirement that duratio n amount and scope of services in the state behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs15 similar for all covered groups and freedomofchoice requirement that medicaid recipients be free to choose their own providers these waivers are usually referred to according to the section of the social security act under which they are authorized extant medicaid waiver authorities include 1115 research and demonstration waivers 1915b freedomofchoice waive rs and 1915c home and communityb ased services waivers states may also use one nonwaiver authority 1915a to establish voluntary managed care programs see appendix c for details states have traditional ly sought 1915b or 1115 waivers when considering mandat ory medicaid managed care programs others have combined 1915a allowing states to establish voluntary managed care programs or 1915b waive r allowing states to establish mandatory managed care programs with 1915c waiver which allows them to expand available services to include nonmedical social and support services that allow individuals who otherwise would have required nursing facility care to remain in the community those explicitly incorporating medicare services into their managed care efforts have also sought section 222 medicare waivers which allow them to contract with plans that are not medicare risk contractors and to alter the way such contractors are paid waiver applications are reviewed and approved by hcfa though the nine programs profiled in this report use varying approaches and combinations of waiver authorities general similarities exist in their strategies for integrating financing and service delivery see table 3 while financial integration involves capitation of medicare andor medicaid benefits service delivery integration typic ally involves comprehensive provider networks case management and interdisciplinary teams of providers less effort however has been made to integrate medicare and medicaid administratively only pace and

approach dual eligibles voluntarily enroll in managed care organization participating in one of three federal initiatives the first and second generation incarnations of the shmo demonstration the evercare demonstration and the pace program which the balanced budget act of 1997 made permanent benefit category under medicare and an optional benefit states can offer under medicaid all three programs operate under section 222 medicare demonstration waivers and all three capitate medicare acute care benefits although pace and shmo also operate under section 1115 medicaid waivers shmos serve much broader crosssection of medicare beneficiaries than pace ie they target medicare beneficiaries generally and therefore enroll comparatively few dual eligibles pace on the other hand requires that enrollees be certified for nursing home care and targets persons who are or would be eligible for medicaid and on whose behalf the state makes another capitated payment generally to cover longterm care services not covered by medicare the evercare program by contrast focuses exclusively on medicareeligible nursing home residents though evercare does not cover longterm care its providers work closely with nursing homes to coordinate acute and longterm care services the goal of evercare in particular is to use physiciannurse practitioner teams as way to reduce the need to hospitalize nursing home residents by emphasizing the delivery of primary preventive and other outpatient services within the nursing home evercare attempts to save medicare money and reduce the dislo cation trauma associated with being transferred from the nursing home to the hospital under evercare the per enrollee monthly capitation paid by medicare is equal to 978 of the medicare county rate for medicarechoice plans approximately 11300 nursing home residents are being served at six evercare demonstration sites an evaluation is due at the end of 2001 unlike evercare pace provides coverage for broad array of longterm care services the primary goal of pace is to use interdisciplinary case management adult day care and other home and communitybased care services to prevent the institutionalization of extremely frail elders case management teams in particular consist of physicians nurses social workers dieticians physical and occupational therapists activity coordinators and other health and transportation workers under pace the per enrollee monthly capitation paid by medicare is equal to 239 times the medicare county rate amount for medicarechoice plans calculation of the monthly medicaid rates varies by state and is subject to negotiation between each pace provider and state medicaid agency member premiums are charged when appropriate there are currently 7000 enrollees at 26 pace sites in 14 states hcfas evaluators of the pace demonstration found that compared to people who applied to pace but later declined to enroll pace enrollees were less costly as indicated by lower health expenditures in the 6 months prior to applying to the pace program28 this led evaluators to conclude that pace sites are experiencinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs18

for prior utilization and other factors they also found that pace enrollees after enroll ment had lower hospital and nursing home use higher probab ility of survival better selfreported health status higher satisfaction and lower levels of functiona l impairment though statistically significant impacts were found with respect to each of these outcomes paces impact on medical utilization tended to be longer lasting ie more than 1 year after enrollment than its impact with respect to selfreported health status satisfaction and function ie less than 1 year after enrollment29 while evaluators found that medicare capitation payments were much lower than expenditures would have been had pace enrollees continued to receive care in the feeforservice sector they found that capitated payments made by medicaid were greater than projected feefors ervice costs overall however statistically significant difference was found between combined medicare and medicaid feeforservice costs and the total medicare and medicaid capitation rates received by pace program sites30 compared to pace the goal of the shmo demonstration is more limited rather than attempting to fully integrate wide range of acute and longterm care services it assesses the feasibility of adding limited chronic care benefit to the typical package of medicare hmo services while the three first generation shmo sites shmoi focus care coordination exclusively on those enrollees certified for nursing facility care the lone second generation site shmoii focuses it more broadly on individuals with highrisk conditions evidence of impending disability or at highrisk for hospitalization this latter site also uses more geriatricoriented model of care including greater reliance on interdisciplinary teams of providers

risk enrollees first generation sites payments are adjusted for the demographic chara cteristics of the enrollee eg higher capitation payments are made for persons in nursing homes than for those in

the prevalence of adverse medical conditions in addition to medicare payment shmos also receive medicaid payments when appropriate currently only one site has formal agreement with the state to

four sites an evaluation of shmoi took place between 1985 and 1989 evaluators concluded that while it succeeded organizationally in offering longterm care to frail enrollees it failed to achieve an adequate degree of coordination between acute and chronic care services lack of communication between physicians and other participants especially case managers was largely to blame31 this finding is one reason why those plann ing shmoii opted to use multidisciplinary teams of providers to assess plan and manage care moreover financial losses and high expenditures relative to feeforservice medicare among number of high risk groups during the demonstration s early years also led investigators to suggest refinements to shmo operations32 like pace shmoi sites experienced favora ble selection in this case the disproportionate enrollment of healthier than average medicare beneficiaries using prior utilization and health status in particular the evaluators found that shmo enrollees tended to be healthier than those in traditional feeforservice medicare they also found evidence of favorable disenrollment where frail and impaired members were more likely to disenroll than healthier members33 the impact of shmoi on outcomes was mixed while the evaluators concluded that shmos performed hmo functions well for the healthy and acutely ill they concluded that shmos did not perform well for impaired or acutely ill enrollees with chronic impairments though there was overall difference in mortality rates standardized for case mix between shmo enrollees and feeforservice medicare beneficiaries moreover frail individuals had higher probability of dying in shmos than in fee forservice medicare34 while unimpaired shmo enrollees reported generally higher satisfaction than comparable feeforservice medicare beneficiaries impaired enrollees reported lower satisfaction than impaired feeforservice beneficiaries in all areas but finance and benefits where they were more satisfied overall shmos serve comparatively larger enrollme nts than pace and evercare because the latter two programs are limited in part by the need to deliver essential program services at particular sites ie adult day care centers for pace and nursing homes for evercare though the pace and shmo programs werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs20 designed to serve as models for states the role of the states in designing and managing federal demonstration programs such as these has been limited integration through comprehensive state demonstrations under this approach dually eligible beneficiary voluntarily enrolls in one of growing number of state administered demonstrations that capitate both medicaid and medicare benefits particular programs include minnesota senior health options msho the wisconsin partnershi p program and the continuing care network ccn demonstration of monroe county new york which will begin operating in 2001 in addition to goals of controlling costs and reducing administrative complexity all intend to delay institutionalization through the provision of expanded home and communitybased care options all three operate under section 222 medicare waivers while wisconsin partnership currently operates under section 1115 medicaid waiver msho recentl substituted section 1915a1915c combination for the section 1115 waiver under which it was originally autho rized ccn is also authorized under section 1915a1915c combination there are currently 3569 enrollees in msho and section 822 in wisconsin partnership though all enroll dually eligible elders wisco nsin partnership also enrolls younger disabled adults while minnesota intends to do so in the future while wisconsin focuses exclusively on individuals deemed eligible for nursing facility care msho and ccn cast their nets more broadly enrolling both impaired and unimpaired beneficiaries in addition to dual eligibles ccn also enrolls medicareonly beneficiaries who receive limited chronic care benefit as part of enrollment in the program and who may purchase extended longterm care coverage privately to provide services ccn has contracted with single managed care organization that features compre hensive network of acute and longterm care service provi ders though most medicaid benefits are included in the new york demonstration some such as prescription drugs remain in the feeforservice system minnesota on the other hand has contracted with hmos which have in turn subcontracted with geriatric care systems to provide all or part of the msho benefits package including all acute care home and communitybased waiver services as well as 180 days of medicaid nursing facility coverage which after 180 days medicaid pays on feeforservice basis to provide all acute and longterm care services wisconsin partnership by contrast has contracted with community based organizations with experience serving elderly and disabled individuals living in the community interestingly msho is the only program to receive waivers allowing it to combine the purchase of medicaid and medicare services into single contract managed and overseen by the state all other dual eligible initiatives including the wisconsin partnership program and ccn require that plans enter into two contracts medicaid managed care contract with the state and medicare contract with hcfa msho believes that use of single contract has allowed it to better resolve important differences between the medicaid and medicare programs than if separate contracts had been used for example it has enabled msho to merge the enrollmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs21 35nursing home conversions refer to individuals who have been discharged into the community after nursing facility stays of more than 6 months in the msho program and 5 months in the ccn demonstrationprocesses membership materials and grievance procedu res of the two programs medicare and medicaid capitation payments are always pooled at the plan level rather than the state level even in minnesota plans in all three programs receive capitation payments from medicare and medicaid like pace the per enrollee monthly capitation paid by medicare under wisconsin partn ership is equal to 239 times the medicare county payment rate amount for medicarechoice plans to create incentives for plans to use home and communitybased services rather than institutional services and to provide disincentives for the favorable selection of healthier than average individuals msho and ccn base reimbursement in part on impairment paying more for impaired individuals living in the community than unimpaired individuals living in the community in doing so both programs employ separate capitation rates for the following subgroups nursing home residents unimpaired community residents community residents eligible for nursing facility care and nursing home conversions35 impaired community enrollees in the minnesota program receive 239 times the medica re county rate amount for medicarechoice plans along with medicaid payment component equivalent to the average monthly payment for elderly home and communitybased waiver services ccn on the other hand intends to use the results of functional assessments to riskadjust medicare and medicaid payments according to impairment level while msho requires that each enrollee have access to care coordinator both wisconsin partnership and ccn use interdisciplinary teams of providers to manage care wisconsin partnership also has an especially strong emphasis on client involvement in decisionmaking including choice of provider services and setting all three programs cater to limited service areas and enrollments though comparatively few of each states dual eligible population is served by msho wisconsin partnership and ccn the limited scope of these programs has facilitated each states ability to put together provider networks capable of delivering comprehensive array of acute and longterm care services it has also facilitated their ability to recruit health and social service organizations with experience serving elderly and chronically disabled adults living in the community all three programs will be studied as part of multistate evaluation performed by researchers at the university of minnesota the results are due in 2005 integration through capitated state medicaid demonstrations under this option dually eligible beneficiary enrolls in capitated medicaid demonstration that coordinates with either capitated or feeforservice medicare these demonstrations include mandatory statewide medicaid managed care programs such as the arizona longterm care system altcs and oregon health plan ohp or small voluntary programs such as floridas communitybased diversion pilot project which serves selected metropolitan areas or counties while the altcshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs22 36minnesota also has similar waiver for its prepaid medical assistance program ie its mandatory medicaid managed care programcurrently enrolls 28993 individuals including close to 19000 elderly and physically disabled persons enrollment in ohp stands at 349500 including 50000 elderly and physical ly disabled dual eligibles there are 501 individuals enrolled in the florida sites both arizona and oregon use section 1115 research and demonstration waivers to require most state medicaid recipients to enroll in managed care while recipients certified for nursing home care receive integrated acute and longterm care services under the altcs the ohp does not formally cover longterm care instead ohp contractors are required to hire exceptional needs coordinators enccs whose responsibilities include coordin ating ohpcovered acute care benefits with longterm care services furnished in the feeforservice system floridas community based diversion pilot project on the other hand uses section 1915c home and communitybased services waiver to add comm unitybased longterm care to the acute care benefits already covered by existing medicaid contractors though none of the three programs profiled capitate medicare aspects of each increase the likelihood of coordination all three for example contract with at least one managed care organization which also participates in the medicarechoice program giving at least some dual eligibles the option of receiving capitated medicaid and medicare benefits from the same plan for those electing to remain in feefor service medicare moreover arizona and oregon have received waivers from hcfa allowing them to limit their medicare costsharing obligations to services delivered through their medicaid plans36 that is the state will cover medicare costsharing amounts only when medicare covered services are provided by capitated plan that also has contract with the state medicaid program all other state medicaid programs must pay medicare premiums deductibles and coinsurance for medicare beneficiaries who qualif for full medicaid benefits matter where those beneficiaries receive their care arizonas and oregons special cost sharing restrictions on the other hand have provided dual eligibles with strong incentives to use the same providers for both medicaid and medicare given hcfas reluctance to offer any more such waivers however other states must instead rely on consumer incentives enrollment counseling and other strategies to persuade beneficiaries to use medicaid network provi ders for medicare services where altcs and ohp members choose to receive their medicare services through enrollment in medicarechoice plan however the states are still obligated to pay any beneficiary costsharing that might be required rather than focusing on beneficiary choice of providers florida requires contractors to hire case managers whose functions include coordinating the delivery of all acute and longterm care services regardless of funding source where project enrollees have opted to receive their medicare benefits on feeforservice basis for example case managers are responsible for actively pursuing coordination with their primary care physician even though that physician may be nonmedicaid affiliated provider how effective such coordination is however depends on how cooperativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs23 37mccall n cw wrightson j korb et evaluation

affords states the opportunity to encourage dual eligibles to receive all of their medicaid and medicare benefits from the same plan some believe that this approa ch may be particularly attractive to states designing programs for broadly defined target groups and not just those certified for nursing homes others however doubt whether effective care coordination can take place unless requirements under both programs are formally synchronized and combined medicaremedicaid capitation occurs of the three capitated medicaid programs reviewed evaluation results are available for arizona and oregon an evaluation of the florida program is currently in the planning stages the evaluation of the altcs found an approximately 16 average annual reduction in what arizona spent per capita for elderly and physical disabled longterm care medicaid recipients from what would have been spent in typical medicaid program most savings arose from reduced hospital and nursing home use while the plan experienced higher ambulatory and administrative expenditures these were smaller than the savings due to lower utilization of institutional care resulting in net savings to the plan37 the effect of the arizona system on patient outcomes was mixed evaluators found that nursing home residents in the altcs were less likely to be offered an influenza vaccine than medicaid nursing home residents in neighboring new mexico medicaid nursing home residents in the altcs moreover were also more likely to experience other negative medical experiences such as decubitus ulcer fever and catheter insertion than nursing home residents served by the new mexico program significant differences however existed with respect to the incidence of patient falls or fractures resulting from the use of psychotropic drugs38 evaluators of the acute care side of the arizona medicaid system found that ssi recipients in arizona were less likely to report being very satisfied with their overall medical care compared to their counterparts in new mexico arizona enrollees also reported being slightly less satisfied on average with waiting time evening and weekend availability information giving courtesy and

jean p hearneconcerns about integrating acute and longterm care though the number of federal and state initiatives integrating acute and long term care for dual eligibles has grown in recent years there are variety of concerns that federal and state policymakers face when developing such programs in the future while some of these issues may be characteristic of managed care more generally they are especially salient where vulnerable populations such as dual eligibles are concerned they include doubts about managed cares appropriateness for vulnerable populations lack of managed care plan availability evidence of risk selection and concerns about inadequate risk adjustment and statutory and regulatory impediments to developing and implementing integrated care programs doubts about managed cares appropriateness for vulnerable populations managed care organizations covering acute health care services through capitated payment arrangement have primarily served relatively young and employed population most states moreover have focused their medicaid managed care programs on children and nondisabled adults while medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in managed care tend to be healthier than beneficiaries not enrolled relatively few managed care plans therefore have had experience serving vulnerable groups such as the dually eligible elderly who often have special needs associated with chronic conditions require continuous rather than episodic care experience problems in navigating through multiple systems and often lack social resources eg informal caregivers as consequence some doubt whether managed care organizations have the expertise or the willingness to take on the risks associated with providing the specialized services and longterm care required by predominately chronically ill and disabled populations42 furthermore given the primarily acute and postacute care experience of most plans some fear the overmedicalization of longterm care services or the diversion of funds budgeted for longterm care if integration should take place others echoing concerns behind the recent passage of patient protection bills in both the house and senate43 fear that financial incentives to do less under managed care may lead to the underprovision of appropriate services resulting in access and quality problems they are particularly wary that gatekeeper systems limited provider networks and other conve ntions used to limit care for younger healthier enrollees may inhibit the appropriate access of chronically ill and disabled

costs quality of care and satisfaction resource use and costs though not in perfect agreement with the shmo evaluation which highlighted plan losses and compara tively high expenditures levels for certain high risk groups findings from the pace and altcs evaluations as well as an evaluation of the medicare hmo program indicate that managed care plans serving the elderly typically use fewer resources and operate more cheaply than traditional feeforservice arrangements while pace and arizona recipients had higher rates of ambulatory care utilization for example enrollees in both programs experienced lower hospital and nursing home use these findings are consistent with the results of the medicare hmo evaluation which found that although hmos had the same number of hospital admissions and home health clients as feeforservice medicare they had lower average length of stay and 50 fewer home health visits45 overall the evaluators concluded that medicare hmos spent 105 less for hospital physician home health and skilled nursing care than what would have been spent for the same enrollees in medicares feeforservice system while medicaid capitation payments under pace were higher moreover medicare capitation payments were found to be much lower than what would have been spent had members not enrolled this latter result is reflected on the medicaid side in arizona where medicaid payments were significantly less than what would have occurred had typical medicaid program been in operation quality of care although existing evaluations indicate that managed care plans serving the elderly often operate less expensively and use fewer resources quality of care findings have been mixed often different but sometimes worse while evaluators concluded that shmos performed well for the healthy and acutely ill for example results indicated that they did not perform well for the impaired or acutely ill with chronic impairments while significant difference was found between arizonas managed carebased system and new mexicos traditional medicaid program with respect to certain nursing home outcomes eg patient falls or fractures resulting from the use of psychotropic drugs medicaid nursing home residents in arizona were more likely to experience unfavorable results such as decubitus ulcer fever and catheter insertion even the pace evaluation with its

number of participating risk plans grew from 275 in 1994 to 375 in 1998 the average number of plans per state with comprehens ive risk plan enrollment declined 15 from 98 to 8351 at this point in time there are questions about the ability and willingness of medicarechoice plans to serve sparsely populated areas with low numbers of potential subscribers and undeveloped provider infrastructures plan withdrawal from both the medicare and medicaid managed care markets on the other hand is hard to interpret though two interrelated issues come to the forefront risk select ion and payment evidence of risk selection and concerns about inadequate risk adjustment evidence indicates that managed care plans serving the elderly experience favorable selection or the disproportionate enrollment of beneficiaries who are healthier on average than feeforservice beneficiaries favorable selection has been extensively documented for medicare hmos52 it has also been documented with shmo and pace at least with respect to people who applied to pace but later declined to enroll to the extent that favorable selection takes place it may stem from reluctance on the part of sicker individuals to disrupt long standing relationships with providers in the community although medicare law prohibits favorable selection on the part of participating plans they may encourage enrollment of healthier beneficiaries through selective marketing or avoid enrollment of frail beneficiaries by for example downplaying their reputation for serving chronically ill individuals given evidence of favorable selection hcfa believes that it has overpaid medicare hmos despite such perceived overpayment however health plans exhibit continued reluctance to serve medicare beneficiaries there are number of possible reasons including fears by health plans of unlimited liability for care weak demand and underpayment by hcfa for frailer than average medicare beneficiarieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs29

smithdissatisfaction with the way capitation rates are set is significant factor underlying all these concerns to ensure that the federal governmen t is not overpaying for healthier than average medicare beneficiaries and that plans are receiving adequate payment to care for frailer than average ones capitation rates can be adjusted for beneficiary risk the mechanism for doing so is called risk adjustment which is process of setting capitation rates that reflect health status paying plans more to care for ill beneficiaries and less to care for healthy ones prior to the bba hcfa adjusted medicares capitation rates to managed care plans using certain demographic factors in particular hcfa used the the average adjusted per capita cost aapcc methodology under the aapcc medicares rates were based on county level fee forservice expenditure s adjusted for age sex disability status institutional status medicaid eligibility and working aged status it is widely acknowledged that these factors do an extremely poor job of adjusting for risk in fact it has been shown that demographics explain only 1 of the variation in individual beneficiaries health care costs53 because demographic factors are poor predictors of future health care use inadequate risk adjustment has led to overpayments for healthier than average medicare hmo enrollees and underpayments for frailer than average ones recognizing certain inadequacies in payment methodology the bba mandated that hcfa develop and implement method for risk adjustment based on health status the new methodology 54 which hcfa began to phase in january 2000 adjusts medicare capitation payments using enrollees inpatient hospital diagnoses in the previous year if any as well as traditional demographic factors55 though the new risk adjustment system may perform much better than the old system there are still concerns that it nonetheless may under estimate the costs of caring for people with disabilities and overestimates the costs of caring for people without disabilities as consequence dhhs has temporarily excluded plans participating in programs enrolling frail populations from implementing the new risk adjustmen t system six of these plans are profiled in this report including pace shmo evercare msho wisconsin partnership and ccn these will continue to be reimbursed under special arrangements established before

for dual eligibles has proven challenging gaohehs0094 report to the special committee on aging us senate august 2000currently some plans choose not to serve vulnerable populations because they do not want to take on the full risk of caring for potentially resource intensive groups such as the dually eligible elderly this observation has raised interest in partial capitation which pays plans using blended capitatedfeeforservice arrangement in exchange for providing or arranging to provide covered services56 under partial capitation plans receive percentage of the full capitation rate for each enrollee along with percentage of the feeforservice rate for each service delivered plans for example may contract with medicare or medicaid at 60 of their usual full capitation rates and receive 40 of the medicare and medicaid fee schedule for each service provided to enrolled beneficiaries by reducing financial risk some believe partial capitation may encourage more plans to serve dual eligibles as well as blunt any incentives to riskselect or underprovide appropriate services because partial capitation still contains feeforservice elements however it does not contain as strong an efficiency incentive as fully capitated systems it also does not provide as large prepaid pool with which to fund extra services often needed by this population statutory and regulatory issues regarding integration before plans can decide whether to participate in managed care programs aimed specifically at medicaremedicaid dual eligibles the federal and state governments must first create these programs states have been particularly enthusiastic in this regard believing that they must be allowed to manage the care of dual eligibles if they are going to control health care costs to overcome many administrative inefficiencies associated with using multiple payers in an uncoordinated system state policymakers believe that such management needs to include medicar as well as medicaid though integrating acute and longterm care through managed care has indeed been one of three noteworthy strategies pursued by states to control medicaid longterm care spending57 states cite number of statutory and regulato ry barriers that have severely hampered the development and implementation of medica re medicaid integration programs many of these perceived obstacles relate to medicare and medicaid program rules58 they include 1 medicare freedom of choice medicare beneficiaries currently have statutory right to choose the providers from which they receive care if states want to integrate medicare into managed care program for dual eligibles therefore enrollment must be voluntary at least for the medicare portion of their benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs31

managed care plan may choose to leave that plan on monthtomonth basis guaranteed beneficiary enrollment of only 1 month makes medicare participation less desirable for managed care plans than if benefi ciaries had to remain enrolled ie locked in for longer periods of time states on the other hand may establish longer lockin periods under medicaid medicare however will move toward 3month annual open enrollme nt period with effective plan lockin for 9 months beginning in 2003 it is expected that longer guaranteed enrollment or lockin periods for both medicare and medicaid should increase the number of plans willing to participate in both programs simultaneously 3 medicare costsharing as noted earlier only three states arizona oregon and minnesota have received permission from hcfa to limit their medicare costsharin g obligations to services delivered through their medicaid plans all other states are required to provide for medicaid payment of medicare costsharing ie premiums deductibles and coinsurance whether or not dual eligibles who qualify for full medicaid benefits elect to obtain care through their states medicaid network of providers if dually eligible medicaid recipient obtains medicare covered services from primary care physician unaffiliated with their states medicaid network for example most states are still required by hcfa to cover medicare coinsurance and deductibles because hcfa allows arizona oregon and minnesota to limit medicare costsharing to services provided by their medicaid networks dual eligibles in those states have strong incentives to use the same providers for both medicare and medicaid since they would have to pay more outofpocket to use non medicaid affiliated provid ers hcfa has expressed an unwillingness to allow any more states to do the same since the agency now believes it infringes on medicare beneficiaries freedomofchoice for the foreseeable future therefore all other states must continue to meet their medicare costshari ng obligations matter where dual eligibles receive their medicare services 4 independent medicare and medica id budget neutrality waiver rules require that managed care programs serving the dual eligible population be budget neutral ie they cannot cost the federal gover nment more than traditional feeforservice programs if both medicare and medicaid waivers are sought for an initiative the office of managemen t and the budget omb requires that they be neutral with respect to medicare and medicaid independently it is not enough to show budget neutrality for both programs combined critics argue that evaluating federal spending for medicare and medicaid separately ignores the interaction between medicare and medicaid costs and limits state flexibili ty to design costeffective programs59 they argue that omb should look at combined medicare and medicaid costs to assess whetherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs32 60us congress senate special committee on aging

demonstrations they argue has resulted in inconsistencies in granting waivers as well as protracted waiver discussions between hcfa and number of states some lasting upwards of 3 years they propose that federal policy in this area be clarified including the implementation of 90day review process and support for broad range of costeffective demonstrations tailored to the market conditions of particular states60 care management in the feeforservice system an alternative to capitation concerns about capitation along with other barriers to managed care have led some observers to focus on care management as way to integrate acute and long term care services for dual eligibles care management may be defined as process that coordinates the provision of acute and longterm care services across health and social service professionals and settings of care including but not limited to needs assessment prior approval care communication coordination and risk assessment61 to varying degrees it is used to coordinate care by most health care organizations including hospitals medical groups insurance companies home health agencies communitybased social service agencies public

arrangements with pace and medicarechoice it also authorized the medicare coordinated care demonstration to evaluate privatesector models of care coordination because care coordination has not traditionally been large part of feeforservice medicare the aim of this demonstration will be to assess the costeffectiveness of making monthly payments for coordinated care services that manage feeforservice expenditures under parts and b of medicare62 demonstration design and applications procedures were published on july 28 200063 hcfa plans to announce selected projects by early 2001 the 4year demonstration which is to include nine sites five urban three rural one in washington dc is based on review of 29 privatesector programs chosen because they serve chronically ill adults and show evidence of reductions in hospital admissions or total medical costs64 the review which was submitted to hcfa on march 22 2000 identifies two main types of coordinated care including disease management which target patients whose main problem is particular medical diagnosis and case management which targets patients who suffer from social and medical vulnerabilities that place them at high risk for costly adverse medical events and poor health outco mes the authors note that none of the programs required physicians to hire new staff install new equipment or reorganize their practices nor did they lock patients into predefined networks of providers all included the following three steps 1 assessing and planning involves identifying all important problems and goals and

designed to remove barriers to prompt medical care including but not limited to communitybased services transportation medications noncovered home visits and equipment though few of the programs studied for hcfas review may have had trouble executing their care coordination programs it is generally reported that case managers and physician s often find it difficult to establish meaningful working relationships there are variety of reasons why it may be difficult to promote physician participation including but not limited to independent physician working styles lack of facetoface communication time pressures and general unfamiliarity with care coordination66 though it is only recently being considered in the context of feeforservice medicare care management has been applied to

case management which they often use for purposes of developing care plans and overseeing the quality of care provided under their waiver programs in 1998 close to 60 of 230 hcbs waiver programs surveyed included case management making it among the most common service for all major targeted populations including the elderly developmentally disabled children and adults with disabilities and

their own initiative to develop care plans that make use of certain types of medicare services they have control over medicare provider behavior and thus cannot ensure that services delivered are consisten t with what was ordered one option would be to create service delivery networks especially designed for the diverse needs of dual eligibles that would grant medicaid case managers the authority to develop care plans involving medicare services to authorize medicare as well as medicaid services and to substitute noncovered services for medicare services if found to be costeffective68 one analyst suggests that such an approach may be one way to hold medicare providers accountable for meeting the needs of dual eligibles while protecting states and beneficiaries from incentives to shift costs to medicaid by inappropriately institutionalizing dual eligibles in need of longterm care69 alternatively the medicare program may benefit from the appropriate substitution of lowcost for highcost settings and the reduced use of expensive acute care services as result of case manager familiarity with the health care needs of chronically ill dual eligibles however it may be operationalized care coordination without capitation is another option considered by advo cates of integrating acute and longterm care services for dual eligibles policy implications congress has considered variety of proposals to improve the financing and delivery of longterm care services while comprehensive reform has been considered congress has primarily taken an incremental approach when addressing longterm care issues including the development and implementation of federal and state initiatives to integrat acute and longterm care services for frail elders and disabled adults though programs such as pace shmo and msho serve comparatively small number of the nations dual eligibles they may provide models that congress may want to consider when formulating longterm care policy in the future before taking action in this area however congress may want to consider variety of issues including doubts about managed cares appropriateness for serving vulnerable populations in particular many worry that incentives under managed care to control utilization may have deleterious effects on patient welfare and qualityespecially for frail recipients given the recent nature of most integration programs however there is currently dearth of evaluation evidence to support or reject this claim definitively of the nine programs reviewed for this report for instance only the pace first generation shmo altcs and ohp programs have been evaluated thoroughly while innovative state programs such as msho andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30813crs36 wisconsin partnership have yet to be independently evaluated other programs such as ccn are only now being implemented despite the lack of rich body of evaluation research proponents strongly believe in the efficacy of using managed care to integrate acute and longterm care financing service delivery and administration under medicare and medicaid in particular they see managed care as way to eliminate fragmentation develop community service options make benefits more flexible promote quality of care improvements and control costs at the same time however they also point to number of statutory and regulatory requirements inhibiting the development and implementation of these programs these include requirements to obtain federal waivers that allow states to enroll dual eligibles in managed care programs that are budget neutral to the medicare and medicaid programs independently given the concerns expres sed by both advocates and opponents to using managed care to integrate acute and longterm care for medi caremedicaid dual eligibles congressional action in this area might include an examination of one or more of the following possibilities put forward by various health policy experts streamlining the waiver approval process or eliminating the need for states to obtain waivers altogether allowing states to show budget neutrality for medicare and medicaid combined rather than each program individually restricting the right of some medicare beneficiaries to choose the provid ers from whom they receive care accelerating the implementation of longer medicare lockin provisions allowing all

services are managed by interdisciplinary teams of physicians nurses social workers dieticians physical and occupation therapists activity coordinators and other health and transportation workers the specific functions of these teams include assessing enrollees needs developing care plans in consultation with patients and their families and delivering services across acute and longterm care

receive care in the feeforservice sector in particular capitated payment was 38 less than projected feeforservice reimbursement in the first 6 months following enrollment and 16 lower than projected reimbursement in the 7 to 12 months following enrollment75 building on these results forthcoming study currently under review at hcfa concludes that in the first year following enrollment projected feeforservice medicare costs were considerably higher than the medicare portion of paces capitated payment while projected feeforservice medicaid costs were lower than the medicaid portion of the capitation rate overall however statistically significant differen ce was found between combined medicare and medicaid feeforservice costs and the total medicare plus medicaid capitation rate received

secondgeneration sites shmoii in 1995 only one of these senior dimensions in vegas nevada achieved operational status for variety of reasons including lack of infrastructure loss of personnel and reluctance to adopt riskbased payment methodology the remaining plans chose not to participate as of july 2000 total enrollment in the shmo demonstra tion was 84004 including 48592 in the three

individuals applying above that level were placed in queue and enrolled as space became available78 shmos serve very few dual eligibles while all shmo members are eligible for medicares basic package of primary and acute care benefits as well as any expanded benefits that plans choose to provide access to care coordination and chronic care benefits are more restricted in first generation shmos in

for dual eligibles shmos also receive payments from medicaid premiums and copayments are also allowed and may be paid outofpocket by beneficiaries or by their medicare supplements the shmoi sites also have the authority to capitate medicaid covered benefits though this occurs in limited circumstances currently only one site has forma l agreement with the state to receive medicaid capitation payments for dually eligible enrollees to varying degrees both shmo generations rely on care coordination to manage patient care at shmoi sites however care coordination has been limited to identifying allocating and managing longterm care services for members whose disabilities make them eligible for additional chronic care benefits by their exclusive focus on nursing home certifiables and resulting systematic lack of geriatric attention toward other populations some believe that the ability of case managers to coordinate care across the continuum of services in firstgeneration plans has been limited79 taking these lessons into account the lone secondgeneration site employs more geriatricoriented care model including greater reliance on interdisciplinary teams of primary care physicians specialists pharmacists dieticians geriatricians and nurse case managers moreover these services are targeted more broadly toward those with highrisk conditions evidence of impending disability or who are at highrisk for hospitalization case managers are also encouraged to coordinate more closely with primary care providers for whom protocols have been developed to ensure adequate attention to geriatric problems congressional authorization for the shmo program has been extended several times with the most recent series of extensions beginning with the bba of 1997 which extended the program through 2000 the bba also expanded the number of persons who could be serve d at each site from 12000 to 36000 and directed the secretary of dhhs to submit to congress plan for making

aggregate maximum limit on participants at all sites to 324000 individuals between 1985 and 1989 the shmoi demonstration was evaluated for hcfa by researchers associated with the university of california san francisco while shmoi succeeded organizationally in offering longterm care to frail enrollees it reportedly failed to achieve an adequate degree of coordination between acute and chronic care services this was attributed largely to lack of communication between physicians and other participants including case managers and communitybased longterm care providers even at the end of the 5year evaluation period many physicians serving shmo enrollees were unaware of the programs package of chronic care benefits80 this finding is one reason why the lone second generation site uses multidisciplinary teams of providers to assess plan and manage care financial losses and high expenditures during the programs early years among number of high risk groups relative to feeforservice medicare also led investigators to suggest need to refine shmo operations81 like pace shmoi sites experie nced favorable selection using prior utilization and health status the evaluators found that shmo enrollees tended to be healthier than those in traditional feeforservice medicare they also found evidence of favorable disenrollment where frail and impaired members were more likely to disenroll than healthier members82 the impact of shmoi on outcomes was mixed with more favorable results experienced by healthier enrollees and less favorable results experienced by frail and chronically ill enrollees manton and colleagues in particular concluded that shmos performed hmo functions well for the healthy and acutely ill as indicated by similarity in outcomes for certain casemix groups between shmo enrollees and feeforservice beneficiaries who joined an hmo during the course of their study alternatively they concluded that shmos did not perform well for impaired or acutely ill enrollees with chronic impairments though there was difference in casemix standardized mortality rates between shmo enrollees and feeforservice medicare beneficiaries frail individuals had higher probability of dying in shmos than in feeforservice medicare83 while unimpaired shmo enrollees reported higher satisfaction than unimpaired feeforservice medicare beneficiaries in all areas except interperson relations where there was difference impaired enrollees reported lower satisfaction than impaired feeforservice beneficiaries in all areas but finance and benefits

approval from hcfa to limit its medica re costsharing obligations to services delivered through its medicaid plans all other states are required to provide for medicaid payment of medicare costsharing whether or not dual eligibles elect to obtain care through their states medicaid network of providers because arizona only pays for medicare costsharing for dual eligibles who obtain medicare covered services from its medicaid network dual eligibles have strong incentive to use the same providers for both medicaid and medicare for those altcs members who choose to receive their medicare services

management costs rates are based on arizona medicaid rates program contractor financial statements service utilization data and histor ical trends medicare is billed separately because of concerns about the costeffectiveness of home and communitybased care hcfa initially placed cap on the percentage of the altcs budget that could be devoted to home and communitybased services for elderly and disabled members this cap was gradually raised from 5 in 1988 to 50 in 1999 hcfa removed the cap on hcbs for elderly and physically disabled members effective october 1 1999 at the present time seven program contractors provide care to the elderly and physically disabled in 15 arizona coun ties including two private plans and five countyoperated programs only one of these providers maricopa county also operates medicarechoice plan originally one contractor operated in each county and members had to enroll with the contractor in their county in order to receive services while arizona law mandated that the two largest counties maricopa and pima serve as program contractors in their respective counties all others counties had the right of first refusal to participate as program contractors if county chose not to participate the altcs sought competitive bids from private plans to provide the services within that county as of october 1 2000 all counties have contractors selected competitively while one county maricopa provides enrollees with choice of plans the countybased plan and two private plans starting october 1 2001 however arizona will consider contracting with more than one plan to serve pima county as well the altcs was evaluated for hcfa by researchers associated with laguna research associa tes evaluators found an approximately 16 average annual reduction in what arizona spent per capita for elderly and physical disabled longterm care recipie nts from what would have been spent in typical medicaid program most savings came from reduced hospital and nursing home use which was less than offset by higher ambulatory and administrative expenditures94 evaluators also found that nursing home residents in the altcs were less likely to be offered an influenza vaccine than medicaid nursing home residents in new mexico medicaid nursing home residents in the altcs moreover were more likely to experience decubitus ulcer fever and catheter insertion than nursing home residents served by the neighboring program in new mexico significant differences however existed between arizona and new mexico with respect to the incidence of patient falls or fractures resulting from the use of psychotropic drugs95 focusing on the acute care side of the arizona medicaid system the evaluators found that ssi recipients in arizona were less likely to report being very satisfied with their overall medical care compared to their counterparts in new mexico arizona enrollees also reported being slightly less satisfied on average with waiting time evening and weekend availability information giving courtesy and consideration alternatively arizona recipients reported slightly more satisfaction with ease and convenience and the costs paid

in medicaid managed care is mandatory oregon provides beneficiaries with choice of plans that in exchange for monthly capitation payments from oregons office of medical assistance programs omap are responsible for all medicaid primary and acute care benefits unlike arizona longterm care services are not included in the capitated plan and are instead provided on feeforservice basis as of january 1 2000 the oregon health plan had 349500 enrolled individuals approximately 50000 of whom were dually eligible elderly and disabled adults under oregons program most medicaid recipients receive their care through prepaid health plans three major types of managed care entities are used including fully capitated health plans dental care organization s and mental health organizations although ohp emphasizes enrollment in fully capitated plans primary care case management pccm and feeforservice coverage are also available on case by case basis individuals may be exempted from managed care enrollment for variety of reasons these include 1 availability of private supplemental insurance typically medigap policy provided by former employer 2 disruption of critical patient provider relationship and 3 native american heritage for elderly disabled and other beneficiaries with complex care needs local ohp enrollment counselors employed by local agencies responsible for aging andor

researchers at health economics research inc based in waltham massachusetts results are currently under review at hcfa and should be made available in early 2001 preliminary findings indicate that separate enrollment of dually eligible beneficiaries in medicare and medicaid is extremely complex and timeconsuming and represents the greatest source of frustration among ohp plans102 they also indicate that while the encc program has resulted in creative and flexible service plans for some beneficiaries the effectiveness of encc has been limited by lack of consumer and provider awareness of the program and variations in encc program operation as result of latitude granted plans in implementing these programs also the evaluators have pointed out that while some encc programs engage in

waiver authorities and one nonwaiver authority that have been used to authorize current federal and state dual eligible initiatives include 1 section 1115 of the social security act medicaid waiver section 1115 research and demonstration waiver allows states to test major restructuring of the medicaid program it has been used for variety of purposes including making medicaid managed care enrollment mandatory states can use 1115 waivers to lock in enrollment in managed care plan for 12 months if they provide enrollees with choice of plans the balanced budget act bba of 1997 granted states the flexibility to enroll most medicaid recipients in mandatory medicai d managed care without havin g to receive waiver so long as they offer beneficiaries choice between at least two managed care organizations or primary care case manager it explicitly excludes medicare beneficiaries children with special needs and members of federally recognized american indian tribes from mandatory managed care enrollment however as such states will continue to need section 1115 or other waiver to enroll dual eligibles in mandatory medicaid managed care section 1115 waiver also allows states to cover nonmedicaid services offer different service packages or combinations of services in different parts of the state test new reimbursement methods change medicaid eligibility criteria in order to offer coverage to new or expanded groups and contract with greater variety of managed care plans105 this waiver is typically granted for periods of up to 5 years at time 2 section 1915 b medicaid
