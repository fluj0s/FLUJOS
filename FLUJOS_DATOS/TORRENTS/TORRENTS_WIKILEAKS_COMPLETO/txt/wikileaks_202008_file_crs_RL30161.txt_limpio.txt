may 3 1999 john p hardt senior specialist in postsoviet economics foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report focuses on two divergent scenarios faced by russia in the wake of its financial crisis of august 1998 prime minister yevgenii primakov expected either vicious cycle of decline and possible collapse in government or an economic management scenario following outlines of an agreed action program that makes imperative fundamental changes in the russian financial system the success or failure of russia in dealing with this crisis may have more effect on the pursuit of peace and prosperity by the united states than any other foreign policy crisis this report draws on number of crs reports that summarize actions relevant to united states relations with russia including crs report 98578 the russian financial crisis an analysis of trends causes and implications crs issue brief 92089 russia crs report 98299 f russian missile technology and nuclear reactor transfers to iran this report builds upon crs report 97977 russias opportunity to enter new stage of transition this report may be updated or superseded by new report depending on action in the 106th congress on these issues or events russia primakovs economic policy dilemma and us interests summary russias devaluation of the ruble and default on its debts in august 1998 put it in its most serious crisis to date if trends that created the crisis continue russia is faced with vicious downward cycle toward dire economic straitshyperinflation steep reduction in output and income default on debts precluding the ability to borrow political weaknessdisintegration of central government power with increased corruption and instability and growing military dissent inviting political implosion resulting in threatened collapse of russias ability to govern the russian government foreign donors and investors agree that this is the likely outcome without radical change the primakov government and the donors international monetary fund the major industrial economiesthe g7 led by the united states are negotiating on an action program that might if effectively implemented provide basis for managing economic revival effectively dealing with debt management bank restructuring and reform budget balancing and investment generation might keep the major donors and some investors engaged with the russians and justify domestic support of reform adjusting now before the parliamentary and presidential elections of december 1999 and june 2000 might open the option of proceeding toward comprehensive reform in the manner of poland and other successfully reforming states the choices between the vicious cycle and managed economy are stark and understandable to russians and donors alike however the shortfalls in reform that created the crisis also established the wealth and power of the financial industrial groups the oligarchs who must change from rent seekers living off politically determined allocations from the state budget and monopoly profits to profit seeking competitive groups able to contribute to economic growth reduction of poverty and payment of taxes this change is crucial to the success of managed economy scenario the united states has different policy options if either the vicious cycle or managed economy scenario develops without concrete fundamental measures by the russians the united states and all major donors are committed to limiting support to humanitarian aid and some military reduction programs the united states may in this negative scenario face hostile russia still armed with nuclear weapons that is viewed by our defense authorities as the number one threat to our security with successful russian economic adjustment strategy the united states may play major role in responding to russian concrete reform actions leading all donors to provide targeted assistance keyed to russian actions and therefore likely to stimulate foreign direct investment from the united states and elsewhere especially in the energy sector if successful over time russia might then move toward becoming political ally in peacekeeping and partner in development of some of the most romising natural resources and technologically advanced assets in the world contents russias historic turning point 1

policy dilemma and us interests russias historic turning point resolution of postsoviet russias most serious economic crisis is of singular importance to the united states the danger to the united states of failed russian federation is great through possible deployment and use of nuclear and conventional weaponry increased destabilization of its eurasian neighbors possible return of authoritarian governance of weakened federation and further aggravation of the global economic crisis on the other hand the opportunities opened by russias actively managing its crisis and keeping open the prospects of return to democratic market trend would provide positive benefits cooperative russia moving toward democratic market system might become an important political ally and business partner congressional interest has been expressed on monitoring the measures promised by the primakov government which are intended to meet the challenges of its financial crises and respond to the requirements of donors and investors this criticality of russianunited states relations is illustrated by the importance attached to its governments bilateral economic discussions with us leaders and the relevance of the kosovo crisis and ratification of the start ii agreement to these exchanges many russian specialists in and outside russia believe russia is doomed to downward trend before the parliamentary and presidential elections in the months ahead michael marrese of chase manhattan bank london reflects this widely held view by projecting vicious cycle deepening crisis of

projection of past trends that gave rise to the current financial crisis when yevgeni primakov took the reins of government in september 1998 he found russia in its most serious economic crisis in its sevenyear existence with the default on debts and devaluation of the ruble by the previous government on august 17 1998 primakov stated that his government needed to take urgent measures to avoid defaulting on sovereign debt international donors and some investors adopted policy of continued engagement with russia under which concrete measures must be taken by russia to receive further assistancemeasures such as debt settlement setting up workable monetary system adopting and implementing sound budget and most importantly establishing rule of law for businesses to encourage investment2 the new approach of requiring both russian commitments and concrete measures as preconditions for assistance resulted from donor perceptions that previous reformoriented russian governments consistently made commitments that were not honored by performance thus successful negotiations between the primakov government and the donors are premised on implementation of urgent concrete measures that would redress the critical problems that caused the financial crisis and keep open the option for future transition to comprehensive reform after parliamentary elections in december 1999 or the presidential elections in june 2000 the russian reform record from september 1998 through march 1999 did not change the views of many primakov skeptics because concrete radical reform measures were not implemented still primakovs government has repeatedly reaffirmed his assessment of the seriousness of its crisis and need for urgent measures that seem to conform to conventional wisdom on the minimum requirements of an incremental policy as judged by the global market donors and investors the imf managing director michel camdessus and the russian authorities agreed on key elements of an economic program required to receive continued support from all donors for 1999 and beyond3 1 continued 1998 michael ellman and robert sharrenborg the russian financial crisis and the imf problems of postcommunism septemberoctober 1998 pp 1725 2 lawrence summers under secretary of treasury testimony to senate foreign relations committee january 27 1999 following similar comments at davos world economic meetings in december 1998 3 camdessus and russian leaders agreed on key elements of economic program april 29 1999 the program includes many measures in the fiscal banking and structural areas that the authorities have undertaken to implement including through enacting the necessary legislation as quickly as possible the authorities have also agreed to provide with full explanation of the management of reserves by the cbr central bank of russia and the use of disbursements from the imf over the last few years imf website crs3 primakov action program the russian government needs to implement measures that primakov has indicated would lead to promised improvements in output reduced social tensions manageable inflation stronger central government and effective debt service management these actions are needed to elicit foreign support successful reform may also enhance primakovs chances to stay in office and later ascend to the presidency preconditions for successful action program twostep approach would seem warranted for primakovs action program to be successful judging by actions and successful reforms elsewhere 1 broad activated political consensus favoring his economic action program broadly based russian program is necessary for success including support of some industrial magnates or oligarchs who favor globalization market system institutionalization and ruledriven society and some regional governors who would benefit from radical change and economic improvement and some more of the electorate who favor reform as means to ensure fairer more efficient system with prospects of improved performance the duma primakovs original parliamentary sponsor might be influenced by all of the above president yeltsin is certainly wild card in developing and implementing consensusbased policy 2 institutional changes to make the state market friendly establishment of legal and regulatory system through fiscal monetary and military reform would be required to create the necessary institutional infrastructure this would especially require change in the power and mindset of key russian entrepreneurs the financial industrial groups and the oligarchs who must change from rent seekers living off politically determined allocations from the state budget and monopoly profits to profit seeking competitive groups able to contribute to economic growth reduction of poverty and payment of taxes as primakov is aware broad political consensus supporting reform and establishing an institutional infrastructure conducive to the implementation of his action program is necessary for successful reform and support by donors4 the recent weakening of recalcitrant oligarchs such as boris berezovsky may indicate that this change is taking place implementation of an action program 1 debt rescheduling discussion on restructuring and renegotiating the debt inherited by russia from the soviet union is under way for commercial debt london club and sovereign debt paris club russians would like the london club and paris club debt to be generously restructured and rescheduled using the precedents of the polish debt

european bank for reconstruction and development 1997 crs4 reform would be critical to creditors acceptance of deep debt restructuring the initial problem for the russian government is to meet the 175 billion debt servicing required for 1999 with only half that amount available from their own budget with revenue projected this year at 22 billion russia would have to use 80 percent of its budget for debt servicing therefore assurance that as much as 9 billion would be covered by successful negotiations is critical moreover the first debtor in the queue is the imf with some 46 billion due imf agreement to begin releasing funds to russia in may 1999 is critical first step successful negotiations on debt reduction and repayment schedules acceptable to both sides will be necessary to avoid default primakov has frequently reassured creditors that all debts would be repaid albeit after restructuring 2 commercial and central bank restructuring the restructuring and recapitalization of the paralyzed banking system funded by state finances would result in many banks going bankrupt recapitalized banks would need to be guided by sound banking practices in order to begin to generate more savings and investment russian and western financial interests would have to accept substantial losses and recapitalized banks would need to be covered by new monetary regulations and legal requirements5 the central bank of russia would need to become more transparent and accountable for reserves and play an effective regulatory role for commercial banks bank restructuring is projected to be completed by summer 1999 under program set up by the primakov government an effective banking reform process might then result in foreign banks accepting primakovs invitation to operate in russia another critical indicator of trust in banking reform would be the willingness of the oligarchs to pull their still substantial financial assets back from abroad for deposit in their own banks and russian citizens willingness to take some 40 billion in assets out of their mattresses and to deposit them in russian banks 3 budget balancing state and regional budgets need to make progress toward supporting necessary expenditures from central state and regional revenues without incurring an additional debt burden under the agreed guidelines of the primakov imf agreement march 29 1999 new fairer and more efficient tax code might be passed into law and implemented with new budget eg reducing the burden on legal enterprises and increasing the yield from the value added tax institutional reforms including military and administrative reforms would be necessary to cut excessive expenditures and eliminate the carryover nomenklatura state administrators6 moving toward budget balancing illustrates the complementary or synergistic character of the action program the debt service burden on the state budget would be reduced by debt renegotiation banking reform might reduce the budget subsidies for failing banks and increased foreign investment and related joint ventures may lead to increases in tax revenue and other financial flows to the state treasury 5 european bank

coping with the financial crisis in addition to financial flows fdi would provide advanced technology and managerial and corporate governance culture of market economies to russian enterprises fdi is also nondebtcreating source of current account finance steady flow of fdi is an important sign of confidence since the worlds major credit rating agencies include it among their indicators of international creditworthiness thus rising inflow of fdi can help to create virtuous circle in which improved creditworthiness leads to more fdi past reform shortfalls remediation essential for the current crisis in spite of some success in stabilization liberalization and privatization in the 19921998 period critical shortfalls in reform policy set the economy on course toward financial crisis7 past failures reduced effectiveness of reform efforts from 19921998 by continued subsidization of unproductive security forces and bureaucracy by permitting wealth creation that was channeled abroad and for consumption of newly wealthy elite rather than into productive investment and tax revenues by privatization without restructuring that would have created competitive enterprises generating economic growth and state revenues and by imprudent shortterm financing by sales of government securities that inflated the debtservicing burden in the budget and led to the default in august 1998 addressing these past failures and reform shortfalls is critical in the implementation of the primakov action program for dealing with the current crisis 7 anders aslund social problems and policy in

aslund and mikhail dmitriev economic reform reform versus rentseeking in russia after communism anders aslund and martha olctott eds washington dc carnegie chapter four forthcoming 1999 crs6 retention and expansion of security forces and bureaucracy operating under old inefficient rules of the game the failure to downsize and restructure russias security forces and administrative bureaucracy puts heavy burden on the state budget and has been an incentive to inefficiency and corruption the heritage and continued burden of the soviet militarized system contributed to the current crisis the precipitous decline and erratic financing of military forces led by 1995 to an escalating crisis in the formerly preferred military forces and the militaryindustrial complex in 1997 yegor gaidar chairman of the budgetary advisory committee to the last government noted the chief national threat for the country is not the expansion of nato to the east but its own unreformed hungry and disgruntled army and the economy can longer withstand the financial load of maintaining an overstaffed and amorphous army it hurts that military reform is starting too late much time has been lost better late than never8 military reform is to date considered crisis management rather than managed restructuring according to the international institute of strategic studies iiss in spite of russias large and burdensome budget the iiss estimates the true level of military spending at about 27 percent of federal budget or 7 percent of gross domestic product when the cost of paramilitary forces arms control and subsidies to military regions and industries are included9 the central administrative civilian bureaucracy has doubled since 1991 to 12 million operating within much the same ministerial system as the old regime despite the fact that the russian federation has half the population of the former soviet union10 regional administrations have also retained much of the old systems structure and operating procedures the present state system is not only inefficient but is acknowledged to breed corruption in russia an estimated 3040 percent of the senior enterprise managers time is estimated to be spent in dealing with the state officials whereas in market economies the time averages only 812 percent by international comparisons russias state administration ranks with nigeria bolivia and colombia as most prone to corruption11 good deal of the promise of the earlier reform teams was that they had taken over many of the leadership positions in the central government ministries and institutions eg finance economics energy privatization and the central bank with 8 yegor gaidar ria novosti may 23 1997 clifford g gaddy the price of the past russias

chief economist of the world bank argues that new state in transition from command to market systems needs to do more than to change top managers it needs to be characterized by publicprivate partnerships that ensure that contracts are enforced and that expansion of markets into such areas as education health and pensions are both equitable and efficient12 nonproductive wealth generation limiting productive investment and tax revenue in 1992 over threequarters of the gross domestic product was channeled to wealth creation that did not contribute to investment or state revenue and instead weakened the value of the ruble and the balance of payments due to weakness in state regulation and politically controlled benefits substantial fortunes were built up eg by buying oil at very low domestic prices and selling at the world market price by buying consumer goods including food at competitive foreign prices and selling at subsidized internal prices and by obtaining soft bank loans for which repayment was not enforced this exploitation diminished over successive years but some such rentseeking and monopoly profits continued up to the financial crisis13 the newly rich oligarchs channeled much of their wealth abroad motivated by the classical reason for capital flight fear of losing their assets capital flight has been estimated by an authoritative canadianrussian study to have been between 125140 billion in the years 1991199714 western banker estimates capital flight at 20 billion in 1998 and projects 171 billion for 1999 if trends continue15 privatization without restructuring of enterprises in 1993 and early 1994 transfer of state assets by voucher privatization and in 1997 loans for shares at low cost to some politically influential rent seekers further reduced the effectiveness of reform by directing financial flows away from new capital assets for generating new output and shifting revenue away from the state budget those who benefitted from the wealthgenerating opportunities of 1992 and others in politically advantageous positions were able to gain control of some of the most valuable industrial assets at low prices in the voucher privatization the financial industrial groups formed by those newly rich with ownership of key industries and banks also gained control of key media sourcesnewspapers tv and radio stations when seeking reelection in 1997 president yeltsin turned to them for financial and political support and offered shares in other key state enterprises as security for their financial support thus the loans for shares program extended the oligarchs control had 12 joseph stiglitz more instruments and broader goals moving toward post washington consensus world institute for development economic research

flight crs8 privatization been undertaken through open auctions with foreign and domestic bidders the state would have received muchneeded cash and the enterprises might have been restructured to make them competitive and profitable this openness was the pattern followed in successful transitions and privatizations in hungary and poland the reform shortfall in voucher privatization and loans for shares programs was that russian privatization did not lead to restructuring the capital assets and management of russian enterprises the new enterprise owners reinforced the power of the rentseeking oligarchs who benefitted from their influence on the state bureaucracy and access to the state budget restructuring the physical assets and management system of the enterprises in the most militarized economy in history has been most formidable challenge not yet met by the reform program although some political gains may have accrued from reduction in state ownership the privatization process that followed reinforced the rentseeking rather than the profitseeking criteria for success and set back the monetization of the economy the newly rich oligarchs were in strong position to extract rents through political influence on the government and by operating outside the official economy many less politically powerful found that operating outside the official economy favored their survival over half of the transactions in russia may have been in the barter or virtual economy rather than in the official economy16 the barter or virtual sector is survival economy whose industrial enterprises do not contribute to economic growth and do not provide tax revenue to the state budget moreover the banks privatized without state regulation do not perform their primary function of providing capital to restructured and new enterprises russian privatization stabilization and liberalization were necessary changes they were not alone sufficient to ensure introduction of the profit motive and economic growth because the russian economy lacked the necessary systemic infrastructure joseph stiglitz chief economist of the world bank aptly summarized the shortfalls in russias transition russia achieved huge increase in inequality at the same time that it managed to shrink the economy by up to third according to some estimates living standards collapsed with gdp levels as life spans became shorter and health worsened all too late it was recognized that without the right institutional infrastructure the profit motivecombined with full capital market liberalization could fail to provide incentives for wealth creation and could instead spark drive to strip assets and ship wealth abroad17 imprudent budget deficit management burdening the state budget and leading to default with the burden of rentseeking subsidies on the state budget and slow growth in taxable income expenditures and debt service continued to exceed state revenues taxable income was especially 16 ebrd transition

auctions to foreign buyers failed to materialize to generate substantial income due to high risk perception in the global market flows from foreign direct investment fell far short of expectations capital flight increased to over 20 billion year and sizable profits were transferred abroad the state temporized by sequestration or withholding of payments to workers pensioners military and others not politically powerful loans from international agencies intended for reform support not budget balancing brought much needed but insufficient financial inflows in this constrained budget context new major source for financing the budget deficit was found in the emerging markets for rubledenominated treasury bills gkos and bonds ofzs the ruble had been stable and appreciating in 1996 and russian international credit ratings reached investmentrisk level in 19971998 even though the gkos had to be sold at high interest and short maturity their sales became major shortterm means of balancing the budget as result by 1998 servicing the debt had risen to about forty percent of the budget18 with the august 17 collapse of the ruble and facto default the gko market collapse put russia in solvency trap the russian government could not sell more securities to service the debt it had increased to manage its budget deficit gkos thus emulated junk bonds of the united states with similar requirement for resolving the solvency trap including restructuring and recapitalizing its failing commercial banks with many seeking the protection of bankruptcy postcrisis scenarios and us policy options the policy options for the united states in relations with russia would be significantly different depending on the development of either the vicious cycle or managed economy scenarios the degree of effective engagement the likelihood of influence on russian developments beneficial to us interests and the implications for future russian developments would all be markedly different depending on the course of russian economic development prior to the parliamentary election in december 1999 and the presidential election set for june 2000 the election outcomes would likely be influenced by the alternative scenarios and in turn affect us options in responding to the outcomes of parliamentary and presidential elections in an environment of failed governance some suggest that the russian reformers might come back and reform might be renewed this worst is better thinking is associated with the prospects of bulgarian or argentine currencyboard19 model in 18 ebrd transition

antireformers are discredited and true reformers make political comeback with an austerity program featuring foreigncontrolled currency board the primakov government might be replaced before the december 1999 parliamentary elections but introduction of the bulgarianargentine model seems less likely than the belarus model in the successor government because belarus has an authoritarian reactionary government that controls the populace by use of intimidation and force belarus might be the likely governance model of viciouscycle scenario under the vicious cycle the united states options for assisting russia would be restricted us presence and engagement would likely be sharply cut back humanitarian aid in food and medicine may be even more needed and appropriate some cooperative security programs may continue as still deemed in mutual security interest20 if the united states is to continue to be engaged with russia it may be because primakov is able and willing to support reasonable efforts to manage its exit from financial crisis through performance on the agreed action programs the strength of the action program and related negotiations for their coming to grips with the crisis may lie in its service to the basic interests of both the current russian government and the donors and investors giving priority to an institutional restructuring strategy promises improved prospects for economic growth improved economic security and closer ties with the global market this strategy of the action program might encourage profitseeking over rentseeking thus pressuring the rentseeking monopolistic oligarchs to shift the russian economy toward growthpromoting strategy21 the success of strategy involving cultural change in the russian system is of interest to the united states and other donors the predictability of the reform scenario is contingent on basic change in the incentive character of the russian system change in the way the elite is judged any benefit from reform is difficult to project as many potential supporters of change would seem to be acting against their interests 19 continued board hanson op cit steve h hanke and kurt

and poles22 in each case the united states persuaded european sovereign and commercial debtors to accept substantial reductions in their claims through paris and london clubs negotiations innovative debt restructuring approaches such as debt to equity and debt to nature may likewise again be explored debt to equity would involve transfer of ownership of industrial enterprises or mines to foreign creditors debt to nature would involve conversion of debt by the russian government funding environmental programs in lieu of debt payment specific measures linking current debt settlements to improved climate for foreign direct investment and provisions for gaining transparency and repatriation of flight capital may also be in order23 2 bank restructuring process reconstructing the facto bankrupt commercial banks might be keyed to making them reliable intermediaries for savings to investment in new capital stock primakovs proposal for foreign banks including united states banks to operate in russia may be pursued if the preconditions for effective operation of american banks in russia are fulfilled russian banking would be greatly improved by adding foreignowned or joint venture banks to the russian banking system hungarian experience with citibank and other american banks could be instructive 3 budget balancing an improved budget for 1999 and adoption of critical aspects of the draft tax code by the duma are necessary but not alone sufficient to proceed toward budget balancing to effectively reduce redundant expenditures all rentseeking activities need to be addressed including military administrative as well as fiscal and monetary reforms without improved debt management and radical bank restructuring the debt service burden on the budget might not be reduced sufficiently revenue from auctions of state assets may also add to state revenue if proper restructuring of assets for sale and necessary conditions for effective foreign management

those concerned that the food would not go to the truly needy and this concern may influence decisions in congress to increase assistance purported russian food aid to iraq and serbia also cloud the aid programs some russians argued the food need is exaggerated and the large us agricultural surpluses had dictated the agreements see crs issue brief 92089 russia updated march 5 1999 broader usled conditionality negotiations and conditionality currently undertaken by the international monetary fund appear to have been broadened to include concrete measures that may be responded to by the world bank european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd and other bilateral and multilateral organizations in the g7 the debate led by joseph stiglitz and nicholas stern on the need to forge new transition strategy postwashington consensus focusing on building institutional infrastructures and emphasizing enterprise efficiency has apparently resulted in broader usled reform assistance strategy and conditionality for russia us policy makers after august 1998 had seemed pessimistic in the short run but continued to have longrun optimism for democratic market reform in russia deputy secretary of state talbott characterized the present crisis as current russian time of troubles using the russian terms smutnye vremya in recent speeches reference was also made to times of miracles chudyesnye vremya that may come in the new millennium27 however by late fall 1998 the us and imf policy began to stress continued us commitment to an engagement policy with specific attention to concrete measures prepared to respond to shortterm results in the months ahead28 the broader conditionality in current negotiations on the russian program may be appropriate not only because of the range of issues beyond the mission of specific international financial institutions but also for the broader implications for change in russia and in our bilateral relations moreover the success of the reform policy seems increasingly tied to the broader issue of how russia defines its identity and future change involving its incentive system and the institutional framework of russian governance may be deemed necessary and required secretary talbott by framing the current financial crisis as part of the identity crisis for russiaa new time of troublessuggests that necessary economic reform may affect not only russian governance but russian culture for favorable outcome russia may need 27 secretary strobe talbott speech at stanford university september 17 1998 john p hardt commentary on

address its broader cultural crisis in resolving its financial crisis in the short run then proceed as other countries have toward democratic market system under rule of law this aspect of change makes adopting necessary changes seem to be miracle or as the germans noted wirtshaftwunder as machiavelli earlier noted in the renaissance period this kind of radical change may be most difficult but crucial and it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of new order of things because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had long experience of them thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans whilst the others defend lukewarmly 29 this broader politicalcultural rationale for incrementally dealing with russias current crisis has been gaining more adherents among professional russia watchers while noting that the current government has survived the immediate crisis better in the short term than expected some still view an incremental approach as too little too late to hold sway with russian voters later this year30 at the same time others argue that furtherance at this time of the managedeconomy reform plan acceptable to foreign donors and investors is necessary over sustained period to decrease economic inefficiencies revive economic growth and enhance internal and international political support what does appear clear is that russia cannot continue to muddle through or just survive its economic crisis should he follow this path primakov risks losing both internal as well as international support primakovs dilemma may thus be that neither action nor inaction are riskless while continuing to push forward on his action plan 29 niccolo machiavelli the
