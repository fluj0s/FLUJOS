resources science and industry division october 24 2008 abstract over the past year crude oil prices have nearly doubled reaching record levels proposals before congress include number of legislative initiatives to increase domestic oil production these proposals have fallen into two broad categories 1 to open areas of the outer continental shelf ocs which are currently under leasing moratoria and 2 to encourage companies holding oil and gas leases to diligently develop leases to bring them into production two bills were introduced that would have denied new leases to those lessees who were not developing their leases or producing oil or gas hr 6251 and hr 6515 the two bills including similar provisions were introduced under suspension of the rules in the house and both failed to achieve the

banned in the offshore ocs areas along the us atlantic and pacific coasts however on july 14 2008 under presidential directive the bush administration lifted the executive ocs moratoria that had been in place since 1990 the recent congressional action approving the continuing appropriations act for fy2009 pl 110329 enacted september 30 2008 that continued the funding of government activities through march 6 2 009 or until regular appropriations bill is enacted omitted language that provided for the congressional ocs moratoria along the atlantic and pacific coasts those areas may now be made available for preleasing leasing and related activity that could lead to oil and gas development the moratorium however would remain in place for near ly all of the eastern gulf of mexico as it

into two broad categories to 1 open areas of the outer continental shelf ocs which are currently under leasing moratoria and to 2 encourage companies holding oil and gas leases to diligently develop leases to bring them into production proponents of these initiatives argue that promising areas should be open for exploration to maximize domestic oil production as soon as possible this report

in commercial quantities by the end of its primary term the lease reverts back to the government for possible future lease saleunless the lessee is granted an extension extensions are granted for onshore lessees under 43 cfr 3107 for onetime twoyear period offshore extensions are granted under 30 cfr 250180 the regulation for offshore extensions does not specify the length of the extension also it is not clear how often the bureau of land managementblm or minerals management service mms grant extensions 3 it has been projected that as much as 48 million barrels per day could be produced on nonproducing leases offshore and onshore4 critics however assert that this rate of additional oil production is unattainable on july 17 2008 the most recent congressional energy proposal to reach the house floor hr 6515 drill responsibly in leased lands act of 2008 was defeated under suspension of the rules vote which requires twothirds majori ty by 244173 this act was said to promote an expeditious and environmentally responsible development of the national petroleum reserve in alaska npra and would have denied new leases to lessees that were not diligently developing their leases producing oil or gas or relinquishing nonproducing leases proponents of this bill argued that many of the lessees are sitting on federal leases and not producing oil or gas although both bills hr 6515 and hr 6251 retained the 10year primary oil and gas lease term language removed from an earlier version of hr 6251 would have reduced the primary lease term for onshore and deepwater offshore from 10year term to five years with 1 for broader analysis of ocs leasing revenue sharing and the moratoria please see crs report rl33493 outer continental shelf debate over oil and gas leasing and revenue

6251 was also defeated by vote of 223195 twothirds needed for passage these two bills were referenced as use it or lose it proposals supported by policymakers who argued that it was unnecessary to lift the ocs moratorium because there were millions of acres already leased that could yield crude oil production but which were presently inactive it is unclear how much and how quickly additional production would take place on nonproducing leases some critics of use it or lose it proposals argued that these proposals could create disincentive for companies to seek leases andor result in lower bonus bids on new leases use it or lose it policy critics of the bills argued would not necessarily lead to additional production sooner it might in fact undercut that objective as noted implementation of use it or lose it legislation could result in fewer bids or lower bid offers if more stringent timeline were to be imposed on all leases held however by maintaining the 10year primary term as both bills would have done more federal funds might be appropriated for permitting and other required environmental reviews similar bill in the senate s 3239 responsible federal oil and gas lease act would deny lessees new leases unless lessees were producing oil or gas on currently held leases if lessees do not diligently develop each lease they would be required to relinquish them the house and senate proposals would require the secretary of the interior to define diligent development as it relates to oil and gas leases

administration eia of the departme nt of energy projects that us oil production will increase from todays 51 million barrels per day 5 mbd to 63 mbd by 2018 then decline to 56 mbd by 2030 but eia did not factorin possible changes in lease management6 eia projected that offshore crude oil production would increase from about 14 mbd to 22 mbd by 2030 when the eia included access to the ocs currently under the leasing moratoria production was projected to rise by an additional 200000 barrels per day by 2020 with significant impact on prices7 an anticipated rise in us domestic production on federal lands is seen as coming primarily from deepwater offshore areas as shallow water and onshor oil fields are in decline according to the mms deepwater oil already accounts for more than 70 of offshore production and 185 of total us crude oil production since 2002 shallow water lease sales have dropped from 418 to 264 while deepwater lease sales rose from 281 to 633 deepwater lease sales spiked in 1997 at 1110 following the deepwater royalty relief act of 1995 further it is notable that there has been increasing exploration activity and an increase in reported finds in the gulf of mexico in very deep waters since 2003 given that oil prices are set in world market any additions to us oil supply must be seen in the context of additions to oil supply worldwide 5 us doe energy information
