and economic analysis summary in the wake of the three destructive hurricanes that struck the gulf coast during the 2005 hurricane season katrina rita and wilma the attention of policymakers in congress and elsewhere has turned to the subject of insurance for large catastrophic risks including natural disa sters such as hurricanes and earthquakes the generally perceived increase in the incidence of major catastrophes and their increasingly costly nature has prompted some analysts to question whether the economys market for catastrophe insurance is sufficient to meet the burdens of major catastrophes does the market provide sufficient amount of insurance against major catastrophes or is there shortage and to the extent that catastrophe insurance exists are the insuring firms sufficiently capitalized so that widespread insolvencies would not occur some have suggested that federa l action is advisable to make sure that insurance industry resour ces are adequate to ensure the availability and affordability of disaster insurance and payment of claims when disasters occur one widely discussed proposal would ch ange the tax treatment of catastrophic risk insurance by permitting insurance companies to establish taxdeductible reserve funds for catastrophes version of the proposal was developed by working group of the national association of insurance commissioners and similar plan was introduced as legislation in the 110th congress hr 164s 926 and in the 109th congress hr 2668 representative foley the proposals supporters argue that they would enhance the ability of insurance firms to meet the requirements of major disasters without risking insolvency and would increase the availability of catastrophe insurance economic analysis suggests that provision of taxdeductible insurance reserve for catastrophes would constitute preferentia l tax benefit in the form of deferral or postponement of taxes tax rules for most other ty pes of activitie s permit the deduction of losses only when losses actually occur not when reserves for losses are established according to theory tax bene fits that favor one type of activity over another ordinarily hamper economic efficiency and reduce economic welfare by diverting resources from their most productiv use in some cases however markets may fail and government intervention thr ough taxes or other policies may improve efficiency the question economic analys is asks of the taxdeferred reserve deduction is thus whether market failures exist in the case of catastrophe insurance while some economic analysts have identified number of market failures that might reduce the volume of catastrophe in surance others are skeptical this report will be upda ted as legislative developments occur

in public fi nance government nd finance division was the coauthor of this report before retirin g from the congressional research service tax deductions for catastrophic risk insurance reserves explanation and economic analysis the devastation caused by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma which struck along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coast during the 2005 hurricane season highlights the fact that the united states continues to be subject to natural hazard risks primarily weatherrelated risks such as hurricanes and windstorms but also seismic risk earthquakes tsunami volcanic eruptions driven by basic geophysics and inland flood hazard risks caused by increasing floodplain development and climatechangedriven extreme weather events1 according to the insurance services office inc iso the propertycasualty pc insurance industry paid 622 billion in catastrophe losses from 24 disasters and more than 44 million claims in 2005 making 2005 the most costly year for catas trophe losses by contrast the 2006 and 2007 hurricane seasons were much less activ than predicted the availability and affordability of property insurance in coas tal countie s along the gulf and atlantic coasts have become concern to property owners state legislators and policymakers as insurers pull back from highrisk areas insurers insist they must take this action to reduce future potential hurricane losses and minimize the potential for insolvency federal outlays for disaster victims have been increasing and the frequency of weatherrelated natural disaster s is generally perceived to be rising the insurance industry had the financial re sources to pay the claims from hurricane katrina rita and wilma and earn significant profits but the devastation in the gulf coast and new orleans from katrina and high federal and private costs have generated interest in congress and elsewhere in proposals desi gned to change the way individuals and communities evaluate and protect themselves against the risk of natural disasters ie financing risk with insurance given the increasing concentration of insured property values and sophisticated comput er models that suggest an increased frequency of hurricanes and high probabl maximum losses pml from catastrophic earthquakes respectively there has been so sense of urgency in congress state legislatures and the private sector to address the nations financial exposure to catastrophic risks one widely discussed proposal would ch ange the tax treatment of catastrophic risk insurance by permitting firms to tablish taxdeductible reserve funds for catastrophes version of the proposal was developed by working group of the national association of in surance commissioners naic along with providing tax deduction for

vedenov innovations in agricultural and natural disaster insurance american journal of agricultural economics august 2001 p 650reserves mandatory and woul d permit the reserves to be accounted for on the balance sheet of the insurers similar plan has been introduced as legislation in the 110th congress hr 164s 926 policyholder disaster protection act of 2007 and previously in the 108th and 109th congresses hr 4186 and hr 2668 representative foley unlike the naic pl an the legislation s reserves would not be mandatory nor directly change cu rrent accounting practices the proposals supporters argue that they would enhance th ability of insurance firms to meet the requirements of major disast ers without risking insolvency and would increase the availability of catastrophe insurance the discussion that follows begins by providing some background on the market for catastrophe insurance it continues by describing the proposal for taxdeductible reserve accounts as set forth in hr 164s 926 of the 110th congress and concludes by providing an economic analysis of the plan the appendix contains sectionby section explanation of hr 164s 926 the version of the plan introduced in the current congress the market for catastrophe insurance in broad terms catastrophic risk is dis tinct from other risks simply because of its large size catastrophes affect large number of persons and firms simultaneously imposing huge losses traditi onal examples include natural disasters such as hurricanes andrew 1992 and katrina 2005 the northridge earthquake 1994 and the midwest floods 1993 anothe r example is the risk of loss from the world trade center terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 alt hough this particular type of risk has certain unique characteristics that place it beyond the scope of the analysis here in terms of economic analysis the large size of catastrophes produces particular result for insurance it makes the elimination of uncertainty by an individual insurance firm diffi cult the market for insurance is based on insurance firms being able to pool risks faced by large number of policyholders whose risks are not related to each other when rge number of uncorrelated risks are pooled insurance firms can predict with relative certainty the average occurrence of particular insured event say an accident occurring among insured persons and can provide insurance based on the reduction of that uncertainty but the ability of pooled risks to reduce uncertainty diminishe s when the risks of policyholders are correlated and in the case of catastrophes the risk of large numbers of insurance buyers is indeed related for exam ple large groups of homeowners may simultaneously incur damage from hurricane or earthquake thus to sell catastrophe insurance insurance firms must pool an exceedingly large group of risks in order to avoid correlated risks and develop marketable insurance2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs3 3 for detailed description of reinsurance and its role in providing catastrophic loss insurance see george rejda principles of risk management and insurance 8th ed boston addison wesley 2003 pp 535541 4 for description of how securitization wo rks see ibid p 541 and miranda and vedenov innovations in agricultural and natural disaster insurance p 651 5 scott harrington and greg niehaus g overnment insurance tax policy and the affordability and availability of catastrophe insurance journal of insurance regulation summer 2001 p 594in keeping with this feature of catastr ophe insurance an important characteristic of the market is its reliance on what is known as reinsurance in insurance parlance that is particular insurance firm in writing policies for catastrophic risk may not be able to find sufficiently large pool of uncorrelated risks in its own marketing area for example company whose market is limited to particular coastal area may have difficulty developing pool of customers whose risk of facing hurricane damage is unrelated the company may accordingly sell hurricane insurance policies but may itself purchase insurance reinsurance against the catastrophe in effect expanding the pool to unr elated risks beyond its own market3 another technique insurance firms have used in recent years to provide catastrophe insurance is secu ritization here insurance firms turn to general capital markets to diversify their risks by marketing securities for example catastrophe bonds whose interest rate is contingent on the likelihood of catastrophes occurrence that are attractive to investors because market risk is not related to catastrophe risk and the catastr ophe securities may thus provide means of portfolio diversif ication for investors4 notwithstanding these methods of financ ing catastrophe insurance concern has been expressed by some analysts and po licymakers about the ability of the industry to satisfactorily meet the challenges of major catastrophe concern has focused on two factors that are sometimes termed th industrys capacity to face catastrophic risk whether the insurance industry pr ovides sufficient level of catastrophe coverage and whether catastrophe would result in large number of insolvencies among insurance firms proposals for taxdeductible reserv accounts have been advanced as means of incr easing the industrys capacity development of the proposal for tax deductible reserves current us tax law and accounting systems do not permit deducting reserves for future catastrophe losses reportedly th is situation has discouraged insurers from accumulating assets specifically to pay fo r future catastrophe losses and has limited the industrys ability to increase its cap acity to underwrite catastrophe risks5 instead payments for catastrophe losses are made from unrestricted policyholders surplus after the losses are incurred httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs4 6 us congress senate committee on the budget tax expenditures compendium of background material on individual provisions report prepared by the congressional research service 108th cong 2d sess s prt 10854 washington gpo 2004 pp 201 203 7 for more information on the naic propos see naic catastrophe working group summary of the naic catastrophe proposal naic research quarterly 6 2 summer 2000under the current us tax law property and casualty insurer income in excess of annual expenses is considered profit and is subject to federal income tax in addition us accounting principles both generally accepted acc ounting principles and statutory accounting principles app licable to property and casualty insurers limit the recording of loss reserves to losses that have already occurred and require the recognition of catastrophe premiums in periods prior to the period in which catastrophe losses are incurred thus both us tax law and accounting standards discourage insurers from setting aside money for natural disaster events that cause unusually costly damages under 832b5 irc deduction of u npaid property loss reserves for property and casualty insurance companies insurers are currently allowed to deduct the discounted value of estimated losses they will be required to pay in the future under insurance policies currently in force including claims in dispute6 this allows insurers to deduct future expenses from current income and thereby defer tax liability this unpaid propert loss reserve is comparable to what is known in the insurance industry as incurred but not repor ted ibnr lossesreserve it is an estimate of losses that have been incurred but not reported in some cases insurers know ibnr losses and make preliminary loss estimates in other cases however ibnr losses show up years after the damage first occurs insurers will adjust ibnr reserves for such losses as new information becomes available and deduct from current taxes the discounted value of the timated losses reserv set aside for the ibnr losses are different from the reserves that insurers want to deduct for future catastrophic losses in that those losses ve not yet been incurred nor reported in 1995 the national association of insurance commissioners naic established catastrophe re serve subgroup of the cata strophe insurance working group to work with the insurance industry and actuarial resources groups for the development and implementa tion of taxdeductible pr eevent catastrophe reserve for property and casualty insurers by 1997 the naic had developed working model for the reserve which if it were to receive the support of congress would enable insurers to set aside funds earma rked for large catastrophe losses and thus increase their capability to manage catas trophic losses the model was revised several times in the late 1990s based on the results of economic evaluation and public comments on the design of the rese rve and the statutory accounting changes needed to implement such reserve in 2000 the naics catastrophe insura nce working group made its proposal to the naic property and casualty committee but the naic did not adopt the proposal beyond the working group level7 the naic maintains that it will adopt the proposal only if congress changes the tax law to allow insurers to establish reserveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs5 for future catastrophic events on taxde ductible basis with offsetting tax increases to the insurance industry insu rers also drafted an example of the kind of federal tax legislation that they felt could be used to implement this taxdeductible preevent catastrophe reserve proposal in 2001 the national conference of insu rance legislators ncoil adopted resolution to support taxde ductible preevent natural di saster reserve fund the resolution states that ncoil will work with the naic and federal legislators to develop taxdeduc tible preevent catastrophe reserve legislation under the insurance industr ys taxdeductible catastrophe reserve proposal state insurance regulators would approve catastr ophe insurance rates that insurers insist must reflect past experien ce and projected exposures during discussions in 2000 before the naics catastr ophe insurance working group regulators expressed an understanding about the concerns of insure rs regarding the current tax and accounting treatment of catastrophe reserv and have assured insure rs that they would approve catastropherelated rates that reflect both past experien ce and projected exposures insurers had insisted that property insurance rates in regions with significant historical or projected catastrophe exposures shoul d reflect this exposure regulators however needed assurances by the industry that the portion of approved catastropherelated premiums set aside in dedicated reserve account for catastrophe exposures will be earmarked for financin g catastrophe losses that are not expected to occur on an annual ba sis and that these funds will be used only to meet obligations to policyholders both regula tors and insurers agree that requiring catastrophe reserve without tax deductibility would not pr ovide additional assets to finance insured catastrophe claims hence many see congressional action to change federal tax law as precondition for imp lementing the naic catastrophe reserve proposal outline of the proposal the taxdeduction proposal set forth by the naic and the approach specified by hr 164s 926 as well as legislation in prior congresses are the same in their broad outline there are however some differences for example the naic plan would make establishment of reserves mandatory while hr 164s 926 would not and the naic plan would have specific dollar target for industry reserves 40 billion after 20year build up while hr 164s 926 would not each plan however would allow insurance firms ta x deduction for amounts contributed to an account designed to provide reserve for disaster payments distributions from the accounts would be subject to tax as disc ussed below the resu lt is tax benefit in the form of deferral postponement of tax the plan specified by hr 164s 926 would permit firms to establish policyholder disaster protection funds wh ich would consist of assets to be used solely for the payment of qualified losses contributions to the funds would be tax deductible as long as they do not exceed the difference between fundcaps specified in the legislation and funds balance the latter amount woul d generally be the cumulative amount of previous contributi ons less distributions generally linked tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs6 8 the skepticism of these analysts is cited in us government accountability office catastrophe risk us and european approac hes to insure natural catastrophe and terrorism risks gao05199 pp 30 25a firms catastrophe losses in short contributions would be deductible in particular year only to the extent there is room between firms cap and its fund balance conversely distributions from the funds would be included in gross income and subject to tax while complex set of rules would determine the amount of distributions in given year the amount s would generally be linked to catastrophe losses catastrophes in tur n would generally consist of disasters such as hurricanes cyclones tornadoes earthquakes winter catastrophes fires tsunami floods volcanic eruptions or hail arguments for and against taxdeductible catastrophe reserves calls for government and industry ac tion in the area of catastrophic risk insurance have stemmed from concerns bout the insurance industrys capacity in this area that is the industrys ability to weather large catastrophe without large number of insolvencies or the inab ility to honor insured losses supporters of the taxdeductible reserve pr oposal have argued that the plan by encouraging insurers to establish catastrophe rese rves will both help protect against insolvencies and will increase the availability of catastrophe insurance it is argued by the plans proponents that number of benefits would follow from such outcomes including enhanced ability of stricken areas to recover from disasters reduced necessity in the long run for other forms of federal assistance reduced flow of us capital to offshore foreign reinsurance firms critics of the plan have pointed out that it would reduce federal tax revenue in an era of large budget deficits they also question whether the proposal would accomplish what is intended that is wh ether it would increase the availability of catastrophe insurance and the financial s oundness of firms providing the insurance some analysts for example have suggested the taxfavored reserves may simply become substitutes for the purchase of reinsurance while others have suggested the taxfavored reserves may shield unrelated activities of insurance firms from tax8 rather than assess these arguments on pointbypoint basis the next section provides an economic analysis of the proposal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs7 9 depending on how the proposal is specifically drafted the exact nature of the benefit could vary for example for an insurance compan with stable premiums the phasedin proposal in hr 2668 appears to provide 20year tax deferral for fraction of premiums collected on catastrophic risk insurance with consta nt growth in premiums however the benefit could approximate that of an indefinite ferral ie an exemption of fraction of continuedeconomic analysis as the dismal science economics begins with the recognition that economic resources are fixed thus even if the proposed tax deduction for catastrophe reserves would increase the supply of catastrophe insurance or reduce insolvencies among insurance firms the added resources th at enable these outcomes are necessarily diverted from other uses economic th eory also holds in general that undistorted price signals established in freely operating markets are the most effective means of channeling resources into their most productive uses thus price distortions normally reduce the efficient allocation of resources and accordingly reduce economic welfare when applied to insurance this part of economic theory indicates that if insurance markets are ope rating smoothly the diversion of resources into catastrophe insurance by means of tax deduction likely reduces economic efficiency markets do not however always function smoothly and in the presence of what economics terms market failure government intervention either by tax subsidy or other means may actually improve efficiency by correcting the market failure in assessing the proposed duction for catastrophe reserves economic analysis thus asks the following questions would the provision of taxde ductible catastrophe insurance reserve constitute preferentia l tax treatment for catastrophe insurance if the deduction would pose tax be nefit are there failures in the markets for catastrophe insurance that result in its underprovision without government intervention if there are market failures woul d the proposal act to address them the analysis here concludes that ta x deduction for reserves is likely tax benefit beyond this it does not attempt final answer regarding market failures or the efficacy of the proposal in correcting them it does however suggest caution there is considerable uncertainty both bout whether market failures actually occur and whether the particular tax proposal in question woul d address them if they do assuming that the proposal that would be implemented would follow the general outlines common to each version of the proposal that is tax deduction for additions to reserve and taxation of withdrawals the tax deduction provided by the proposal would constitute tax benefit in the form of deferral or postponement of taxes9 in general the federal income tax applies to income as it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs8 9 continued premiums equal to the growth rate 10 other factors that might contribute to ca tastrophe insurance market failures may be inefficiencies in the reinsurance market not discussed here 11 for discussion see david m cutler and richard j

business costs and losses to be deducted only when they are actually incurred because the proposal w ould permit additions to reserves to be deducted from taxable income before the losses the reserves finance actually occur the plan would have the effect of shiftin g some amount of taxable income towards the future permitting firms to delay an amount of tax liability equa l to the tax savings generated by the deduction tax deferral in turn conf ers tax benefit because given amount of taxes matters less to fi rm the longer its actual payment can be postponed in the interim the funds that w ould otherwise have to be paid in taxes can be invested and earn return incr easing the insurers aftertax profits the proposal would thus confer tax be nefit but are there one or more market failures economic analysts of the in surance industry have identified several theoretical reasons to believe the market failures may exist first as described in other parts of this report catastrophe insurance by its nature sometimes leads individual insurance firms to seek reinsura nce to adequately cover catastrophe risk the scope of catastrophes is so broad that without reinsurance single insurance firm may face claims from large portion of its policyholders at the same time thus increasing its risk of insolvency if either reinsurance or securitization is not undertaken several analysts have argued that the use of reinsurance may in turn increase the likelihood of market failures that result from asymmetrical information that is the insured entity knowing more about the size or probability of risk than the insurer10 these information related failures are termed adverse selection and moral hazard with adve rse selection reinsurance firms ar not as familiar with the risks they insure as are the individual insurance companies who buy reinsurance the primary insurers11 with moral hazard the insured entity increases its risky behavior once it purchases insurance in the case of catastrophe reinsurance such risky behavior consists of primary insurer increasing the volume of risky policies they themselves sell to individuals and firms12 in the case of either failure reinsurance firms must increase their premiums to account for the uncertainty and the volume of insurance coverage is accordingly lower than it would be without adverse selection or moral hazard there are some analys ts however who doubt that either adverse selection or moral hazard play promin ent role in the market for catastrophichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs9 13 jaffee and russell for example are skeptical of the existence of asymmetrical information dwight m jaffee and thomas russell catastrophe insurance capital markets and uninsurable risks journal of risk and insurance vol 64 june 1997 p 206 froot believes that the design features of catastrophic insurance high deductible amounts mitigate problems of adverse selection and moral hazard see froot limited finance of catastrophe risk p 14 14 the principalagent problem with catastrophe insurance is identified in david m cutler and richard j zeckhauser reinsurance for catastrophes and cataclysms nber working paper 5913 cambridge ma national bur

economic research 2001 p 1 in both this and an earlier study however froot expresses doubt over adverse lection and moral hazard as explanatory factors preferring capital market factors as being more likely cause the capital market continuedinsurance13 so the presence of moral hazard or adverse selection cannot be accepted as given second type of market failure that s been suggested as being present with catastrophe insurance is what is sometime s termed principalagent problem that is where principal in this case prospective policyholder lacks information about the entity acting as the prin cipals agent in this case the insurance firm and the true value of the risksharing instruments sold by the agent here the potential problem is that the prospective purchaser of insurance lacks the knowledge or expertise to adequately gauge the chances of an insurance firm becoming insolvent in the face of large catastrophe and bein g incapable of making good on its promises to reimburse policyholders for their losses in the case of this type of market failure the value of insurance for the buyer is reduced and demand for insurance declines as consequence less catastrophe insura nce is sold in the market than is economically efficient14 as with moral hazard and adverse selection however some analysts are skeptical of the existence of substantial principalagent problem another possible explanation for w volume of catastrophe insurance is government action in the wake of di sasters specifically the provision of government disaster assistance at either the state or federal level such assistance is considerable for example during the 1980s nd 1990s federal disaster assistance exceeded the average annual loss borne by reinsurers on catastrophe coverage15 the assistance may have the eff ect of reducing demand for cat astrophe insurance and thus reducing its volume if large numbers of pe rsons believe that disaster assistance will be forthcoming if catastrophe strikes th eir incentive to buy insurance is reduced there is some empirical evidence that is at least consistent with the presence of market failures in 2001 study by froot found that the volume of catastrophe insurance is lower and prices are higher than would likely exist in perfectly functioning market16 here also however there is cause for skepticism the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs10 16 continued factors however may not be failures per but rather higher transactions costs 17 us government accountability office catastrophe risk us and european approaches to insure natural catastrophe and terrorism risks gao report gao05199 washington febr uary 2005 pp 30 25study pointed out that there are several other possible explanations for the low volume and high prices including the pr esence of market power on the part of insurance firms and certain features of capital markets froots analysis favored these explanations over the presence of market failures does the possibility of these market failures warrant provision of tax benefit of the type contemplated by the proposed tax deduction for reserves first we point out that the presence of market failures is not certain while evidence may suggest that the volume of catastrophe insurance is low and prices high there may be alternative explanations other than market failure for example costs inherent in capital markets may drive up prices also insurance firms may possess market power which might enable them to increase prices and restrict supply it is thus uncertain whether there are market failures that can potentially be corrected by the tax benefit if there are market failures would the tax deduction for reserves address the problem in principle if market fa ilures reduce production of commodity tax benefit could draw resources into the ac tivity reducing prices and increasing the quantity sold in the insurance industry reserves are amounts co llected as premiums and held by insurance firms rather than di stributed to stockholders in order to cover expected losses in the case of catastrophe insurance tax benefit linked to the establishment of reserves could increase the aftertax return on invested reserves and reduce the level of premiums insurers must charge to cover expected losses key to the success of such tax mechanism in in creasing supply is whet her insurance firms could be expected to pass the added retu rn on reserves to buyers or whether they would instead increase distributions to st ockholders or expand operations in other operations not related to catastrophe insurance as described above firm s deduction under the pr oposal would be dependent on the volume of premiums collected on catastropherelated insurance lines of business and would be contin gent on creation of catastrophe reserves yet even with this language whether price reduction and an increase in the availability of insurance would occur is not certain for example according to february 2005 government accountability office gao re port some analysts have expressed skepticism about whether ta xdeductibility would induce firms to increase reserves and even if the tax benefit induces firms to increase rese rves some analysts believe that the reserves would not materially enhance capacity because insurers might substitute reserves for existing reinsurance coverage the cost of which is tax deductible17 ultimately whether the proposal woul d expand catastrophe insurance depends on market conditions generally the more competitive is the market for catastrophe insurance the more likely the deduction would expand insurance on the other hand if firms have fair degree of market power the impact could be small or factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs11 such as the availability of postdisaster government aid could render demand inelastic thereby limiting the impact of price reductions in expanding insurance even if firms were willing to reduce prices an analysis of the market for catastr ophe insurance is not undertaken here nonetheless economic analysis indicates there are sufficient theoretical reasons to recommend caution with respect to the pr ovision of tax benefit for insurance reserves to reiterate theory indicates th at tax benefits such as that recommended by the reserve proposal improve efficiency only in the presence of insurance market failures and the presence of such failures is not certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33060crs12 appendix sectionbysection analysis of the policyholder

revising tax laws applicable to insu rers to permit the accu mulation of pretax dollars in separate reserve funds devoted solely to the payment of catastropherelated claims will provide incentives for property and casualty insurers to offer catastrophe insurance better protect the nations hom eowners small businesses and other insurance consumers and help ensure the financial solvency of the
