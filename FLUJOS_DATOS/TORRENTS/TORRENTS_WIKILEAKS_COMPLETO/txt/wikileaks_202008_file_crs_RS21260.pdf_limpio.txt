clingercohen act have served as the primary statutory basis for federal information tec hnology management issues among the major provisions of the clingercohen act are the establishment of departmentlevel chief information officers the elimination of the general service administrations primary role in setting policy and regulation for fede ral information technology procurementacquisition the deployment of information secu rity practices and the establishment of two pilot programs to test alternative acquisition approach sharein savings and solutionsbased contracting3 the ongoing interest in homeland security issues has brought further attention to government informa tion technology management inform ation technology has been cited not only as means to more efficiently manage an agencys internal operations but also to facilitate activities such as information sharing among departments as well as between federal state and local government4 consequently some pr ovisions were included in the homeland security act of 2002 that position information technology management practices as means to achieve homeland security goals department of homeland security in the aftermath of the terrorist att acks of september 11 2001 congress passed legislation to create department for ho meland security while pl 107296 contains many provisions the overall inte nt of the law is to provide for the consolidation and coordination of federal government programs and activities to combat terrorism the role of information technology figu res prominently in the homeland security act of 2002 however most of the references to information technology in pl 107296 are used to delineate the departments role as facilitator of standards leader in establishing priorities for research and procurement and provider of advice and information to other departments in the ar ea of homeland security applications for example section 301 includes provisions for directorate of science and technology generally these provisions ca ll for developing system for sharing key homelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21260crs3 5 see

eparedness and response directs the department to develop comprehens ive programs for developing interoperative communications technology and helping to ensure that emergency response providers acquire such technology following from the departments mission to c oordinate and lead efforts to reduce the vulnerability of the united state to terrorism these provisions are primarily focused on external information manage ment ie the departments interactions with other departments and agencies rather than explicitly describing or defining the departments management of its own info rmation technology resources however significant challenge for the department at its outset was to absorb the programs personnel and objectives then residing in other agencies to that end some provisions regarding departmentlevel internal information t echnology management were included and are discussed in relation to th clingercohen act below the clingercohen act and homeland security the clingercohen act currently serves as the primary legislative guidance for most executive departments and agencies regard ing information technology management where the homeland security act is silent it is anticipated that the relevant provisions of the clingercohen act will apply to the department of homeland security however there are some provisions in the homeland security act that explicitly outline information technology management practices for the new partment which are in contrast to those followed by most other departments these differences could be relevant to oversight efforts as congress continues to evaluate the implementation of the homeland security act chief information officer section 5125 subtitle title li of the clinger cohen act mandates the creation of cio in each

under secretary for management responsible for management and administration of the new departments information technology and communications systems it is unc lear how the overlapping responsib ilities for information technology systems between th departmentlevel cio and the under secretary are mediated in practice however both the dhs inspector general ig and the government accountability office gao ve released reports critical of dhs it management structures and practices among the problems they identified both organizations highlighted the lack of centra lized authority over it assets and personnel as significant weakness of the dhs cio position6 congress may choos to address this issue in part by approving fy2006 budget for dhs that emphasizes initiatives and management structures that centralize contro l over it resources within the office of the dhs cio7 national security exemptions subtitle national security systems of the clingercohen act states that most of the pr ovisions of the law do not apply to national security systems8 national security systems ar defined as those which involve intelligence activities cryptography command and control weapon systems or other information systems used in carrying out the defense of the na tion generally this provision in the act was included to give those agencies that handle classified and sensitive information greater flexibility in how they acquire and procure information technology the department of homeland security includes some of the activities described in subtitle to that nd the homeland security act does provide some exemptions similar to those provided in the clingerc ohen act section 3533 exempts national security systems from oversight by the di rector of omb for the development and implementation of information security standards section 3538 goes on to state that nothing in this act including any amendment made by this act shall supersede any authority of the secretary of defense the di rector of central intelligence or other agency head as authorized by law and as directed by the president with regard to the operation control or management of na tional security systems as fined by section 35323 of title 44 united states code at this time it is still unclear whether the departments evolvinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21260crs5 role will result in being
