declarations unde r the stafford act in the event of an outbreak of infectious disease are not unprecedented in 2000 the detection of west nile virus in new york and new jersey was used as the basis of an emergency declaration under the stafford act13 despite the lack of disa ster declaration during the 1957 pandemic flu pandemic would likely qualify under the broad category of any occasion or instance in the statutory definition of an emergency 14 however recent events have led to uncertainty over whether flu pandemic is eligible for major disaster assistance under the stafford act15 in 2005 various federal agencies participated in topoff 3 national level exercise that simulated various securityrelated events including biological attack causing an outbreak of pneumonic plague in the united states16 the federal emergency management agency fema the agency responsible fo r administering the stafford act was among the participants in that exercise during topoff 3 as well as during an earlier exercise fema interpreted biological disasters as ineligible for major disaster assistance because such incidents were not explic itly mentioned in the stafford act17

may of 2006 the ho meland security council issued its implementation plan for the national strategy for pandemic influenza 18 which stated that the president could declare either an emergency or major disaster with respect to an influenza pandemic potentially contradicting the earlier position adopted by fema during the topoff exercises19 as discussed later in this report it is debatable whether the homeland s ecurity councils broa d interpretation is supported by the text and legisla tive history of the stafford act most recently in march of 2007 fema issued disaster assistance policy dap that establishes the types of emergency protective measures that are eligible under the public assistance program durin g federal response to an outbreak of human influenza pandemic20 it is unclear whether this dap is departure from femas prior assertions that biological disasters were ineligible for major disaster assistance on one hand the dap states that it is appli cable to all major disasters and emergencies declared on or after the da of publication nd cites as authority the provisions of the stafford act authorizing major disaster assistance21 however the only types of assistance offered by the dap in the event of flu pandemic are emergency protective measures categ ory b provided by femas public assistance program22 notably category b assi stance may be offered during emergency declarations and is not limited to major disaster incidents23 in fact category b assistance was precisely the type of assistance authorized during the emergency declarations for west nile virus in 200024 therefore this dap is not necessarily inconsistent with the view that biological disasters are ineligible for major disaster assistance other guidance issued by fema does not mention flu pandemics but may still be re levant for example the most recent working draft ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34724crs5 25 federal emergency management agency national disaster housing

disasters25 in summary fema has historically ex cluded biological incidents from major disaster declarations under the stafford act but the current presidential policy appears to consider biological incidents or at least flu pandemics to be eligible for major disaster assistance the permissibility of both interpretations in light of the current statutory langua ge is discussed below recent legislative activity provision in s 3721 introduced in the 109th congress by senator collins of maine would have added the following to the definition of major disaster any act of domestic terrorism or international terrorism as those terms are defined in section 2331 of title 18 united states code and any outbreak of infectious disease or any chemical release in any part of the united states26 this provision would have made flu pandemics clearly eligible for major disaster assistance but it was not enacted number of other modifications to the stafford act were ultimately added by the postkatrina emergency management reform act of 200627 but changes to the definition of major disaster were made by that law analysis under the standard procedure for declaration under the stafford act the governor of an affected state submits request for either an emergency or major disaster declaration28 the federal emergency management agency then evaluates the incident and makes recommendation to the president with whom lies the ultimate discretion to make declaration29 the stafford act precludes any judicial review of that decision30 therefore even though it is emphatically the province

interpretation of statute by the executive br anch this should not be taken to mean that fema or the president could be sued in state or federal court for failing to designate flu pandemic as major disaster this analysis is solely included to provide context with which policymakers and other stakeholders may view this issueduty of the judicial departme nt to say what the law is31 requesting governor or other affected party that disagrees with the executives interpretation of what constitutes major disaster is unlikely to be successful seeking judicial remedy denials of declaration requests may be appealed and resubmitted to the president but again there is possibility of judicial review32 nevertheless questions ma arise among policymakers and other stakeholders as to which of the dueling interpretations of the stafford act are legally permissible that is whether the stafford act requires the conclusion that fl u pandemics are either eligible or ineligible for major disaster assistance the validity of an executive branch construction of statute can be eval uated using the twopr ong test laid out by the supreme court in chevron v natural resources defense council 33 first if the text and legislative history of the stat ute demonstrate that congress has spoken directly on the issue then that statutory nguage or history must control however under the second prong if congress s not directly ddressed the precise question at issue the agencys interpretation will stand so long as it is reasonable one34 both positions regarding the eligibility of flu pandemics for major disaster assistance are evaluated below using this twoprong test but regardless of what result the application of supreme court juri sprudence is likely to have in this case it is important to note that congress may come to its own conclusions as to whether particular type of incident should or should not be considered major disaster and may amend the statutory definition if it deems it appropriate to do so ambiguity of congressional intent the first prong of the chevron test asks whether cong ress has directly spoken on the issue if congress has spoken th the analysis ends and the agencys interpretation must comport with that cong ressional intent in this case the inquiry is whether the statutory text and legislativ history of the stafford act demonstrate that congress addressed whether the defin ition of major disaster includes flu pandemic statutory text the statutory definition of major disaster confines its scope to natural catastrophes or regardless of cause any fire flood or explosion flu pandemic is not fire flood or explos ion under the ordinary meaning of thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34724crs7 35 id any hurricane tornado storm high wa ter winddriven

s third new international dictionary 15067 1976three words therefore flu pandemic cannot qualify as majo r disaster unless it can be considered natural catastrophe as that term is defined for purposes of the stafford act the text of the stafford act provi des concrete examples of natural catastrophes35 but it does not appear to provide an exhaustive list of all qualifying events36 based on plain reading of the phr ase it is not clear whether flu pandemic would be considered natural catastrophe ne ither the stafford act nor any other provision of the us code pr ovides legal definition of catastrophe dictionary definitions of catastrophe range from momentous tragic usually sudden event marked by effects ranging from extreme misfortune to utter overthrow or ruin37 to sudden disaster widespr ead very fatal or signal38 either of which would seem to be applicable in the case of flu pandemic dditionally many media reports colloquially refer to pandemic as catastrophe39 but even though pandemic likely has the potential to cause sufficient harm to meet the ordinary understanding of catastrophe the event would still need to be considered natural in order to be eligible for major disaster assistance the stafford act does not elaborate on the meaning of natural but various dictionaries define it as formed by na ture not subject to human intervention not artificial40 and occurring in conformity with the ordinary course of nature41 as has been recently observed with the h5n1 strain of avian influenza it is possible for virulent flu strains to develop without hum an intervention and once infection occurs the virus can continue to propagate and sp read absent human intervention by virtue of the innate biological processes present in living persons in response one could argue that the widespread dispersal of flu pandemic is likely dependent upon human vectors recent attention garnered by actual and potential biological terrorism attacks raises the question whether an entirely manmade disease epidemic could be rightly described as natural catastrophe initially one shoul d note that it is not necessary to conceptually view randomly occurring flu pandemics in the same category ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34724crs8 42 see supra note 35 43 see fema landslide and debris flow mudslide available at httpwwwfemagovhazardlandslide noting that landslides may be activated by steepening of slopes caused by erosion or human modification 44 see crs report 97589 statutory interpretation gene ral principles and recent trends by yule kim at n49 and accompanying text in this case the general phrase any natural catastrophe actually precedes the list of specific examples but the same interpretive principle applies 45 see eg an act granting additional quarantine powers and imposing additional duties upon the marinehospital service ch 114 27 stat 449 1893 46 pl 93288 88 stat 143 at 102 emphasi s added under the disaster relief act emergencies and major disasters were primarily di stinguished by the severity of the incidentintentional biological attacks however even if one were to treat all biological incidents as the same other exampl of known natural catastrophes are not necessarily disqualified because they may be partially caused by human actions for example landslides are statutorily identified as natural catastrophes42 even though human development may preci pitate their occurrence43 textual arguments for excluding flu pandemic from major disaster assistance may also be made one c ould conclude from the statut ory definition that flu pandemic is not natural in the same way that tornado or hurricane is natural ejusdem generis is canon of construction statin g that when general word or phrase follows list of specifics the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only items of the same type as those listed44 applying this canon of construction one interpretation is that the list following the phrase natural catastrophe limits its scope to geologic or climatic events that have the potential to cause extensive physical property damage furthermore there is evidence that the threat of infectious outbreaks was not alien to congress specifically in light of its response to cholera and yellow feve r during the latter half of the 19th century45 consequently the omission of infectious diseases from the list of explicit natural catastrophes bolsters the argument that outbr eaks of infectious disease were seen by congress as distinct from natural catastrophes legislative history insofar as the text of the major disaster definition is susceptible to more than one interpre tation it may be helpful to examine the legislative history to further interpolate congresss intent in drafting the provision the current definitions of emergencies nd major disasters were enacted in 1988 with passage of the stafford act prior to that the definitions for both major disasters and emergencies declarations were contained in the disaster relief act of 1974 disaster relief act and had applied to any hurricane tornado storm flood high water winddriven water tidal wave tsunami earthquake volcanic erupti on

as reported in senateand major disaster declarations found that presidential authority to extend disaster assistance has been exercised almost exclusively in cases where damage was caused by or was closely related to some act of nature47 however it appears likely that the amended definitions in the stafford act which limited major disasters to natural catastrophes and created new definition for emergenc ies were partly enacted in response to the presidential use of the di saster relief act aut hority to deal with certain manmade incidents48 for example in 1980 large number of people fled cuba and arrived in southern florida president carter dir ected fema to provide temporary housing and shelter for these refugees apparently under the authority of the disaster relief act49 also in 1980 fema assisted with the mporary relocation of families affected by the toxic waste deposits in the love canal neighborhood of niagara falls new york50 similarly in 1983 fema assisted with the relocation of residents of times beach missouri after the area had been contaminated with dioxin51 these incidents generated controversy in congre ss which expressed concern that in some instances aid has been extended by the president in situations which resulted primarily if not entirely from human activity rather than natural hazards broadening the scope of the disaster relief act to cover both natural and nonnatural catastrophes has strained the capacity of programs designed to respond only to natural catastrophes52 following these declarations an amendment to the definition of both emergencies and major disa sters under the disaster re lief act was proposed limiting such declarations to physi cal or natural catastrophes53 although this amendment was not enacted the debate regarding the amendment suggested that chemical spillhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34724crs10 54 srept 96891 at 3 1980 55 chevron 467 us at 866would have been considered physi cal catastrophe but not natural one54 further attempts to amend the definitions of major disasters nd emergencies were introduced several times during the 1980s nd permitted only natural catastrophes the definition was ultimately ccessfully amended by the 100th congress as part of the passage of the stafford act in 1988 an examination of this legislative hist ory reaffirms the conclusion that the 100th congresss principal intent in limiting major disaster assistance to natural incidents was to deny major disaster assistance to incidents that were caused by human activity furthermore the legislative history provides at least two clear examples of presidential declarations for which congre ss likely found natural causes lacking the mass arrival of political refugees and instances of chemical contamination nevertheless it is likely inaccurate to say that by excluding these two types of incidents from major disaster assistance c ongress clearly addressed the issue of flu pandemics or other biological in cidents under the stafford act reasonableness of executive branch interpretations the preceding analysis of the text and legislative history indicates that congress did not directly address whether flu pa ndemic is natural catastrophe for purposes of the stafford act under the framework laid out by the supreme court in chevron the remaining question is whether particular executive branch interpretation is reasonable choice within gap left open by congress55 in this case interpreting flu pandemic as either natural or nonnatural catastrophe is arguably reasonable on the one hand the manner in which flu pandemic is likely to propaga does not require human intervention making flu pandemics eligible for major disasters makes the maximum amount of resources available to avert the loss of life human suffering and loss of income that is likely to occur in the event of flu pandemic some types of assistance that are only available in major disaster declaration ma be particularly usef ul in flu pandemic for instance flu pandemic is likely to result in significantly reduced workforce as victims fall ill and others stay home to take care of them the provision of unemployment assistance and emergency public transportation under the stafford act both may be an appropriate response but are only available under major disaster declaration on the other hand pandemic is substan tially different than the climatic and geologic natural catastrophes listed by the stafford act and many types of major disaster provisions such as assistance to repair buildings or clear debris are not likely to be necessary during flu pand emic restricting flu pandemics to only emergency assistance arguably limits the burden on federal disa ster relief funds additionally other federal responses may be more appropriate to deal with pandemic such as the authority of the hhs secretary to declare public healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34724crs11 56 for more detailed discussion of authority and funding for public health emergencies see crs report rl33579 the public health and medical response to disasters federal authority and funding by sarah lister at 47 1618emergency56 or impromptu legislation to provide assistance with respect to particular incident finally it should be noted that the reas onableness of either interpretation is being evaluated under current law were congress to conclude that flu pandemics categorically should or should not be eligib for major disaster assistance it may amend the statute to explicitly say so in that case the clearly expressed intent of congress would render any evaluation of an executive branch interpretation unnecessary and congresss intent would control
