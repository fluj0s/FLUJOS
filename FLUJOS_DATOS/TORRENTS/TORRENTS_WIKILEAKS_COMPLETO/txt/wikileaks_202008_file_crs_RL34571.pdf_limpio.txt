divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34571medical device user fees and user fee acts summary the food and drug administration fda is the agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices an establishment may not market device in the united states w ithout fdas prior approval or clearance in 2002 congress first granted fda the au thority to collect user fees from medical device establishments the authority was granted to help reduce the time required for the agency to review and make decisions about marketing applications lengthy review times harmed establishments which waited to market devices and patients who waited to use them user fee law provides revenue stream for the agency and also requires it to set performance goals for rapid application review the authority to collect medical device user fees has been authorized in fiveyear increments and will expire ne xt on october 1 2012 in 2002 it was first established in the medical device user fee and modernization act mdufma pl 107250 before reauthorization it was amended by the medi cal device technical corrections act pl 108214 and the dical device user f ee stabilization act of 2005 pl 10943 it has been reauthorized once in the medical device user fee amendments of 2007 mdufa 2007 enacted as title ii of the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 hr 3580 pl 11085 since medical device user fees were first collected in fy2003 they have comprised an increasing proportion of fdas device budget in fy2003 148 million of user fees comprised 68 of the budget in fy2007 the year of the most recent reauthorization 352 million of user fees comprised 132 of the budget medical device user fees have raised number of issues these have prompted congress to determine the following whic h activities should require fees how user fees can be kept from supplanting federa l funding or being diverted from device review through triggers which activities the agency should fund with user fees and how to qualify as small business s mall businesses pay reduced fee amounts in addition to addressing the above issues medical vice user fee legislation has served secondary purpose as moving vehicle that legislators could use to address range of issues related to medical devices for example mdufa 2007 included provisions about the extent to wh ich fda can delegate activities to third parties inspections and th review of premarket notif ications establishment registration requirements timing and ectronic submission unique device identification system reporting requirements for devices linked to serious injuries or deaths and requirements that fda and gao c onduct certain studies mdufma included provisions about re processed single use vices and other topics

fees and user fee acts medical device user fees consist of c ongressionally authorized private money which is paid by medical device establishm ents to the food and drug administration fda fda is an agency within the department of health and human services hhs user fee funds are one of the two revenue streams available to fda for carrying out its mission with respect to medical devices to ensure devices safety and effectiveness the second revenue stream is direct appropriations from congress medical device establishments to whom most regulations and fees apply are often device manufacturers but can also be domestic companies and importers who prepare andor propagate devices blishments must obtain fda approval or clearance before marketing their medical devices in the united states they must continue to abide by fdas requirements in cluding the payment of certain user fees while their devices are on the market the authority to collect medical device user fees has been authorized in fiveyear increments the same is true for the two other fda user fee programs for prescription drugs and animal drugs1 the agencys authority to collect medical device user fees is set to expire on october 1 2012 medical device user fees were first authorized in 2002 the medical device user fee and modernization act mdufma pl 107250 created the authorization it inserted two new medical device user fee sections in the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca 737738 21 usc chapter 9 mdufma was amended twice by smaller laws before its user fee authorities were reauthorized these two laws were the medical device technical corrections act mdtca pl 108214 and the medical device user fee stabilization act of 2005 mdufsa pl 10943 in 2007 mdufmas user fee authorities we re reauthorized ju st before their expiration the amendments came in the form of the medical device user fee amendments of 2007 mdufa 2007 enacted as title ii of the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007

johnson donna v porter susan thaul and erin d williamsfdaaa was the most significant and sw eeping piece of fda legislation since the food and drug administration mode rnization act fdama pl 105115 fdaaa addressed topics ranging from food safety to postmarket surveillance of drugs to pediatric medical devices to the formation of nonprofit organization to assist fda two key factors converged to enable the passage of the broa d legislation the first was that significant fda revenue streams would have been lost if its medical device and prescription drug user fees d not been reauthorized before their expiration at the end of fy2007 failure to reauthorize the legislation would have cost the agency more than 280 million in user fees over five year s reauthorization legislation was characterized as must pass providing moving vehicle for congress to address othe r concerns about fda the second key factor leading to f daaa was the emergence of landscape of criticisms about the agencys response to safety concerns raised about range of products the agency regulates publicized examples included dverse events related to products ranging from prescription drugs such as vioxx to medical devices such as cardiac stents to imported items such as heparin and pet foods to human foods such as spinach congress was able to address many of these threats to public safety in fdaaa debates about which nonuser fee topics were to be addr essed in fdaaa and how they should be addressed slowed th process of reauthorization of fdas authority to collect user fees those lays sparked concern that fda would have to lay off some 2000 employees due to the resulting funding shortfall or at least issue legally required notices to the employ ees 60 days before such lay offs would have to occur3 however neither layoffs nor notices were ultimately necessary fdaaa was signed into law on september 27 2007 four days before the user fee collection authorities would have expired numerous topics of debate related to user fees have emerged over time while many of these are related to the smaller details of the user fee program three raise overarching policy issues for lawmakers one concern is that the agencys reliance on funds collected from the establishments that it regulates could possibly create conflict of interest second is that reliance on fees could lead appropriators to give the agency less federal fundi ng than they otherwise would4 third is that the requirement that user fees only be expended on activities related to medical device approval drains resources needed for postma rket activities consideration of each of these issues will help to inform readers as they consider the details of the medical device user fee program scribed in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34571crs3 5 ffdca 201h 21 usc 321h 6 industry profile standard and poors industry survey healthcare pharmaceuticals continuedthe remainder of this re port contains the

key documents the third section descri bes the way in which medical device user fees currently function and provides relevant background for the various user fee provisions the final section of the repor t discusses the various nonuser fee topics that have been introduced or addre ssed in medical device user fee acts background fda and medical device regulation in order to understand the function and impact of medi cal device user fees and related policy issues ba sic understanding of the way that fda reviews and regulates devices is useful this section presents the definiti on of medical device an overview of the device industry an in troduction to the medical device components at fda and survey of the agencys userfee relevant requirements for medical device establishments both before nd after products come to market medical devices and the device industry the first step to understanding fdas re gulation of medical devices is to see how the agency defines the term according to statute medical device is an instrument apparatus implement ma chine contrivance implant in vitro reagent or other similar or related article including any component part or accessory which is 1 recognized in th official national formulary or the united states pharmacopeia or any supplement to them 2 intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditi ons or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals or 3 intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes5 according to this definition medical device can be anything from tongue depressor to home pregnancy test to wheelchair to pacemaker types of medical devices vary widely as do their respective vels of complexity and risk therefore device manufacturing requirements vary significantly as well in part due to the diversity of medi cal devices themselves medical device establishments tend to have certain characteristics these characteristics can be highlighted by comparing the device industr with the pharmaceutical industry the device industry is more fragmented and smaller than the pharmaceutical industry with estimated earnings of 274 billion in 2007 compared with the drug industrys estimated 712 billion6 it is also dominated by smaller companies

of user fees particularly with regard to the way that fee amounts impact individual companies and the effect that fees have on the development and review of new medical devices fda device regulatory structure brief structural overview of fda provides background for understanding the way that fda regulates medical devices and for understanding the activities that require user fees fda has five regulato ry centers each focused on particular type of product the center within fda primarily responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices is the ce nter for devices and radiological health cdrh one other center the center for biologics evaluation and research cber regulates some devices specifically those associated with blood collection and processing procedures as well as with cellular therapies eg stem cell treatments jurisdiction of the cente rs medical device revi ew is governed by the fda intercenter agreement betw een cber and cdrh october 31 19917 approval or clearan ce of medical devices different types of applications to f da trigger different user fees these application types are highlighted in the following description of the way in which fda classifies devices and the mechanisms establishments can use to apply to market their devices cdrh categorizes medical devices according to their risk into one of three classes class i ii and iii see table 1 the risk device poses and the regulatory controls required increases from class i to class iii the device classification regulation defi nes the regulatory requireme nts for general device type in each class most class i devices are exempt from premarket notification and require only registration with fda before marketing most class ii devices require premarket notification 510k8 before

activities in addition to receiving fda clearance or approval prior to marketing device establishments must meet certain requirements once thei r products are on the market many notable examples of this do not have an associated fee for example fda inspects establishments where medical devices that are marketed in the united states are manufactured inspections assess compliance with fdas quality system requirements for ensuring good manufacturing practices and other applicable specifications10 fda also collects information about adverse events related to medical devices and may reque st or require recalls of medical devices in certain circumstances while fee is associated with these functions they are important to consumer protection because they reflect the agencys efforts to help ensure that devices on the market meet required safety and effectiveness sta ndards in addition they help to inform userfee related policy discussions the effect that user fees have on the agencys ability to conduct pos tmarket activities s been debated two postmarket activities required of medical device establishments do have user fees associated with them one is that establishments must register annually with fda establishment registration the other is that establishments of certain class iii devices must file periodic re ports required by pma approval order periodic reporting medical device user fee acts congress first authorized fda to collect user fees from medical device manufacturers with the passage of mduf ma in 2002 this was 20 years after parallel authority had been granted for pres cription drugs as had been the case for drugs the impetus behind authorizing user fees for medical devices was reducing the amount of time it took for fda to make d ecisions about manufact urers applications to market their products the agency attr ibuted the long review times to shortage of funds to employ enough staff the time taken in review ffected patients who waited for new products and manufacturers which waited to market the products manufacturers thus agreed to pay user f ees and congress granted fda the authority to collect them so that fda could hire more staff and decrease its review times this section provides historical overvie w of the laws congre ss has passed related to medical device user fees mduf ma mdtca mdufsa and mdufa 2007 it also

s11549012002mdufma in the years prior to mdufmas 2002 enactment fdas resources for its devices and radiological health program had increased at lower rate than its costs11 as stated in the house report to hr 3580 mdufma the medical device industry is growing rapidly the complexity of medical device technology is increasing at an qually rapid pace unfortunately fdas device review program lacks the resource s to keep up with the rapidly growing industry and changing technology be cause prompt approval and clearance of safe and effective medical devices is critical to improving public health it is the sense of the committee that adequate funding for the program is essential12 in addition to issues raised by dical device review funding capabilities at fda prior to mdufma concerns had also emerged regarding the reprocessing and reuse of medical devices that fda had cleared or approved as single use devices suds reprocessing means cleaning and sterilizing device and verifying that it functions properly concerns about s uds funding and the agencys capacity to inspect device establishments as frequently as required by law paved the way for congressional action in 2002 in preparation for the enactment of m dufma fda officials met with industry leaders to agree upon mutually acceptabl fee types amounts exceptions and performance goals13 the agreement specified that in return for the additional resources provided by medical device us er fees fda was expected to meet performance goals defined in novemb er 14 2002 letter from the hhs secretary to the chairmen and ranking

medical devices technical corrections act mdtca november 2004 at http wwwfdagov cdrhmdufmamdtcasummaryhtmlmdufma was enacted in order to provide fda with the resources necessary to better review medical devices to enact needed regulatory reforms so that medical device manufacturers can bring their safe and effective devices to the american people at an earlier time and to ensure that reprocessed medical devices are as safe and effective as original devices15 mdufma amended the ffdca to enact three significant provisions for medical devices 1 it established user fees for premarket review s of devices 2 it allowed establishment inspections to be conducted by accredited persons third pa rties and 3 it instituted new regulatory requirements for reprocessed singleuse devices mdufma enabled fda to collect over 133 million from medical device companies during the first five ears of the program fy2003fy2007 mdtca prior to mdufa 2007 mdufma was amended by two laws the first of these was the medical devi ce technical corrections act mdtca pl 108214 it addressed three areas of mdufma16 first it removed certain barriers to the thirdparty inspection progra m second it amended an electronic labeling provision to extend the circumstances in which ectronic labeling could be used third it delayed the implementation of provision that required device to prominently and conspicuously bear the na of its manufacturer mdufsa the second law that amended mdufma pr ior to its reauthorization was the medical device user fee stabilization act of 2005 mdufsa pl 10943 it contained five primary meas ures first it lowered trigger amounts of direct appropriations required for the agency to be able to collect user fees triggers are discussed in more detail be low second it changed the method of setting user fee amounts eliminating the inflation work load compensating and final year adjustments of revenues used for setting fees third it allowed the hhs secretary to use unobligated carryover balances from f ees collected in prev ious fiscal years fourth it made it easier for companies to qualify as small businesses and pay reduced user fees fifth it deemed as misbranded and thus subject to ffdca penalties any reprocessed sud that did not identif the manufacturer but allowed such information to be provided by detachable label intended to be affixed to the

scussed many of the above factors they negotiated an agreement that they submitted to congress fda agreement17 the agreement contained legislative proposals as well as arguments to support those proposals pursuant to mdufma 105 on april 30 2007 fda held public meeting about the fda agreement attendees expressed general satisfaction with its terms congress incorporated most of the recommendations into mdufa 2007 mdufa 2007 congress addressed many i ssues in mdufa 2007 subtitle reauthorized and amended fdas authority to collect medical device related user fees subtitle b amended certain aspects of medical device regulation the primary issue addressed in mdufa 2007 was the reauthorization of fdas authority to collect user fees from medical device manufacturers fdas authority to collect these fees would have expired on october 1 2007 if congress had not acted mdufa 2007 extended the authority through october 1 2012 the pending expiration of this authority was one of the primary drivers of mdufa 2007 and fdaaa mdufa addressed several ot her issues as well one was to generate an increased and more stable user fee revenue stream for the agency with the addition of two new types of fees mdufma d only authorized fda to collect various application fees which were payable upon submissi on of an application of fda according to fda there were fluctuations in the number of applications submitted from year to year and fee revenues re peatedly fell short of expectations18 in order to address this issue mdufa 2007 added establishment fees paid annually by each device establishment registered with fda and product fees paid annually for each class iii device for which periodic reporting was required pursuant to the pma mdufa 2007 also added two new applica tion fees and lowered the existing application fee amounts the law was drafte d to increase the tota l revenue generated by user fees offsetting the lowered app lication fee amounts with revenue from the new fees another issue addressed by mdufa 2007 was that domestic and foreign companies had expressed frustration with the difficulty in qualifying for small business user fee discounts this led cong ress to enact amendments designed to ease that processkey mdufa 2007 provisions device user fees authorized through fy 2012 new fee types added fee amounts reduced qualification as small business made

previous heading the law raises the base fee the pma fee annually by 85 per year from fy2008 to fy2012 see table 5 fda asserts that this annual increase will sure that fee revenues contribute their

both suggest that fda may expend user fees on premarket approval activities and not on postmarket surveillance one provision was created by mdufma it states that fees shall only be collected and available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of device applications 39 the law specifies the elements of the process for the review of device applications 40 see table 6 they focus solely on activities involved in premarket approval the one partial exception to this rule is the inclusion of the evaluation of postmarket studies that are required as condition of approval mdufa 2007 did not amend the above provision howeve r 201c did include the statement in its findings that fees would be dedicated toward expediting the process for the review of device applications and for assuring the safety and effectiveness of devices 41 the law specifies that fees are to be used to support fda in achieving the performance goals identified in the commitment letter while it is conceivable that assuring the safety and ffectiveness of devices could be interpreted to encompass postmarket surveillance the commitment letter lists only premarket

for certain types of activities such as pma reviews but allow for some flexibility that may be prudent given that different types of pmas and other applications may vary in complexity therefore performance goals generally state that for certain percentage of applications fda will complete particular type of activity within given time period see table 7 in addition to the specific timerelated goals presented in table 7 the commitment letter also articulates several other goals four of these are related directly to the review process one states that fda will at minimum maintain its current performance for processes for which quantitative goals were not identified such as ides and 30day notices two others state that fda will continue to incorporate an interactive review process for informal communication between fda and sponsors to facilitate accurate and timely applica tion reviews and will make every effort to schedule bot h informal and formal meetings before and during the

jeopardized by poor manufacturing practices55 mdufa 2007 228 amended the accr edited thirdparty inspection requirements as described further below according to the fda agreement the amendments are aimed at increasing the quantity of useful information fda has about the compliance status of medical vices marketed in the united states and permitting fda to focus its resources on in specting those firms and products posing the greatest risk to public health fda is required by statute to inspect certain domestic establishments where medical devices are manufactured at least once every two years56 according to 2007 gao report fda has not been meeting this requirement57 instead five or six years sometimes pass between fda inspections at any one establishment fda accredited the first thirdpart on march 11 2004 as of may 31 2008 23 organizations had applied to conduct independent thirdpa rty inspections of establishments of which 16 had recei ved fda accreditation since that time 43 inspections of domestic establishments and one inspection of foreign establishment have been conducted by accred ited organizations jointly with fda officials as part of training that fda requires

on by an accredited organization include the opportunity to reduce the number of inspections conducted to meet fda and other countries requirements and to c ontrol the scheduling of the inspection potential disincentives include bearing th cost for the inspection and uncertainty about the potential consequences of making commitment to having an inspection to assess compliance with f da requirements in the near future59 mdufa 2007 changed the thirdparty accr edited person inspection program in three major ways first it streamlined administrative burdens associated with qualifying for the program for example for clearance to use third party the law now requires that firms provide fda with 30 days prior notice of their intent to use third party listed on fdas website previously firm was required to petition fda for such clearance second it made amendments designed to expand participati on in the program for example the law now permits firms to use third parties for an unlimited number of consecutive inspections without seek ing waiver with certain exceptions previously the thirdparty program restri cted qualified manufactur ers of class ii and class iii medical devices to two consecutive thirdparty inspections after which fda was required to conduct the next inspec tion unless the manufact urer petitioned and received waiver from fda the third change has to do with fdas process for setting its inspection priorities to do this the agency uses riskbased approach to inform the risk based approach mdufa 2007 requires fda to accept certain reports that are voluntarily submitted by establishments establishments may submit reports by third parties that assess conformance with an appropriate international quality systems standard such as those set by the international sta ndards organization60 previously fda did not accept such submissions reports mdufa 2007 requires two reports by gao and one by fda to be delivered to congress by september 27 2008 one report is to present the results of gao study on the appropriate use of 510k clearance as part of the device classification process to determine whether new device is as safe and effective ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34571crs27 classified device 225 the second is to present the results of gao study on the number of nosocomial infections attributable to new nd reused medical devices and the causes of such infections 229 mdufa 2007 defines nosocomial infection as an infection that is acquired wh ile an individual is patient at hospital and was neither present nor incubating in the patient prior to receiving services in the hospital the third report requires fda to conduct consumer sting and determine whether labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices provide sufficient information to consumers regarding the ri sk of damage to eyes and skin 230 nonuser fee topics only in mdufma the following issues were addresse d in mdufma but not in mdufa 2007 the review of

history of use of fees is presented in the main text with the explanation of the provision not in this appendix because the evolution of the provisions is releva nt to their interpretation triggers the direct congressional appropriations trigger is lower than the one initially set in 2002 mdufma had required an appr opriation equal to or greater than 205720000 multiplied by an inflation adjustment factor current law requires 1 less than this amount in 2005 legislati on was required to enable the continuation of the mdufma user fee program becau congressional appr opriations had been lower than required for fy2003 and fy 2004 mdufsa the 2005 legislation lowered the mdufma triggers re troactively for fy2003 and fy2004 and prospectively for fy 2005fy 2007 to the level required by current law mdufa 2007 perpetuated the mdufsa trigger includi ng the adjustment factor indefinitely the second trigger for the hhs secretary was created by mdufma 102 in 2002 and has not been amended user fees and the device review budget mdufma 102 first authorized the collection of fees in fy2003 mdufa 2007 212h1 authorized an increas for each year between fy2007 and fy2012 the base fee amounts

erin d williams and susan thaul and crs report rl33986 fdas authority to ensure that drugs prescribed to children are safe and effective by susan thaul513gs to help establish more consiste nt and predictable user fee revenue stream for fda mdufa 2007 also changed the percentage of the base fee assigned to various types of activities but the ba sic method of setting the fees is the same as it was under mdufma the one exception to this is the way that the premarket notification fee for 510k submissions is set under m dufma the premarket notification fee had been calculated annually so that the total of all such fees in aggregate comprised target amount mdufa 2007 provided that th fees are to be set like the others as percentage of the base fee mdufa 2007 lowered the base fee by 96600 in fy2008 from its fy2007 level however as noted previously fda projects that it will still have more fee revenue in fy2008 than fy2007 because the addition of revenue from the new types of fees should more than compensate for the money lost in fee reductions the net effect should be an increase in fee revenue for fda feecollection offset the authority to consider excess funds in aggregate over several years was added by mdufa 2007 212h2 under mdufma fda was required to reduce fees in any year for which collec tions in the preceding year exceeded the amount authorized fee exceptions reductions refunds the following is history of the vari ous device user fee exceptions reductions and refunds humanitarian use devices huds mdufma 102 created the hud user fee exemption mdufa 2007 did not amend the hud provisions however another fdaaa title the pediatric medical device safety and improvement act of 2007 title iii 303 allowed that certain pediat ric device manufacturers may also be able submit an hud application62 the hud fee waiver is not significant for manufacturers of pediatric dical devices this is because under mdufma these manufacturers had already qualif ied for user fee exemptions as described in the next paragraph the hud fee waiver does not appl to the establishment registration fee created by mdufa 2007 212a5 devices intended for pediatric use mdufma 102 created the pediatric use exemption it was not amended by mdufa 2007 but the exemption does not apply to the new laws nnual establishment fee 212a5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34571crs31 applications from federal or state government entities t h i s exemption was created by mdufma 102 unlike the other exemptions mdufa 2007 212a5 applied this one to establishment registration fees further manufacturing mdufma 102 created this exemption mdufa 2007 212a5 does not apply it to the newly created establishment registration fee premarket notification by third parties mdufma 102 created this exemption mdufa 2007 does not change the exemption but sub title b 221 extends thirdparty review authority from 2007 to 2012 small businesses mdufma 102 authorized fee reductions for small businesses mdufa 2007 212d chan ged the details of the small business rules established under mdufma in two ways first it lowered the fee percentage that small businesses must pay fo r example as stat ed above mdufa 2007 requires small business to pay 50 of the standard 510k fee and 25 of the standard pma fee whereas mdufma had required small bus inesses to pay 80 and 38 respectively see table 5 second mdufa 2007 made it easier for tities to qualify as small businesses with two amendments the first rem oved mdufmas requirement that fda consider the assets of part ners and parent firms in th small business qualification calculation the second broadened the types of acceptable gross receipt documentation beyond irs filin gs making it possible for foreign establishments to qualify as small businesses modular pma refunds this refund provision was added by mdufa 2007 2124 performance goals mdufma 102 and mduf 2007 212g each incorporated the contents of commitment letter into law by reference according to the fda agreement the mdufa 2007 goals are fewer and more rigo rous than those in mdufma they build on the progress made in mdufma in making these proposals fda considered efficiencies gained and expected by means of additional scientific regulatory and leadership training additional staff including those with expertise demanded by increasingly complex device re views expanded use of outside experts and information technology improvements that allow fda to better track and manage the device review process like mdufa 2007 mdufma had created performance goals which were articulat ed in the 2002 commitment letter see table 7 according to the fda agreement fda was on track to meet nearly all of the mdufma performance goals which expired on october 1 2007 performance goalsetting process performance goalsetting process was c onducted in preparation for mdufma second one required by mdufma 105 was created inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34571crs32 preparation for mdufa 2007 mdufa 2007 213 sets forth requirements for the third such process the three processes and their requirements were similar except that mdufa 2007 added the requirements that the recommendations be revised upon consideration of public comments and that the recommendations be transmitted to congress not later than january 15 2012 mdufa 2007 also wrote all of the relevant consulta tion requirements into the ffdca quarterly performance reports these reports were required according to the co mmitment letters issues pursuant to both mdufma and mdufa 2007 each tter specified unique set of factors to be included in the reports postmarket safety mdufma authorized additional appropriations for postmarket surveillance in the amounts of 3 million for fy2003 6 million for fy2004 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2005 through fy2007 however these sums were not appropriated mdufma also required the hhs secretary to conduct study of the postmarket review impact of the medical device userfee program mdufa 2007 changed both the amounts and wording of th purpose of the authorization for post market safety appropriations annual reports to congress annual reports were initially required by mdufma from the time that fda was first granted the authority to collect medical device user fees through fy2007 however mdufa 2007 changed the law by requiring that the reports be made available to the public by writing the report requirements into the ffdca and by expanding substantive requireme nts of the performance report
