wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34073 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl34073 productivity and national standards of living brian w cashell government and finance division july 5 2007 abstract there is little question that rising productivity is the single most important factor behind rising living standards but the proportion of nations population that is working is also important the larger that proportion is the more goods and services there are to go around the share of the population that is working is only partly subject to the inﬂuence of policymakers the size of the labor force is largely function of demographic factors but the share of that labor force that is employed can vary with shortterm economic conditions as well as policies that aﬀect the cost of laborhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34073g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

standard of living and it is generally understood that the means to that end is rising productivity productivity relates the quantity of goods and services produced and the income generated as result of that production to the amount of labor eg hours worked or number of workers required to produce it the most commonly used measure of the living standard of nation is simply the ratio of that income to the total population without regard to how the income is actually distributed if relatively small share of nations population works there will be large difference between the level of productivity and that measure of the national standard of living productivity varies over time and it varies across countries as well the link between productivity and living standards is not direct one therefore countries with high level of productivity may not necessarily have the highest standard of living gross domestic product gdp per capita can rise in the absence of an increase in productivity if 1 employees increase the number of hours they work hours per employee 2 the share of the labor force that is employed rises ie the unemployment rate drops or 3 the share of the population that is in the labor force rises presuming that the share of any new jobseekers who get jobs is at least as large as the share of those already in the labor force who have jobs large labor contribution can offset low productivity to raise nations standard of living korea for example has the secondlowest gdp per hour but because its workers work more hours than in any other country shown here its per capita gdp is not as close to the bottom of the ranking the united states has the second highest per capita gdp after norway the united states is also second to norway in terms of productivity france and germany have relatively high levels of productivity but because they both have relatively low employment and high unemployment rates and in frances case relatively small share of the population in the labor force they fall to the middle with respect to per capita gdp there is little question that rising productivity is the single most important factor behind rising living standards but the proportion of nations population that is working is also important the larger that proportion is the more goods and services there are to go around the share of the population that is working is only partly subject to the influence of policymakers the size of the labor force is largely function of demographic fact ors but the share of that labor force that is employed can vary with shortterm economic conditions

standard measure of the production of goods and services for nation is gross domestic product gdp gdp measures the total value of goods and services produced within nations borders productivity is measure of how much work is required to produce it the most basic unit of labor is the hour thus productivity can be measured as gdp divided by the total number of hours worked productivity may also be measured as the average contribution of each employee to total production or simply gdp divided by employment the broadest measure of the living standard of nation is gdp divided by the total population per capita gdp says nothing about how those national resources are distributed 1 but the proceeds from productivity gains are shared and do not accrue solely to workers and the owners of capital much of the sharing is simply done within individual households but may also come about through policies that redistribute income or by public sector investments that benefit everyone per capita gdp is probably the best single statistical measure of national living standards and is especially useful for comparisons as it is available for large number of countries to show how per capita gdp and productivity are related per capita gdp can be expressed as the product of ratios reflecting the relationship be tween the overall population and the amount of work done per capita gdp obviously depends on the level of gdp and the population but the relationship can be decomposed in way that may shed some further light the following equation shows the decomposition of gdpthe equation shows that per capita gdp can be expressed as the product of four ratios gdp di vided by labor hours which is labor productivity labor hours per employee the share of the labor force that is employed and the size of labor force relative to the overall population 2 1 it is also limited in that for the most part it only counts those items for which there is value defined in market and does not take into account some activities that have ec onomic value leisure time for example 2 gdp is measure or the dollar value of production in given year and so hours in this case refers to the number of continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34073g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g159g146g157g162g561g138g151 g141g561g16g138g157g146g152g151 g138g149g561g21g157 g138g151g141g138g155g141g156g561g152

forc population hours employees labor force popula tion the equation shows what factors contribute to per capita gdp first per capita gdp depends in part on the level of productivity gdp divided by hours3 an increase in productivity other things being equal will raise the average standard of living that much is widely understood as the equation shows however per capita gdp ma change for reasons entirely unrelated to productivity from purely arithmetical standpoint it woul d appear that neither hours the number of employees nor the size of the labor force could have any effect on per capita gdp suppose for example the number of hours worked increased while the other variables remained unchanged in that case the hourstoemployees ratio would rise but it would be offset by decline in the gdptohours ratio leaving per capita gdp unchanged but while the equation allows for an accounting of the factors that separate productivity from per capita gdp it does not make clear that the variables themselves are interdependent for example it is unlikely that an increase in hours worked would have effect on gdp only if the increase in hours worked yielded additional production of goods and services would the increase in hours not raise per capita gdp similarly an increase in the number of employees would raise the employmenttolabor force ratio while causing the hourstoemployees ratio to fall it is unlikely however that employment would rise without corresponding increase in the number of hours worked finally an increase in the labor force by itself other things being equal would have direct effect on per capita gdp because it would lead to both an increase in the labor forcetopopulation ratio and decline the ratio of employment to the labor force but that would only hold true if all of any increase in the labor force remained unemployed gdp per capita can rise in the absence of an increase in productivity if 1 employees increase the number of hours they work hours per employee 2 the share of the labor force that is employed rises ie the unemployment rate drops or 3 the share of the population that is in the labor force rises presuming that the share of any new jobseekers who get jobs is at least as large as the share of those already in the labor force who have jobs this breakdown also illustrates weakness in using gdp per capita as measure of living standards leisure has value as does unpaid work done in the home but those values are not included in the measure of gdp thus an increase in gdp brought about by an increase in work may overstate the true increase in economic wellbeing since it requires the sacrifice of leisure what is the relationship between gdp and the labor that produces it economic theory provides some basis for answering that question labor is generally assumed to have the characteristic that in the short run each additional employee contributes smaller amount of production than did the continued hours worked in the course of year 3 for more on productivity see crs report rl32456 productivity will the faster growth rate continue by brian w cashell

other words among those seeking work the ones who are relatively more productive tend to be hired first this is referred to as diminishing marginal product of labor4 if that is true then with reference to the equation above increases in employment may generate proportional increases in hours but they might not lead to proportional increases in gdp in other words each new worker tends to bring down the average productivity of labor that is not to say that increases in employment over time will tend to reduce average labor productivity rather it says that other things being equal higher ratio of employment to the labor force is likely to mean lower ratio of gdp to hours or lower average level of labor productivity over longer periods of time growth in the stock of physical capital more educated labor force and technological progress will all contribute to gains in productivity but comparing two otherwise identical economies at given point in time the one with larger share of its labor force employed will likely have lower average productivity it is less clear whether there is similar relationship between hours worked and the level of productivity individual worker productivity is generally presumed to be determined by education training experience and the quantity of capital available further most workers contribute roughly the same number of hours so that at least in the short run an increase in hours is unlikely to happen without an increase in employment unless the productivity of individuals is significantly affected by the number of hours they work an increase in hours might be expected to result in roughly proportionate increase in gdp the share of the population that is in the labor force is not likely to affect productivity directly but other things being equal it is an important factor in the level of per capita gdp given two otherwise equivalent economies the one with higher percentage of its population in the labor force will also have higher level of gdp unle ss the additional members of the labor force are unemployed higher unemployment rate or they contribute nothing to the production of goods and services that would mean higher per capita gdp as well figure 1 shows how per capita real gdp and real gdp per hour in the united states have grown since 1948 the two series are shown as indexes set equal to 100 in 1948 from 1948 through the mid1970s the two measures grew at about the same rate since the mid1970s they have diverged given the equation presented above the reason for that divergence must be an increase in either the number of hours worked per employee decline in the unemployment rate or an increase in the proportion of the population in the labor force 4 this could also happen even if all workers were equally productive with fixed stock of capital each additional hire would tend to reduce the amount of capital available to each worker

pr oductivity source depart ment of comme rce bureau of economic analysis hours worked per employee cannot account for th divergence because they have been declining steadily since 1948 between 1973 and 2006 the index of average weekly hours published by bls fell by 75 neither can the share of the labor force employed be the reason for the divergence the civilian unemployment rate in 1973 was 49 compared with 46 in 2006 hardly enough of change to have made difference that leaves the share of the population in the labor force to examine the bureau of labor statistics bls bases its measure of the labor force on the noninstitutional population aged 16 and older from that population the bls measure of the labor force is the sum of those who are employed and those who are actively looking for work given that the ratio of the labor force to the population was little changed between 1948 and 1975 in 1948 it was 59 and in 1975 it was 61 by 2006 however it had risen to 66 two developments account for that increase first was substantial increase in the labor force participation rate of women for men there was slight decline from 78 to 73 between 1975 and 2006 but for women the share of the population in the labor force rose from 46 to 60 the second factor that caused the labor force to grow more rapidly than the population was the aging of the babyboom generation the babyboom generation is generally considered to include those who were born between 1946 and 1964 this cohort began entering the labor force in 1962 and was all in by 1980 most economists agree that since world war ii the us economy has experienced several shifts in the longrun rate of productivity growth the particular reasons for all of those shifts are not entirely clear but the data show that begi nning in about 1973 productivity growth slowed significantly from its rate of growth up to that point then in 1995 it appears to have accelerated table 1 presents growth rates over those intervals for productivity as well as for the other factors that enter the calculation of per capita gdp httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34073g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g159g146g157g162g561g138g151

016 sources depart ment of comm erce bureau of economic analysi s departmen t of labor bu reau of labor statistics these figures illustrate some interesting facts first it is clear that growth in per capita gdp fell after 1973 in part that was due to the decline in productivity growth the growth rate of real gdp per hour worked productivity fell by almost full percentage point moreover growth in the number of hours worked per employee also fell by almost 04 percentage point after 1973 but the declines in productivity and hours worked were not completely reflected in per capita real gdp the growth rate of per capita real gdp only fell by about 07 percentage point the reason was big jump in the share of the total population in the labor force growth in that ratio jumped nearly 07 percentage point offsetting some of the decline in growth or hours and productivity the data also show that after 1995 productivity growth picked up again although not quite to the pre1973 rate there were also increases in the rates of growth of both hours worked per employee and the share of the population in the labor force the increase in the growth rate of per capita gdp was only about half of the increase in the growth rate of productivity however the reason is that the growth rate of the share of the population in the labor force fell by nearly 06 percentage point the reason for that drop is that the share of the population in the labor force stabilized after all the baby boomers were old enough to be counted as part of the labor force and were longer factor pushing up the ratio the biggest reason for the discrepancy between per capita gdp growth and productivity growth has been changes in the share of the population in the labor force absent those changes the data suggest that changes in productivity growth would have been fully reflected in the growth rate of per capita gdp but just as the entry of the babyboom generation into the labor market caused per capita gdp to grow faster than productivity for time as the baby boomers age and exit the labor market there is likely to be an extended period where per capita gdp grows more slowly than productivity as happened in the late 1950s and early 1960s actuaries at the social security administration project that labor force growth will fall below population growth for much of the period between 2010 and 2035 the difference between the two is about 03 percentage point the 2007 social security trustees intermediate projection also assumes productivity growth rate of 17 suggesting that they expect the per capita gdp growth rate to be about 14 5 5 see the trustees 2007 report at httpwwwssagovoacttrtr07 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34073g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g159g146g157g162g561g138g151

possible to assess how the united states compares with other industrialized countries per capita gdp is the single most widely used measure to make international comparisons of living standards but comparing gdp across countries is complicated because it is calculated in different currencies exchange rates resulting from trading in curr ency markets are not suitable for converting gdps from various countries into common unit of account those exchange rates are influenced by crosscountry differences in prices and they are also subject to the influence of changes in financial markets exchange rates are greatly affected by international flows of financial capital they may rise or fall because of speculation in currency or because of changes in interest rates for example rise in interest rates in one country will tend to draw in foreign capital foreign investors however must first buy that countrys currency in order to buy financial assets denominated in that countrys currency that drives up the value of that countrys currency without there having been any change in the price levels of goods and services either in that country or abroad because of those complications economists have devised way of estimating an exchange rate that is based only on the differences in the prices of goods and services across countries this is referred to as the purchasing power parity currency conversion rate ppp for example if liter of soda costs 200 in the united states and 230 euros in france then the ppp conversion ratio for that particular item is 232 or 115 ppp ratios for entire economies are based on weighted averages reflecting all of the goods and services that add up to gdp the price an american would have to pay for that soda would reflect not only the difference in price but also the relative values of the two currencies the ppp allows crosscountry comparisons of the prices paid by residents of country for goods and services in that country estimates of gdp can thus be converted to common unit of account or currency to allow comparisons of economic well being in different countries table 2 presents data for 27 countries for which the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd has published comparable figures 6 the amounts have all been converted to us dollars using oecd estimates of purchasing power parity exchange rates the first column shows per capita gdp the second column shows gdp per employee which is measure of the productivity of the working population the third column shows gdp per hour worked for each measure the countrys ranking is also given the united states has the second highest per capita gdp after norway two measures of productivity are shown norway has the highest production per worker and the united states is second with respect to production per hour worked however the united states is sixth after norway belgium the netherlands ireland and france the figures show considerable range across countries mexico has per capita gdp that is just 225 of norways and gdp per hour that is 205 of norways 6 these data are taken from the oecd factbook 2007

how the share of nations population that contributes labor may influence its measured standard of living high per capita gdp may be the result of high productivity or it can be the result of large proportion of nations population working or working high number of hours8 large labor contribution can offset low productivity to raise nations standard of living korea for example has the secondlowest gdp per hour but because its workers work more hours than in any other country shown here its per capita gdp is not as close to the bottom of the ranking iceland is another example with respect to productivity it places in the bottom half of countries shown here but because it employs relatively large proportion of its population it ranks much higher with respect to per capita gdp france and germany in contrast have relatively high levels of productivity as measured by gdp per hour but because they both have relatively low employment and high unemployment rates and in frances case relatively small share of the population in the labor force they fall to the middle with respect to per capita gdp it may be in the case of countries like germany and france that there is small tradeoff between the national average level of productivity and the proportion of the labor force that is employed in those countries where labor costs are relatively high perhaps because of relatively greater regulation of labor markets some who might otherwise be hired are not because they are not productive enough to cover the costs of hiring them t able 3 labor contribution to living

income may be one of the most widely cited measures of national standards of living but it is limited in that it says nothing about how income is distributed nonetheless there is little question that rising productivity is the single most important factor behind rising living standards but the proportion of nations population that is working is also important the larger that proportion is the more goods and services there are to go around the share of the population that is working is only partly subject to the influence of policymakers the size of the labor force is largely function of demographic factors but the share of that labor force that is employed can vary with shortterm economic conditions as well as policies that affect the cost of labor it may also be the case that one nations average level of productivity is lower than anothers because it employs larger share of its less skilled and less productive workers but even if those workers are relatively less productive the goods and services they produce represent an addition to the nations living standard higher productivity is not the only way to raise living standards high levels of labor force participation and employment are also important g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 brian w cashell specialist in macroeconomic policy
