reasons 14 b d 1 c summary pakistani officials do not appear to have coalesced on strategy or position for the midjanuary resumption of conference on disarmament cd discussions on the fissile material cutoff treaty fmct ministry of foreign affairs mfa interlocutors continue to stress the need for consensus language to bring pakistan on board cd work program that includes fmct negotiations while strategic plans division spd officials urge cautious approach that leaves plenty of time for deliberations in the absence of formal decision continued delay along procedural lines is the most likely default approach overt us pressure may solidify this tactic according to nongovernmental contact who follows disarmament issues the gop strongly desires the resumption of uspakistan talks on nonproliferation security and strategic stability before the next cd session in order to discuss perspectives on the fmct and come to an understanding on each sides positions in order to take advantage of internal gop deliberations post recommends highlevel interventions with pakistans military leadership to help build support for proceeding with fmct negotiations end summary 2 c over the last two weeks poloff canvassed gop officials in the disarmament division at the ministry of foreign affairs director general dr irfan yusuf shami and director kamran akhtar the arms control and disarmament directorate at the strategic plans division director khalid banuri and deputy director adil sultan as well as one nongovernmental contact maria sultan of the south asia strategic stability institute sassi who follows nonproliferation issues for views on pakistans likely approach to fissile material cutoff treaty discussions at the conference on disarmament when the 2010 session convenes in january the discussions with pakistani interlocutors suggest that pakistans fmct position remains somewhat malleable and that gop officials have not yet coalesced on specific position for the next cd session they also underscored the importance of bilateral discussions particularly with highlevel pakistan military officials if the usg is to secure pakistani support for beginning cd negotiations strategic considerations 3 c according to pakistani counterparts pakistans fmct position is shaped by four strategic considerations which point to degrading of the deterrent value of pakistans nuclear weapons and thus make an fmct difficult for pakistan first pakistani officials perceive the usindia civil nuclear cooperation initiative as having unshackled indias nuclear weapons program prior to the initiative they said india faced significant uranium supply constraint that forced it to choose literally between nuclear weapons or nuclear power now however india is able to secure foreignsupplied uranium for its civil nuclear power reactors leaving it free to devote greater share of its domesticallysourced uranium to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons this perceived growth in nuclear weapons production capability blunts any numerical advantage in nuclear weapons pakistan may have 4 c second the increase in hightechnology defense and space trade between india and the united states russia and others has improved the quality of indias nuclear systems according to pakistani thinking while pakistan continues to face significant trade barriers and is subject to export denial regimes pakistani officials believe india is longer held back by these constraints and is using market access to improve its nuclear delivery vehicles 5 c third indias growing conventional military superiority coupled with its cold start military doctrine of fast mobilization and rapid strike capability poses new level of threat according to pakistani counterparts indian plans and capabilities have forced pakistan to rely more on nuclear weapons and less on conventional military capability to balance indian force maria sultan of sassi suggested that pakistani military planners now focus on the possibility of twofront war and believe that pakistan needs to transform its arsenal to smaller tactical weapons that could be used on the battlefield against indian conventional capabilities the result of this trend is the need for greater stocks of fissile material to feed pakistans nuclear weapons requirement 6 c finally pakistani counterparts point to indias interest and investment in missile defense even if it will take many years to field capable system they believe this indicates that india is not interested in balance of power but intends to degrade the value of pakistans nuclear deterrent 7 c taken together these strategic considerations point pakistan in the direction of larger nuclear force that requires greater amount of fissile material pakistani officials argue by this logic agreeing to production cutoff now does not meet pakistans interests it is unclear whether gop officials believe pakistan is ahead of india in terms of nuclear capability but they point to the combination of indias capabilities and intentions as well as its stockpile of fissile material even if spent nuclear reactor fuel is not as useful in nuclear weapons to suggest that there is little advantage for pakistan in trying to lock india into an fmct now since both countries arsenals appear set to grow maria sultan suggested that this is not the consensus view however and that at least some part of the pakistani military establishment believes it better to agree to an fmct now since india has much greater longterm fissile material growth potential than pakistan in either case the argument that the fmct is global disarmament imperative seems to have currency in islamabad pakistans position as described by pakistani counterparts is shaped exclusively by its own regional concerns fmct policy circle 8 c while gop officials would not comment directly on internal fmct policy deliberations over the summer maria sultan argued that pakistans surprising reversal at the cd can be chalked up to two factors cd ambassador too eager to join consensus and lethargic policy process driven more by personalities than institutions by her account pakistans initial support of the cd work program in the spring of 2009 was decision made by ambassador zamir akram without the benefit of full policy review in islamabad akram she suggested is part of the old guard of mfa ideologues and longtime supporter of the shannon mandate which identified parameters for international consensus on an fmct however pakistans position to support fmct negotiations based on the shannon mandate was outdated she said the advent of the usindia civil nuclear initiative in particular had changed the terms for islamabad but its cd strategy had never been updated military officials in islamabad intervened she stated and it was left to mfa to extricate pakistan from dilemma of its own creation which is why pakistan sought to tie up the cd on procedural grounds 9 c according to sultan there are several camps within the gop policy circle on fmct mfa officials she said tend toward continuing to support negotiation of an fmct in addition to foreign secretary bashir and irfan shami other officials such as mfa spokesman abdul basit and ambassador to beijing masood khan are akram protgs and will continue to be consulted on negotiating strategy even though they are not directly tied to the disarmament division she suggested while important mfa officials probably are not the most influential voices on fmct she argued the views of highlevel military officials in particular gen kayani and spd director general khalid kidwai carry more weight within this circle kayani she indicated is aware of the issue but is not prepared to make decision kidwai on the other hand favors delaying negotiations as long as possible presumably to leave time and space for the investments made in expanding pakistans fissile material production capacity to bear fruit spd arms control director khalid banuri indicated this preference for delay telling poloff that the current momentum on fmct should not be used to rush the process and there needs to be plenty of time for deliberations 10 c sultan argued however that kidwai does not monopolize the debate on this issue and that other critical inputs come from the strategic forces command the director general for military operations dgmo the minister of defense and some national defense university experts in particular she stated the dgmo maj gen javed iqbal takes view on the fmct 180 degrees apart from kidwais believing that it is better to bind india to current fissile material levels than wait for the full effect of the usindia nuclear initiative which will allow india to produce even greater amounts of plutonium 11 c when asked how she rated overall government support for these two positions sultan assessed 70 favor further delay while 30 support negotiation however she cautioned overt us pressure on pakistan will firmly tip the balance toward delay to bring pakistan on board she said the us needs to focus on addressing pakistans strategic concerns and the slow degradation of deterrence in particular she argued for opening the hightechnology defense market for pakistan on early warning capabilities such as the awacs platform next steps and posts recommendations 12 c looking ahead to january mfa disarmament director general irfan shami expressed strong desire to resume bilateral talks on nonproliferation security and strategic stability before the cd session in order to discuss perspectives on the fmct and come to an understanding on each others positions he would not elaborate on what that understanding might constitute but stated pakistan needs time to explain its position while it is unlikely such discussions will turn pakistans policy around they should have the effect of forcing more internal discussions on the issue which provides some opportunity for usg influence 13 c it seems clear that beyond mfa pakistans military leadership is crucial audience while direct us pressure is unlikely to convince them to support fmct negotiations and may even hurt efforts to move forward milmil discussions on pakistans strategic concerns particularly with coas general kayani and dgmo major general javed iqbal could help build the militarys confidence that pakistans interests will be taken into account as part of these interventions it may help to provide pakistani military leaders with an analytical case for why an fmct makes more sense for pakistan now than in the future in terms of the strength of the its deterrence visavis india patterson
