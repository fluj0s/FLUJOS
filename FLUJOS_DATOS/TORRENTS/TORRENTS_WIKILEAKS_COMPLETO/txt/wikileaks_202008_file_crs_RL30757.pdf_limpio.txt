divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757chinas emergence as major economic power implications for us interests summary chinas likely development as major economic power over the next quarter century holds important implications for us interests assuming continuation of current trends by 2025 china is likely to become medium income economy with an estimated 35 trillion to 58 trillion gross domestic product and 15 billion population an optimistic view of china in 2025 is for it to be well integrated into the world economy with global standards for trade investments finance labor and the enviro nment and with booming investment and trading relationship with the united states conducted in peaceful world environment pessimistic view is that in 2025 china with huge and powerful economy and globally competitive industries would be presided over by politically authoritarian regime with modern military that views the united states as the enemy and with government that poses formidable threat to us interests the actual china in 2025 will probably contain elements of both these extremes chinese economic prosperity depends on its internal micro and macroeconomic polici and reforms it also depends on access to markets foreign capital and technology of the united states and other countries of the world in recent years chinas economic ties with the us in effect have resulted in an annual gain of some 60 billion for china from its bilateral trade surplus and direct foreign investment any major conflict between the two countries could jeopardize chinas economic modernizat ion and undermine its internal stability as well as its international status rising chinese demand for resources particularly food and energy as incomes rise and popu lation grows and becomes more urbanized may become source of conflict china could seek to assert its claims to disputed islands in the east and south china sea for their resource and military value the us could be drawn into these territorial disputes the status of taiwan also could become source of conflict as beijing has not ruled out the use of force in dealing with taiwan with rapidly rising incomes china could devote more resources to its military but in view of growing domestic needs military spending is likely to continue to take second place to economic expansion and modernization even if the military share of gdp remains constant however chinas military spending could rise from about 3035 billion in 1998 to projected 135 billion to 225 billion by 2025 the clinton administration as did the bush administration has pursued basic policy of engagement with china along with restrictions on exports of military and certain hightechnology exports in response to chinese activities deemed threatening to us security the engagement policy is based on view that economic reforms and growth will make china less of threat to us interests those opposed to engagement seek stiffer and less accommodating us position toward china this is based on view that china with greater economic and military power woul d increasingly threaten us interests both sides in the policy debate would have the united states apply firm pressures and maintain strong military presence as counterweight to rising chinese power in asiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757contents findings and policy 1 chinas economic growth 7 sources of rapid

in its financial system but the peoples republic of china largely avoided sharp drop in its rate of economic expansion the return of economic growth in asia while still fragile renews the prospect that over the long term china might catch up with the united states and other industrial countries not only in economics but in the strategic and military spheres during the almost quarter century since the us normalization of diplomatic relations with china and the beginning of economic reforms under the leadership of deng xioaping the prc has achieved impressive although not unprecedented rates of economic growth as the 21st century begins china is about to join the world trade organization wto and is bidding to become solidly integrated into the global economic system what will china be like if it becomes major power or even an economic superpower this report examines chinas current growth rate in terms of where it is at the beginning of the 21st century the sources of that growth and certain constraints and negative effects of its rapid development it also provides projections of chinas gross domestic product to the year 2025 and examines certain international implications of chinas emergence as major economic power such as future competition for natural resources and certain sovereignty and territorial issues chinas economic prospects over the first quarter of the 21st century provide backdrop to several congressional concerns these include chinas accession to the wto adherence to wto standards once it has joined the organization the burgeoning uschina merchandise trade deficit 68 billion in 1999 chinas relationship with taiwan internal economic and other reforms national security implications of modernizing chinese military and extensive productive capacity

indicates that longterm economic growth paths typically follow an scurve with period of catching up in which growth rates arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757crs2 1 international monetary fund international financial statistics november 2000high followed by slowing down and eventua l settling into average growth rates similar to those of industrialized economies since china is still in its catchingup phase most projections of chinese economic growth over the next quarter century see fairly high rate at between 5 and 7 per year chinas actual growth rate will depend on the continuation of some current favorable circumstances and overcoming significant constraints these include further economic and financial reforms and opening of the chinese market continuing inflows of foreign capital and technology letdown in the high rates of savings and investment sustained banking or financial crisis protracted domestic political turmoil and the resolution of certain environmental constraints if china lives up to the commitments it has made to join the world trade organization and if it takes the measures to achieve the goal of the asia pacific economic cooperation forum to establish free trade and investment in the asia pacific by the year 2020 its economic reforms and the opening of its economy should continue apace unless world economic sanctions are triggered by some sort of security crisis such as an attack on taiwan china is unlikely to become recid ivistic in its integration into the world economy as market forces become more entrenched in the chinese economy however the potential efficiency gains and growth from further reforms and rationalization of the economy will likely diminish china has relied heavily on foreign resou rces to finance its imports of technology equipment and raw materials notable characteristic of chinas economic growt h in the 1990s has been its ability to amass the foreign exchange needed to fund its development it has been able to finance investments beyond the savings its economy has generated domestically and to grow rapidly without serious balanceofpayments constraint chinas holdings of foreign exchange reserves rose from 224 billion in 1993 to 1577 billion in 1999 and had risen to about 162 billion by mid20001 the major sources of these foreign financial resources have been hong kong the united states and japan these resources have taken the form of trade surpluses foreign direct investments bank borro wing and foreign aid from 1996 to 1999 chinas average gain in financial resources from its trade and financial relations with the united states amounted to 614 billion per year as compared with 263 per year from japan the bulk of this 614 billion came from the average 56 billion us trade deficit with china over the period this trade deficit completely overshadows foreign direct investments about 35 billion per year from both the us and japan loans about 2 billion per year from each country and foreign aid 1 billion per year from japan chinas 614 billion per year in financial resources gained from public and private sector interaction with the united states was equivalent to 133 of chinas average annual inflow of total foreign direct investments or about 25 of chinas annual rate of fixed capital formation the ability of china to continue to run bilateral trade surpluses in excess of 50 billion with the united states as well as 20 billion surpluses with japan over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757crs3 next 25 years is problematic with the additional 180 million workers expected to be added to its labor force over this period of time however china is likely to remain favored manufacturing base for exports by multinational corporations in any case future chinese economic prosperity will require continued access to export markets in the united states japan the european union and other industrialized nations china also obtains much of its foreign capital and technology from those same countries since these nations have adopted coordinated economic sanctions under certain circumstances chinas rising dependence on overseas markets has created domestic chinese stake in stable international political and economic relations in terms of domestic economic and political stability chinas high rates of savings and investment are likely to continue unless its banking sector fails beijing is fully aware of the problem of bad loans and technical insolvency in many banks mostly because of loans extended to moneylosing stateowned enterprises as part of the governments economic plans it has taken some initial steps to address the problem but has experienced some backsliding in the face of political resistance from the stateowned enterprises and workers as for political stability while beijing now seems to be overreacting to all potential opposition it is betting that it can stay in power by delivering more economic growth and becoming more representative of the population still rising problems of unemployment and disparities in income combin ed with nascent democracy movements could unleash forces in chinese society that beijing might not be able to contain aside from protracted civil unrest however leadership struggle or political crisis is not likely to have longterm negative impact on growth if china remains on its current growth path it should become major economic power by 2025 or earlier if its economy grows by 5 per year in real terms its gross domestic product gdp would rise from the current 1 trillion to around 35 trillion in 2025 for details and projections based on purchasing power parity see the section of this report on future trends of growth at higher 7 growth rate it would expand to around 58 trillion moderately large when compared with the current gdp of 92 trillion for the us or 44 trillion for japan the 35 trillion gdp would roughly be the size of the us economy in the mid1970s while the 58 trillion gdp would be about as large as the united states in the mid1980s in short china would be major world economic power but still considerably smaller than the projected 15 trillion gdp for the united states in 2025 assuming 2 growth rate the large size of the chinese economy in 2025 would come primarily from its huge population of project ed 15 billion people on per capita basis gdp in china is likely to rise from the current 790 to an estimated 2800 to 4600 depending on its growth rate considering that per capita gdp in the united states or in japan currently is aroun d 34000 chinas average standard of living still would be relatively low consumers would be just entering the stage of the personal automobile larger and more liberalized chinese economy that is more dependent on foreign trade and investment is likely to have greater stake in stable global economy until now foreign companies operating in china have been hostage to beijings policies as more chinese companies establish subsidiaries andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757crs4 partnerships overseas they likewise will become subject to local governments and economic conditions their profitability will hinge on policies of their respective host countries and economic conditions in those countries as well as in the world larger more international chinese economy also should provide incentives for beijing to accelerate its adoption of internation standards in several areas not only in traderelated standards as will be required by wto membership but in accounting banking and other aspects of an industrialized economy an optimistic view of china in 2025 is for it to be well integrated into the world economy with global standards for trade investments finance labor and the environment and with booming investment and trading relationship with the united states and other nations conducted in peaceful world environment pessimistic view is that this huge and powerfu l economy with industries that compete directly with those from the united states would be like the former soviet union during the cold war presided over by politically authoritarian and repressive regime armed with modern military that views the united states as the enemy and with an international agenda that includes thwarting us actions in all policy arenas middleground projection could include aspects of each of the two extremes with rapidly rising incomes china could devote more resources to its military even though currently beijing is placing higher priority on economic expansion and modernization the chinese military therefore likely will have difficulty increasing the share of gdp that it now takes current estimates of chinese defense spending vary widely at the lower end is chinas officially reported military spending of 126 billion in 1998 western analysts believe the actual figure to be several times higher than this official figure because number of significant items are funded elsewhere taking this official figure as base by 2025 chinas military spending would rise to 45 billion at 5 growth rate or 69 billion at 7 growth consensus of government and academic experts suggests more realistic estimate for military spending of 30 to 35 billion per year in 1996 that is close to an estimate by the international institute for strategic studies iiss of 367 billion in 1998 using the iiss figure chinas total military expenditures in 2025 would rise to betwee n 137 billion and 228 billion depending on the growth rate of gdp the 228 billion is roughly 75 of the level of defense spending that existed in the united states in 1999 sufficiently large to be major military power although by 2025 us defense expenditures also would likely have grown considerably roughly speaking therefore chinas military expenditures in 2025 official plus hidden are expected to range between 135 billion and 225 billion for china two conceivable sources of conflict with us interests lie in chinese claims to sovereignty the first is the question of taiwan for china reunification with taiwan is domestic issue that is intertwined with chinese nationalism beijing continues to assert that the taiwan issue is matter of chinas internal affairs and china is under obligation to commit itself to rule out the use of forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757crs5 2 peoples republic of china the taiwan affairs office and the information office of the state council white paperthe onechina principle and the taiwan issue february 21 2000 on internet at httpwwwchinaembassyorgpaperstaiwan00htmin resolving it2 under this policy the military option remains open regardless of the economic and international consequences the second possible conflict stems from the combination of overlapping claims to certain islands in the east and south china sea and rising chinese demand for food grains energy and other mineral resources economic growth places china in situation faced by all economies as country develops it requires more resources both real and financial to operate these resource needs can be supplied either domestically or through international trade and investments on one hand chinas rising demand for food is likely to make it increasingly dependent on the united states and other food exporters such as canada and australia who might be sympathetic to us attempts to use trade as weapon this could make china more susceptible to economic sanctions and may establish political constituencies within china that oppose military or political actions that might jeopardize their sources of supply on the other hand chinas rising dependency on imported petroleum and raw materials could induce beijing to seek to enforce its territorial claims over disputed islands in the pacific particularly the spratly paracels xisha and daioyutai senkaku islands china would do so however at the risk of conflict with neighboring countries or even the united states aside from these potentially large conflicts other issues such as nuclear and missile technology proliferation human rights religious freedom democracy the environment and differences on policies pursued by international organizations are likely to continue to be irritants on both sides for us business and labor interests larger and more economically powerful china raises the possibility that it will become an even more formidable competitor in international markets it could become second japan an economy that began exporting toys and textiles and then moved progressively into steel machine tools automobiles computers and precision machinery question for the united states is what econ omic policies to pursue in order to achieve outcomes that bring maximum benefits to us interests in the economic sphere us policy options include 1 continuing present policies of engagement opening markets bringing china into the global market system and attempting to ensure compliance with trade agreements this includes providing economic incentives and disincentives aimed at assisting various chinese groups to build institu tions and values that are more in accord with those espoused by the united states or 2 attempting to curtail chinas economic power through sanctions export controls trade isolation or capital controls the clinton administration as did the bush administration basically has pursued policy of engagement with china along with restrictions on exports of military and certain hightechnology exports or engagement in activities deemedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757crs6 3 for discussion of us policy toward china see crs issue brief ib98018 chinaus relations by kerry b dumbaugh and crs issue brief ib91121 chinaus trade issues by wayne m morrisonthreatening to us security3 this policy of engagement of course goes beyond the economic policies considered in this report it seeks to maintain and enhance relations with china in the various policy realms in economic terms it attempts to bring china more into the world economy by opening it to us exporters and investors and assisting it in its transition from centrally planned to more market based economic system albeit with chinese characteristics this includes providing permanent norm trade relations status for chinese exports as well as bringing the chinese system into accord with world norms including membership in and adherence to the rules of the world trade organization the premise underlying this policy is that china is current ly undergoing tremendous change it is revamping its economic system opening its markets and seeking to join the mainstream of the global economy although the thrust of this change in china currently is mainly economic and less political or military in this state of flux chinas increasing engagement with the world globalization and the freer flow of informati on may induce the chinese people to insist on more democratic institutions and espouse values less at odds with those of the united states the approach also assumes that the more china is brought into the international system the more it will have to adhere to international norms and the less likely beijing will jeopardize gains by disruptive domestic or intern ational behavior those favoring engagement also fear that belligerent policies toward china will only generate enmity unnecessarily treat china as an enemy and it will become one from the viewpoint of global economic efficiency policies that move china more into the global market economy in which resources are allocated according to their most productive needs are more likely to maximize world wellbeing this is an economic argument favoring current policies of engagement us exporters and multinational corporations also seek the stability and openness that engagement tends to bring in order to maximize their market opportunities and protect their investments in china they also seek to deal with the chinese market on the same basis as businesses from competitor companies particularly those from asia and europe whose home nations are seeking engagement with china those opposed to the current policy of engagement see china whose security outlook and political direction are basically unchanged from the period of the korean war except that it now has nuclear weapons missiles and russianmade naval vessels according to this view as the chinese economy grows its military buildup will continue this heavily armed china increasingly could threaten peace and stability in asia and under certain circumstances even challenge vital us interests this view reflects the fear that chinas current focus on economic development and raising the standard of living of its people is temporary once it becomes an economic power beijing may rever t to its prereform ways and even while it is developing its leaders may maintain repressive author itarian and nondemocratic policies the assumption of this view is that engagement only accelerates the time that china will have the resources to openly challenge us interests othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757crs7 source data from standard poors data resources

human rights and environmental interests under an extreme form of these views opposing engagement us policy would be aimed at containing china and promoting internal change while dealing strongly with beijings disruptive foreign policy actions also under this approach the united states would provide economic or diplomatic concessions without quidproquo response on the part of china and the us would enlist allied countries in concerted actions to achieve desired behavior by beijing this approach may call for sanctions and other punitive measures both sides in the policy debate would have the united states apply firm pressures and maintain strong military presence as counterweig ht to rising chinese power in asia chinas economic growth this section examines the size of the chinese economy how it has grown and compares it with other countries chinas economy has grown from gross domestic product gdp in 1980 of 1758 billion as measured in 1997 us dollars not adjusted for price differences

china in the world economy institute of internati onal economics washington dc 1994 differences in estimates arise because of the arbitrariness in selecting domestic prices of nontraded goods also

the economy particularly from the united states and japan economic reform on the microeconomic side most of chinas modernization has occurred since 1978 when beijing began to implement economic reforms in essence these reforms have been to convert the economy from one that essentially was closed based on public ownership of means of production centrally controlled and dependent on governm ent rather than market allocation of resources into an economy still with elements of socialism but more based on individual initiative and marketbased resource allocation chinas economic reforms have brought privatization market based pricing and changes in management and corporate governance these reforms were initially intro duced in agriculture and smallscale industries both in rural and urban areas and subsequently have been applied in largescale enterprises includ ing some of the stateowned enterprises soes the economic incentives provided by these reforms accelerated growth and promoted economic efficiency in both agricultural and industrial production concurrently by opening the country to foreign trade and liberalizing the rules concerning foreign capital and the creation of the special economic zones sezs china facilitated the entry of foreign capital investments and technology based on these investments it has been able to increase exports of laborintensive manufactured goods tailored to western technology tastes and fashions high rates of domestic savings and investment two of the major features of the chinese economic development have been high rate of domestic

domestic savings have averaged 37 of gdp the world bank estimates suggest 33346 at capitaloutput ratio7 of 31 ratio that is typical for economies at chinas stage of economic development the current

helped build chinas foreign currency reserves international trade has played the most important role china has been following the economic development model of other east asian nations in which industrialization is financed partly through trade countries such as south korea have relied on access to foreign markets particularly those in the united states to generate the foreign exchange needed to finance purchases of equipment and technology the normalization of relations between the united states and china along with chinese economic liberalization led to rapid expansion of chinas trade during the two decades following normalization chinese exports rose from mere 137 billion in 1979 to 1949 billion in 1999 while imports increased from 157 billion to 1658 billion over the same period sizable proportion of these exports originated from manufacturing plants that were linked to foreign companies in essence chinese exports have displaced those from newly industrialized economies south korea taiwan hong kong and singapore in laborintensive industries such as apparel footwear and household products chinese exports also have been both competing with and complementary

growth path the chinese economy takes will greatly affect the rest of the world second chinas economic power is the most important underlying factor in chinas ability to develop military power of course projections of chinese gross domestic product or per capita income over the long term is by its nature risky and somewhat conjectural much depends on chinese domestic as well as international circumstances that are yet to develo p on the domestic side growth will depend on some success in implementing economic reforms having tolerable level of social unrest and achieving reasonable level of entrepreneurial and bureaucratic efficiency on the international side growth will require access to world markets for chinese exports continued access to foreign capital and technology and regional peace the experience of other nations indicates that growth paths typically follow an scurve with period of catching up in which growth rates are high followed by slowing down and eventual settling into average growth rates similar to those of industrialized economies with increasing economic maturity growth tends to slow because new technology has to be generated domestically rather than borrowed and the same rate of investment brings about less of an increase in production the capitaloutput ratio or amount of capital needed per unit of production tends to increase also with economic growth shortages of various resources and inputs necessary for production particularly labor lead to rise in their prices and increases in manufacturing costs as shown in figure 5 the experience of variety of industrialized economies over the last 30 years of the 1900s indica tes they experienced relatively high economic growth followed by significant drop off in rates of expansion by the 1970s

both potentialities and problems on one hand the larger economic base implies that china can allocate more resources toward meeting the social needs of its citizenry but also toward strengthening its military and pursuing the strategic interests of the country on the other hand this megaeconomy will require resources organ ization and markets to keep functioning constraints and costs of rapid economic growth while rapid economic growth in china has generated higher income levels and considerable modernization it also has brought significant costs and has revealed possible constraints on future growth these costs and constraints include rising disparities of income unemployment social discontent environmental degradation and health problems rising disparities of income rising disparities in income levels both among individuals and regions are divisive and can be detrimental to political stability chinese experience during past political upheavals such as the cultural revolution has been that such instability can severely retard modernization and development in any fast growing economy some in society catch the wave of new opportunities and prosperity while others are left behind even though the rising tide of an expanding economy can lift the average income earner entrepreneurs capitalists business executives and landowners may become rich while workers in factories using obsolete technology or who do not have the skills to compete in globalized market may become unemployed benefits of growth eventually may trickle down to the lower strata of society but this often takes considerable time in china income has become less equally distributed as the economy has grown in the distribution of personal income for example standard measure of income disparities rose by 50 between 1988 and 199424 this indicates that over this sixyear period considerably larger share of income was going to the higher than lower income earners the same is true for

high because it did not calculate chinas increased expor ts in industries such as textiles and clothing that are likely to occur as workers move from agriculture to industry chinas problem of unemployment and under employment also is being exacerbated as result of much needed reform of chinas stateowned enterprises soes35 about half of the soes are unprofitable and of those most are behind

increasingly difficult44 on the other side of the coin if china fails to maintain adequate growth political instability could also rise that in turn could further depress economic growth international implications chinas emergence as major economic power carries several implications for us economic and security interests in this section we examine five of particular interest to the united states 1 increasing competition for resources particularly food and petroleum on world markets 2 chinas spending on modernizing its military 3 the rising us trade deficit with china and 4 democracy and human rights in china in the previous section on constraints to growth we already have examined chinas internal problems associated with income distribution unemployment and environmental degradation which also may be of interest increasing competition for resources as any economy develops it generates rising demand for food raw materials and energy with population nearing 15 billion and legitimacy for the ruling communist party dependent on delivering higher standard of living to the chinese people the meeting of such resource requirements through global markets is likely to become an inescapable avenue for beijing not only will this require harmonious relations with supplying nations but access to sea lanes and world ports according to one study china will have to depend on maritime shipping for as much as 30 of its oil 50 of its iron ore and 80 of international trade45 question for the united states is whether the magnitude of chinas future demand for food and energy will disrupt world

emergence as major economic power significantly affect the demand and supply situation prices in world markets how will chinas depen dence on imported commodities affect its military strategy particularly with respect to its territorial claims chinas future food demand chinas future demand for food on international markets depends on several key factors these include chinas rate of economic growth the pace of urbanization shifts in eatin g habits population changes and the relative prices of substitutes future domestic supplies of food depend on weather conditions the rate of growth of investment in agriculture and agricultural inputs eg fertilizer research and development the availability of water relative prices and infrastructural developments transportation communications and storage still rough calculations can be made based primarily on alternative assumptions regarding the most important variables such as population and income although individual estimates of chinas future international food requirements vary widely the current consensus suggests that by 2025 china may be importing about 40 to 50 million tons of food grains per year recent study by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd estimated baseline projection of annual net imports of 43 million metric tons by the year 202046 other studies give figures that range from 20 to 30 million metric tons per year47 if china fails to invest significantly in agriculture and implement appropriate agricultural policies however its imports could rise to 106 million metric tons even 100 million metric tons of chinese demand on international markets per year though may not have significant impact on world food grain markets48 in 1999 total us exports of grains and feeds totaled 1045 million tons half of which went to asia49 for the beijin g leadership imports of up to 100 million tons per year of food grains roughly equivalent to 15 of total chinese grain demand may be viewed as an unacceptable vulnerability particularly because much of this imported grain would have to be obtained from the united states canada australia and argentina or countries

its large petroleum and coal resources chinas production of crude petroleum in 1999 was 32 million barrels per day but its oil consumption was estimated to be 43 million barrels per day it has proven oil reserves of 24 billion barrels and refining capacity of 43 million barrels per day its net imports were 11 million barrels per day or about 25 of its consumption china therefore has become major importer of oil51 it is estimated that chinese dependence on imported oil will increase to 3035 in 2005 and up to 45 by 2010 experts project chinas dependency on middle eastern oil to increase from the present 50 to as much as 80 by the year 201052 the effects of chinas rising petroleum demand are threefold first chinas rising purchases of oil adds to demand for supplies kept limited by the opec oil cartel this conflicts with the interests of the united states eu japan and south korea who also are major importers of oil an increase in the price of crude oil as result of chinas demand on world oil markets will affect american and other consumers although opec may simply increase supply as china develops in order to keep prices stable second chinas increasing dependence on oil from the middle east may be viewed by beijing as strategic vulnerability third chinas increasing dependence on oil imports may move it into closer relationship with iran and iraq as for the third point the united states disagrees strongly with china over that countrys relations with iran and iraq these two oil producers loom heavily in chinas energy strategy and its efforts to build pipelines reaching the middle east china also has been developing friendly relationships with central asian republics some of which are rich in oil in deal with kazakhstan china acquired the right to develop two oil

development of missiles55 sover eignty and territorial issues chinas growing needs for imports of petroleum food and raw materials carries important implications for certain of its territorial claims in recent years beijing has been pressing its claims to certain islands in the east and south china sea56 the chinese leadership views these actions as more than just matter of sovereignty the seas surrounding these islands are rich in fish potentially rich in hydrocarbons and have deposits of minerals including copper zinc lead nickel cobalt manganese iron gold and silver57 the south china sea also is important for shipping more than half the worlds merchant fleet tonnage passes through the straits of malacca sunda and lombok with much of it continuing into the south china sea those ships passing through the malacca and sundra straits follow lanes near the disputed spratly islands much of the cargo being carried by these ships consists of crude oil liquified natural gas coal and iron ore58 the issue of competing claims of sovereignty has been further complicated by the fact that the 1982 law of the sea convention allows for twelvenautical mile territorial sea and 200 nautical miles for exclusive economic zones eezs as well as archipe lagic waters the waters defined as part of the territory of an island nation determined by drawing baselines joining outermost island points for indonesia the philippines and other island states in the region the archipelagic countries in the region unilaterally have claimed eezs but as of yet eez boundary has been officially delimited between opposite and adjacent countries of the 73 different boundaries required only seven have been agreed upon59 more confusion also has been created by the law on the territorial sea and contiguous

of narrow belt varying between 12 and 80 miles in breadth chinese scholar points out however that the boundary line on the chinese map is merely line that delineates ownership of islands rather than maritime boundary in the conventional sense61 in order to stress its claims further in february 1992 china organized seismic survey to explore for oil and also constructed military installation on the mischief reef62 the disputes over the islands have led to military skirmishes the most serious in 1974 when china attacked and captured paracel island from vietnam and again in 1988 when clash between chinese and vietnamese navies at johnson reef on spratly island led to the death of 70 sailors in november 1998 the philippine navy fired warning shots at the chinese ships that had come too close to mischief reef63 these island disputes are likely to continue for some time in summary chinas rising resource needs must be supplied either domestically or internationally on one hand chinas rising demand for food is likely to make it increasingly dependent on the united states and other food exporters such as canada and aust ralia who might be sympathetic to us attempts to use trade as weapon this could make china more susceptible to economic sanctions and may establish political constituencies within china that oppose military or political actions that might jeopardize their sources of supply on the other hand chinas rising dependency on imported petroleum and raw materials could induce beijing to seek to enforce its territorial claims over disputed islands in the pacific and to expand its sales particularly of military equipment to countries such as iran such actions could bring it into conflict with neighboring countries and the united states chinas military spending the focus of this report is chinas economy not its military or security issues but chinas further economic development would enable it to devote more resources toward modernizing its military currently military expenditures are lower on beijings list of budget priorities than allocating funds for economic development but the growin g economy is providing additional funds for the peoples liberation

assigning high priority to defense could provide justification for the united states to move toward policy of containment while also providing japan with the impetus to improve its force projection capabilities senior pla strategists have consistently advised the leadership in beijing against lopsided arms race against the united states because it would undermine economic modernization64 an assessment of chinas military capability and future threat to us interests is beyond the scope of this report here we focus on how chinas economic growth could allow it to devote more resources to the military over the next quarter century by projecting military expenditures for the year 2025 of course projecting such expenditures quarter century into the future is inherently difficult and imprecise and depends on the same factors discussed previously in projecting chinas gdp estimates of current military spending by china range from its officially reported figure of 126 billion 12 of gdp in fy99 which is conside red to be understated considerably to 184 billion 1998 by the stockholm international peace research institute sipri to 367 billion 1998 estimated by the international institute for strategic studiesiiss another estimate provided by the us department of states bureau of arms control of 749 billion is calculated in terms of purchasing power parity ppp and therefore not directly comparable to the other estimates65 the state departments figure uses ppp exchange rate that uses world prices for products such as food lodging and other consumer goods that are sold at relatively low prices in china consensus of government and academic experts suggests an figure of 30 to 35 billion per year around 199666 in view of the stated priorities of beijing it seems that the chinese military is not likely to be allotted much higher proportion of gdp than it presently receives with chinas relatively high rates of gdp growth however even the present allocation would result in substantial increase in the chinese military expenditures as shown in figure 6 projections of chinese defense spending based on current shares of gdp vary widely depending on the initial estimate for 1988 and on future growth rates if one takes low official figure of 126 billion and 12 of gdp in 1998 that would rise to 47 billion or 78 billion in 2025 at growth rates of 5 or 7 respectively at the higher iiss estimate of 367 billion in 1998 chinas total military expenditures in 2025 would rise to projected 137 billion or 228 billion depending on the growth rate of gdp the 228 billion is considerable and begins to approach the 283 billion that the united states spent on defense in 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30757crs31 67 see also frieman op cit p 264 freiman suggests that it is not

billion in 2005 if us defense spending is maintained at 3 of gdp it would rise to roughly 464 billion at us growth rate of 2 per year at higher gdp growth rate of 3 per year spending would rise to about 599 billion in either case chinese military expenditures would be less than half those of the united states with respect to japan it currently spends 37 billion on defense this is roughly the same as the higher iiss estimate for china japan holds its defense spending to roughly 1 of gdp since chinas economic growth rate is expected to be considerably higher than that of japan by 2025 japanese military expenditures of projected 73 billion or 94 billion at 2 or 3 growth rates respectively would be highe r than chinas 47 billion lower estimate based on chinas officially reported military spending level in 1998 but it would be considerably lower than the 228 billion upper estimate for china in short china would be capable of spendi ng enough on defense in 2025 to support sizable military the level of military expenditures however are but one indicator of military strength other important elements are whether the country has sufficient sophisticated weaponry whether those weapons can be incorporated into their military framework and whether their armed personnel have sufficient knowledge and training to use such sophisticated weapons67 modern military

the major imponderable in chinas military situation although beijing views this as chinese internal problem it could entangle the united states and the rest of the world beijing sees taiwan as core

itself to ruling out the use of force74 in defense white paper china reiterated this position stating that if grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of taiwan from china in any name or if taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries or if the taiwan authorities refuse sine die the peaceful settlement of crossstraits reunification through negotiations then the chinese government will have choice but to adopt all drastic measures possible including the use of force to safeguard chinas sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve the great cause of reunification75 if chinas relations with taiwan worsen this could induce the country to devote more resources toward its military modernization program trade deficit and import competition third major effect of chinas emergence as major economic power is in its trading relations with the united states particularly the rising bilateral us trade deficit this trade deficit has consistently been increasing and in 1999 stood at 688 billion bilateral trade deficit however does not occur in any fixed proportion to the size of an economy 5 growth in the chinese economy does not imply 5 growth in its trade surplus with the united states actually fast growing economy generally will run trade deficit since its import growth which depends on rapidly growing domestic demand will usually outpa ce export growth which depends on slower growing foreign demand chinas import regime also is scheduled to undergo considerable liberalization as it joins the world trade organization and fulfills its

demand for goods and services in the united states and would have positive effect on us growth what is less clear is what would happen to us imports from china as market forces induce chinese firms to become more efficient and more international corporations use china as manufac turing and exporting platform but as china s labor and resource costs rise more to the level of those in competitor countries as chinese firms become more competitive and multinational corporations establish more factories there china could become more formidable competitor in export markets including those in the united states for example chinese sources indicate that chinas textile exports will grow by 10 or more after its entry into the wto78 chinas recent gains in exports to the united states however have mainly come at the expense of other newly industrializing countries in asia the overall share of china taiwan hong kong singapore and taiwan in us imports has remained at roughly 17 since 199279 the overall us trade deficit moreover is determined primarily by us macroeconomic forces in concert with international capital flows the total us trade deficit is affected only at the margin by chinese trade liberalization or the export prowess of chinese industries individual us industries however could be affected considerably by larger chinese economy with liberalized trading sector this has been particular concern by us laborintensive industries such as textiles and apparel us import competing industries also fear that larger and more economically powerful china will become an even more formidable competitor in international markets it could become second japan an economy that began exporting toys and textiles and then moved progressively into steel machine tools automobiles computers and precision machinery china moreover tends to be more open to foreign investment than japan or other industrialize d nations in asia such as south korea this implies that china may move up the technology ladder even faster than did japan or south korea since it does not have to develop that technology indigenously but can rely on subsidiaries of multi national corporations to identify

chinese companies establish subsidiaries and partnerships overseas they likewise will become subject to local governments and economic condi tions their profitability will hinge on policies of their

adoption of international standards in multitude of areas this not only includes traderelated standards as will be required by wto membership but in accounting banking and other aspects of modern economy democracy and human rights whether or not economic development and greater globalization of the chinese economy will accelerate the pace of democracy and promote human rights is unclear currently beijing seems to be giving economic betterment higher priority than improving human rights or yielding to outside pressures it claims that eliminating starvation through economic growth to be equivalent to assuring the right to live the most important human right of all in view of the experience of the former soviet union and the demise of communist rule in many countries however beijing is cautious about the pace of democratization and firm in its suppression of dissent even though beijing has allowed local competitive elections in rural areas it seems to have appetite for allowing the people to choose leaders higher up the governing hierarchy in terms of democracy and human rights economic development is twoedged sword on one hand it has broadened the sources of information and generated resources for opposition and religious groups as more of chinas population attains economic security they are able to turn their attention toward issues such as democracy
