federal programs and issues for congress summary adults may go missing due to choice an abduction foul play mental or physical disability or natural catastr ophe among other reasons although accurate estimates exist of the number of missing adults the federal bureau of investigation fbi reported that as of january 1 2008 over 50000 missing adult cases were pending in the national crime information system ncic federal computerized index with data on crimes and locator files for missing and unidentified persons certain adults are pa rticularly vulnerable to ssing episodes for example those with dementia are at risk for wa ndering adults who engage in highrisk behaviors including involvement in gang activity may also be more prone to going missing unlike children adults have the legal right to go missing under most circumstances as result families of ssing adults may r eceive limited assistance from state and local law enforcement entities in recovering their loved ones the federal government has not been involved in assisting law enforcement entities with missing adult cases in the same way it has with missing children cases further cases of missing children nd young adults under the age of 21 must be reported to the ncic while reporting missing adults to the database is voluntary in recent years however the federal government has increasingly played role in 1 preventing certain types of missing adult incidents and 2 working to recover adults who go missing including those who are deceased and for whom only remains can be found recognizing the needs of growing aging population congress authorized funding for the missing alzhe imers disease patient alert program under the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 the program has awarded funds to the alzheimers associ ation of america since fy1996 to protect and locate missing individuals with dementia through patient identification program as well as outreach and edu cation efforts in 2000 congress passed kristens act pl 106468 to permit the department of justice doj to make grants to establish national clearinghous for missing adults and provide technical assistance to law enforcemen t agencies in locating these individuals from fy2002 through fy2006 doj made grants to th national center for missing adults ncma for these purposes both doj nd ncma have estab lished databases to collect and disseminate information to law enforcement on missing adults their relatives and unidentified human remains the presidents dna initiative has also supported efforts to recover missing persons and identify unidentified human remains by funding dna analysis and providing tec hnical assistance on using this analysis policymakers and other stakeholders ve increasingly focused on two issues related to adults who go missing whether to provide federal assistance to states and localities to develop alert systems and technology to locate missing adults and possibly expanding federal i nvolvement in cases of missi ng adults with diminished mental capacity another issue is the coordination of the databases on missing persons this report will be updated as events

federal programs and issues for congress introduction adults may go missing due to choice an abduction or foul play physical or developmental disability natural catastr ophe that displaces individuals such as hurricanes katrina and rita and certain highrisk behaviors including gang involvement or drug use among other circumstances state and local laws govern how cr iminal justice entities respond to missing adult cases this response is complicated by number of factors unlike children adults have the legal right to go missing in most cases and may do so to seek protection from domestic abuser and other related reasons1 further law enforcement agencies may be hesitant to devote resources to missing adult cases given competing priorities law enforcement agencies within and across states also respond differently to missing adult cases so states mandate that law enforcement officials take reports without waiting peri od while other states require at least 24 hour waiting period after the pers on is believed to be missing2 the federal government has not been i nvolved in assisting state and local law enforcement entities with missing adult cases in the same way it has with missing children cases federal law requires law enforcement to report missing children and young adults under the age of 21 to the fe deral bureau of investigations fbi national crime information ce nter ncic federal data base of crime and missing person information reporting missing adu lts to the database is voluntary in addition since 1985 congress has appropr iated funding to the missing and exploited childrens program to coordinate federal re sponse to missing children cases and to create and maintain national clearinghouse that assists law enforcement and families with these cases3 in recent years the federal government has increasingly played role in both 1 preventing certain types of missing adult in cidents and 2 recovering adults who go missing including those who are deceased and for

congress authorized the department of justice doj through kristens act pl 106468 to make grants to blish national clearinghouse for missing adults and provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies in locating missing adults the federal government has also supported efforts to establish databases to track and identify missing dults their relatives and unidentified human remains some advocates of missing adults and policymakers have called for the federal government to expand its role in missing adult cases for example these advocates and policymakers would like the federal government to assist states by creating or expanding missing adult alert programs that serve as warning to the public about cases of missing adults much like the amber americas missing broadcast emergency response ert program for missing children the first section of this report discu sses demographics and record keeping of missing adults and unidentifie d remains and some of the factors that may contribute to the disappearance of adults this secti on also discusses fede rally funded databases that are used to track data on missing dults and unidentified individuals the second section of the report describes the federal programs and initiatives to assist in locating missing adults including fundi ng data for fy2002 through fy2008 where applicable final action has been taken to fund these activities for fy2009 finally the third section discusses issues about the federal role in missing adult cases why do adults go missing certain circumstances can make adults vul nerable to going missing adults may go missing because of an abduction or foul play physical or developmental disability or cognitive disorder such as alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia may also contribute to missing episode adults with dementia have been identified as highrisk for going missing by advocates for older adults according to the alzheimers association as many as five million people in the us suffer from alzheimers disease and rela ted dementia and about 60 of those will wander away from their homes or health care facilities4 further natural catastrophe can displace individuals and make their whereabout s unknown to others approximately 13000 adults were reported missing in the days following hurricanes katrina and rita in 20055 finally other adults vulnerable to ssing incidents may

history of vic timization including domestic violence6 data on missing adults and unidentified decedents there is definitive estimate of the num ber of adults who go missing because some adults are not known to be missing or are not reported to databases that compile data on missing persons however thr ee federally supported data sources provide some insight into this number the missing person file at the fbis national crime information center the fbis national dna index system ndis which stores information on offenders and arrestees fo rensic evidence as well as individuals believed to be missing their relatives and unidentified human remains and the national missing and unidentified persons system namus administered by dojs national institute of justice nij the national center for missing adults ncma clearinghouse in glendale arizona that assists the fa milies of missing adults and law enforcement agencies also has data base on missing adu lts ncma was funded with doj grant authorized by kristens act from fy2002 through fy2006 profiles of missing individua ls entered into one databa do not necessarily populate other databases although so missing individuals may be reported to more than one of the databases therefor numbers of missing persons should not be added across any of the databases the ncic unidentified person file namus and ndis contain information about unidentified decedents however the true number of unidentified missing adult cases is unknown because remains can go undi scovered or if they are recovered they may not be reported to the databases or reta ined in census conducted by doj in 2004 medical examiners and coroners re ported total of 13486 unidentified human remains on record though about 51 of medical examiner and coroners offices lacked policies for retaining records such as xrays dna or fingerprints that could identify missing individuals7 the report also found that 90 of offices serving large jurisdictions did retain such records further medical examiners and coroners estimated that about 4400 uniden tified human decedents were reported in an average year with approximately 1000 230 re maining unidentifie d after one year another doj study estimated using death records reported to the centers for disease control from 1980 through 2004 that as many as 10300 of these records were for unidentified decedents this number is an approximation as states do not uniformly specify on the death certificate when persons identity is not known8 in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34616crs4 8 continued pdfuhrus04pdf 9

division on january 25 2008 for further information about the current ncic advisory policy board see httpwwwfbigovhqcjisdadvisorypolicy boardhtm the fbi is authorized to maintain the ncic under 28 usc 434 10 the missing children act of 1982 affirmed the need for the missing person file by requiring the fbi to acquire collect classify and preserve any information which would assist in the location of any missing person i ncluding an unemancipated person as defined by the laws of the places of residence of ch person and provide confirmation as to any entry for such person to the parent legal gu ardian or next of ki n of that person 28 usc 534a the fbi amended ncic entry procedures in may 1999 to replace the phrase unemancipated person with person who is missing under the age of 18the criteria used by doj to search the death records may have included individuals whose identities were known as well as uni dentified individuals who were later identified the discussion below will show that the databases range in the number of profiles they contain as well as the type of information they collect eg basic demographic profiles dna profiles etc the discussion also raises the question about whether these database s can or should share data or indicate that data about an individual profile is available in nother database some crossreferencing between the databases now ccurs though on limited basis national crime information center missing person and unidentified person files the ncic within the fbis criminal justice information services cjis division maintains statistics on missing adults and unidentified decedents9 the ncic is computerized index of docum ented information concerning crimes and criminals of nationwide interest and locator file for missing and unidentified persons since october 1 1975 the ncic has maintained records of missing persons known as the missing person file who are reported to the fbi by federal state and local law enforcement agencies foreign criminal justice agencies and autho rized courts the missing person file was creat ed in response to request in 1974 from the ncic advisory policy board apb10 the apb is composed of local state and federal criminal justice and national security agencies and advises the fbi on criminal justice information matters the missing person file includes records for individuals who are

these 1788 257 were entered in 2007 nearly all 6822 of the active entries were for deceased uniden tified bodies the remaining were for unidentified catastrophe victims and living persons who could not be identified either because they could not identify themse lves or refused to disclose their identity also in 2007 nearly 1000 records were canceled or cleared by law enforcement agency for such reasons as the subject be ing identified or the records being invalid the total number of unidentif ied persons in the ncic may represent just fraction of the true number of missing remains

under the jurisdiction of state and local governments these efforts may be complicated by number of factors unlike children adults have the legal right to go missing in most cases and can do so to seek protection from domestic buser and other reasons35 further law enforcement agencies may be hesitant to devote resour ces to missing adult cases given competing priorities in addition law enforcement agencies within and across states respond differently to missing adult cases some states mandate that law enforcement officials take reports without waiting period whereas other states requi re at least 24hour waiting period after the person is believed to be missing36 in recent years the federal government has increasingly played role both in preventing certain types of missing adult incidents and in working to recover adults who go missing including those who are deceased and for whom only remains provide clues to the circumstances surroundi ng their disappearance in

addition state alert systems vary in terms of the target population for issuing an alert ie older adults with dementia versus any adult with disability most law enforcement agencies have the ability to disseminate the alert to law enforcement agencies and media in the local area region statewide and other states fo r example the texas division of emergency management disse minates information within the alert advisory area to local state and federal law enforcement agencies primary media outlets the texas departme nt of transportation the texas lottery commission and the independent bankers associ ation of texas however illinois issues alerts only to law enforcement agencies and does not i nvolve the public or media some states also have the ability to issue regional or interstate alerts some advocates have raised concerns th at alert systems may not be useful for some adults who go missing for example it is reported that nearly all 94 persons with alzheimers disease who wander are found less than 15 miles from home and almost 30 are found among makeshif t shelters under brush or briar65 further there is concern that alerting the media rep eatedly about missing adult case could desensitize the public to the issue of wa ndering some advocates suggest that policymakers may wish to consider silver alerts in combination with combination of other policy approaches66 legislation in the 110th congress on april 24 2008 representative gus bilirakis introduced the silver ert grant program ac t of 2008 hr 5898 hr 5898 sought to authorize the attorney

for states to decide the defi nition could have varied wide ly from one state to another the bill also did not define the rights of adults with cognitive disabilities who want to go missing and may choose to do so for legitmate reasons hr 271 would have essen tially required the national center for missing and exploited children which receives most of the funding from the federal missing and exploited childrens prog ram authorized by the missing childrens assistance act to work to recover any missing adults deemed eligible under hr 271 in response to the possibility that ncmec would need to focus its work on certain vulnerable adults ages 21 and older the or ganization has said that it would prefer to initially take on missing adults cases on pilot basis to assess the issues and problems that may arise such as varying state law definitions of diminished capacity73 according to ncmec we would only take diminished capacity cases if requested to do so by law enforcemen t agency and given that these are cases of missing adults who are not like children whose disappearance is presumed to be involuntary we would likely need limited civ il and criminal liability to prevent
