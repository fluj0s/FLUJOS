concluded negotiations on the usperu trade promotion agreement ptpa president bush notified the congress of the united states intention to enter into the ptpa on january 6 2006 and the agreement was signed on april 12 2006 by us trade representative rob portman and peruvian minister of foreign trade and tourism alfredo ferrero diez the ptpa is comprehensive trade agreement that if approved by congress would eliminate tariffs and other barr iers in goods and services trade between the united states and peru the approval and implementation of ptpa is high priority for the peruvian government peruvian president alan garcía has met with president bush and members of congress on several occasions in the united states to stress the importance of the agreement for peru the pending ptpa would likely have small net economic effect on the united states because us trade with peru accounts for small percent of total us trade for peru the impact would be more significant because the united states is perus leading trade partner in 2006 23 of perus exports went to the united states and 16 of perus imports were supplied by the united states in that same year peru accounted for 05 of total us trade peru ranks 43 rd among us export markets and 42nd as source of us imports the dominant us import item from peru is gold 24 in 2006 and the leading us export items to peru are petroleum oils and related products 9 in 2006 upon implementation ptpa would eliminate duti on 80 of us exports of consumer and industrial products to peru an additional 7 of us exports would receive dutyfree treatment within five years of implementation remaining tariffs would be eliminated ten years after implementation ptpa would make the preferential duty treatment for selected us imports from peru permanent the united states currently extends dutyfree treatment to imports from peru under the andean trade preference act tpa title ii of pl 102182 enacted on december 4 1991 and reauthorized under

the worst forms of child labor and 5 the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation these obligations would refer only to the 1998 ilo declaration on the fundamental principles and rights at work another change relates to labor law enforcement any decision made by signatory on the distribution of enforcement resources would not be reason for not complying with the

domestic environmental laws and to adopt maintain and implement laws and all other measures to fulfill obligations under the seven covered multilateral environmental agreements meas all obligations in the environment chapter would be subject to the same dispute settlement procedures and enforcement mechanisms as all other obligations in the agreement the environment chapter includes an annex on forest sector governance that addresses environmental and economic consequences of trade associated with illegal logging and illegal trade in wildlife the annex would require concrete steps for the

include provisions on generic medicines and government procurement among others regarding the provisions on generic medicines the trading partners would provide five years of data exclusivity for test data related to pharmaceuticals if peru relies on us federal drug administration fda ap proval of given drug and meets certain conditions for expeditious approval of that drug in peru the data exclusivity period would expire at the same time that the exclusivity expired in the united states these provisions would reportedly allow generic medicines to enter more quickly into the market in

have small but positive net economic effect on the united states because of the relatively small size of perus economy in relation to the us economy in 2006 peru had nominal gdp of 93 billion approximately 07 the size of the us gdp of 132 trillion another reason the net effect would be expected to be small is that the value of us trade with peru is small when compared to overall us trade us trade imports plus exports with peru accounts for about 03 of total us trade us imports from peru account for 03 of total us imports and us exports to peru account for 03 of total us exports most of the economywide trade effects of trade liberalization from the ptpa would be due to perus removal of tariff barriers and other trade restrictions us exporters have substantially larger tariff barriers on their exports to peru than do peruvian exporters on their exports to the united states the usitc study on the potential effects of ptpa estimates that us imports from peru would increase by 439 million and us exports to peru would increase by 11 billion the study also estimates that us gdp would increase by over 21 billion 002 as result of the agreement in terms of losses the report estimates that three us sectors metals mainly gold copper and aluminum crops such as cut flowers live plan ts and seeds and paddy rice would experience reductions in output revenue or employment of more than 010 24 the proposed ptpa is unlikely to affect the aggregate employment level in the united states but it could impact jobs in specific industries ccording to the usitc study the largest us employment gain 1 is estimated to be in wheat production declines are estimated in metals gold copper and aluminum rice production and miscellaneous crops cut flowers live plants and seeds which could lose up to 02 of their employment displaced by imports some labor groups argue that us exports of basic grains could adversely affect the livelihoods of subsistence farmers in peru where agriculture is the main source of jobs another factor for consideration is the extent to which the proposed ptpa would provide trade creation over trade diversion 25 one of the drawbacks to bilateral free trade agreement is that it may result in trade diversion because it is not fully inclusive of all regional trading partners trade diversion results when country enters into an fta and then shifts the purchase of goods or services imports from country that is not an fta partner to country that is an fta partner but still higher cost producer in the case of the united states and peru for example goods from the united states may replace perus lowerpriced imports from other countries in latin america if this were to happen the united states would now be the producer of that item not because it produces the good more efficiently but because it is receiving preferential access to the peruvian market 24 usitc ptpa report p xv 25 when trade agreement lowers trade barriers on good production may shift from domestic producers to lower cost foreign producers and result in substituting an imported good for the domestic good this process is called trade creation trade creation provides economic benefits as consumers have wider choice of goods and services available at lower costs trade creation also results in adjustment costs however usually in the form of domestic job losses as production shifts to another country httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34108g23g495g21g495g556g18g142g155g158g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g20g142g149g138g157g146g152g151g156

labor provisions have been among the more controversial in the negotiation of the agreement supporters of the agreement have argued that peru has ratified all eight international labor organization ilo core labor standards that ptpa would reinforce perus labor reform measures of recent years27 and that ptpa provisions would go beyond labor protections in us laws under the atpa and the generalized system of preferences gsp critics argue that with enforceable ilo core labor standards in the language of the agreement the main issues at this point are perus adoption of new labor laws and enforcement of labor law number of members of congress indicated early in 2007 that ptpa labor requirements would have to be strengthened for the agreement to be approved stating that enforceable ilo core labor standards should be included in the text of the agreement in march 2007 the democratic leadership of the house ways and means committee announced set of trade principles democratic trade principles 28 that can pave the way to reestablishing bipartisan consensus on trade29 these principles included commitment that free trade agreement fta signatory countries adopt basic ilo labor standards and agree to enforcement provisions for those standards in agreements30 on may 10 2007 after much negotiation congress and the administration announced an agreement for new trade policy for america which incorporated key democratic priorities relating to labor and other issues key concepts in the new tradelabor policy include fully enforceable provisions that 1 incorporate ilo core labor standards as stated in the 1998 ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work henceforth referred to as the ilo declaration 31 and 2 prohibit partner countries from weakening laws relating to ilo core labor standards in order to attract trade or investment before the new ptpa language was released some observers noted that the united states has ratified only two ilo conventions while peru has ratified all eight in addition the us has some laws that may not totally conform with language of ilo conventions possible example is some state laws which permit employmentwithoutpay for prisoners consequently they express concern that including enforceable ilo core labor standards into trade agreements could subject the entire us labor code to challenges by trading partners this issue is addressed by language in the ptpa that restricts the application of the ptpa provisions to traderelated matters and 26 for more details see crs report rs22521 peru trade promotion agreement

surrounding the proposed ptpa is that of patent protection and access to medicines some organizations we re concerned that the agreements stronger protection of intellectual property rights ipr patents and trade secrets could jeopardize access to medicines by poorer segments of the population they argued that the agreements provisions could delay the entry of generic drugs into the market in peru and cause the price of medicines to rise the primary issue related to patent protection and access to medicines involves the data exclusivity term to bring patented drug to market drug company must demonstrate through clinical trials that the drug is both safe and effective under us law the data used to establish these claims are protected from use by generic manufacturers to certify their own products for period of five years from the time the patented drug is approved for use in countrys market this protection refers the socalled data exclusivity term the amendments to the text of the ptpa on data exclusivity would grant peru the period of data protection to be concurrent with the term of protection provided in the united states which could shorten the time line for allowing generic medicines into the peruvian market the original text of the agreement would have delayed the availability of generic pharmaceuticals in the peruvian market for at least five years even if the patent had already expired in april 2005 perus health ministry released an evaluation of potential effects of free trade agreement on access to medicines in peru the study stated that an agreement would affect generic brands of medicine in that many of thes medicines would longer be eligible to be branded as generic 32 number of nongovernment organizations based in the united states and latin america were also concerned that ptpa would reduce access to essential medicines by the poor populations of peru they argued that the agreements provisions far exceeded international standards established by the wto33 the pharmaceutical industry has denied claims that patents may prevent access to essential medicines in developing countries according to industry representatives very few medicines on the world health organizations list of essential medicines are patented the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers ifpma and associations report that 95 of essential medicines including antiretrovirals for treating hivaids are offpatent and can therefore be legally copied by generic manufacturers anywhere in the world however according to ifpma generic copies of these products are still not reaching the poorest populations of the world 34 the pharmaceutical industry believes that without patent protection many of the innovative medicines that are saving lives would not be available 32 valladares alcalde raúl cruzado ubillús juan seclén palacín zósimo and juan pichihua serna evaluation of potential effects of the free trade agreement being negotiated with

major environmental issue surrounding possible ptpa is related to us imports of bigleaf mahogany and reports of illegal logging in peru environmental groups are concerned that an agreement could lead to an increase in exports of illegal logged mahogany to the united states from peru the united states is the worlds larg est wood products consumer and one of the top importers of tropical hardwoods some environmentalists believe that us demand for tropical timber from countries in latin america may be driving force for illegal logging ptpa environmental provisions require each country to enforce domestic environmental laws and establish policy mechanism to address public complaints that party is not enforcing its environmental laws whether or not the failure is traderelated in early 2007 number of members of congress emphasized that environmental provisions of the agreement needed to be strengthened the may 10 bipartisan democratic trade principles 35 stated that peru should be required to adopt and enforce laws on logging mahogany and that the united states should promote sustainable devel opment and combat global warming by requiring countries to implement and enforce common multilateral environmental agreements these principles were incorporated into the agreement in the june 2007 amendments annex 1834 of the amendment to chapter 18 the environmental chapter of the proposed ptpa is devoted to forest sector governance and subject to the dispute settlement provisions of the agreement the annex specifically mentions protection measures for mahogany within the norms established by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites the annex includes section on enforcement measures on forest sector governance and provisions related to the harvest of and trade in timber products the united states currently requires an export permit from peru validating that mahogany entering the united states was harvested in sustainable manner that is not detrimental to the species some argue however that peruvian mahogany is nonetheless harvested illegally at times and that export permits provided by peru have been granted without sufficient monitoring and assessment of harvesting practices 36 the peruvian nongovernment organization native federation of madre dios fenamad recently teamed with the natural resource defense council to file suit against the us government and us timber importers to the us court of international trade stating that the government was authorizing trade in bigleaf mahogany from peru without valid export permits the court however rejected these claims and moved to dismiss the complaint stating lack of jurisdiction 37 us timber importers announced in press release after the courts decision that they were pleased with the court decision and that the lawsuit was mischaracterization of international trade regulations 38 under the ptpa there are more legal protections for us investors in peru which could potentially lead to larger timber industry in peru and greater harvesting on the other hand an agreement may increase awareness of the illegal logging issue and add mechanisms that may be used to increase protection critics of the proposed ptpa environmental provisions in the 35 house ways and means committee staff new trade policy for america march 27 2007
