permitted to restrict access to federal programs on the basis of immigration status the personal responsibility and work oppor tunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 the original law authorizin g the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program dramatically changed noncitizen eligibility for public assistance it restricted the eligibility of lprs refugees asylees and other noncitizens for meanstested public aid these provisions rang ed from categorical eligibility bars to new rules governing aliens with sponsor s and thei r sponsors responsibilities2 aliens in the united states without authorization commonly referred to as illegal alie ns remained ineligible federal public assistance although the federal government re tains exclusive responsibility for immigration policy federal law now permits states to di fferentiate among types of noncitizens when setting welfare policy th 1996 welfare reform act gave states several options of placing fu rther restrictions on noncitizen eligibility it also gave them options of expanding benefits to noncitizens3 as congress considers thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32363crs2 4 crs report rl31114 noncitizen eligibility for majo r federal public assistance programs policies and legislation by ruth ellen wasem lays out these rules in more detail including special rules that apply to several limited noncitizen categories certain crossborder american indians hmonghig hland laotians parolees and conditional entrants and cases of abuse 5 this fiveyear ban on eligibility for new entran ts also applies to program closely

aliens physically present in the united states who if returned to their country of origin would be persecuted or have wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinionreauthorization of the welfare reform law the issue of state options to restrict or expand assistance to noncitzens arises after outlining the options states ve to cover noncitzens under tanf and presenting data on the number of lprs in each state this report studies whether and which states have exercised these options regarding noncitizen eligibility for tanf it investigates how states are funding th assistance provided to noncitizens and also analyzes tanf receipt by state current federal eligibility policy under current law noncitizens eligibility for tanf largely depends on their immigration status and whether they arrived or were on programs rolls before august 22 1996 the enactment date of p l 104193 the tanf eligibility policies laid out by the 1996 welfare reform act re main essentially unc hanged for noncitizens entering after its enactment the basic federal rules are as follows4 lprs who entered the united states after august 22 1996 are barred from tanf for five year s after which their coverage becomes state option5 lprs with substantial work history generally 10 years 40 quarters of work documented by social security or other employment records or milita ry connection active duty military personnel veterans and their fa milies are eligible for tanf refugees and asylees are eligible for tanf for five years after entering the united states6 after this fiveyear term refugees and asylees may be eligible at state option for tanf7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32363crs3 8 to naturalize under us immigration law all lprs must also show that they have good moral character demonstrate the ability to read write speak and understand english and pass an examination on us government and

citizenship and immigrant services formerly the immigration and naturalization service asks all people as they become lprs where they intend to live in the united statesnonimmigrants eg temporary alien residents and unauthorized aliens ie illegal aliens are barred from tanf as they we re barred from its predecessor aid for families with dependent children legal permanent residents by state the state residential patterns of th almost 145 million aliens who became lprs in the united states from fy1988 through fy2002 provide gauge of the relative effect of these po licies across the states lthough substantial number of people who are currently lprs came to th united states before 1988 many others who came prior to 1988 have become us citiz ens all lprs are eligible to become citizens through the naturalization process after they have lived here for five years as lprs three years in the case of spouses of us citizens8 estimates of the naturalization rate range from 30 to 49 and the median number of years between becoming an lpr and naturalizing as us citizen varies from eight to 10 years for those who opt to naturalize9 immigrants are concentrated in several states indeed over half of all new lprs from fy1988 through fy2002 indicated that they intended to live in just three states california new york and texas10 as table 1 presents california dominates with 4561693 new lprs which is 315 of all ne w lprs during this period new york follows with 2001439 new lprs 138 in terestingly both california and new york had slightly smaller percentage of all new lprs during the 19972002 period 261 and 128 respectively than during 19881996 period 344 and 143 respectively suggesting somewhat wider dispersion of new lprs to other states almost 80 of all new lprs reported their

presentation of data from national tanf datafile as of may 15 2002 generally states with larger shares of lprs were more likely to have expanded statelevel tanf policies for noncitizens as we ll as have greater percentage of their caseload who were noncitizens there were however some exceptions as noted above the level of immigrant enrollment in assistance programs is affected by the restrictions imposed under the 1996 welfare re form law by states choices to extend or deny coverage when given the opti on and to some degree by individuals perception of their eligibility status and their election to participate or not among the public at large confusion remains over what classes of noncitizens are eligible for which programs in part because the 1996 welfare law used the phrase qualified alien not term in immigration law that encompasses variety of classes of noncitizens who must meet additional speci fied conditions moreover despite narrowly drawn regulations from the former immigration and naturalization service now the us citizenship and immigration services in the department of homeland security on what constitutes public char ge many believe that receiving public benefits may adversely ffect noncitizens immigration status or potential to sponsor immigration petitions for family member s these factors may be inhibiting participation among eligible immigrants
