in the housepassed amendment 2 before clearing the bill for the president the senate voted 7721 to waive the budget act concerning the bill thus disposing of point of order against the bill raised by

substantially increased educational benefits for military personnel who serve abroad for thirtysix months or more see below for more detailed review of the main provisions key issue in congressional action on the bill was whether to offset the longterm costs of expanded benefits which cbo estimated would amount to 52 billion through fy2018 in may under pressure from blue dog democrats the house leadership agreed to add to the bill 05 surcharg on high income taxpayers as means of offsetting the cost of the program the senate however did not agree to the tax offset and it was not included in the may 22 senatepassed bill subsequently as the house leadership considered how to proceed blue dog democrats in the house continued to warn that they would vote against the final bill if it did not offset the costs meanwhile the white house warned that the president would veto the bill if it included tax increas in the end the house leadership didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34451crs7 5 bart jansen josh rogin and kathleen hunter gop slips mccains gi bill alternative into play on senate floor cq today online news may 14 2008not include the offset in the final version of the bill on june 19 the house approved expanded veterans educationa l benefits as part of am endment 2 with only 12 votes against it aside from the debate about offsetting costs there were some objections to specific aspects of the main gi bill propos being considered in the house and senate senior officials in the defense department opposed key elements of the measure and senate republicans with wh ite house support proposed an alternative that would require longer rvice before personnel could qualify for full benefits at may 8 press conference secretary of defense robert gates and joint chiefs chairman admiral michael mullen complain ed that the measure being proposed in the house and senate bills would undermine retention of personnel because it would make full educational benefits available for service members who have not reenlisted for second term on may 6 at an event to honor military spouses the president said that he was sending to congress legislation that would improve benefits for military fa milies including measure that would allow educational benefits to be transferred to children or spouses on may 14 senate republicans brought up an alternative gi bill expansion proposal sponsored by senator graham as an amendment to pending collective bargaining legislation5 that amendment was based on s 2938 measure to increase veterans education benefits that senator grah am proposed on april 29 with number of cosponsors including senator mccain the graham bill would provide larger benefits for military personnel who serve for at least 12 years and permit benefits to be transferred to other family members the education benefit measure included in the house and senate supplemen tal bills in contrast was based on bill s 22hr 5740 sponsored by senator webb and representative mitchell that provides maximum benefits after as little as thirtysix months of service in the end the enacted version of the supplemental adheres to the webbmitchell bill it provide s maximum benefits to pe rsonnel with as little as 36 months of service the final bill however also includes provision allowing service members to transfer be nefits to spouses and other depe ndents the transfer provision adds 108 billion to the tenyear projected cost of the bill house and senate differences over other domestic spending apart from the fact that the house rejected funding for military operations except for military construction funds that were grouped together with funding for domestic programs the main differences between the initial house and senate bills had to do with amounts for domestic spending both the house and the senate bills provided 99 billion for interna tional affairs programs thoug h the bills allocated the funds somewhat differently both bills also included expanded gi bill educational benefits with 716 million required in fy2008 and fy2009 and extended unemployment benefits costing 156 billion in the first two yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34451crs8 beyond that the house bill provided 58 billion in fy2009 emergency funds for gulf coast levee construction 210 milli on for the bureau of the census and 178 million for shortfalls in the federal pr ison system budget representative obey the chairman of the house appropriations committee repeatedly noted that all of these funds were requested in so form by the administration the senatepassed bill provided 85 b illion more than the house bill for domestic programs of the additional funds 46 billion was for hurricanerelated relief and reconstruction and other disaster assistance for total in the senate bill of 104 billion and 1 billion was provided fo r lowincome energy assistance 590 million for state and local law enforcemen t assistance 400 million for secure local schools 437 million for veterans administration polytrauma fac ilities 275 million for food and drug administration safety programs and 12 billion for science initiative with funds allocated to nasa the department of energy and the national institutes of health the additional funds in th senate bill for domestic programs were matter of considerable debate among house and senate democratic leaders not wanting to invite presidential veto the house lead ership resisted adding funds for domestic programs except for veterans educati on benefits unemployment compensation and the cost of delaying new medicaid rules the house stayed within limits on spending that the white house insisted on the senate however appr oved substantial amount of additional domestic spending as part of an amendment that passed by vote of 7026 with more than nough support to override veto when the house subsequently took up th senatepassed vers ion of the bill in june the house leadership decided to negotiate with the white house in an effort to agree on bill that would not be vetoed the final bill included relatively little unrequested domestic funding that version of the bill passed by the house june 19 and by the senate june 26

contractors in war zones subject to prosecution for offenses that would viol ate us law prohibited the establishmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34451crs14 of permanent bases in ira q and prohibited interrogati on techniques not authorized in the army field manual the senate however rejected by vote of 3463 package of iraq policy provisions that were approved by the appropriations committee the vote did not necessarily reflect the sentiment of the senate on policy matters however several antiwar senators said they opposed the m easure because they did not want to vote for the 163 billion in funding to which the policy package was attached the senate committee measure did not establish timetable for withdrawal as in the house bill the rejected senate policy provisions would state that the mission of us forces in iraq should shift to counter terrorism training nd force protection require that units be fully missi on capable before being deployed with presidential waiver set limits on the time units may be deployed of one year in the armyand seven months in the marine corps also with waiver require that units be based at home for the same periods between rotations with waiver

for the department of defense through december 2007 congress had approve d 868 billion which left 1025 billion still pending when the 110th congress reconvened in january in march 2008 the defense partment provided the congressional defense committees with revised allocation of the remaining funds the main changes were to reduce remaining requested funding fo r other procurement army and to add money for navy army national guard nd air force operati on and maintenance accounts the revision also added about 1 billion in military construction funds to cover escalating base realignment and closure costs in considering the remaining fy2 008 defense request house and senate appropriators announced plans to add bridge fund for fy2009 of 6570 billion providing funds mainly for personnel and operating accounts sufficient to allow the military services to continue operations into about the middle of calendar year 2008 this would avoid another contentious deba over iraq policy during the fall election season accompanied by dod complaints that it would have to shut down army and marine corps operations early in the following year it would also leave time for the next administration to formulate its own fullyear war supplemental funding proposal based on any proposed change s in strategy nd troop levels subsequently on may 2 2008 the white h ouse sent congress formal request for 70

provided for the iraqi enterprise fund and such fund was specifically prohibited the fy2008 incle iraq program funding at 85 million was cut substantially by 74 million fro m the request and prison construction funding was included because operational funds for the prts are blended with those of the embassy and usaid operating expenses are provided for both iraq and afghanistan it is not possible to say with certainty whether the full request was met by the house amendment the amendment did pr ovide the sigir with 25 million and 465 million for fy2008 and fy2009 respectively may 22 senate action on iraq reconstruction with regard to iraq funding levels the senate bill approved on may 22 differed from the may 15 housepassed bill in one large resp ect it contained 28 billion in dod reconstruction appropria tions and the house bill had none in other respects the bills were similar see table 6 for account levels in all the senate bill provides 42 billion for both dod and foreign operati ons appropriations in fy2008 and fy2009 67 of the administration request like the house the senate bill shifted funding strongly in the direction of local level assistance programs of the 398 million in fy2008 esf at least 313 million would be targeted to provincial and local community activities rather than programs supporting the national government pr t programs would get 138

enterprise fund would also not be funded in the senate bill the may 22 senate bill pr ovided the sigir an opera ting expense level of 25 million in fy2008 and 365 million in fy2009 prt and usaid operating expense levels are not specified house and senate action on ir aqi role in reconstruction reflecting recent indications that members of both pa rties desired to see the iraqi government pay greater share of the costs of reconstruction under the approved house amendment 2 the may 15 house bill contai ned measure that would require most reconstruction funds to be matched by iraqi obligations on dollarfordollar basis the exceptions are for democracy and human rights programs the usaid community action program and other ngoassisted programs humanitarian demining refugee and displaced persons assistance intelligen ce activities and cerp projects with value less than 750000 it is not clear from the language whether the match would have to be made projectbyproject or whether total iraqi funding for reconstruction in general would suffice to permit continued us assistance at the same level if the latter the provision might not affect us funding significantly as in the past year iraqi obligations for security and economic reconstruction have approached the us contribution and will likely surpass it in 2008 the may 22 senate bill cont ained the above matching fund language the senate bill also contained language requiring the secretary of defense to develop process with iraq to institute equal sh aring of reconstruction costs for all dod funded projects costing over 750000 beginning by october 1 2008 the bill debated on the floor on may 22 would also have prohibited dod funding of large scale infrastructure projects costing ove r 2 million but this section was rejected along with other socalled policy provisions as the cerp was exempted from this restriction the likely effect would have been only to ensure that iraq funds construction of securityrelated facilities such as military barracks and training centers enacted version of fy20082009 supplemental the version of the fy2008 and fy2009 supplemental approved on june 19 by the house approved by the senate june 26 and signed by the pr esident june 30 differs from its predecessor in few important respects first it pproves dod appropriations for iraq security adopting the senates

infrastructure maintenance 25 million for provincial economic growth agriculture nd microcredit 70 million for national capacity development and 75 million for the marla ruzicka war victims fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34451crs29 third significant difference between the first version of the house bill and the version enacted on june 30 is the range of conditions placed on economic aid the bill maintains prohibitions on prison cons truction and an enterprise fund it withholds funding on infrastructure main tenance 10 million until the department of state certifies that iraq has entered into and begun to implement an asset transfer agreement including an iraqi agreement to maintain usfunded infrastructure it releases more than 40 of rule of law incle funding until the state department reports that an anticorruption strategy has been veloped and is being implemented by the iraq government it withholds all prt operating expenses and program funds until the state department reports on stra tegy for winding down and closing out the prts on the costs of the prt program expenses security and any iraq contribution and on the future costs nd placement of us consulates in iraq the bill withholds half of the community stabilization program csp appropriation until the state department certifies that usaid is implementing the inspector generals recommendations regarding accountability finally the bill only releases its foreign operations appropriations for iraq to the extent that us funds ar matched on dollarfordollar basis by iraq exceptions are made for democracy

successes in counterinsurgency operations but the taliban continues to present considerable threat to peace and security in parts of afghanistan some experts argue that slow reconstruction corruption

retention and transferability issues the gi bill enhancements became major issue in congressional consideration of the fy2008 supplemental holding up action on the entir measure for some time in the house members of the democratic blue dog caucus initially warned that they would not support rule on the bill because the cost wa s not offset as the rules of the house required at the beginning of the 110th congress the new democratic majority agreed to changes in house rules to require that increases in mandatory spending or cuts in revenues be paid for either by cuts in ot her mandatory programs or by increases in revenues these requirements which are based on provisions initially included in the budget enforcement act of 1990 are known as pay as you go or paygo rules the house leadership subsequently agreed to support an income tax surcharge as an offset to the costs of the bill the senate however did not concur in addition the defense partment was cons istently critical of the webb and mitchell bill because of cern that it might weaken re tention of military personnel because the bill would provide full benefits to servicemembers after as little as 36 months of service
