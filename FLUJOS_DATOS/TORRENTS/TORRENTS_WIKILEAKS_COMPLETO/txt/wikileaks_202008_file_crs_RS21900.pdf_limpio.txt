classification decisions were left to military regulation1 in 1940 president franklin roosevelt issued an executive order authorizing government officials to protect information pertaining to military and naval installations2 presidents since that time have continued to set the federal governments classification standards by executive order but with one critical difference while president roosevelt cited specific statutory authority for his action later presidents have cited general statutory and constitutional authority3 the supreme court has never directly addressed the extent to which congress may constrain the executive branchs power in this area citing the presidents constitutional role as commanderin chief4 the supreme court has repeatedly stated in dicta that the presidents authority to classify and control access to information bear ing on national security flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the pr esident and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant5 this language has been interpreted by some to indicate that the president has virtually plenary authority to control classified information on the other hand the supreme court has suggested that congress could certainly provide that the executive branch adopt new classification procedures or establish its own proceduressubject only to whatever limitations the executive privilege may be held to impose on such congressional ordering6 in fact congress established separate regime in the atomic energy act for the protection of nuclearrelated restricted data7 congress has directed the president to establish procedures governing the access to classified material so that person can gain such access without having undergone background check8 1 see harold

areas of national security see eg haig v agee 453 us 280 291 1981 matters intimately related to foreign policy and national security are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention the court has

classification procedures to adhere to certain minimum standards of due process with regard to access to classified information9 these include the establishment of uniform procedures for inter alia background checks denial of access to classified information and notice of such denial10 the statute also explicitly states that the agency heads are not required to comply with the due process requirement in denying or revoking an employees security clearance where doing so could damage national security although the statute directs agency heads to submit report to the congressional intelligence committees in such case 11 with the authority to determine classification sta ndards vested in the president these standards tend to change whenever new administration takes control of the white house12 the differences between the standards of one administration and the next have often been dramatic as one congressionally authorized commission put it in 1997 the rules governing how best to protect the nations secrets while still insuring that the american public has access to information on the operations of its government past and present have shifted along with the political changes in washington over the last fifty years with the exception of the kennedy administration new executive order on classification was issued each time one of the political parties regained control of the executive branch these have often been at variance with one another at times even reversing outright the policies of the previous order 13 various congressional committees have investigated ways to bring some continuity to the classification system and to limit the president s broad powers to shield information from public examination14 in 1966 congress passed the freedom of information act foia creating presumption that government information will be open to the public unless it falls into one of foias exceptions one exception covers information that under executive order must be kept secret for national security or foreign policy reasons15 in 2000 congress enacted the public interest declassification act of 200016 which established the public interest declassification board to advise the president on matters regarding the declassification of certain information but the act expressly disclaims any intent to restrict agency heads from classifying or continuing the classification of information under their purview nor does it create any rights or remedies that may be enforced in court 17 9 50 usc 435a 10 id 11 id at 435b the house conference report that accompanied this legislation in 1994 suggests that congress understood that the line defining the boundaries of executive and legislative authority in this area is blurry at best the conferees made explicit reference to the egan case expressing their desire that the legislation not be understood to affect the presidents authority with regard to security clearances see hr rep

declassifying information were last amended in march 200318 under these current standards the president vice president agency heads and any other officials designated by the president may classify information upon determination that the unauthorized disclosure of such information could reasonably be expected to damage national security19 such information must be owned by produced by or under the control of the federal government and must concern one of the following military plans weapons systems or operations foreign government information intelligence activities intelligence sourcesmethods cryptology foreign relations or foreign activities of the united states including confidential sources scientific technological or economic matters relating to national security federal programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities vulnerabilities or capabilities of national security systems or weapons of mass destruction20 information is classified at one of three levels based on the amount of danger that its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause to national security21 information is classified as top secret if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security the standard for secret information is serious damage to national security while for confidential information the standard is damage to national security significantly for each level the original classifying officer must identify or describe the specific danger potentially presented by the informations disclosure22 the officer who originally classifies the information establishes date for declassification based upon the expected duration of the informations sensitivity if the office cannot set an earlier declassification date then the information must be marked for declassification in 10 years time or 25 years depending on the sensitivity of the information 23 the deadline for declassification can be extended if the threat to national security still exists24 classified information is required to be declassified as soon as it longer meets the standards for classification25 although there is presumption that classified information continues to meet 18 exec order 12958 as amended by exec order 13292 2003 68 fr 15315 march 28 2003 19 exec order 12958 as amended by exec order 13292 2003 11

to declassify information when the public interest in disclosure outweighs the need to protect that information26 on december 31 2006 and every year thereafter all information that has been classified for 25 years or longer and has been determined to have permanent historical value under title 44 of the us code will be automatically declassified although agency heads can exempt from this requirement classified information that continues to be sensitive in variety of specific areas27 agencies are required to review classification determinations upon request for such review that specifically identifies the materials so that the agency can locate them28 this requirement does not apply to information that has undergone declassification review in the previous two years

duties commissions appointed by the president or other entities within the executive office of the president that advise the president 30 each agency that has classified information is required to
