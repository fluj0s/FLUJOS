europeans are not matching pledges with actual disbursements and necessary dispatch whether aid pledged will go to meet actual needs is another issue of possible concern to congress both external

were based on comprehensive ontheground survey in july 1999 several international task forces began making the assessments that would lead to more realistic estimate of needs and costs the first major assessmen t july 28 1999 conducted by european commission task force focused on housing and local village infrastructure it estimated that 58 percent of the houses in 1300 villages had been damaged most of them severely the estimated cost to repair this housing is 12 billion and for other village facilities schools clinics local electricity clean water etc 439 million second more farreaching round of assessments covering energy telecommunications transport commercial and social infrastructure was conducted prior to the second donor conference held in midnovember 19992 it was prepared by the european commission ec and the world bank with the support and assistance of numerous donor organizations including groups specializing in specific sectors for example the food and agriculture organization fao focusing on damage to the agriculture sector and the european bank ebrd reviewing the state of business enterprises laying out reconstruction and development objectives in kosovo over the next four to five years the ecworld bank report estim ates the cost of reaching those object ives at 23 billion in external financing on highly concessional terms according to the european task force nearly half of the funds would be needed before early 2001 in addition government operations during this period taking into account probable local revenues are expected to suffer deficit that would have to be made up by external financing estimated at 107 million in 2000 as of march 2000 at the november 1999 donor conference donors were asked to contribute to the operational budget as well

its reconstruction program it is working with the administration in kosovo its seat is in thessaloniki greece and its operations center is in pristina the us agency for international development established mission in pristina to implement the us program of assistance us and other donor contributions although the chief focus of the july 28 1999 donor meeting was provision of shortterm mostly

more longterm reconstruction and development effort3 the november 17 conference almost entirely focusing on reconstruction and development concerns evoked slightly more than 1 billion in pledges only

kosovar life for years to come4 issues for congress us reconstruction aid levels the extent of the us role in kosovo reconstruction is still unsettled issue by virtue of its leadership in nato and its donor status the united states has significant role at this time but constraints on the amount of assistance it provides may affect its role in the future at the july 1999 donor conference the united states pledged 2776 million in nonhumanitarian urgent aid coming from fy1999 emergency supplemental appropriations pl 10631 originally approved for refugee and related relief during the war including its humanitarian assistance pledge the united states accounted for 25 of all donor pledges at the july conference at the november conference the united states pledged an additional 157 million the latter pledge reflected the limitation s placed on us assistance by congress under the fy2000 foreign operations appropriations act hr 3422 enacted by reference in pl 106113 appropriated at least 150 million for kosovo but limited the total us contribution to 15 of all other donor pledges made at the november 1999 conference in fact the 157 million was 15 of the total pledged the clinton administration position reinforced by congress was that because the united states bore the brunt of the burden for prosecuting the war the eu and its member states would be the principal contributors for reconstruction in kosovo and for most of the development assistance for southeast europe5 the 15 share of reconstruction activity imposed by congress in the fy2000 appropriations however did not coincide with the clinton administrations view of the appropriate us role the fy2000 supplemental request for 93 million in economic assistance not counting other sums for kosovorelated activities would have boosted the us share to about 22 of year 2000 pledges the clinton administration argued that these additional funds were needed to meet us objectives in the region regardless of what other donors did especially in view of the financial demands posed by the increasingly evident need for an expanded and welltrained police force in the endhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30453crs8 6 albright irked

ukraine represent 80congress approved in pl 106246 only 124 million in suppl emental funds designated solely for police activities the fy2001 appropriations language continues to limit the us contribution from seed esf and narcotics accounts to 15 of total donor pledges as of march 31 2001 the clinton and later bush administrations planned kosovo 94 million economic aid program and state department estimates of total donor contributions at 648 million would permit this amount under the 15 formula however these donor totals would be insufficient to cover an additional 55 million requested for civilian police because police costs vary considerably between countries while many countries assign police from their national forces the united states must contract usually former police for the positions the state department is figuring the us police contribution by number of police rather than expense as of march 2001 the united states had pledged 605 police out of total pledge of 4585 132 burdensharing as noted above the debate on whether aid is sufficient to meet us objectives in the region has been dominated by the question of aid proportionality in relation to other donors early in the year 2000 the slowness of european donors in turning their pledges into actual cash exacerbated this concern in january 26 2000 speech secretary of state albright took note of this problem saying it is vital that our partners join us not only in pledging generously but also in disbursing promptly6 the eu with reported history of bureaucratic delay in dispensing aid was apparently the target of these remarks it was particularly slow in providing promised 35 million in budgetary assistance which was urgently needed to pay salaries of teachers and government staff in february 2 2000 hearing of the senate armed services committee senator john warner criticized the eu on the 35 million and hammered it for not doing enough to meet the unmik request for 6000 person civilian police force he threatened to use the kosovo supplemental as vehicle to tie us assistance to the disbursement of funds by other nations the proposed warner amendment would withhold 50 of us funds for military operations in kosovo until the president certified that among other things the eu and member states had provided at least 33 of amounts committed by them for reconstruction 75 of amounts committed for the unmik budget and at least 75 of the international police force in response to criticism such as that offered by secretary albright and senator warner statement issued by leading eu officials pointed out that the eu nations provide 80 of the kfor troops and the eu provides the majority of reconstruction assistance7 with regard to the 35 million mentioned at the senate

ramifications in congress on march 22 2000 representative gilman and 19 co sponsors introduced hr 4053 the united statessoutheastern europe democratization and burdensharing act of 2000 which in part limited total us assistance to southeastern europe for fy2001 through 2005 to 15 of total donor assistance at an april 11 house international relations committee hearing chairman gilman and representat ive bereuter offered to amend the legislation to raise the limit to 18 on march 30 2000 during house debate on the fy2000 supplemental kasich amendment was offered with language identical to the proposed warner amendment it was defeated on 200219 vote however on may 17 the house approved 264 153 kasich amendment to the defense authorization hr 4205 that would end funding for the us military presence in kosovo if by april 1 2001 the president had not certified that eu eu member nations and european nato members obligated or contracted at least 50 of their 1999 and 2000 commitments for reconstruction aid 85 of humanitarian commitments 85 for the kosovo budget and 90 for police the language was removed from the enacted bill on may 18 2000 the senate rejected 5347

of their 1999 and 2000 reconstruction commitments and 75 of their humanitarian assistance commitments provided 75 of their unmik budget commitment and deployed 75 of the number of international civilian police pledged if that certification was not made by july 15 2000 those funds could be used only for withdrawal of us troops during appropriations committee markup of the bill on may 9 the condition had been approved by vote of 233 whil the clinton administration would probably have been able to make the required certifications regarding humanitarian reconstruction police and budget aid proposed in the various amendments offered during the 2000 debate see tables 3 4 and 5 for status as of end of 2000 perhaps key question when considering proportionality of aid in relation to other donors is what impact the us proportion would have on its role in multilateral decis ionmaking the presumption is that the united states would be happy to see europe lead on this issue but the consequence of smaller us financial role may be that it relinquishes desired influence over events in kosovohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30453crs10 table 3 donor contributions and disbursements to unmik

provide funds to the speci fic sectors where and when they are needed the housing and health sectors in particular have been consistently underfunded by donors the most stark and serious example of inadequate funding to date was the deficit in the 1999 administrative budget of unmik which pays salaries for civil servants teachers and policemen and provides basic government services possibly because donors prefer to provide aid in the form of technical expertise using their own nationals rather than providing funds for things like salaries insufficient funds were pledged for this purpose

system and electricity9 as noted above sufficient payments have now been made to keep unmik operating as tax revenues increase the donor role in the administrative budget is expected to decline related issue has been the lack of sufficient international civilian police to date the united nations has authorized 4718 level international police force although kouchner had requested 6000 level force and many believe even more are needed as of march 4585 had been pledged by donors and 4314 had actually been deployed although police training center was established in autumn 1999 training new kosovo local police is slow process and recruiting experienced civilian police from donor nations has not been easy implementation and corruption as reconstruction and development programs go forward there have been concerns regard ing the competency of implementation and based on the example of bosnia the possibility of corrupt use of funds during the 19992000 winter some commentators raised questions about the ability of unmik to provide adequate housing for the tens of thousands of returned kosovars and complained about the slow progress in restoring servi ces despite congestion at the macedonia border that slowed import of building materials and other problems the did achieve its housing objectives in the first year critics also noted that hundreds of criminal suspects had been released without an indictment or trial because there was still criminal justice system in place in response unmik imported international judges and prosecutors in order to jumpstart judicial process some observers have also criticized international donors for distorting the local economy by paying higher wages for agency drivers than for teachers and stifling local initiative by providing large grants to civic organizations whose management skills are weak and liable to become dependent on external donors all these criticisms must be weighed against the feasible alternatives as well as the inherent difficulties of the kosovo situation including the early failure of donors to meet budget requirements one reason for the presence of so many donor organizations is concern regarding possible corrupt use of their resources if funds were provided directly to local groups or individu als there were early allegations of missing usaid funds from one humanitarian organization with limited rule of law in place and corrupt petty bureaucrats at the local level the growth of corrupt practices in government is danger donor caution in releasing funds however means slower process when many demand speed efforts by usaid and others to create rule of law are necessary first steps to stifle an environment that breeds corruption serb ia and kosovo the extent to which policymakers recognize serbian

certain to affect future reconstruction efforts10 while resolution 1244 technically refers to an autonomous kosovo within sovereign serbia the facto result of reconstruction aid appears to have been the creation of viable self functioning entity early on this was the subject of some controversy between bernard kouchner and kofi annan the secretary general who reportedly disputed kouchners decision to recognize the german mark as the legal currency and other decisions that infringed on the sovereignty of yugoslavia11 later annan pushed the security council for some clear determination of kosovos status whatever the outcome but the allies remained reluctant to be seen endorsing separatism in europe12 the uncertainty regarding kosovos status keeps unresolved property issues that constrain administrators from selling off governmentowned utilities and establishing property rights it also discourages the foreign investment necessary to stimulate economic growth in the province while the october 2000 change of government in serbia has not altered the fact of administration of koso vo it does raise the possibility of limits to continued activity and kosovo independence and it may also be diverting potential donor funds from kosovo to the reform effort in serbia
