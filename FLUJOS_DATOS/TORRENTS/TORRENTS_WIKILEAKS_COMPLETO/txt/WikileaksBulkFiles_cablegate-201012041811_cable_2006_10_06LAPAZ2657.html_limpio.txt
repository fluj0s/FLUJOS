goldberg for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary following the september 29 death of two civilians who ambushed gob eradication operation in carrasco national park in cochabamba the embassys nas section will begin supporting gob eradication efforts in the park at the gobs request president morales started spinning the conflict october 2 publicly declaring that the two civilians killed are not cocaleros but narcotraffickers in an effort to maintain the loyalty of his cocalero base regardless of how the gob moves forward this is likely loselose situation for it given bolivians predisposition toward blaming their government for civilian deaths while morales attempts to walk the political highwire our role is to provide assistance to achieve us goals while keeping the gob out in front this event demonstrates that enforcing antidrug laws can require tough decisions that go beyond morales simplistic rhetoric about coca being harmless end summary 2 c following the september 29 death of two civilians who ambushed gob eradication operation in carrasco national park in cochabamba the embassys nas section will begin supporting gob eradication efforts in the park at the gobs request vice president alvaro garcia linera expressed gratitude for the embassys september 29 offer to assist stating that president morales had decided to begin serious eradication campaign in the park and would need us backing at garcia lineras suggestion the dcm met september 30 with defense minister walker san miguel to coordinate embassy logistical support for the gob campaign based on that meeting nasowned c130s and helicopters will begin transporting bolivian eradicators and troops october 2 san miguel told the dcm that this crisis has created an opportunity for improved milmil relations we are taking careful measures to provide only logistical support and to encourage the gob to respect human rights throughout the planned operations 3 c president morales started spinning the conflict october 2 publicly declaring that the two civilians killed are not cocaleros but narcotraffickers in an effort to maintain the loyalty of his cocalero base note in fact the civilians did not belong to the six federations of cocaleros of the chapare and therefore were not part of morales core political support end note cocaleros in carrasco national park have defiantly challenged the gob saying that they will defend their coca with blood while morales manages the public side of the conflict the gob is investigating the deaths to confirm that gob forces did not commit human rights abuses ironically forensic experts have determined that at least one of the injured was victim of cocaleros friendly fire 4 c comment regardless of how the gob moves forward this is likely loselose situation for it given bolivians predisposition toward blaming their government for civilian deaths as in october 2003 if the gob takes hard line and begins eradicating carrasco national park in earnest the backlash from morales core political base could be strong morales went to the chapare october 2 to meet with his base and we will provide readout of that meeting septel if the gob instead attempts to finesse this conflict and fails it will become vulnerable to further conflicts which it will also likely lose the final option negotiating deal which neither comes down too hard nor caves to cocalero demands is fine line that may be impossible to walk particularly since keeping the constituent assembly on track requires the gobs full attention 5 c comment continued while morales attempts to walk the political highwire our role is to provide assistance to achieve us goals while keeping the gob out in front in rare move the gob has asked for embassy logistical paz 00002657 002 of 002 assistance to move military units to begin the forceful eradication of coca well try to use opportunities that present themselves to help the gob get back onto the right track on counternarcotics including in signing new loa on future cooperation and will hold out hope that the goodwill stemming from our assistance may create an opening for increased dialogue on broader issues including democracy and milmil relations in any case this event demonstrates that enforcing antidrug laws can require tough decisions that go beyond morales simplistic rhetoric about coca being harmless end comment goldberg
