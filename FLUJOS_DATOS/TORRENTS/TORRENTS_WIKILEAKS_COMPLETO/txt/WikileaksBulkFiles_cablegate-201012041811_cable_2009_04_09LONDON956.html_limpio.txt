budget and new scandal torpedo browns poll numbers ref london 949 b london 831 c 08 london 2163 classified by polmincouns gregory berry reasons 14 b d 1 cnf key points poll numbers for pm gordon brown and his labour party have dropped following the april 22 budget presentation with an april 24 poll showing the opposition conservative party with an 18 point lead over labour if an election were held now according to these poll numbers the tories would win staggering 150seat majority in parliament the past two weeks have been wretched for brown and labour who have endured gloomy budget presentation and particularly ugly new scandal popularly known as smeargate involving top brown advisors plan to plant false rumors on the internet about senior conservative party figures even after the pm personally apologized for smeargate the media and the tories have sought to implicate more of browns close allies the scandal also may have forced brown to cancel what plan to call the next general election this spring when he had hoped to capitalize on his successful performance at the g20 summit browns attempts to close loop holes in the parliamentary second homes allowances which according to media reports many of the most senior members of browns cabinet have used for personal gain have been opposed by the conservatives and thirdparty liberal democrats one tory mp told us browns plan would allow endemic featherbedding and graft end key points labour poll numbers collapse following gloomy budget new scandal 2 sbu david cameron and the opposition conservative party have an 18 point lead in the polls over gordon brown and the labour party according to the first poll following the april 22 presentation of the budget yougov poll for the daily telegraph published april 24 found the conservatives are at 45 percent up four points from march while labour is down four points to 27 percent and the thirdparty liberal democrats are at 18 percent according to these figures if the elections were held today the tories would sweep to power with an astonishing 150seat majority in parliament more than double the 63seat majority that labour now holds sixtynine percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied with browns performance as prime minister while 56 percent said they were satisfied with camerons performance as tory leader thirtynine percent thought the conservatives would be more likely to run the economy well while only 24 percent approved of labours current handling of the economy 3 cnf the causes of this collapse in brown and labours poll numbers which had rebounded slightly following the g20 before subsiding again ref b are gloomy budget presentation by chancellor alistair darling on april 22 ref mounting media reports of mp abuse of parliamentary allowance for second homes which has engulfed brown and many members of his cabinet ref b and new and particularly ugly scandal dubbed smeargate by the media it erupted on april 10 when the media obtained leaked emails from pm special adviser damian mcbride in which mcbride attempted to launch an internet smear campaign against cameron shadow chancellor george osborne osbornes wife frances mp nadine dorries and another unnamed tory mp the smears themselves which have been described in salacious detail on the internet were more delicately described in the april 14 guardian as including rumors involving the wife of the shadow chancellor the health of cameron the personal relations of mp nadine dorries and accusations that tory mp was promoting his partners business interests in the commons 4 cnf mcbride resigned on april 11 claiming that he had merely written up list of stories doing the rounds in westminster and that he had never actually intended them to be published unpopular within the labour party according to our contacts and particularly unpleasant person based on our own experiences with him mcbride was one of browns closest advisors having followed him to 10 downing street from the treasury brown disclaimed all knowledge of mcbrides antics but critics were quick to point out mcbrides close relationship to brown and that mcbride had used his 10 email account to send the smear rumors in any case they argued pm brown holds final responsibility london 00000956 002 of 003 for any such tactics coming out of 10 after private written apologies to the parties concerned didnt work brown apologized personally for smeargate on april 17 nonetheless his poll numbers dropped with 37 percent of voters in an april 19 poll by news of the world saying they found labour less trustworthy than before smeargate broke the media sought to implicate more members of browns inner circle including education secretary ed balls who was forced to deny that he runs smear unit inside downing street former labour mp alice mahon resigned from the labour party april 18 telling the press i can longer be member of party that at the leadership level has betrayed many of the values and principles that inspired as teenager to join although mahon maintained low profile during her tenure in parliament her resignation was head line news and unison publicsector union representing 13 million workers announced publicly that it would withhold gbp 18 million in annual dues to the labour party onetenth of labours yearly funding if brown didnt put stop to smear tactics smeargate wrecks gordon browns plans for early elections 5 cnf perhaps most damaging of all however smeargate effectively ended what may have been browns plan to call general election this spring based on the rise in the polls he received following his solid performance at the g20 labour prospective parliamentary candidate for burton ruth smeeth strictly protect told us april 20 that brown had intended to announce the elections on may 12 and hold them after very short matter of weeks campaign season labour had been just 7 points behind the conservatives in some polls taken right after the g20 summit which other labour contacts had told us was close to an acceptable standing from which to launch campaign but the drop in labours poll numbers following smeargate forced brown to abandon his plan despondent smeeth said note this information has not been reported in the press end note opposition parties oppose plans to abolish second homes allowance 6 sbu at the same time as the budget and smeargate dominated the headlines brown and labour were continuing to take media fire over the controversial second homes allowance which is designed to cover the costs that mps incur by maintaining home in their constituencies as well as residence in london in recent weeks the media has highlighted attempts by prominent government ministers to maximize their claims against this allowance in ways that while not strictly illegal amount to bilking the tax payer the politicians in the uk snared in the public outrage over the practice include chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling home secretary jacqui smith and even brown himself talks among party leaders on the pms plans to abolish the second homes allowance and replace it with daily attendance allowance was rejected by both the tories and the lib dems however during tense and heated meeting april 22 that broke down after 40 minutes tory mp keith simpson strictly protect told us april 23 that the conservatives at first thought they would have option but to back the proposed reforms or face criticism from labour once the tories understood however that the public perceived the proposal for daily allowance as copy of the system used for european parliamentarians system which he described as allowing endemic featherbedding and graft in brussels the tory leadership decided it was politically acceptable to attack the reform proposals simpson told us that the inability of the brown government to achieve crossparty support for the reforms is sign of how listless and ineffective this government has become because this kind of reform is something any effective government could have been able to nail down long before going public with it comment 7 cnf while the media has begun to trot out the usual pundits who claim that brown cant last until the next election as we have reported there is virtually chance either that he will step down voluntarily or that an alternative leader will step forward to challenge him not only is replacing sitting labour leader an arduous task procedurally ref c but we assess it unlikely that any labour politician with his or her eye on the future would want to take on the sinking ship that is the current labour party at this time of crisis it is more likely that labour will go down in the next election and then will begin the london
