mohammed bin naif assistant minister of interior classified by ambassador james b smith for reasons 14 b d summary 1 s summary during 30minute meeting with prince mohammed general jones reviewed us and saudi efforts to combat alqaida extremists in the region and discussed afghanistanpakistan yemen and iran prince mohammed highlighted saudi arabias continued and growing concerns about alqaida operations originating from yemen and praised the yemeni governments successful december attacks against alqaida operatives the meeting was followed by lunch and briefing on the situation on the saudiyemeni border we must keep alqaida on the run 2 s general jones noted that the attempted bombing of us aircraft on december 25 is another reminder that we are passing through difficult times he assured prince mohammed that while the us recognizes that screening procedures can be improved the us has confidence that the systems in place are basically sound the general also noted that terrorism concerns seem to be spreading beyond afghanistan pakistan yemen and somalia and now are being heard from governments in north africa particularly niger mali morocco and algeria 3 s prince mohammed responded that we are likely to see many more attempts like the december 25 incident he also noted that the saudi experience against alqaida demonstrates that the best response is to keep them on the run right after the 911 attacks he noted nearly eighty percent of the mosques in saudi arabia voiced support for bin laden that is when the saudi leadership realized how dire the problem they faced was over the last 6 years of combating alqaida inside saudi arabia the kingdom has foiled many alqaida plots and in the process learned that we must not only to fight alqaida in the field but also to counter their ideology in order to curtail recruitment 4 snf in this light the recent attack against alqaida in yemen was very positive prince mohammed noted that the saudis have been monitoring conversations of alqaida operatives in yemen very closely and whereas before the attack they were hearing relaxed 20minute phone conversations over cell phones after the attack the phones went virtually silent this suggests that at least for now these operatives are more focused on their own security rather than on planning operations saudi concerns on yemen 5 s prince mohammed said that the saudi government has been watching with great concern alqaidas growth in yemen over the last five years yemens geography makes it much more convenient place for alqaida operations not only does the mountainous terrain help them hide but the shoreline also gives them an ability to move over the water extending their potential reach much further abroad 6 c one of alqaidas objectives in its confrontation with saudi arabia prince mohammed explained is to control mecca and medina he said that they want to be able to control who makes the hajj and if they were able to do so they would limit the visits of those coming to the hajj to one week something that could cause chaos embassy note among alqaidas basic objectives is its call to liberate the islamic holy sites from the corrupt hands of the saud but this is the first time we have heard saudi official point out the more specific goal of limiting how long muslims can visit the holy places as part of their hajj end note 7 c prince mohammed also noted that saudi arabia has been making an effort to seal the saudiyemen border noting that we have been arresting between one to two thousand people each day he also admitted that the saudis have maintained common practice of feeding those caught crossing before transporting them back across the border we need to change that he went on since many may be crossing the border only to get meal prince mohammed pointed out that key feature of the saudi approach to undermine alqaidas growth in yemen is to bolster the central government in particular with substantial financial assistance saudiyemeni council meets twice year to review development projects in yemen funded by saudi arabia however up to now he reported the saudis have not been satisfied with the distribution of these development and infrastructure projects because the yemeni government has been concentrating them in sanaa and other urban areas the saudis now insist on having say in distributing these infrastructure investments with remote areas receiving priority to give the tribes in those areas something to lose if they cooperate with terrorists afghanistanpakistan 8 c general jones noted that the obama administrations approach in pakistan and afghanistan reflects many of the same lessons that the saudis have learned that is why the us is working with new emphasis on national reunification in afghanistan the approach includes reducing the emphasis on military operations while exerting new efforts to encourage reconciliation in order for this strategy to succeed gen jones cautioned it will be essential that pakistani territory longer be available as safehaven to terrorists 9 c prince mohammed commented that pakistan must let people know that it is fighting war to keep pakistan united and its people safe but if we want one hundred percent from them he cautioned we should make them feel more secure on their border with india he also noted that king abdullah has concerns about the pakistani government the biggest problem is the army general kayani army chief of staff is good man i asked him prince mohammed recounted whether or not his soldiers when they visit their villages wear their uniforms or if they changed into civilian clothes he told that they change to civilian clothes 10 c general jones assured prince mohammed that the us is working to reduce pakistaniindian tensions and emphasized that what is most needed at this moment is for pakistan to choose which path it wants to take the first step is to dislodge the terrorists if pakistan resolves to do this they will find that the us will help them for some time to come the pakistani isi also needs to act with greater consistency noting saudi arabias influence with pakistan general jones emphasized that the us is looking for saudi arabias support next phase with iran 10 c general jones described the administrations current thinking on iran noting that iran has failed to enter into serious dialogue with the international community about its nuclear program with the deadline of the end of the year now passed it is time to start looking at sanctions prince mohammed said saudi arabia remains greatly concerned about irans nuclear program and noted that there is now big crack in the iranian government particularly following the recent attack on karroubi embassy note opposition leader mehdi karroubis car was fired upon on january 9 an attack that oppositionist attribute to irans revolutionary guard end note high marks for ussaudi counterterrorism cooperation 11 c general jones asked prince mohammed if there was anything needed from the us to improve our counterterrorism coordination prince mohammed responded that king abdullah has made very clear that ussaudi security cooperation must remain independent of political buffeting he said that our cooperation is very good and has developed to the point that the us and saudi arabia are in simultaneous mode regarding the sharing of raw data and threat information gen jones remarked that prince mohammed has played an important role in bringing about this strong security relationship and conveyed president obamas appreciation for this strong partnership comment 12 s we note that prince mohammed did not raise the matter of recently introduced heightened screening procedures on saudi citizens while we have heard that these new measures provoked strong reactions from some in the saudi leadership the absence of any expressions of concern or upset on prince mohammed part is fully in keeping with his reputation as one who fully understands the difficulty of maneuvering against extremist elements to prevent attacks the embassy views this meeting as accomplishing the important objective of reinforcing our strong counterterrorism cooperation as is evident from his brief responses to gen jones briefs on iran and afghanistanpakistan these issues are ones on which prince mohammed carefully defers to the king
