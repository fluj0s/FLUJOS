is provided at the end of this report and can also be found in us congress congressional record 107th congress 1st session october 1 2001 pp s9949s9951daily editionin the days immediately after the september 11 attacks the president consulted with the leaders of congress on appropriate steps to take to deal with the situation confronting the united states these discussions produced the concept of joint resolution of the congress authorizing the president to take military steps to deal with the parties responsible for the attacks on the united states the leaders of the senate and the house decided at the outset that the discussions and negotiations with the president and white house officials over the specifi c language of the joint re solution would be conducted by them and not through the formal committee legislation review process2 consequently formal reports on this legislation were made by any committee of either the house or the senate as result it is necessary to rely on the text s of the original draft proposal by the president for use of military force resolution and the final bill sjres 23 as enacted together with the public statements of those involved in drafting the bill to construct the legislative hist ory of this statute betw een september 12 and 14 2001 draft language of joint resoluti on was discussed and negotiated by the white house counsels office and the senate and house leaders of both parties other members of both houses of congress suggested language for consider ation through their respective party leaders3 on wednesday september 12 2001 the white house gave draft joint resolution to the leaders of the senate and the house this white house draf t legislation if it had been enacted would have authorized the president 1 to take military action against those involved in some notable way with the ptember 11 attacks on the us but it also would have granted him 2 statutory authority to deter and preempt any future acts of terrorism or aggression against the united states4 this language would have seemingly authorized the president without durationa l limitation and at his so discretion to take military action against any nation terrorist group or individuals in the world without having to seek further authority from the cong ress it would have granted the president openended authority to act ag ainst all terrorism and terrorists or potential aggressors against the united states anywhere not just the authority to act against the terrorists involved in the september 11 2001 attacks nd those nations organizations and personshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22357crs3 5 in december 23 2005 oped article former senate majority leader thomas daschle dsd stated that literally minutes before the senate cast its vote on sjres 23 the administration sought to add the words in the united states and after appropriate force in the agreed upon text of the bill senator daschle wrote that this change would have given the president broad authority to exercise expansive powers not just overseas where we all understood he wanted authority to act but right here in the united states potentially against american citizens senator daschle stated that he refused to accede to this request tom daschle power we didnt grant washington post december 23 2005 p a21 th is account is not reflected in the official record of the legislative debate on sj res 23 6 pl 10740 115 stat 224 2001 sjres 23who had aided or harbored the terrorists as consequence this portion of the language in the proposed white house draft resolution was strongly opposed by key legislators in congress and was not included in the final ve rsion of the legislation that was passed the floor debates in the sena and house on sjres 23 make clear that the focus of the military force legislation was on the extent of the authorization that congress would provide to the president for use of us military force against the international terrorists who attacked the us on sept ember 11 2 001and those who directly and materially assisted them in carrying out their actions the language of the enacted legislation on its face makes clear especia lly in contrast to the white houses draft joint resolution of september 12 2001 th degree to which congress limited the scope of the presidents authorization to use u s military force through pl 10740 to military actions against only those international terro rists and other partie s directly involved in aiding or materially supporting the septem ber 11 2001 attacks on the united states the authorization was not framed in terms of use of military action against terrorists generally on friday september 14 2001 after the c onclusion of the meetings of their respective party caucuses from 915 am to 10 15 am where the final text of the draft bill was discussed sj res 23 jointly sponsor ed by senators thomas daschle and trent lott the senate majority and minority leaders respectively was called up for quick consideration under the terms of unanimous consent agreement sjres 23 was then considered and passed by th senate by vote of 9805 as part of the senates unanimous consent agreement that set the st age for the rapid consideration and vote on sjres 23 the senate agreed to adjourn nd to have additiona l votes until after the following wednesday that action effectively meant that if the house amended sjres 23 further legislative action on it would ccur until the middle of the following week after the house of representatives received sjres 23 from the senate on friday september 14 2001 the house passe d it late that evening af ter several hour s of debate by vote of 4201 clearing it for the president prior to passing sjres 23 the house considered and then tabled an identically worded joint resolution hjres 64 and rejected motion to recommit by rep john tier ney dmass that would have had the effect if passed and enacted of requiring report from the president on his actions under the joint resolution every 60 days after it entered into force sjres 23 formally titled in section 1 as the authorization for use of military force was thus passed by congress on ptember 14 2001 and was signed into law by the president on september 18 20016 the enacted bill contains five whereas clauses in its preamble expressing opinions regardin g why the joint resolution is necessary fourhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22357crs4 7 the united states supreme court has ruled di rectly on the distinction between language in the preamble of legislative act and in the act itself chief justice melville fuller writing an opinion for unanimous us supr eme court stated but as the preamble is part of the act and cannot enlarge or confer pow ers nor control the words of the act unless they are doubtful or ambiguous the necessity of resorting to it to ssist in ascertaining the true intent and meaning of the legislature is in itself fatal to the claim set up yazoo and

authorizations of use of military force historical background and legal implications by david m ackerman and richard f grimmett of these are identical to the whereas clauses contained in the white house draft joint resolution of september 12 2001 the fifth wh ich was not in the original white house draft reads as follows whereas the pr esident has authority under the c onstitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the united states this statement and all of the ot her whereas clauses in pl 10740 are not part of the language after the resolving clause of the act and as such it is not clear how court would treat such provisions in interpretin g the scope of the authority granted in the law7 section 2a of the joint resolution author izes the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organi zations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons the joint resolution further states in section 2b1 congressional intent that it constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution finally section 2 b2 of the joint resolution states that nothing in this resolution supercedes an requirement of the war powers resolution notable feature of sjres 23 is that unlike all other major legislation authorizing the use of military force by the president this joint resolution authorizes military force against organizations and persons linke d to the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states in its past authorizations for use of us military force congress has permitted action against unnamed nations in specific regi ons of the world or against named individual nations but never against org anizations or persons the authorization of use of force against unnamed nations is cons istent with some previous instances where authority was given to act against unnamed st ates when they becam aggressors or took military action against the united states or its citizens8 president george w bush in signing sjres 23 into law on september 18 2001 noted the congress had acted wisely decisi vely and in the finest traditions of our country he thanked the leadership of both houses for their role in expeditiously passing this historic joint resolution he noted that he had had the benefit of meaningful consultations with members of the congress since the september 11 attacks and that he would continue to consult closely with them as our nation responds to this threat to our peace and security

the constitutiona lity of the war powers resolution9 it is important to note here that presidents frequently sign bills into law that contain provisions or language with which they disa gree presidents sometimes draw attention to these disagreements in formal statement at the time they sign bill into law while presidential signing statements may indicate that the president views certain provisions to be unconstitutional they do not themselves have the force of law nor do they modify the language of the enacted st atute should the president strongly object to the language of any bill presented to him he has the option to veto it and compel the congress to enact it through voting to override his veto once bill is enacted into law however every president in accordance with article ii sec tion 3 of the us constitution is obligated to take care that the laws be faithfully ex ecuted thus unless its current language is changed through enactment of new statute that amends it or its effect is modified by opinions of the federal courts the authoriz ation for use of milita ry force statute pl 10740 retains the legal force it has had since its enactment on september 18 2001 text of
