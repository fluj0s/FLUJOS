library of congress colas for military retirees summary of congressional and executive branch action 19822004 fy1983fy2005 summary the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 which applied to fy1983 budget issues suspended previously existing permanent law pertaining to costofliving adjustments colas for federal civilian and military retirees and changed the cola calculation formulas to postpone andor reduce future colas for military retirees during 19831985 fy1984fy1986 although the cola situation during 1983 fy1984 remained unchanged despite some proposals to modify the 1982 legislation so as to further reduce colas the period from 1984 the fy1985 budget to 1986 the fy1987 budget was marked by intense debate over reducing colas and an actual elimination of the 1986 fy1987 cola reagan administration budget proposals in both 1987 fy1988 and 1988 fy1989 did not propose any changes in military retirement cola provisions contained in permanent law major change from the previous several years neither did any such changes take place as result of congressional action the original bush administration budgets in both 1989 fy1990 and 1990 fy1991 proposed canceling the colas scheduled for january 1 1990 and january 1 1991 respectively and reducing future colas however none of these proposals were eventually enacted into law the bush administration budgets in 1991 fy1992 and 1992 fy1993 did not include any proposals for reducing colas and such proposals were acted on by the congress the clinton administrations budgets for 19931999 fy19942000 did not include any proposals for reducing colas although cola reduction proposals were considered by the congress during some of these years some were enacted in each of the years 19931995 fy19941996 providing that in each of those years disabled military retirees and survivor benefit recipients were first paid their cola on january 1 nondisabled military retirees first received their colas on april 1 however the fy1997fy2005 budgets enacted in 19962004 respectively contained changes in the cola formula hence the fy1997fy2005 military retirement colas were first paid on january 1 of each of those years respectively to all classes of military retirees these nine years are the longest period since military retirement colas were first authorized in 1963 in which legislative changes in the cola mechanism have been made the seven years fy1999fy2005 calendar years 19982004 are the longest period in which cola cuts have even been proposed let alone enacted contents background the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 fy1983 1

background the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 fy1983 the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 pl 97253 september 8 1982 suspended previously existing permanent law pertaining to costofliving adjustments colas for federal civilian and military retirees much of the legislative and executive branch activity related to military retirement colas since 1983 has involved efforts to repeal or extend provisions of this legislation prior to enactment of the 1982 act military retirement colas had been paid on an annual basis effective on march 1 of each year and based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi of december of the preceding year over that of the december before that for example the 87 cola effective march 1 1982 was based on the percentage increase in the cpi of december 1981 over that of december 1980 the 1982 act provided that colas for fy1983 fy1984 and fy1985 would be effective on april 1 1983 may 1 1984 and june 1 1985 respectively it also provided for the colas of nondisabled military retirees under age 62 to be calculated according to different formula designed to lower them relative to those of all other military retirees cola of 33 was accordingly paid to nondisabled military retirees under 62 and 39 cola was paid to all other military retirees effective april 1 1983 in addition the 1982 act required deductions equal to the colas in their military retired pay from the pay of most federal civil servants who had previously retired from the military this report examines executive and congressional colarelated initiatives associated with each of the fiscal year budgeting processes from calendar year 1982 fy1983 through calendar year 2000 fy2001 fy1984 1983 cola actions the cola situation for military retirees remained unchanged during fy1984 legislative activity that which took place during calendar year 1983 despite efforts from the administration and in the congress crs2 the reagan administrations budget request for fy1984 submitted to the congress in early 1983 contained several measures related to military retirement colas the administration proposed to cancel the fy1984 cola scheduled for may 1 1984 the fy1983 april 1 1983 and fy1985 june 1 1985 colas would occur as mandated by the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 beginning in fy1986 limit colas for nondisabled retirees under age 62 to onehalf of the actual percentage increase in the cpi frequently referred to as halfcola or diet cola nondisabled retirees 62 or older retirees receiving disability retired pay and survivor annuitants would continue to receive full colas the first concurrent resolution on the fy1984 budget hconres 91 approved by the house and senate on june 23 1983 assumed that the effective date of the fy1984 cola would be delayed until december 1 1984 with all subsequent annual colas also effective on december 1 this would have had the effect of canceling the fy1984 cola while advancing the effective date of the fy1985 cola by seven months however congress adjourned on november 18 1983 without enacting the proposed changes in substantive authorizing legislation the cola situation therefore remained as enacted in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 under which the next military retirement cola was to be effective on may 1 1984 two other colarelated legislative proposals in 1983 received substantial attention but were not passed by the congress 1 the administration proposal to institute permanent halfcola for nondisabled military retirees under 62 and 2 provision of the senate version of the fy1984 reconciliation bill that would have repealed the requirement instituted in the 1982 act that most federally employed military retirees have an amount equal to the cola they received be deducted from their civil service salaries fy1985 1984 cola actions in fy1985 legislative action calendar year 1984 the cola provisions in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 were largely negated the reagan administrations fy1985 budget request submitted in early 1984 contained several measures related to military retirement colas the admini stration proposed to repeal the provisions of the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 1 authorizing colas effective may 1 1984 and june 1 1985 and 2 providing for the colas of nondisabled retirees under age 62 to be calculated on different basis from all other retirees colas permanently shift the payment date for federal civilian and military retirement colas to january 1 of each year beginning with january 1 1985 this proposal in conjunction with that described in the crs3 preceding paragraph would therefore have resulted in cola being paid between april 1 1983 and january 1 1985 at the same time the period of time over which the cpi was measured to determine the extent of the cola increase would have been modified to reflect the increase in the average cpi between the third quarters of successive years ie the cola paid to federal retirees on january 1 1985 would be based on the percentage increase in the average cpi for the period juneseptember 1984 over the average for juneseptember 1983 the omnibus reconciliation act of 1983 pl 98270 april 18 1984 was the legislative vehicle for these proposals and therefore for practical purposes repealed comparable provisions of the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 july 18 1984 repealed the provisions of the 1982 act which required most military retirees working for the federal government to forfeit their military retired pay colas it also changed the technical payment date for military retired pay checks or electronic fund transfers from the last business date of the current month ie the 30th or 31st of most months to the first business day of the next month by pushing the twelfth monthly military retirement payment for fy1985 from september 30 to october 1 1985 the first day of fy1986 this provision provided onetime paper savings in fy1985 of 16 billion in military retirement outlays the second supplemental appropriation act for fy1984 pl 98396 august 22 1984 had the practical effect of negating the provision of the 1982 act which would have provided nondisabled military retirees under 62 smaller cola on january 1 1985 than those granted all other military retirees thus on january 1 1985 all military retirees received 35 cola fy1986 19851986 cola actions the reagan administrations fy1986 department of defense dod budget proposed to eliminate the military retired pay cola scheduled for january 1 1986 there would thus have been cola between that paid on january 1 1985 and that scheduled for january 1 1987 under existing law the final concurrent resolution on the budget sconres 32 approved by both the house and the senate on august 1 1985 rejected the administrations recommendation to cancel the fy1986 cola indicating initially that it would be paid as permanent law provided on january 1 1986 however the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 also known as the grammrudmanhollings grh act pl 99177 december 12 1985 provided that payment of the fy1986 cola was to be at least temporarily suspended until other provisions of the grh act took effect earlier than march 1 1986 specifically subsection 252a6c of grh provided that the amounts that would otherwise be expended during this period for colas would be withheld payment of the fy1986 cola was accordingly suspended between january 1 1986 crs4 and march 1 1986 the president according to other provisions of grh then determined that payment of the fy1986 cola had to be completely eliminated to assist in reducing the fy1986 federal deficit it was therefore permanently canceled on july 7 1986 the supreme court held that the automatic spending provisions of grh were unconstitutional however the court stayed the effects of its decision for 60 days to give the congress and the president time to enact the fy1986 grhmandated budget cuts into effect through the regular pregrh legislative process if it so desired on july 31 1986 the president signed pl 99366 which ratified and affirmed the fy1986 grh budget cuts including the fy1986 cola cancellation fy1987 1986 cola actions the reagan administrations fy1987 dod budget proposed to eliminate the military retired pay cola scheduled for january 1 1987 if accepted this proposal would have meant that there would have been cola between that paid on january 1 1985 and the one scheduled under permanent law for january 1 1988 the final concurrent resolution on the fy1987 budget sconres 120 passed both house and senate on june 26 1986 assumed that full military retirement colas would be paid in fy1987 on the basis of permanent law the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 sec 7001 title vii pl 99509 october 21 1986 also provided that full colas would be paid according to permanent law in calendar years 1987 through 1991 inclusive to military retirees and retirees covered by other federal retirement programs as well if grhmandated spending cuts occur because grhmandated spending cuts did not take place for the fy1987 budget however this latter provision of law was not required to guarantee the payment of military retirement cola for fy1987 accordingly based on the percentage increase in the average consumer price index for the third quarter of 1986 over the average cpi for the third quarter of 1985 military retirees received 13 cola on january 1 1987 fy1988 1987 and fy1989 1988 cola actions the reagan administrations fy1988 and fy1989 dod budgets did not propose any changes in military retirement cola provisions contained in permanent law as this report indicates this was major change from previous years reagan administration dod budget requests from 1983 fy1984 through 1986 fy1987 all contained colarelated proposals which usually had the aim of postponing or eliminating colas to save money the congress also did not enact any restrictions on colas in 1987 and 1988 as part of its consideration of the fy1988 and fy1989 budgets the house budget committee full house senate budget committee full senate and final versions of the concurrent resolutions on the fy1988 and fy1989 budgets all assumed the payment of full colas in fy1988 in accordance with permanent law in addition crs5 the 1987 amendments to the grammrudmanhollings grh deficit reduction process pl 100119 september 29 1987 provided for the exclusion of military retirement colas from any automatic sequestrations acrosstheboard budget reductions resulting from grh this contrasts with the original grh act which as noted above on page 3 canceled the fy1986 military retirement cola originally scheduled for payment on january 1 1986 and would have allowed cancellation of future colas under certain circumstances finally other legislation enacted in 1987 and 1988 affected the operation of the permanentlaw cola formula accordingly based on the percentage increase in the average consumer price index for the third quarter of calendar year 1987 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1986 military retirees received 42 cola on january 1 1988 based on the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1988 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1987 military retirees received 40 cola on january 1 1989 fy1990 1989 cola actions the original fy1990 budget of the incoming bush administration and that of the outgoing reagan administration unlike the budgets the reagan administration submitted for fy1988 1987 and fy1989 1988 but very much like those the reagan administration did submit for fy1984 1983 through fy1987 1986 did propose reducing military retirement colas the bush administrations cola reduction program had two components first it proposed to cancel the cola that would be paid on january 1 1990 second through at least 1994 all military retirees not just those who first entered military service after august 1 1986 as provided for in the military retirement reform act of 1986 would beginning with the january 1 1991 cola have their cola calculated on the basis of one percentage point below the actual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price indexrelated formula described above however the bipartisan budget agreement reached between congress and president bush in the spring of 1989 assumed that colas would be paid to military retirees based on permanent law although there were explicit statements to that effect stated in the documents associated with the agreement savings from cola cancellations were included in the budgetary calculations released to the public as part of the agreement the bush administration thus implicitly abandoned the idea of proposing cola reductions for either fy1990 or later fiscal years in addition the house senate and final versions of the fy1990 concurrent resolution on the budget all assumed the payment of full colas in accordance with permanent law finally the various statutes described above which prevented sequestration under grh from affecting military retirement and other federal retirement colas remained in effect based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula therefore the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1989 crs6 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1988 military retirees received 47 cola on january 1 1990 fy1991 1990 cola actions the original fy1991 budget of the bush administration submitted in early 1990 proposed military retirement cola reductions identical in nature to those the administration had proposed year earlier for fy1990 the fy1991 cola reduction proposal of the administration had two components first it proposed to cancel the cola that would be paid on january 1 1991 second through at least 1995 fy1995 all military retirees not just those who first entered military service after august 1 1986 as provided for in the military retirement reform act of 19861 would beginning with the january 1 1992 cola have their cola calculated on the basis of one percentage point below the actual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price indexrelated formula described above in addition to the administrations cola reduction proposal it was reported that the ongoing budget summit negotiations between the congressional leadership and the administration during augustoctober 1990 considered reductions in cola benefits similar but deeper than those proposed by the administration these reductions allegedly included the following elements 1 canceling the fy1991 cola scheduled for payment on january 1 1991 2 limiting colas in fy1992 and thereafter to the cpi minus one percentage point for military retirees age 62 and over 3 providing colas for military retirees under age 62 and 4 restoring the purchasing power of under62 retirees with onetime recomputation of their retired pay after the onetime recomputation the purchasing power of retirees over age 62 would however still decline due to their future colas being determined on the basis of the cpiminus one formula2 however the final budget agreement reached by the congressional leadership and the administration in late october 1990 included such cola reductions the house senate and final versions of the fy1991 concurrent resolution on the budget all assumed the payment of full colas in accordance with permanent law finally the various statutes described above which prevented sequestration under grh from affecting military retirement and other federal retirement colas remained in effect based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula therefore the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1990 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1989 military retirees received 54 cola on january 1 1991 1 ibid 2 see for example rick maze 41 pay raise called clearly dead 35 in doubt army times sept 24 1990 3 retirees cry foul over suggested cola cuts army times oct 1 1990 10 and cheney fights for cola army times oct 8 1990 4 crs7 fy1992 1991 and fy1993 1992 cola actions the original fy1992 and fy1993 budgets of the bush administration submitted in early 1991 and 1992 respectively proposed military retirement cola reductions the house senate and final versions of the fy1992 concurrent resolution on the budget all assumed the payment of full colas in accordance with permanent law the various statutes described above which prevented sequestration under grh from affecting military retirement and other federal retirement colas remained in effect in fy1992 and fy1993 the bush administration did propose as part of its fy1993 budget to allow military retirement colas to be subject to grh budget sequestration if one took place but congress took action on this proposal and it was not enacted based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1991 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1990 military retirees received 37 cola on january 1 1992 similarly based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula in this case the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1992 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1991 military retirees received 30 cola on january 1 1993 fy1994 1993 cola actions summary after year of complex and lengthy debates on military retirement colas 1993 ended with the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 providing that military retirees received 26 cola on either april 1 1994 nondisabled retirees or january 1 1994 disability retirees and survivor benefit recipients administration proposals the clinton administration fy1994 budget did not propose curtailing military retirement colas fy1994 congressional budget resolution the fy1994 budget resolution embodied in its budgetary assumptions certain restrictions on colas however as with all such assumptions these were not binding house version of the fy1994 budget resolution the following assumptions regarding military retirement colas were contained in the house version crs8 1 all military retirees would have had their colas capped at 400 for fy1994 that cola to be first paid on january 1 1994 2 current retirees under age 62 would have had their colas computed on the basis of 50 of the actual inflation rate when retiree reached age 62 there would have been onetime recomputation of his or her annuity to make up for the lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to 50 of the inflation rate this would have been permanent change in the cola formula for under62 military retirees survivor benefit recipients would have been excluded from this change and 3 current retirees 62 or older would have had their colas computed on the basis of one percentage point below the actual inflation rate but only for fiscal years 19951997 senate version of the fy1994 budget resolution the senate version embodied cola restrictions in its policy assumptions final fy1994 budget resolution as enacted the final budget resolution embodied the following cola restrictions in its policy assumptions 1 current retirees under age 62 not all retirees as would have been the case in the assumptions embodied in the house version would have had their colas capped at 400 for fy1994 that cola to be first paid on january 1 1994 2 current retirees under age 62 would have had their colas computed on the basis of 50 of the actual inflation rate when retiree reached age 62 there would have been onetime recomputation of his or her annuity to make up for the lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to 50 of the inflation rate this would have been permanent change in the cola formula for under62 military retirees this was identical to 2 of the house version as noted above omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 fy1994 reconciliation legislation table 1 itemizes congressional action on military retirement colas in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 in all versions military survivor benefit plan beneficiaries and military disability retirees are excluded note that this legislation changed the dates of colas not the cola computation formulas the final bills action on federal civil service retirement colas is included for comparative purposes as the table indicates civil service retirement colas were to have been reduced less than military retirement colas crs9 table 1 military and civil service retirement colas in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 date cola paid 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 house 050194 080195 110196 none 020198 050199 senate 100194 100195 100196 100197 090198 010199 military 040194 100195 100196

retirement colas after action on the omnibus budget reconciliation act of fy1994 reconciliation legislation was complete many military retirees questioned why the legislation provided that military retirement colas would be paid later than civil service retiree colas in fy19951998 the reasons are complex and relate to the congressional budget process as noted above the fy1994 congressional budget resolution included retirement spending reductions based on the policy assumption of limiting civilian and military retirement colas to onehalf the rate of inflation for retirees under age 62 up to maximum cola in 1994 of 400 this generated larger estimated savings in military than in civil service retirement because there are more military than civil service retirees under age 62 in 1992 about 55 of military retirees were under 62 compared to about 15 of civil service retirees the budget resolution is the vehicle through which the congressional budget committees annually provide instructions regarding budget targets to the authorizing committees the authorizing committees responsible for the military retirement program are the house and senate armed services committees civil service retirement is the responsibility of the house post office and civil service committee and the senate governmental affairs committee savings in the form of reductions to ongoing programs are enacted in reconciliation legislation drafted in the authorizing committees budget resolutions do not contain binding programmatic changes required to achieve specified savings but the dollar amounts of savings are based on policy assumptions made by the budget committees the final programmatic changes must be made by the authorizing committees the authorizing committees responsible for the military and civilian retirement programs did not adopt the policy assumptions underlying the budget resolution proposal to pay half colas to retirees under age 62 nevertheless they were required to save the same amount of money that proposal would have saved thus crs10 when the committees decided that delaying the date on which colas are paid was more acceptable than differentiating colas on the basis of age it was necessary to include longer delay for military retirees in the years after fy1994 than for civilian retirees because of the requirement for greater savings from the military program nevertheless the armed services committees agreed to protect from delay colas to groups they perceived as more financially vulnerable namely military disability retirees and survivors 1993 congressional cola reduction proposals not enacted pennykasich on october 27 1993 bipartisan group of house members led by representatives penny and kasich proposed package of federal budget cuts as an alternative to budget cutting proposal advanced the previous day by president clinton initially the pennykasich proposal would have denied colas to all military retirees under age 62 beginning with fy1994 it was later modified to deny colas to under62 retirees who first entered military service on or after january 1 1994 ie the proposal was fully grandfathered for practical purposes therefore the final pennykasich proposal which was proposed as an amendment to hr 3400 103rd congress and was defeated in the house on november 22 1993 would not have affected any retirees until january 1 2014 when the first military members affected would have completed 20 years of service and become eligible for immediate nondisability retirement senate proposal november 1993 on november 10 1993 bipartisan group headed by senator bob kerrey released budget cutting proposal broadly similar to pennykasich it called for cutting the fy1994 cola in half from 26 to 13 and exactly like the final version of pennykasich denying all colas to under62 retirees who first entered military service on or after january 1 1994 this proposal was never introduced as senate bill borendanforth proposal may 1993 another cola reduction scheme never actually embodied in bill was proposed by senators boren and danforth as part of another bipartisan deficit reduction effort released on may 20 1993 this plan would have paid full colas on only the first 600 monthly of military retired pay federal civil service retired pay and social security retirement under this proposal which would have been in effect during fy19941998 colas on military retired pay above 600 monthly would have been limited to two percentage points below the cpi increase as determined in accordance with the permanent cola formula for example assume the cola was computed to be 4 for particular year retiree receiving 1000 monthly in retired pay would have had the full cola of 4 paid on the first 600 monthly of his retired pay but only 2 cola paid on the remaining 400 monthly the borendanforth proposal did not exempt disability retirement and survivor benefits from its provisions crs11 fy1995 1994 cola actions summary after legislative activity even more intricate than in 1993 the 2nd session 103rd congress ended with the fy1995 national defense authorization act and the fy1995 dod appropriations act providing that military retirees received 28 cola on april 1 1995 nondisability retirees or january 1 1995 disability retirees and survivor benefit recipients administration proposals the fy1995 budget of the clinton administration released in february 1994 did not propose cutting military retirement colas fy1995 congressional budget resolution the final version of the fy1995 budget resolution approved in early may 1994 included cuts in military retirement colas neither did the house and senate versions both approved during march 1994 an attempt to eliminate military and civil service retirement colas

were made specifically for this purpose the house appropriations committee and full house versions of the fy1995 dod appropriations act did not include funding of this earlier cola the senate appropriations committee and full senate versions did include funding for the earlier cola in conference action the senate position prevailed so that the fy1995 military retirement cola was paid to nondisabled retirees on april 1 1995 crs13 cola action in the fy1995 national defense authorization act detailed discussion house armed services committee in its report on the fy1995 national defense authorization act the house armed services committee in addition to identifying 376 million to be used to fund an fy1995 military retirement cola that would first be paid on the same date as the civil service retirement cola april 1 1995 also stated that it will seek to work through the budget process to find solution to the disparate cola payment dates for fiscal years 1996 1997 and 1998 house floor action the full house adopted the house armed services committee language on military retirement colas senate armed services committee the senate armed services committee version of the authorization bill would have paid for earlier military retirement colas by authorizing later civil service retirement colas this would have avoided paying for the earlier colas by cutting discretionary defense spending because civil service retirement colas are within the jurisdiction of the senate governmental affairs committee not the armed services committee the senate committee did not actually include statutory language to modify civil service retirement colas in the bill it reported the armed services committee report senate report 103282 june 14 1994 pp 19799 instead contained explanatory language for committee amendment which was to have been offered during floor consideration of the fy1995 national defense authorization act senate floor action the senate armed services committee amendment described immediately above was never offered by senator nunn the committee chairman instead the senate adopted by vote of 8812 an amendment cosponsored by senators warner and sarbanes which was identical to the language in the house authorization bill the senate also adopted another amendment which would have required military and civil service retirement colas to first be paid on the same date beginning october 1 1998 fy1999 conference action the conference version of the authorization bill reported august 12 1994 included the language adopted by both house and senate however the conference report included language strongly criticizing the use of discretionary defense funds needed to maintain military readiness for the payment of retirement colas an entitlement that does not contribute to readiness and stating that for this reason the conferees deem it imperative that an alternative method of eliminating the disparity between military and civil service retirement colas be found for fiscal years 1996 1997 and 1998 the conference version of the authorization bill also changed the senate floor amendment language mandating that military and civil service retirement colas be paid on the same date whichever was earlier to language that it was the sense of the congress that such change should be made crs14 cola action in the fy1995 dod appropriations act detailed discussion house and senate committee and floor action the payment of the earlier cola in accordance with the house and senate authorization language was explicitly contingent on the appropriation of the additional 376 million in appropriations legislation the house appropriations committee and full house versions of the fy1995 dod appropriations act did not include any such appropriations however the senate appropriations committee and full senate version of the fy1995 dod appropriations act did despite the previously stated opposition of senators byrd and inouye chairmen of the full senate appropriations committee and the senate defense appropriations subcommittee respectively to the plan adopted by both the house and senate conference action whether or not the fy1995 cola was to be paid earlier than october 1 1995 therefore depended on the conference action on the fy1995 dod appropriations act see the conference report hrept 103747 september 26 1994 because the senate position prevailed in the conference the fy1995 military retirement cola would be paid on the same date as colas for civil service retirees april 1 in 1995 and 1996 and january 1 thereafter based on the existing statutory cola computation formula described above the amount of the 1995 cola was to be 28 if the senate position in the appropriations act had not prevailed and money had been appropriated for the earlier cola matter what the language in the fy1995 national defense authorization act the cola delays contained in the 1993 obra would have remained and the fy1995 military retirement cola would have been scheduled for first payment on october 1 1995 the conference version of the fy1995 dod appropriations act also contained provision which mandated the payment of the fy19961998 military retirement colas on the same dates mandated by the 1993 obra for civil service retirement colas during those years april 1 1996 january 1 1997 and thereafter january 1 rather than the october 1 mandated for military retirement colas only in the obra the january 1 dates it should be noted were those that are provided in permanent law which governed military retirement colas before enactment of the 1993 obra or the fy1995 defense authorization and appropriations legislation furthermore the earlier military retirement colas mandated in the fy1995 dod appropriations act were contingent on two requirements 1 the presidents fy1996 defense budget proposing legislation to pay for the earlier colas in accordance with budgetary rules for entitlement programs and mandatory ie not discretionary spending and 2 the enactment of authorizing legislation which would offset the cost of first paying colas on the earlier dates by cuts in other mandatory and entitlement programs crs15 fy19941995 cola reductions budgetary aspects the cola reductions enacted as part of the 1993 obra were projected to save 788 million in civil service retirement costs and 2358 billion in military retirement costs total of 3146 billion in savings during the period fy19941998 because the fy1995 cola was scheduled for payment on april 1 1995 and 1996 and january 1 of 1997 and thereafter the total savings those that were projected in 1994 were to be reduced as shown in table 3 the plan originally advanced by the senate armed services committee which was not adopted by the full senate by providing for earlier military retirement and later civil service retirement colas would actually have resulted in savings greater than the original 1993 obra delays in military retirement colas the senate committee plan would have decreased total costs by 79 million in fy1995 189 million in increased military retirement outlays offset by 268 million in decreased civil service retirement outlays over the period fy19951999 the senate armed services committee amendment would have resulted in 221 million in savings 1118 billion in increased military retirement outlays offset by 1339 billion in decreased civil service retirement outlays overall savings would have been achieved because there are more civil service retirees than military retirees and civil service retirement outlays 346 billion in fy1993 are substantially larger than military retirement outlays 272 billion in fy1993 outlays table 3 military and civil service retirement cost

military retirees participate in the dod survivor benefit plan sbp under the sbp military retiree can have portion of his or her monthly retired pay withheld to partially finance the remainder of the costs being borne by the government after the retirees death monthly survivor benefit to surviving spouse or other eligible recipients the survivor benefit is percentage maximum of 55 of base amount that amount of retired pay that the retiree selects to be used in determining the sbp benefit and cost permanent law provides that whenever retired pay cola takes effect retirees sbp premium the amount deducted from his or her retired pay is increased at the same time and by the same percentage as the cola 10 usc 1452h therefore had permanent law regarding colas not been changed by the 1993 obra the amount deducted from nondisabled military retirees retired pay to finance the retirees sbp participation would have increased by 26 on january 1 1994 however as noted above the obra delayed nondisability retirees colas until april 1 1994 the obra did not though delay the increase in sbp costs to each nondisability retiree enrolled in the sbp therefore sbp premiums were increased for the three months of retired pay payable on january 1 february 1 and march 1 1994 because dod said it could not reprogram its computers that generate retired pay checks and electronic payments to accommodate the new law by january 1 the three months of increased sbp premiums were taken out of the retired pay received by retirees on april 1 1994 the first month of the fy1994 cola according to dod this retroactive collection of sbp premiums amounted to less than 15 for most retirees there appeared to be two dod rationales for the increase in sbp costs to the retirees before the cola takes effect the survivor benefits received by survivors of retirees who died before the new cola took effect reflected that cola ie their survivor benefits were computed as if the cola had first been paid on january 1 for the retired pay accruing during december although the costs to the government of this increase will be much less than the additional sbp deductions taken in by the government as noted above all survivor benefit recipients received their colas on january 1 not april 1 sbp budgeting assumes particular balance of sbp costs to the government payments to beneficiaries and costs to the individual retiree premiums taken as deductions from retired pay had the increase in sbp premiums not been made retroactive to january 1 therefore the proportion of sbp costs borne by the government would have increased contrary to the statutory structuring of the sbp there has been some controversy about whether sbp deductions from retired pay should start before fiscal years cola is first paid it has been argued that some or all of the earlier deductions should be waived to avoid the loss in retired pay crs17 1994 fy1995 legislation the senate version of the fy1995 national defense authorization act included floor amendment which would have prevented the coladriven increases in sbp premium deductions from military retired pay from taking effect before the actual cola is granted for the retired pay itself however this provision was not adopted by the authorization conference committee and hence the earlier premium deductions will continue unless modified by later legislation previously legislation had been introduced hr 4046 and s 1817 103rd congress that would have prevented the increased sbp deductions from taking effect before the actual payment of the cola applicable for any colas which are payable after the legislations enactment for further information on the sbp see crs report 94779 the military survivor benefit plan description of its provisions military retirement options of the entitlement commission on december 5 1994 the staff of the bipartisan commission on entitlement and tax reform issued report containing numerous options for cutting broad range of federal entitlements3 these options were reiterated in the final report of the commission released on january 27 1995 those options included in the report that would affect military retirement are cap on the combined total of military retired pay and social security under this proposal the combined total of military retired pay and social security could not for persons retiring from the military after january 1 2000 exceed 80 of the high3 years of basic pay if retirees combined benefit exceeded the cap military retired pay would be reduced but by more than 50 in computing the combined benefit only social security benefits resulting from military service would be counted social security based on civilian employment would not be counted the cap would be computed by dod at the time military member retires thereafter it would be adjusted upward annually to reflect wage growth in the civilian economy until the retiree becomes eligible for social security at age 62 reducing the percentage of high3 basic pay received for each year of service between 20 and 30 years military members covered by the military retirement reform act of 1986 those who first entered the military on or after august 1 1986 accrue retired pay at the rate of 2 per year for each year of service through 20 thus for 20 years of service retired pay is calculated at 40 of high3 basic pay the 1986 act also provides that for each year of service 3 the commission was established by president clinton in late 1993 in response to concerns about entitlement growth raised during congressional debate on the 1993 obra it finished its public deliberations on december 15 1994 its published products included letter to the president and both houses of congress various packages of entitlement and tax options prepared by different groups of commission members and analytical and supporting documents crs18 past 20 through the 30year mark retired pay is calculated at the rate of 35 per year reaching maximum of 75 of high3 basic pay 20 years of service x 20 10 years of service x 35 the entitlement commission staff option would have reduced the 2030 year accrual rate from 35 to 2 thus under this proposal retiree with 30 years or more of service would thus receive maximum of 60 of high3 basic pay rather than 75 in addition the commission staff proposed dropping the onetime recomputation of retired pay upward at age 62 for the first 20 years of service as noted above although it would have retained the onetime recomputation at age 62 to make up for the lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to the inflation rate minus one percentage point cutting military retirement colas the commission staff suggested two possible cola options 1 revising the cpi by 1999 to make it more accurate which the commission believes would result in lower cpi figures or limiting colas to the cpi 05 until the cpi revisions were completed andor 2 suspending all colas for one year these options would affect wide variety of other federal programs in addition to military retirement in addition two other options to change military retirement were discussed in the individual views submitted by commission members and contained in the commission final report these included limiting colas to 1 the full percentage amount or 2 the maximum percentage cola of the 20th percentile of retirees whichever is larger for example assume the lowest 20 of retirees receives more than 1000 per month in retired pay and that the cola is determined to be 5 all retirees receiving more than 1000 per month in retired pay would get 5 cola ie maximum of 50 5 of 1000 any retirees receiving more than 1000 per month in retired pay would get only 50 cola as well placing cap on all federal entitlements without exception including military retirement the commissions final report to the president and the congress did not endorse any specific program cuts however the commission report as with other such commissions and groups formed part of later debate on federal entitlements including military retirement crs19 fy1996 19951996 cola actions summary after legislative activity

legislative process evolved during 1995 the house and senate ended up assuming that the legislative vehicle for determining the date on which colas would first be paid to nondisabled military retirees would be the fy1996 reconciliation bill the proposed balanced budget act of 1995 although the house and senate had addressed the issue earlier in the year in their versions of the fy1996 defense authorization bill however due to procedural concerns in the senate over the extent to which the senate could include colarelated provisions in its reconciliation bill the socalled byrd rule the first version of the fy1996 reconciliation bill ultimately did not address the cola issue at all not only did the bill not specifically mention cola dates it appears that 18 billion incorporated into the mandatory spending assumptions of the bill in order to pay for colas to be first paid on april 1 1996 and january 1 of 1997 and 1998 was applied to other programs during conference action on the first version of the fy1996 reconciliation bill the first reconciliation bill however was vetoed by the president complicated situation then arose if cola legislation had been approved as part of the fy1996 legislative program then the situation would have defaulted back to the cola dates in previously enacted law these dates were those enacted as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1993 october 1 of 1996 1997 and 1998 the 1993 obra was amended in 1994 by the fy1995 dod appropriations act to allow the fy1996 cola to be paid on april 1 rather than october 1 1996 however such earlier payment was contingent on authorizing legislation being passed to do so and offsetting savings being identified to pay for the earlier cola with the enactment of the fy1996 dod appropriations act into law on december 1 1995 without cola provisions if other fy1996 legislation had set cola dates then it is difficult to see what legislative vehicle would be available to authorize the earlier cola and identify the offsetting savings hence without further legislation the fy19961998 colas would have reverted to october 1 however the fy1996 national defense authorization act signed into law on february 10 1996 pl 104106 110 stat 186 mandated that colas first be paid on april 1 1996 january 1 1997 and whenever in 1998 civil service retirement colas are first paid the fy1996 dod appropriations act pl 10461 december 1 1995 did not have any cola provisions fy1997fy1998 19961997 cola actions summary in fy1997 and fy1998 military retirement colas were first paid on january 1 of each of those years respectively the percentage increase was 29 for 1997 and 21 for 1998 administration budget the fy1997fy1998 dod budgets of the clinton administration included proposals for changes or cuts in military retirement colas ie the budgets for crs22 all five years assumed that the law as it stood after enactment of fy1996 legislation would stand payment of each fiscal years cola on january 1 of each year fy1997fy1998 congressional budget resolutions fy1997 the house version of the fy1997 budget resolution embodied the same assumptions as did the administrations budget an fy1997 cola paid on january 1 1997 and later colas to be the same as civil service it simultaneously provided for civil service retirement colas to be paid on april 1 of the years 1997 through 2002 because current law provided for fy1998 and later military retirement colas to be paid on the same date as civil service retirement colas the house resolution thus had the effect of assuming fy1998 and later colas would be paid on april 1 as well the house budget committee estimated this would save 1067 billion from fy1998 through fy2002 because the policy assumptions underlying budgetary amounts are not binding this did not assure that passage of the house version would have delayed military retirement colas until april 1 of each year what it would have required is that somehow either through the cola delays or through other cuts in mandatory direct or entitlement spending equivalent savings be achieved however the senate version of the fy1997 budget resolution did not address the issue of military retirement colas and the senate version prevailed in conference therefore the final congressional budget resolution passed by the house on june 12 1996 and by the senate on june 14 contains policy assumptions regarding military retirement colas fy1998 neither the house nor the senate fy1998 budget resolutions and hence the final resolution contained any assumptions regarding changes in military retirement colas however the resolution did assume slight technical change in how the department of labors bureau of labor statistics calculates the cpi this change assumed that the cpi would be 03 of percentage point less than it otherwise would have been fy1997 fy1998 national defense authorization acts fy1997 the house version of the fy1997 national defense authorization act did not address the issue of military retirement colas the final version signed by the president on september 23 1996 pl 104201 accepted the senate version of the act changing the effective date of the fy1998 cola from 1 payment on whatever date the civil service retirement cola is paid to 2 january 1 1998 fy1998 there were cola changes in any of the various versions of the fy1998 national defense authorization act crs23 other proposals for changes in military retirement colas 19961997 concord coalition plans 1996 in 1996 the concord coalition bipartisan group devoted to reducing the federal deficit endorsed eliminating colas for all nondisabled retirees military and federal civilian under age 62 having one time recomputation upward at age 62 to reflect the purchasing power due to the lost colas and then the payment of colas at rate of the consumer price index less one percent thereafter ie the same formula as is mandated by the military retirement reform act of 1986 for persons who first entered the military on or after august 1 1986 the centrist coalition proposals 1996 on april 25 1996 group of 11 republican and 11 democratic senators known as the centrist coalition released plan not fully formulated calling for reducing both colas and the retired pay computation formula for retirees under age 50 colas would be established at april 1 of each year through fy2003 colas would be capped in fy1997 and fy1998 at the cpi less 05 and in fy1999 and thereafter at the cpi less 03 details of the cuts in the computation formula were not yet available similar proposal was considered in the house but likewise not adopted other senate proposals in 1996 floor amendment to the senate version of the fy1997 budget resolution was similar to the centrist coalition proposals it would have reduced military retired pay for retirees under age 50 limited colas to the first 50000 annually of retired pay for current and future retirees and reduced colas by 05 below the cpi as with other similar amendments it also failed the blue dog democrats cpi proposals 1997 in february 1997 group of conservative house democrats known colloquially as the blue dog democrats released balanced budget proposal which proposed several types of limits on federal colas including military retirement under the blue dog proposal the overall cola would be reduced by 08 for example cola of 30 would be reduced to 22 however the reduced cola would be applied not to each individual military retiree but to the average military retired pay for an average retiree each retirees pay matter what the amount would then be increased by the latter amount for example continuing to use 22 as an example of blue dogcomputed cola if the average retiree was receiving 1600 per month in retired pay the cola increase for all retirees would be 22 of 1600 or 3520 per month each retiree regardless of how much the retiree was receiving in retired pay would have his or her retired pay increased by flat 3520 per month while this was been defended on grounds of equity it has been attacked for penalizing success by giving higherranking personnel much smaller percentage raise than lowerranking retirees proposals to change the cpi 19961997 various authorities have asserted that the cpi overstates the rate of inflation perhaps by as much as about one percent yearly and that it should therefore be revised downward such change would cause the annual military retirement percentage colas and all other federal benefits receiving cpibased colas to decrease accordingly in general crs24 proponents of the change argue that the existing mechanism for computing the cpi fails to account for both consumer behavior changes and changes in the quality of goods which contribute to minimizing the rate of inflation opponents suggest that the assumptions made by those who wish to change the cpi formula and computing methods are difficult if not impossible to verify and that some of them in fact should not be counted as reducers of inflation some comparatively minor changes in the cpi formulae resulting in cpis lower by 025 year or less than they otherwise would be have been implemented without much controversy for further information on the cpi controversy see crs report 95670 adjusting benefits for inflation impacts of policy change repeal of the 1986 redux military retirement legislation 19981999 effects on future colas the military retirement reform act of 1986 summary of 19981999 congressional action leading to its nearcomplete repeal throughout 1998 and into 1999 there was increasing discussion of whether some or all of the future retired pay cuts contained in the military retirement reform act of 1986 pl 99 348 july 1 1986 100 stat 682 et seq also known as the redux cuts should be repealed eventually the redux retirement reductions were almost completely repealed by the fy2000 national defense authorization act sections 64144 subtitle dretired pay reform title vicompensation and other personnel benefits pl 10665 october 5 1999 113 stat 512 at 66264 the redux statute would have substantially cut the retired pay for those retirees who first entered military service on or after august 1 1986 with very few exceptions military personnel do not become eligible for retired pay until completing 20 years of service the redux formula therefore would not have been used to compute any significant number of retirees pay until mid2006 it applied to very small number of disability retirees starting upon its enactment redux changing the cola formula4 for military personnel not affected by redux ie who entered service before august 1 1986 each december cola equal to the percentage increase in the cpi between the third quarters of successive years is applied to military retired pay for the annuities paid beginning each january 1 for example assume that the cpi rises from an average of 5000 in the third quarter of 2008 the average of the cpi for the months of july august and september 2008 to an average of 5200 in the third quarter of 2009 an increase of 200 points or 40 of 5000 the military retired pay that accrues during december 2009 and is actually paid to retirees on january 1 2010 would be increased by 40 above the amount paid the previous month for military personnel whose retired pay would have been computed in accordance with redux the 1986 act modified the above formula by providing that 4 for description of the noncola aspects of the redux retirement legislation see crs issue brief ib85159 military retirement major legislative issues crs25 annual colas would have been held to one percentage point below the actual inflation rate for retirees under age 62 retirees covered by the redux formula would thus have received 30 increase rather than 40 in the hypothetical example described in the paragraph immediately preceding this one however under redux when the retiree reached age 62 there would have been onetime recomputation of his or her annuity to make up for lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to the inflation rate minus one percentage point after this onetime recomputation however future redux colas would have continued to be computed on the basis of the cpi minus one percentage point repeal of the 1986 redux legislation beginnings and the administration proposal most discussion about repealing redux in 1998 and early 1999 revolved around changing its noncola aspects however the legislative process including the administrations own proposal which eventually led to the repeal included variations in the original redux cola formula from the beginning in late december 1998 the administration announced that it would propose repeal of redux that would replace the cola formula for reduxeligible retirees with the formula used for federal civil service retirees covered by the federal employee retirement system fers the pension plan for those federal civil servants who were first employed by the government on or after january 1 1984 the fers formula is less generous than the formula for preaugust 1 1986 entrant retirees but more generous than the original redux cola provision fers currently operates for civil service retirees by giving them cola of the cpi minus one percentage point if the annual cpi increase is over 3 flat 2 cola if the annual cpi increase is between 2 and 3 and the full cpi if the actual cpi increase is less than 2 early legislative action the senate bill on january 27 1999 the senate armed services committee reported out s 4 the soldiers sailors airmens and marines bill of rights act of 1999 srept 1061 which would have offered military member two choices regarding retirement of which one would have to be
