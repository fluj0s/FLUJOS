divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32690the child welfare workforce an overview summary it is difficult to get clear picture of the frontline child welfare workforce because it is one component of larger occupational groups child family and school social workers as well as social and human assistants employed in the public sector state and local governments and private sector individual and family services industry that provide wide rang of social assistance to disparate clients job training to adults and nonmedical home care to the elderly that being said child welfare workers appear to be disp roportionately women and africanamericans who deliver social services to atrisk children to be hired as social worker b achelors degree usually is necessary although agencies rarely require that the degree be in social work agencies also employ frontline workers with little experience in social assistance or little education beyond high school the share of collegeeducated individuals in the child welfare workforce has decreased over time as agencies reportedly sought to expand the supply of available and affordable pe rsonnel in res ponse to greater reports of child maltreatment in the 1960s and 1970s the annual earnings of child family nd school social workers at private individual and family services agencies are 32130 on average state and local governments pay 37920 and 42100 respectively to this group of social workers excluding those employed in schools the average earnings of social and human assistants at private ag encies are 24170 and in state and local government 29790 and 29640 respectively the wages of both occupational groups do not compare favorably with most other occupations having similar educational qualifications in addition to comparatively low salaries child welfare workers are reported to experience threats ofactual violence the na ture of the work also can be emotionally draining and stressful given heavy casework loads caseloads appear to be higher at public than private child welfare ag encies with relatively more government managers stating that caseloads are highly problematic for sta ff retention turnover rates are estimated to be in the double digits rates average about 40 for professionals in private child welfare agenci and about half that in public agencies nonetheless other state and local government employees seemingly exhibit much less turnover high turnove r rates are of concern because they can pose problems such as the continued provision of quality service to clients factors associated with turnover and retention in addition to heavy workloads are the extent of supervisory and collegial support as well as the empl oyees degree of satisfaction with such organizational variables as compensation administrative duties and professional development prospects are good for those interested in frontline child welfare jobs above average rates of job growth are projected particularly in private agencies and for socialhuman assistants existing jobs are expected to open up as well due to current workers leaving for othe r fields or retiring prospects may not be as good for recruiting professionals into the human services workforce however this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32690contents w h r c h i l d w l f r w r k r s 2 d u c t i n n d t r i n i n g 2 d u c

public agencies concurs with the previously mentioned pattern among child welfare caseworkerscase managers at private agencies agencies also employ individuals with little experience in social assistance or little schooling beyond high school11 for example between 3 and 14 of local public agencies do not require college education for employment as child welfare worker see table 1 when employees rather than agencies are the unit of analysis the nscaw foster care survey estimated that 2 of child welfare workers do not have at least bachelors degree12 over time there has been decline in the share of collegeeducated child welfare workers13 the increased reporting of ch ild maltreatment in the late 1960s and early 1970 s which reportedly stemmed from greater public awareness of the issue and the resulting passage of child maltreatment reporting laws appears to have caused agencies to lower educational standa rds for child welfare workers in order to expand the supply of available and affordable staff14 this is referred to as the deprofessionalization or deskilling of the field phrase that has come to mean not so much the employment of persons wit hout college degree but the employment of collegeeducated individuals with major other than social work efforts to reprofessionalize the child welfare workforce through social work education were given boost by the adop tion assistance and child welfare act of 1980 pl 96272 the law created title ive and authorized 75 federal matching specifically for public child welfare training expenditures but was little used by

assignment of cases to workers who had not yet received or completed initial tr aining and training inadequate to prepare caseworkers for their jobs with regard to the ongoing training requirement the challenges most often mentioned by states were limited staff participation due to heavy cas eloads and lack of funds20 other training concerns identified in state final reports of the cfsr include lack of cultural competency training training too theoretical in cont ent failure of the state to have ongoing training curriculum or requirements lack of supervisory training in child welfare practice as opposed to management uneve n training opportunitie s and inconsistent training requirements within the same state and training resour ces stretched thin by high staff turnover21 gender and race child welfare staff are predominan tly and disproportionately women according to 2004 data from the current population survey cps women account for 79 of all persons regardless of occ upation employed in the individual and family services industry this is the fe deral industrial classi fication that includes private agencies engaged in child welfare assistance the same pattern prevails in public administration at the federal state and local levels of all personnel staffing government human resources programs in cluding child welfare services 71 are women similarly on an occupational basis women represent almost 4 of every 5 individuals employed as social workers in th public and private sectors in contrast women comprise somewhat less than 1 of every 2 employed persons in the labor forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32690crs8 the child welfare workforce appears to be disproportionately composed of africanamericans as well blacks represent minority of employees in the individual

individuals who are employed as social workers in contrast blacks represent little more than 1 of every 10 employed persons in the united states size and job characteristics of the child welfare workforce the performance of the child welfare function in two broad industry groups complicates analysis of the child welfar workforce state and local government employees as well as private sector worker s in the social assistance excluding child day care industry group provide wide ra nge of social services eg worker training nonmedical home care and emergency provision of food and shelter more specifically as noted above the federal i ndustrial classification system places child welfare activities in th individual and family services segment of the private sector establishments that provide social assistance individual and family services is the largest component of the so cial assistance excluding child day care industry group but even this segment focuses on more th an children eg the elderly and persons with disabilities similarly child welfare is subsumed within the wideranging human resources activities of state and local government thereby further increasing the difficulty of utilizing federal statistics to analyze just the child welfare workforce reliance on nongovernment data sources is problematic as well some associations conduct surveys of their mbers who may not be representative of workers in the child welfare field as with federal data these and other surveys may cover workers who assist indi viduals other than atrisk children in addition small sample sizes may make it inaccurate to disaggregate survey results to look only at child welfare workers what follows then is an impression rather than precise accounting of members of the child welfare workforce the focus is on frontline workers rather than on others who perform functions that support the primary mission of assisting atrisk children size and composition of the workforce by industry and occupation private agencies according to may 2004 data from the occupational employment statistics oes program some 847000 persons are employed by non profit and forprofit organizations

private agencies which typically are small23 have played an increased role in the delivery of child welfare services ove r time although public agencies have paid private nonprofit organizations to deliver child welfare services since the early 1800s contracting out to forprofit firms began to grow substantially during the 1960s and 1970s the more recent particip ation of forprofit businesses in

the oes program does not report government employment separately by type of social service performed it does however produce data on government employment by occupational group state government is the

agencies it averages 14 and 11 respectively at private agencies32 perhaps not surprisingly given the heavier caseloads at public compared to private child welfare agencies managers and supervisors at relatively more public 62 than private 13 agencies report that caseloads are highly problematic for staff retention some 39 of private agen cies did note that workload in general is highly problematic for staff retention33 and according to an hhs survey of randomly selected counties the majority 69 of local child protective services agencies consider their workloads to be ex cessive for at least one function screening and intake investigations and alternative response34 turnover the strain of heavy workloads commonly is offered as one factor prompting child welfare workers to leave their employers specifically or the field generally other frequently mentioned contributors include uncompetitive wage levels increased administrative incl uding paperwork burdens insufficient supervisory support little time for inservice training inadequate preservice training unsafe working conditions and the greater complexity of cases35 turnover rates are estimate d to be in the doubledigits with

public child welfare workers california social work education center berkeley ca october 2004despite their previously mentioned greater caseloads the wide disparity between private and public agencies on average may be associated with few private agencies at which large shares of staff left over the course of year when the comparator is all state and local government employees rather than child welfare workers at private agencies turnover at public child welfare agencies appears to be quite high37 interest exists in reducing the rate of turnover among frontline child welfare workers because of its impact on the tinuity and quality of service delivery to clients rapid turnover also appears to be problem for staff who remain they must pick up the slack not only from leavers but also from sometimes inexperienced individuals hired to fill vacated positions as previously ntioned preservice training usually is required for child welfare workers and even after this training period is completed the number of cases ndled by new hires may be increased only gradually thereby continuing the pressure on the existing staff to carry the overall caseload and workload during th new staff gearingup period38 research has been conducte d to determine why some workers stay and others leave the child welfare field despite disparate methodologies surveys and interviews populations all child welfar professions caseworkers and title ive scholarship recipients and sc ope public agencies in diffe rent states and in different counties within one state nd dependent variables intenti on to leave or to stay and actual turnover or retention the outcome s of these empirical studies are fairly similar although they do play role pers onal characteristics of child welfare staff age gender and race do not appear to be strong predictors of intention to leave instead certain professional and organizational characteristics are estimated to account for much of the variation in who d ecides to leave or remain this has been taken as positive sign because there might be great deal that both managers and policy makers can do to prevent turnover39 supervisory support and internal career ladders are among the organizational characteristics estimated to be related to turnover and re tention this twin finding prompted the recommendation that public child welfare agencies utilize

transfers across work units and by implementing regular peersupport meetings and other forms of team development41 one professional characteris tic described in differe nt studies as sense of mission commitment and belief that social work provides valuable service to society was estimated to strongly influence allegiance to the occupation and to remaining in the child welfare field42 this finding led to the suggestion that an individuals orientation to service be c onsidered when recruiting employees as it might increase their likelihood of staying bu t even when the intrinsic value of the job is strong other factors such as ffective and competent supervisory support as well as organizational charact eristics turnover and caseload appear to be important contributors to the like lihood of job retention43 not only do shorttenured child welfare wo rkers with the strongest intention to remain in the field differ from those with the weakest intention in their professional commitment but they also were found to diffe r in levels of job stress perceptions about supervisory quality and leadership received views about the degree of co worker support and their extent of job satisfaction with orga nizational variables including caseloads compen sation paperwork and support44 other results show that relatively inexperienced workers and those who feel less competent are more inclined to

actual employment vels in future years at both public and private social assistance agencies likely will be affected by the fluctuating availability of government resources in addition to net

weeks shy of obtaining bachelors degrees in liberal arts or in social work however prospects are not nearly as good for recruiting professionals into the human services workforce defined as jobs in child welfare child care youth services juvenile justice and employment and training relatively few had given serious consideration to getting jobs in any of these fields and even among those w ho had minority were knowledgeable about how to find one additionally 45 of stude nts with the greatest interest in these fields called the hiring process confusing 71 characterized it as slow almost 3 out of 5 students who were ve ry or somewhat interested in obtaining human services jobs anticipated remaining in them for five or fewer years55 findings like these have caused concern in some quarters that without effective recruitment strategies the demand for child welfare service professionals might outweigh their supply it appears that one federal initiative to increase recruitment of college graduates to the child and family welfare field may not be having much of an impact as some 43 of survey res pondents eligible for can cellation of federal perkins loans under section 465a of th higher education amendments of 1992 pl 102325 did not learn of the ca ncellation opportunity until after college graduation it is not surprising that onl 12 reported the availability of loan forgiveness influenced their employment preference reasons other than timing that students offered for the seemingly limited usefulness of this program as recruitment tool include the small share of indebte dness accounted for by perkins awards the lengthy employment period five years be fore cancellation occurs and the rate at which forgiveness takes place within that period56 there also is concern that absent the implementation of effective retention strategies at public and private agencies child welfare and other human services work ers could continue to cycle through the workforce
