appropriations bill in the house and the state foreign operations measure in the senate are the primary legislative vehicles through which congress reviews the us international affairs budgets and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally they contain the largest shares the house bill about twothirds the senate bill about 97 of total us international affairs spending funding for foreign operations and state departmentbroadcasting programs have been rising for five consecutive years while amounts approved in fy2004 reached an unprecedented level compared with the past 40 years emergency supplementals enacted since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks to assist the front line states in the war on terrorism afghanistan and iraq reconstruction and for state department operations and security upgrades have pushed spending upward the president sought 228 billion for foreign operations and 98 billion for state department and related agencies appropriations these amounts were 157 and 122 respectively higher than fy2005 amounts enacted in regular non supplemental appropriations the combined stateforeign operations request of 3267 billion was 146 larger than

fy2005 major challenge for congress in considering the presidents foreign operations and state department spending proposals has been the tightening budget environment the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 set international affairs spending 7 below the presidents request the house appropriations committees spending allocation among all spending bills provided 2027 billion for foreign operations 112 less than the proposal the senate committee allocation of 3167 billion for the combined state departmentforeign operations measure was 1 billion or 3 below the request other key issues

operations housestate foreign operations and related programs senate appropriations for fy2006 most recent developments on december 30 2005 president bush signed the department of defense appropriation for fy2006 pl 109148 legislation that affects foreign operations spending in three ways the defense appropriation includes 38 billion for addressing the avian influenza virus of which 1315 million is available to usaid for international surveillance planning preparedness and response pl 109148 further rescinds 25 million from the exportimport bank as part of large package to offset the costs of relief for victims of hurricane katrina finally the defense appropriation enacts 1 acrosstheboard reduction for most nonemergency discretionary appropriations resulting in reduction in foreign operations spending of approximately 209 million from the amount approved earlier for fy2006 previously on november 14 2005 president bush signed into law 2094 billion foreign operations appropriation for fy2006 pl 109102 hr 3057 the net total for foreign operations after adjusting for supplemental funds and rescissions enacted in pl 109148 is 2083 billion the house passed the conference report hrept 109265 on november 4 35839 while the senate approved it on november 10 910 conferees decided to separate the state department and related agencies portion of the senatepassed measure and address those funding and policy issues as part of the science state justice and commerce appropriation hr 2862 the enacted foreign operations appropriations adjusted for supplementals and rescissions in pl 109148 falls 21 billion or 93 below the presidents request and represents by far the largest cut in regular nonsupplemental foreign operations spending relative to the administrations proposal during the bush administration the total however remains about 14 billion higher than the regular fy2005 foreign aid spending measure excluding emergency and supplemental appropriations and falls between the housepassed 2027 billion level and the senatepassed 2216 billion amount conferees made the largest reduction to the presidents proposed 3 billion millennium challenge account paring the appropriation down to 177 billion for nearly every other account the enacted bill also sets spending at or somewhat below requested levels pl 109102 further reduces the presidents 459 million request for iraq to 61 million crs2 in few selected areas however the enacted measure adds funds appropriations for the three core bilateral development aid accounts of child survivalhealth development assistance and the global aids initiative are 52 billion or 105 higher than the request and aid to the former soviet states is set at 514 million 66 more than proposed the conference agreement further adds to spending for the african and interamerican foundations voluntary contributions to international organizations and establishes new democracy fund of 95 million as proposed by the senate the total amount for hivaids malaria and tuberculosis programs across all foreign operations accounts is 282 billion up from the presidents 256 billion request this includes 450 million for the global fund higher than the 200 million request for family planning pl 109102 provides 466 million 432 million in bilateral funding and 34 million as contribution to the population fund unfpa this compares to 425 million total request on key policy issues the conference agreement deletes senatepassed provisions that would have reversed the mexico city family planning policy and altered the kempkasten restrictions that apply to us contributions to the population fund unfpa the enacted measure also stipulates that portion of us assistance to egypt must support democracy human rights and governance programs introduction amounts appropriated for foreign operations programs and for the department of state and related agencies comprise about 97 of the total international affairs budget and represent roughly 7 of discretionary budget authority under the jurisdiction of house and senate appropriations committees at the beginning of the 109th congress house and senate committees on appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures the house panel reduced the number of subcommittees to ten and reconfigured several of their jurisdictions these changes however do not affect the previous organizations for foreign operations and state departmentbroadcasting programs the jurisdiction of the house foreign operations committee remains the same while state department broadcasting and related activities continue to be funded within the retitled subcommittee on science state justice commerce and related agencies ssjc the senate appropriations committee chose to restructure its subcommittees differently from the house by maintaining twelve subpanels the senate configuration combined foreign operations with the state department broadcasting and related agencies creating retitled subcommittee on state foreign operations and related programs subsequently in late october house and senate appropriations committees agreed that for fy2006 appropriation bill jurisdictions would follow the house structure consequently state department funds were removed from the senatepassed legislation hr 3507 and are incorporated in hr 2862 the ssjc measure crs3 this report covers funding and policy issues related to foreign operations as addressed in the house and senate and state department programs as debated in the senate the discussion and accompanying tables are designed to track the house foreign operations appropriation measure as well as the broader senate state foreign operations spending bill to read about state

housecommerce justice science and related agencies senate fy2006 appropriations coordinated by ian f fergusson and susan b epstein foreign operations overview foreign operations the larger of the two components with request of 228 billion for fy2006 is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences major aspects of executive branch foreign policy making generally1 the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations foreign operations also includes resources for the two newest administration initiatives the millennium challenge corporation mcc and the global aids initiative managed by the state departments hivaids coordinator most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations including usaids disasterfamine program and the state departments refugee relief support foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the independent states account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are other security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon foreign operations appropriations also fund reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq and for countries affected by the december 2004 indian ocean tsunami us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three 1 although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign aid programs food aid an international humanitarian aid program administered under the pl 480 program is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill foreign operations also include funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is regarded as trade promotion program rather than foreign aid in recent years funding for food aid has run somewhat higher than for the eximbank so foreign operations is slightly smaller than the official foreign aid budget nevertheless throughout this report the terms foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably crs4 export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency state departmentbroadcasting overview budgets for the department of state including embassy construction and security and public diplomacy are within the state department and related programs title of the science state justice and commerce ssjc appropriations in the house and the state foreign operations measure in the senate this title for which the administration requests 98 billion in fy2006 also funds the broadcasting board of governors bbg and us assessed contributions to united nations international organizations and peacekeeping state department and related programs further include funding for the us institute of peace asia foundation national endowment for democracy and several other small educational and exchange organizations this title also appropriates resources for international commissions related foreign policy authorization measures intertwined with both foreign operations and state department appropriations are foreign policy authorization bills that by law congress must pass prior to foreign aid and the state departments expenditure of its appropriations when congress does not pass these authorization measures as was the case during the 108th congress the appropriation bills must waive the authorization requirement for foreign policy agencies and programs to continue to function2 in some cases this results in the attachment of foreign affairs authorizing provisions to foreign operations and state department appropriation measures adding increased importance to the appropriation bills in terms of both funding and setting policy priorities for us foreign policy this has been the situation especially for foreign operations for two decades the foreign operations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign policy making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees3 as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and 2 for details on foreign relations authorization legislation from the 108th and 109th congresses see crs report rl31986 foreign relations authorization fy2004 and fy2005 state department and foreign assistance and crs report rl33000 foreign relations authorization fy2006 and fy2007 an overview both by susan b epstein 3 although congress has not approved broad comprehensive foreign aid authorization individual foreign aid components have been authorized including legislation for the millennium challenge account the presidents hivaids initiative assistance for the former soviet states freedom support act and eastern europe seed act microenterprise programs and the peace corps crs5 congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 and launched afghan and iraqi reconstruction operations these appropriation measures have also been key instrument used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making key foreign operationsstate department funding issues for fy2006 while appropriation bills funding foreign aid state department operations embassy construction public diplomacy and contributions to international organizations can address the entire range of us foreign policy issues the fy2006 budget request posed several key matters that the 109th congress closely examined and debated for foreign operations programs major issues included the overall size of the request 157 increase over regular fy2005 foreign operations funds and whether competing budget proposals for domestic programs and efforts to reduce the deficit would permit full funding of the 2283 billion recommendation foreign aid in support of the global war on terror and whether the fy2006 request fully addressed this high national security priority including resources for reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan the millennium challenge account and whether progress thus far on this new innovative foreign aid program justified doubling of its budget in fy2006 hivaids funding and whether the 125 funding increase for fy2006 and the implementation and allocation of resources including those for the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria were fully meeting the vision of the presidents 15 billion initiative core development and humanitarian aid programs and whether proposed funding reductions for some activities and account restructuring to enhance flexibility were justified on state department operations key policy and funding issues included crs6 the us embassy in iraq and funding for ongoing operations security and construction public diplomacy educational and cultural exchange funds would increase in fy2006 by 21 and broadcasting operations by 10 international peacekeeping contributions would rise by 114 over fy2005 regular appropriation levels for new operations in sudan and elsewhere democracy promotion activities emphasized by president bush and secretary of state

appropriations committees agreed to follow the house bill structure for fy2006 consequently state department programs are included in the conference version of hr 2862 the ssjc measure foreign operations and state department policy trends and goals arguably from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s the underlying rationale for foreign aid and diplomatic efforts was the defeat of communism us aid programs were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to american allies and friendly states some of which faced soviet or sovietproxy threats aid programs also were used to help the united states gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy american forces diplomacy emphasized strengthening alliances and building coalitions to isolate and confront the soviet threat foreign aid and diplomatic programs also supported number of secondary us policy goals in the developing world such as reducing high rates of population growth promoting wider access to health care expanding the availability of basic education advancing us trade interests and protecting the environment if these secondary goals were also achieved us aid programs could be promoted as delivering more bang for the buck with the end of the cold war the focus of american foreign policy shifted to support more extensively other us national interests including stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs expanding peace efforts in the middle east seeking solutions to conflicts around the globe protecting human rights countering trafficking in persons foreign aid policy shifts foreign assistance in particular underwent significant changes during the 1990s the united states launched expansive aid programs in russia and many easternbloc states the influence of which us assistance previously tried to combat while these and other new elements of american foreign aid emerged broad consensus developed over what the new overarching rationale for us aid programs should be throughout the 1990s policymakers and congress explored number of alternative strategic frameworks around which to construct revised foreign assistance policy rationale not only did policy consensus fail to emerge but efforts to overhaul the largely cold warbased foreign aid legislation also did not succeed during this period the clinton administration emphasized the promotion of sustainable development as the new postcold war main strategy of those parts of the foreign aid program under the aegis of the us agency for international development usaid economic assistance supported six interrelated goals achievement of broadbased economic growth development of democratic systems crs8 stabilization of world population and protection of human health sustainable management of the environment building human capacity through education and training and meeting humanitarian needs early in the bush administration these goals were modified around three strategic pillars of 1 economic growth agriculture and trade 2 global health and 3 democracy conflict prevention and humanitarian assistance more recently usaid white paper on american foreign aid identified five core operational goals of us foreign assistance promoting transformational development especially in the areas of governance institutional capacity and economic restructuring strengthening fragile states providing humanitarian assistance supporting us geostrategic interests particularly in countries such as iraq afghanistan pakistan jordan egypt and israel and mitigating global and international ills including hivaids4 impact of the september 11 terrorist attacks the most defining change in us foreign policy however came following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states since 911 american foreign aid and diplomatic efforts have taken on more strategic sense of importance and has been cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism in september 2002 president bush released his administrations national security strategy that established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense and diplomacy also in 2002 executive branch foreign assistance budget justifications began to underscore the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority highlighting amounts of us assistance to 28 frontline states in the terrorism war countries that cooperated with the united states in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves5 the substantial reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq which totaled more in fy2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid programs are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism state department efforts focused extensively on building coalitions to assist in the war on terror and finding new and more effective ways of presenting american views and culture through public diplomacy at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of us foreign policy the bush administration announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened two additional key foreign assistance goals promoting economic growth and reducing poverty and combating the global 4 us agency for international development us foreign aid meeting the challenges of the twentyfirst century january 2004 5 according to the state department these frontline states include afghanistan algeria armenia azerbaijan bangladesh colombia djibouti egypt ethiopia georgia hungary india indonesia jordan kazhakistan kenya oman pakistan philippines poland russia saudi arabia tajikistan tunisia turkey turkmenistan uzbekistan and yemen crs9 hivaids pandemic the millennium challenge corporation mcc is new aid delivery concept authorized by congress and established in early 2004 in pl 108 199 that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of us resources in few low and lowmiddle income countries that have demonstrated strong commitment to political economic and social reforms if fully funded 5 billion will be available by fy2006 to support these best development performers in order to accelerate economic growth and lower the number of people living in absolute poverty addressing global health problems has further become core us aid objective in recent years congress created separate appropriation account for child survival and health activities in the mid1990s and increased funding for international hivaids and other infectious disease programs president bushs announcement at his 2003 state of the union message of fiveyear 15 billion effort to combat aids malaria and tuberculosis has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective beyond these recently emerging foreign policy goals other prominent objectives that have continued since the early 1990s have included supporting peace in the middle east through assistance to israel egypt jordan and the palestinians fostering democratization and stability for countries in crisis such as bosnia haiti rwanda kosovo and liberia facilitating democratization and free market economies in central europe and the former soviet union suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking through assistance to colombia and other andean drugproducing countries and alleviating famine and mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world foreign operations and state department funding trends foreign operations appropriations trends as shown in figure 1 foreign operations funding levels expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation have fluctuated widely over the past 30 years6 after peaking at over 35 billion in fy1985 constant fy2006 dollars 6 some of these swings in budget levels are not the result of policy decisions but are due to technical budget accounting changes involving how congress scores various programs for example the large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as offbudget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than only the partial appropriation required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown here can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign operations appropriations over the past 29 years crs10 foreign operations appropriations began period of decline to lowpoint of 146 billion in fy1997 with only brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for panama and nicaragua 1990 countries affected by the gulf war 1991 and the former soviet states 1993 arguing that declining international affairs resources seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events clinton administration officials and outside groups vigorously campaigned to reverse the decadelong decline in the foreign policy budget foreign aid spending increased slightly in fy1998 but beginning the following year and continuing to the present foreign operations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special and in some cases unanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives while funding for regular continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period supplemental spending for special activities such as central american hurricane relief fy1999 kosovo emergency assistance fy1999 wye rivermiddle east peace accord support fy2000 counternarcotics initiative in colombia and the andean region fy2000 aid to the front line states in the war on terrorism and iraqwar related assistance fy2003fy2005 was chiefly responsible for the growth in foreign aid appropriations figure 1 foreign operations funding trends although foreign operations appropriations had been rising for five consecutive years amounts approved in fy2003 and fy2004 reached unprecedented levels compared with funding over the past 40 years substantial supplementals of 75 billion and 212 billion respectively for assistance to the front line states in the war crs11 on terrorism and afghanistan and iraq reconstruction pushed spending upward foreign operations spending for fy2004 41 billion constant fy2006 dollars was the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s the enacted level for fy2005 of 2275 billion in constant terms and including supplemental appropriations while less than the previous two years is the

importance of supplementals supplemental resources for foreign operations programs which in fy2004 exceeded regular foreign operations funding have become significant channel of funding for us international activities due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the us national interest to respond it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources from time to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle supplementals have provided resources for such major foreign policy events as the camp david accords fy1979 central america conflicts fy1983 africa famine and middle east economic downturn fy1985 panama and nicaragua government transitions fy1990 the gulf war fy1991 and bosnia relief and reconstruction fy1996 but after period of only one significant foreign aid supplemental in eight years beginning in fy1999 congress approved foreign operations supplemental appropriations exceeding 1 billion in each of the past six years relief for central american victims of hurricane mitch kosovo refugees and victims of the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in fy1999 totaled 16 billion and was followed in fy2000 by 11 billion supplemental largely to fund the presidents new counternarcotics initiative in colombia as part of 40 billion emergency supplemental to fight terrorism enacted in september 2001 president bush and congress allocated 14 billion for foreign aid activities in fy2001 and fy2002 another 115 billion supplemental cleared congress in fy2002 to augment afghan reconstruction efforts and assist other frontline states in the war on terrorism crs12 figure 2 supplemental funding for foreign

billion iraq war supplemental for fy2003 however went well beyond these standards representing nearly onethird of the fy2003 foreign operations budget and was surpassed as noted above only by fy2004 supplemental appropriations which more than doubled the foreign operations budget for the year congress approved another large foreign operations supplemental for fy2005 252 billion largely for additional afghan reconstruction tsunami disaster relief and additional aid for sudan representing about 11 of total appropriations for that year7 state departmentbroadcasting appropriation trends over the past nearly three decades the funding level for the state department and international broadcasting has reflected generally an upward trend although there were few brief periods of declining resources appropriations continually climbed to the point where the fy2006 budget request is more than double what it was in the 19781984 time period 7 the fy2005 supplemental included 352 billion in new foreign operations funds but 1 billion rescission of fy2003 economic aid to turkey lowered the net supplemental to 252 billion crs13 many of the spikes in funding over the years were related to overseas security issues since the vietnam war american embassies have increasingly been the targets of hostile action terrorist attacks grew in number in the 1970s the decade ending with the taking of american hostages in tehran in 1979 similarly in the early 1980s the state department recognized greater need to tighten security after the 1983 bombing of us marine barracks in beirut lebanon and the bombing of the embassy annex in beirut in 1984 in 1985 report by the advisory panel on overseas security headed by admiral bobby inman set new standards for security measures at us facilities around the world in 1986 congress provided an embassy supplemental appropriation to meet those standards again in august 1998 another major attack occurred on us embassies in kenya and tanzania later that year congress passed an emergency supplemental that sharply increased total state department spending and as noted above following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks several emergency supplemental appropriations raised the state department funding levels to alltime highs by fy2004 the clinton administration generally believed in multilateral approach to handling international problems and sought an expansion of involvement in international peacekeeping in 1994 the administration requested supplemental funding for peacekeeping to provide more help with cyprus and african regional efforts as well as angola iraq yugoslavia somalia haiti and mozambique congress appropriated 670 million for the peacekeeping supplemental in 1994 more than doubling the international peacekeeping account that year during this same period both congress and the administration struggled to reduce the federal deficit some members contended that with the end of the cold war peace dividend could be derived and believed that foreign policy agency funding could be trimmed to help meet growing budget pressures reorganization of the international broadcasting entities beginning in 1994 and later the consolidation of the foreign policy agencies into the department of state in 1999 reflected the mood in congress to streamline these foreign policy agencies thereby realizing budgetary savings from the outset of the george w bush administration thensecretary of state colin powell strongly asserted within the executive branch and in testimony to congress that state department resource needs had been neglected during the previous decade and that significant increases were needed to improve technology and staffing challenges the administration of foreign affairs portion of state department spending the area of the budget out of which personnel and technology costs are paid has risen from 4 billion fy2000 to nearly 68 billion in the fy2006 request an increase

mandatory retirement programs for usaid and state department officers that are not included in figures and tables the two retirement funds are scheduled to receive 425 million and 1326 million respectively for fy2005 in addition funding levels and trends discussed in this report exclude us contributions to the international monetary fund imf which are enacted periodically about every five years in foreign operations bills congress approved 179 billion for the imf in fy1999 the first appropriation since fy1993 including these large infrequent and uniquely scored imf appropriations would distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing foreign operationsstate department the fy2005 budget resolution and section 302b allocations usually appropriations committees begin markups of their spending bills only after congress has adopted budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations figure 4 budget function 150 panels under what is referred to as total 3157 billion the section 302a allocation foreign operations 2083 process section 302a is the pertinent authority in the 660 congressional budget act following this house and senate appropriations committees 40 separately decide how to allot the food aid 125 total amount available among their 301 subcommittees staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution this second step state dept 949 is referred to as the section 302b allocation foreign operations and state department funds fall within the international affairs budget function function 150 representing in most years about 67 and 30 respectively of the function total the other major component of function 150 international food assistance is funded in the agriculture spending measure crs16 how much international affairs money to allocate among each of the subcommittees with jurisdiction and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs are decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees nevertheless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the house and senate subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills on march 17 2005 both houses approved budget resolutions for fy2006 hconres 95 and sconres18 that reduce the amount of discretionary budget authority for international affairs funding compared with the presidentss request the house measure cut function 150 by about 16 billion or 47 while the senate resolution set discretionary spending roughly 350 million or 1 below the administrations proposal the final agreement on hconres 95 which cleared both houses on april 28 cut deeper into the international affairs budget function than either of the earlier resolutions as approved function 150 was set at 3137 billion for fy2006 about 24 billion or 7 less than the presidents request house and senate appropriations committees however can choose to allocate the final amount set out in the budget resolution among the various subcommittees with jurisdiction over the international affairs budget proportionally different than what the president proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities depending on other competing priorities the final allocations can diverge significantly from those assumed in the budget resolution nevertheless the size of the reduction compared with the executive request approved in the budget resolution created challenging budget picture for appropriation subcommittees with jurisdiction over foreign operations and state departmentbroadcasting programs the house appropriations committee announced its subcommittee allocations on may 5 providing 2027 billion to the foreign operations subcommittee level 255 billion or 11 below the administrations recommendation during each of the past two years the house foreign operations subcommittee was able to absorb more modest reductions to the presidents request largely by paring back large increases proposed by the president for the millennium challenge account once again the executive branch sought substantial increase for the mca doubling its budget to 3 billion as discussed elsewhere in this report even though the house subcommittee decided on june 16 again to recommend sizable cut to the mca proposal 175 billion it also had to make reductions across number of other programs and accounts in order to meet its allocation target for state department and related programs the implications of the house sec 302b allocations were less clear because these funds are merged with range of domestic agencies however the 575 billion house ssjc subcommittee allocation was 52 less than the administrations request state department programs absorbed relatively small portion of this reduction 272 million or 37 less than the request when the house appropriations committee ordered reported the ssjc measure on june 7 crs17 the situation in the senate was much different where the state foreign operations subcommittee had significantly more funds than its house counterparts to support international under its jurisdiction the senate 302b allocations issued on june 9 provide 3167 billion to the subcommittee 1 billion or 31 less than the combined state departmentforeign operations request the comparable totals for the house foreign operations and state departmentbroadcasting components of the ssjc appropriation were 29837 billion or about 6 less than the senate allocation under the senate plan the decision to reduce the mca request along the lines of the past two years was able to absorb the entire gap between the presidents request for fy2006 and the subcommittee allocation as noted elsewhere the senate passed on july 20 bill providing 18 billion for the mca 12 billion less than the request prior to finalizing the foreign operations conference agreement the committees once again revised the 302b allocations setting the budget authority cap for foreign operations at 2094 billion this level was about 670 million higher than the original house amount but over 12 billion below the senate initial mark state departmentbroadcasting funds included in the senate bill were moved to the ssjc appropriation and were not factor in the foreign operations final conference allocation foreign operationsstate department appropriations request for fy2006 on february 7 2005 the president submitted his fy2006 budget request including 228 billion for foreign operations and 98 billion for state department and related agencies appropriations these amounts were 157 and 122 respectively higher than fy2005 amounts enacted in regular nonsupplemental appropriations the combined foreign operationsstate department request of 3267 billion was 146 larger than regular fy2005 funding with passage of the fy2005 emergency supplemental appropriations hr 1268 total foreign operations for fy2005 increased to 2227 billion while state departmentbroadcasting funds rose to 1078 billion comparing the fy2006 request with the total amount enacted for fy2005 regular and supplemental found foreign operations increasing for fy2006 by about 550 million or 25 and state department and related programs decreasing by 943 million or 87 foreign operations request overview and congressional action the 157 increase over regular fy2005 appropriations proposed for foreign operations was one of the largest additions in the presidents request for discretionary spending in fy2006 by comparison the administration sought increases for two other high priority budget areas defense and homeland security of about 5 and 3 respectively crs18 despite the large overall increase for foreign operations much of the added funding was concentrated in few areas the fy2006 budget continued to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority with 9 increase in aid to the frontline states in the war on terrorism and 12 more funds for global counterterror programs resources would continue to grow for the presidents two newest foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge account mca and the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar the mca request doubled to 3 billion in fy2006 while foreign operations funds for pepfar would rise from 228 billion in fy2005 to 256 billion in the fy2006 request additional pepfar funds were proposed in the laborhhs appropriation measure bringing the total fy2005 pepfar request to 316 billion after failing to win congressional approval the past three years for contingency fund that could be used in response to unanticipated foreign policy emergencies the white house again proposed 100 million for crisis response fund the state departments international narcotics and law enforcement program would also receive significant funding boost of over 60 almost entirely to support nearly threefold increase in programs to stem opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan the administration was also seeking the transfer of about 300 million in food assistance traditionally funded in the agriculture appropriation

november 1 by housesenate negotiators and agreed to by the full house on november 4 foreign operations is set at 2094 billion for fy2006 conferees decided to separate the state department and related agencies portion of the senatepassed measure and address those funding and policy issues as part of the science state justice and commerce appropriation hr 2862 subsequently congress approved the defense department appropriation fy2006 pl 109148 that provided an additional 1315 million for usaid programs assisting in global efforts to address the avian influenza virus rescinded 25 million from the exportimport bank as an offset to pay for costs associated with hurricane katrina and reduced by 1 most discretionary budget authority accounts foreign operations accounts are reduced by an approximate 209 million due to the 1 acrosstheboard cut consequently the net foreign operations total after adjusting for supplementals rescissions and the 1 reduction is 2083 billion the net foreign operations total falls 21 billion or 93 below the presidents request and represents by far the largest cut in regular non supplemental foreign operations spending relative to the administrations proposal during the bush administration the total however remains about 14 billion higher than the regular fy2005 foreign aid spending measure excluding emergency and supplemental appropriations and falls between the housepassed 2027 billion level and the senatepassed 2216 billion amount conferees made the largest reduction to the presidents proposed 3 billion millennium challenge account paring the appropriation down to 177 billion also reduced significantly is securityrelated economic aid through the economic support fund falling 400 million or 13 below the request nearly all of this reduction comes from the decision to provide only 61 million in esf aid for iraq instead of the 360 million request conferees also deny another 99 million in assistance to iraq drawn from other aid accounts arguing that 35 billion remains unobligated from the fy2004 184 billion supplemental for iraq levels for other major esf recipients however are set at the requested amount israel 240 million egypt 495 million pakistan 300 million jordan 250 million and palestinians 150 million despite fullfunding for egypt conferees stipulate that 50 million must be allocated for democracy and political reform programs while an additional 50 million must be spent on educational initiatives for nearly every other account the conference agreement also sets spending at or somewhat below requested levels some key reductions include usaid operating expenses reduced to 630 million 50 million less than the request conflict response fund 100 million eliminated refugee aid cut to 791 million 100 million below the request crs24 debt reduction reduced to 65 million twothirds of the amount proposed the tropical forest conservation act programs receive 20 million of this total as requested and global environment facility pared to 80 million less than the 1075 million proposal in few selected areas however conferees added funds the three core bilateral development aid accounts of child survivalhealth development assistance and the global aids initiative each receive boost reflecting continuing congressional priorities in these areas the combined total of 52 billion including the avian influenza supplemental is 103 higher than the request the total amount for hivaids malaria and tuberculosis programs across all accounts is 282 billion up from the presidents 256 billion request this includes 450 million for the global fund higher than the 200 million request for family planning the conference agreement provides total of 466 million 432 million in bilateral funding and 34 million as contribution to the population fund unfpa this compares to 425 million total request conferees also expressed concern over the fy2006 proposed reductions for several countries in africa and noted their expectation that with the added funds provided in the child survival and development assistance accounts the executive would restore funds to fy2005 levels the conference agreement however does not include the senate provision corzine amendment transferring 50 million for military aid to support the african unions mission in sudan conferees stated that the administration should expeditiously request any necessary funding conferees also increased the request for aid to the former soviet states setting appropriations at 514 million or 66 more than proposed the agreement further adds to spending for the african and interamerican foundations and to voluntary contributions to international organizations for these latter organizations conferees boost funding in particular for the development program 110 million unicef 127 million and the development fund for women and its trust fund 475 million the conference measure also establishes new democracy fund account of 95 million similar to although less than senate proposal in total conferees include 1448 billion for democracypromotion activities throughout all economic aid accounts boost from the estimated current usaid funding level of about 12 billion on key policy issues the conference agreement deletes senatepassed provisions that would have reversed the socalled mexico city family planning policy and altered the kempkasten restrictions that apply to us contributions to the population fund unfpa and stipulated that portion of us assistance to egypt must support democracy human rights and governance programs conferees however include modified text of provisions added earlier regarding restrictions on aid to countries that refuse or fail to extradite certain individuals to the united states beauprez and dealchamblis amendments in both cases the conference agreement includes an executive national interest waiver the final crs25 version of hr 3057 further adopts the ban on aid to saudi arabia weiner amendment but adds language allowing such assistance if the president certifies that the saudis are cooperating with efforts to combat terrorism the conference measure also requires the secretary of state to make certain determinations in order to provide indonesia with foreign military financing and arms sales this provision however can be waived through national interest certification and does not block the provision of military training funds to indonesia fighting the war on terrorism since the terrorist attacks in september 2001 american foreign aid programs have shifted focus toward more direct support for key coalition countries and global counterterrorism efforts in total congress has appropriated approximately 462 billion in fy2002fy2005 foreign operations funding to assist the approximately 28 frontline states in the war on terrorism implement antiterrorism training programs and address the needs of postconflict iraq and other surrounding countries frontline states are those nations cooperating with the united states in the global war on terrorism or are facing terrorist threats themselves nearly half of all foreign operations appropriations the past four years have gone for terrorism or iraq warrelated purposes although there is disagreement regarding the extent to which foreign aid can directly contribute to reducing the threat of terrorism most agree that economic and security assistance aimed at reducing poverty promoting jobs and educational opportunities and helping stabilize conflictprone nations can indirectly address some of the factors that terrorists use to recruit disenfranchised individuals for their cause the fy2006 budget continued the priority of fighting terrorism with 58 billion or 25 of foreign operations resources assisting the frontline states the largest frontline state recipients for fy2006 include afghanistan 920 million pakistan 698 million jordan 462 million and iraq 4585 million including refugee funds while the fy2006 request changed little in the size and composition of bilateral assistance for these countries that play key roles in the war on terror questions were raised over the proposals for afghanistan and iraq the 920 million aid package for afghanistan while similar in size to amounts appropriated in the fy2005 regular foreign operations measure did not include military assistance to train and equip the afghan army an activity that received around 400 million in foreign operations funding for fy2004 and fy2005 instead the administration proposed placing military aid programs under the direction of the defense department and sought 13 billion for such purposes in the fy2005 emergency supplemental hr 1268 military assistance programs have maintained long tradition of falling under the policy authority of the secretary of state and civilian diplomats at the department with dod given responsibility to manage the operations congress approved the shift from foreign operations to defense department funds for afghan military aid in the fy2005 emergency supplemental but only after adding the requirement that the secretary of state must concur with dod decisions over how to program these funds crs26 the fy2006 request for frontline states also differed from previous proposals in that for the first time iraq reconstruction funds were sought in regular rather than an emergency spending measure since congress approved 1844 billion for iraq in the fy2004 emergency supplemental pl 108106 additional foreign operations funds have been requested until fy200610 the administrations 414 million would largely focus on democracy and governance activities 130 million and economic reconstruction 230 million at the time of the budgets submission some critics argued that since large portions of the 1844 billion remained unobligated and even larger amounts were unspent there were sufficient funds available to meet current and future reconstruction needs in iraq more recently the pace of reconstruction spending increased as of october 26 2005 1477 billion or 81 of amounts appropriated in pl 108106 had been obligated and about 49 of the 1844 billion total had been spent11 antiterrorism training and technical assistance programs also would rise by 12 above fy2005 levels as illustrated in table 6 table 6 global counterterrorism

1844 billion appropriated in pl 108106 pakistan was set to receive 80 million less than the 10 the fy2005 emergency supplemental includes 57 billion as requested for iraq security forces training

recommended by the house at the requested level 462 million for afghanistan the house recommendation earmarked 954 million in total aid roughly the level requested but added some conditions to the assistance the house appropriations committee expressed concern over the lack of cooperation of the afghan government at the local level and the lack of support at the national level for usfunded opium poppy eradication efforts consequently the house reduced from 184 million to 135 million the budget request for afghan counternarcotics aid and required report prior to the obligation of any funds for such purposes regarding the overall us strategy for assisting afghanistan to counter poppy cultivation fight heroin trafficking and implement alternative development programs while fully funding the 430 million esf request for afghanistan the house barred the expenditure of 205 million of the funds until the secretary of state certified that the local and national government of afghanistan was fully cooperating with the united states on narcotics eradication and interdiction efforts like the house the senate measure did not establish precise funding level for war on terror programs unlike the house however the senate bill fully funded country aid levels as requested for key partners in the global war on terrorism amounts for jordan pakistan indonesia iraq and others were provided at amounts sought by the executive branch funds for afghanistan were set at 920 million senate floor amendment that cut by 100 million esf appropriations however could have placed some constraints on assistance in the war on terror since the esf account is primary source of funds for this purpose the conference agreement on hr 3057 follows many of the housepassed provisions regarding programs supporting the war on terror the esf account falls about 400 million below the request and 300 million less than the senate amount much of the reduction comes from cut to esf funding for iraq which is set at 61 million rather than the 360 million proposal for afghanistan hr 3057 provides 9314 million in total assistance level between the house and senatepassed measures conferees also require the withholding of 225 million in esf funding until the secretary of state certifies that national and local governments are fully cooperating with us counternarcotics and interdiction efforts in afghanistan as shown in table 6 hr 3057 as passed the house proposed 147 million for several specific counterterrorism programs slightly higher than for fy2005 but 12 million less than the presidents request the senate companion measure fully funds the executives proposal conferees operating under additional funding constraints set levels at 146 million below both house and senate amounts and 13 million below the request crs28 the millennium challenge account12 the largest funding increase in the fy2006 foreign operations budget is for the millennium challenge account mca foreign aid program announced in early 2002 and created in february 2004 the mca is designed to radically transform the way the united states provides economic assistance concentrating resources on small number of best performing developing nations mca funds are managed by new millennium challenge corporation mcc which provides assistance through competitive selection process to developing nations that are pursing political and economic reforms in three areas ruling justly promoting good governance fighting corruption respecting human rights and adhering to the rule of law investing in people providing adequate health care education and other opportunities promoting an educated and healthy population and fostering enterprise and entrepreneurship promoting open markets and sustainable budgets if fully implemented and funded at its 5 billion per year target level the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half century outpaced only by the marshall plan following world war ii and the latin america focused alliance for progress in the early 1960s the mca concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to the principles and policies of free market economy and democracy and where governments are committed to implementing reform measures in order to achieve such goals the mca differs in several fundamental respects from past and current us aid practices the size of the 5 billion commitment the competitive process that will reward countries for past actions measured by 16 objective performance indicators the pledge to segregate the funds from us strategic foreign policy objectives that often strongly influence where us aid is spent and the requirement to solicit program proposals developed solely by qualifying countries with broadbased civil society involvement the request for fy2006 was 3 billion twice the amount appropriated for fy2005 but less than the 5 billion fy2006 target that the president pledged when he announced the initiative in march 2002 the mccs board of directors selected 23 countries13 to participate in the program in fy2004fy2006 and the corporation 12 for complete discussion of the millennium challenge account its current status and future challenges see crs report rl32427 the millennium challenge account implementation of new us

mozambique namibia nicaragua senegal sri lanka tanzania and vanuatu crs29 signed its first five agreements or compacts with madagascar honduras cape verde nicaragua and georgia between april and september 2005 some members of congress however believe the initiative has started more slowly than they had anticipated spending only small amounts of the roughly 25 billion appropriated in total for fy2004 and fy2005 doubling the budget of an untested foreign aid program while other traditional development assistance programs are scheduled for reductions in fy2006 they assert may not be the best allocation of foreign operations resources the mcc argues however that the signing of additional compacts will accelerate in the coming months that existing resources are likely to be fully committed by the end of calendar 2005 and that an additional 3 billion is necessary to finance new countries selected for fy2006 programs congressional action the housepassed bill recommended hr 3057 175 billion for the mca in fy2006 262 million higher than fy2005 but 125 billion below the presidents request the house appropriations committee noted however that the reduction stems solely from the constrained budget environment and the need to allocate resources to other presidential and congressional priorities in order to operate in fy2006 with reduced resources the committee recommended that the corporation not use funds for amending and increasing existing compacts but to maximize resources for new compacts with available appropriations the senate measure also hr 3057 provided slightly higher mca appropriation of 18 billion the senate committee in its report hrept 10996 also said that the constrained budget allocation was one reason for the reduced appropriation the senate panel however further noted that the mcc had obligated less than 34 million of the nearly 25 billion in existing funds and that the average value to the two signed compacts was about onehalf of what the corporation stated in its budget justification the committee further expressed concern about coordination and consistency with other us aid programs in mca countries and directed the secretary of state to report on these issues including an assessment of whether mca programs were duplicative of usaid or other aid activities in compact countries the conference agreement provides 177 billion for the mca presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar in his january 2003 state of the union address president bush pledged to increase substantially us financial assistance for preventing and treating hivaids especially in the most heavily affected countries in africa and the caribbean the president promised 15 billion over five years 10 billion of which would be money above and beyond current funding most but not all pepfar funds are included in the foreign operations bill the balance is provided in the laborhhs appropriation measure the program aims to prevent 7 million new infections provide antiretroviral drugs for 2 million infected people and provide care for 10 million infected people including orphans in the 15 focus countries where much of the additional crs30 resources are concentrated these 15 nations 12 in subsaharan africa14 plus haiti guyana and vietnam are among the worlds most severely affected and where about half of the current 39 million hivpositive people live the new funds are channeled through the state departments global hivaids initiative ghai an office headed by the united states global aids coordinator randall tobias the aids coordinator oversees not only the ghai programs in the focus countries but also the hivaids programs of usaid and other agencies in both focus and nonfocus countries for fy2006 the president requested total of 316 billion for the international hivaids initiative 256 billion in foreign operations up from the 29 billion enacted for fy2005 228 billion in foreign operations as shown in table 7 however the increased budget request concentrated new resources in the state departments ghai program where funding for the 15 focus countries increases by over onethird bilateral hivaids assistance for nonfocus countries remained at roughly the same level in the fy2006 request while usaid bilateral malaria and tuberculosis appropriations would decline by 35 contentious executivelegislative issue in the past has been how much to allocate out of the pepfar budget for us contribution to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the fund is an international organization established in 2001 to receive contributions from countries that will finance hivaids tuberculosis malaria and broad public health programs in nations facing acute health crisis some believe the presidents plan is too strongly unilateral and argue for the united states to act in closer cooperation with other countries and donors particularly the global fund since fy2003 congress has boosted the presidents annual 200 million request for the global fund to between 350 million and 550 million the president proposed 300 million for the global fund for fy2006 still well below congressional appropriations the past three years congressional action in total the housepassed measure hr 3057 provided 2695 billion for pepfar programs under the foreign operations jurisdiction over 500 million more than in fy2005 and 131 million more than requested for fy2006 of this total hr 3057 included 232 billion specifically for hivaids activities the remaining funds were available for malaria and tuberculosis programs under the pepfar initiative for the global fund the house recommended 400 million double the presidents request15 in further change to the administrations request the house increased from 320 million to 350 million usaid bilateral hivaids programs for nonfocus countries and stipulates that 50 million of appropriations provided to the state departments coordinator for the global aids initiative be available only for nonfocus nations this and other 14 these 12 countries are botswana cote divoire ethiopia kenya mozambique namibia nigeria rwanda south africa tanzania uganda and

when foreign operations totals are combined with amounts in the laborhhs and defense department appropriation measures pepfar funding level for fy2006 total 345 billion keeping pace on progress towards meeting the presidents 15 billion fiveyear plan development and humanitarian assistance funding priorities account restructuring and policy differences continuing source of disagreement between the executive branch and congress is how to allocate the roughly 3 billion core budget for usaid development assistance and global health programs among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in recent years have been programs supporting child survival basic education and as noted above efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases the administration has also backed these programs but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors in years when congress has increased appropriations for its priorities but not included corresponding boost in the overall development aid budget resources for other aid sectors such as economic growth and the environment have been substantially reduced this was more problematic during the midtolate 1990s when worldwide development aid funding fell significantly in more recent years and especially since fy2003 congress increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could be funded without significant reductions for nonearmarked activities nevertheless administration officials continue to argue that such practices undermine their flexibility to adjust resource allocations to changing global circumstances most recently usaid administrator natsios told the house foreign operations subcommittee that part of the problem lay with development contractors non governmental organizations ngos trade associations universities and other groups that have become major implementors of usaid development assistance programs these organizations and individuals he asserts lobby congress to earmark higher funds for programs the groups manage mainly in the social sectors but ignore other development programs such as those supporting agriculture infrastructure institutional capacity building and governance the result according to administrator natsios is that the areas of usaids budget that are not earmarked crs33 get squeezed by resource requirements mandated in foreign operations appropriation bills leaving serious funding gaps in conducting broad comprehensive and wellintegrated development assistance strategy16 table 8 development assistance funding in millions fy06 fy05 fy2004 fy2005 fy2006 actual estimate request

disagreements all sides agree that the bush administration has increased significantly overall funding for us development and humanitarian aid activities underpinned by the launch of the pepfar and mca initiatives this trend would continue in fy2006 under the presidents request in which total development assistance would grow by over 17 billion or 29 see table 8 concern expressed frequently by development aid proponents and some members of congress however is that the two new initiatives were intended to be an additional source of international development funding not substitute for traditional programs while the state departments global aids initiative account the major element of the pepfar program and the mca program have grown to represent combined 5 billion in the presidents fy2006 request over 21 billion higher than for fy2005 the budget recommendations for the longstanding traditional usaid 16 testimony of usaid administrator andrew natsios before the house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee april 20 2005 figures shown in table 9 illustrate some of these points made by administrator natsios comparing amounts requested in fy2005 for specific programs with those enacted by congress show substantial reduction in the enacted level for the categories of agricultureenvironment and economic growth conversely there are significant increases between requested and enacted for the areas of child survival vulnerable children other infectious diseases and family planning crs34 accounts of development assistance and child survival and health programs are about 370 million or 12 less than approved for fy2005 looking below the account level at sector allocations perhaps more informative analysis of the fy2006 proposal is to look not at the totals but to compare funding levels recommended for individual components of development assistance this broadens the scope of foreign operations account to include both the core development aid accounts and other funding channels such as the economic support fund assistance to eastern europe and states of the former soviet union and alternative development programs funded under the andean counterdrug initiative using this broader scope of comparison as illustrated in table 9 mixed picture emerges regarding the fy2006 budget proposal the administration seeks substantial increase in economic growth 19 higher education 30 and conflict management 20 activities with smaller increases proposed for agriculture 2 child survival 5 and democracygovernance 7 conversely large cuts are proposed in most health categories vulnerable children 63 other infectious diseases 28 family planning 3 and contributions to the global aids fund as well as reductions for human rights 21 and basic education programs

conference report congress directed the administration to allocate all focuscountry assistance out of the global aids account and not from the child survivalhealth account as result there was sharp reduction in the amount of hivaids funding allocated from the child survivalhealth account from the requested level but corresponding increase in the global aids account that is not shown in this table congressional action as passed by the house hr 3057 restored much of the funding reductions proposed by the administration for various development and health accounts for the child survival and health account hr 3057 provided nearly 15 billion 250 million higher than the presidents request house recommendations increased levels for all areas of the account including vulnerable children 25 million infectious diseases other than hivaids 200 million reproductive health 375 million and child survival and maternal health 347 million including children and health funding in other accounts esf and fsu the total in the bill equals 174 billion 245 million or 16 higher than the 15 billion request shown in table 9 the house proposal further increased funding for the development assistance account by net total of 82 million after taking into account the readjustment of funds between this account and the transition initiative program see directly below for discussion of this issue the senate companion bill pushed these housepassed amounts higher funding for the child survival and health account was set at 500 million or 40 higher than the request the development assistance account after adjusting for the transition initiative proposed change grew by 300 million over the request like the house measure the senate bill restored most of the reductions in spending recommended by the executive branch conferees followed the guidance set out in house and senatepassed bills by increasing both the child survival and development assistance accounts well above the proposed levels although in both cases the marks fall closer to the lower house amounts child survival programs receive 1585 billion 26 higher than the request while development assistance activities are funded at

funding targets specified in house and senate foreign operations bills and committee reports targets are not set for all programs in each bill or in the administrations request but are selectively identified often to establish minimum amounts for development aid activities of special congressional importance usaid appropriation account realignment proposals for fy2006 the administration proposed to realign four appropriation accounts one of which is in the agriculture appropriation bill that would require action by the foreign operations subcommittees the rationale in each case according to executive branch officials was to provide usaid with greater flexibility and the means to respond more effectively and appropriately to rapidly changing development needs broadening the transition initiatives account growing concern among us national security and development officials is the threat posed to us interests and the complexities of addressing the needs of fragile failing and post conflict states last year the state department created an office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization ocrs in order to strengthen the us capacity to deal with such countries which can be the source of regional instability and terroristscriminal operations the senate has under consideration legislation that would authorize an expansion of the ocrs see s 600 while funding for the coordinators office is included in the state department appropriations budget request related to this effort is proposal by usaid to transfer economic growth and democracy program resources currently funded in the development assistance account for four fragile states and place them in the agencys transition initiatives account the fy2006 usaid request recommended that 275 million in development aid for ethiopia sudan haiti and afghanistan be shifted to the account and combined with the traditional transition initiatives budget for total appropriation request of 325 million see table 8 above the account which was established about 10 years ago supports countries that face crisis or are in transition from conflict to stable development it is form of assistance that can bridge the gap between strictly humanitarian intervention and the establishment of permanent longterm development strategy in the past congress has approved core appropriation to the office at usaid from which funds are allocated as needs emerge annual appropriations have ranged between 40 and 55 million the fy2006 request marked the first time that usaid would manage full country development assistance program out of the account from the agencys perspective this offers greater flexibility funds are available notwithstanding restrictions and conditions that might otherwise apply to development aid resources and would permit usaid officials to design programs aimed at achieving results in shorter time frame than the current fiveyear development program time horizon crs38 at present the account does not include congressional country or programmatic earmarks and permits shorter congressional review period for new activities agency officials argue that this shift would avoid the more common six twelve month period for regular development aid program to make its way through the contracting and congressional notification processes17 besides making it more difficult to compare usaid program funding priorities for fy2006 with fy2005 an issue noted above some members have questioned why this account realignment was necessary some wondered whether the change would erode congressional oversight of aid programming in these highly volatile environments it was also unclear how these fragile state usaid programs would fit into the broader us strategy addressing failing and fragile countries overseen by the ocrs for fy2006 usaid said that its field missions would manage the programs in the same way that they currently operate regular development assistance activities shifting conditions for food aid programing the administration also sought to transfer 300 million from the socalled pl480 title ii food assistance program18 funded in the annual agriculture appropriation bill to the international disaster and famine assistance idfa account in foreign operations this would not result in net gain or loss of resources available for international food aid but change considerably how the 300 million could be programmed currently pl480 assistance must be used to purchase us commodities and transported for the most part on ships owned by american firms idfa resources have such conditions attached buy america and cargo preference required by pl480 help us agricultural and maritime interests but add costs to the shipment of commodities overseas the administration argued that the proposal substantially improves the developmental impact of food aid by allowing the 300 million to purchase commodities in developing nations thereby providing additional markets and income sources to local farmers in some cases the commodities may come from an area close to an emergency situation helping deliver the food more quickly and at far lower cost transportation expenses of pl480 commodities often can equal the value of the food itself some in congress however opposed this realignment of the pl480 and idfa accounts to them it represented further erosion of support for american farmers they also raised questions regarding the quality of foreign purchased commodities and whether proper standards and inspections are in place to ensure that the emergency food supplies are suitable these critics contended that food could be prepositioned near famineprone regions so that commodities could be made able immediately congressional action house senate and conference measures each deny both of the account realignment initiatives proposed by the administration in the 17 see comments by usaid administrator natsios before the council on foreign relations april 20 2005 18 title ii of the agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 pl 83480 title ii authorizes grant food aid for both emergency and nonemergency purposes crs39 case of the transition initiative proposal the house appropriations committee noted that the flexibility provided for programs was intended for targeted situations and not meant for total usaid aid in specific country due to funding constraints the committee did not recommend moving 300 million from the pl 480 program to usaids disaster and famine assistance account the senate measure however increased the level for regular disaster and famine assistance by 445 million in related house action hr 2744 the fy2006 agriculture appropriations bill provides 1107 billion for title ii of pl 480 222 million more than requested however the combined house action on hr 2744 and the foreign operations bill would result in cut to the administration food aid request of 78 million the senate agriculture appropriations subcommittee has recommended somewhat higher pl 480 funding level 115 billion also hr 2744 family planning and unfpa policy controversies19 us population assistance and family planning programs overseas have sparked continuous controversy during foreign operations debates for nearly two decades for fy2006 the administration requests 425 million for international reproductive health and family planning programs an amount that includes 25 million for the population fund unfpa in the event the organization is declared eligible for us assistance this represents cut of 8 from the combined 462 million available in fy2005 for total family planning programs although funding considerations have at times been heatedly debated by congress the most contentious family planning issues addressed in nearly every annual congressional consideration of foreign operations bills have focused on two matters whether the united states should contribute to the population fund unfpa if the organization maintains program in china where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years and whether abortionrelated restrictions should be applied to bilateral usaid population aid grants commonly known as the mexico city policy unfpa funding during the reagan and george hw bush administrations the united states did not contribute to unfpa because of concerns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in china where unfpa maintains programs in 1985 congress passed the socalled kempkasten amendment which has been made part of every foreign operations appropriation since barring us funds to any organization that supports or participates in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in 1993 president clinton determined that unfpa despite its presence in china was not involved in the management of coercive program from 1993 through the end of the decade in most years congress appropriated about 25 million for unfpa but added directive that required that the amount be reduced by however much unfpa 19 for more extensive discussion of the these controversies surrounding us family planning programs and unfpa contributions see crs issue brief ib96026 population assistance and family planning programs issues for congress crs report rl30830 international family planning the mexico city policy and crs report rl32703 the population fund background and the us funding debate all by larry nowels crs40 spent in china consequently the us contribution has fluctuated between 215 million and 25 million for fy2002 president george w bush requested 25 million for unfpa congress provided in the fy2002 foreign operations bill not more than 34 million for unfpa but after the white house placed hold on unfpa funds in january 2002 and sent state department team to investigate in july 2002 secretary of state powell announced that unfpa was in violation of the kempkasten provision and that funds would be withheld although congress has continued to earmark funds for unfpa in subsequent foreign operations bills the administration has continued to find unfpa ineligible under the kempkasten restrictions and has redirected the earmarked funds for other womens programs the state department announced the most recent determination on september 17 2005 once again finding unfpa in violation of the kempkasten provision under the terms of the fy2005 foreign operations appropriation the 34 million unfpa earmark will be used by usaid for bilateral family planning maternal and reproductive health programs mexico city policy the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began over three decades ago in 1973 when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administration and later the george h w bush administration restricted funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortionrelated work subsequently on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president george w bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator to rescind the 1993 memorandum of president clinton and to direct the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care on february 15 2001 the day on which fy2001 population aid funds became available for obligation usaid issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the presidents directive the guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy applied crs41 critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds they believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions opponents also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating situation in which the united states challenges their decisions on how to spend their own money they further argue that us policy in effect imposes gag order on the ability of foreign ngos and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations this would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states critics note supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving americantaxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the certification process they contend closes the fungibility loophole since reinstatement of the mexico city policy in early 2001 several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy but except for language included in the senate fy2004 foreign operations appropriations bill s 1426 none has passed either the house or senate and measure has been enacted into law on april 5 2005 the senate approved 5246 an amendment by senator boxer to s 600 that would effectively overturn the mexico city policy s 600 an omnibus foreign policy and aid authorization bill remains under consideration in the senate and has not received final vote congressional action as passed by the house hr 3057 earmarked bilateral family planning aid at 432 million for fy2006 with an additional 34 million contribution to unfpa the combined total of 466 million compared with the administrations request of 425 million the house recommendation however continued all existing restrictions on such funds including the kempkasten provisions that has resulted in funds for unfpa in recent years in the event that unfpa is found to be ineligible for us support the house measure required that the funds be used by usaid for bilateral family planning programs20 in the senate the companion bill provided somewhat higher funding levels than the house as well as altered key conditions under which the money is available the senate bill included 450 million for usaid bilateral programs and 35 million unfpa contribution the unfpa funds must be kept in separate account by the organization cannot be spent in china and cannot be used to fund abortions if the administration finds unfpa ineligible for us support the senate measure 20 in debate on unfpa in related appropriation the house on june 16 defeated 192233 an amendment by representative maloney that would have prohibited the use of funds in the science state justice and commerce appropriation hr 2862 to prohibit or restrict funding for unfpa crs42 directs that funds drawn from the international organizations and programs account 20 million shall be transferred to usaid for additional bilateral family planning activities under the terms of an amendment offered by senators leahy clinton and others and approved by the full senate unfpa contributions would be available only for six purposes safe child birth and emergency obstetric care obstetric fistula treatment and care contraceptive supplies for preventing pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases including aids restoration of maternal health care in locations hit by natural disasters elimination of female genital mutilation and access by unaccompanied women and other vulnerable individuals to vital services hr 3057 as passed the senate further included modified kempkasten language that appears to narrow the terms under which unfpa can be declared ineligible for us funding the senate language stated that an organization cannot receive funds if it directly supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization the term directly is not currently part of the kempkasten restriction the senate measure further stated that an organization cannot be found in violation of this condition only because the government of country in which the organization operates conducts coercive practices this would represent new exception to past applications of the kempkasten language the senate bill further included language that would effectively reject the presidents mexico city policy this provision is similar to the text of an amendment offered by senator boxer to s 600 and adopted 5246 by the senate on april 5 the senate appropriation bill language stated that foreign ngos shall not be ineligible for us funds solely on the basis of health or medical services they provide including counseling and referral services with nonus government funds this exemption would apply so long as the services did not violate the laws of the country in which they are performed and that they would not violate us laws if provided in the united states the provision further provided that nonus government funds used by foreign ngos for advocacy and lobbying activities shall be subject to conditions that also apply to us ngos since it is largely held that american ngos would not be subject to these restrictions under the constitutional protection of free speech it is possible that this latter exemption would lift current prohibitions that apply to overseas ngos the white house opposed both the kempkasten and mexico city policy changes and said the president would veto hr 3057 if they were included in the final bill conferees agreed to drop senatepassed language modifying the mexico city and kempkasten restrictions leaving current policy in place on funding questions the conference agreement provides 432 million for bilateral family planning programs plus an additional 34 million for unfpa if the organization is eligible under the terms of kempkasten if found ineligible the conference agreement states crs43 that unfpa funds would become available for bilateral family planning activities conferees did not include the leahyclinton amendment setting out specific activities for which unfpa contributions could support conflict response fund the administration proposed to establish within the state department 100 million contingency fund to allow the united states to respond quickly to unforseen foreign crises with resources targeting immediate stability and reconstruction needs this would include funding the capacity to mobilize and deploy an emergency civilian presence in the field in the past congress has been reluctant to approve this type of contingency fund for which it can apply little oversight the administration had asked lawmakers to launch somewhat similar crisis funds in several recent emergency supplemental and foreign operations appropriation requests proposals that were rejected in each case the conflict response fund however differs from these previous requests in that it is linked with broad state department strategy to more effectively respond to weak fragile and postconflict states that can pose serious security risks for the united states in mid2004 with considerable encouragement by senator lugar and other members of congress the department created the office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization to manage the us government civilian response to crisis and unstable situations and is seeking funds to form and train civilian ready response corps presumably the conflict response fund could be utilized by the coordinator as an operational tool in the immediate aftermath of an international crisis where american interests were threatened previous requests for contingency funds had placed control of the money in the white house and did not link the resources with specific us policy initiative congressional action although denying the 100 million for the conflict response funds the house bill granted authority to the administration to reprogram funds from other accounts subject to congressional notification for the same purposes as proposed for the fund in the senate the companion measure provided 24 million for the fund the reported bill had provided 74 million but an amendment by senator corzine transferred 50 million to the fmf account for additional support for the african unions mission in sudan the conference agreement like the house denies funding for the conflict response fund conferees however ask the administration to submit prior to the fy2007 budget request more specific strategy for how the office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization will coordinate united states governmentwide efforts to respond to international postconflict contingencies other key elements of the fy2006 request and congressional action beyond these specific and prominent issues the foreign operations proposal for fy2006 seeks to increase aid activities in few areas while cutting resources for several programs significant appropriation increases and key congressional actions include the following crs44 exportimport bank resources increased in the request from 99 million to 226 million allowing the bank to guarantee about 1376 billion in loans the same as estimated for fy2005 hr 3057 as passed the house reduced the request to 158 million but permitted the administration to use the roughly 260 million that remains in the exim bank war chest for tied aid purposes to support new loans house floor amendment by representative sanders blocked eximbank loans in support of project to build nuclear power plants in china the senate measure provided slightly more than the house at 1642 million conferees set eximbank funding at 139 million below the requested house and senatepassed levels subsequently congress rescinded 25 million of eximbank appropriations in pl 109148 as one of several offsets to pay the costs associated with hurricane katrina relief usaid administrative costs would have grown substantially under the request with operating expenses climbing by 11 and capital investment costs rising by onethird the house measure provided 630 million 17 million higher than the regular fy2005 level excluding supplementals but over 50 million less than the request the senate bill set appropriations lower at 620 million the conference agreement provides 630 million peace corps spending would have increased by 9 but fall far below the level necessary to sustain the presidents initiative announced three years ago to double the number of peace corps volunteers by fy2007 hr 3057 as passed in the house proposed 325 million for the peace corps about 7 million more than fy2005 but 20 million less than the request the senate recommendation provided 320 million conferees approved 322 million refugee assistance resources would have risen by 17 in the request over fy2005 regular appropriations excluding supplementals with onethird of the additional resources for overseas programs and twothirds available for refugee admissions into the united states hr 3057 as passed the house provided 791 million 27 million above fy2005 regular spending but more than 100 million less than the fy2006 request the denial of any refugee funds for iraq 43 million would partially offset the gap between the request and the house recommendation in the senate the bill provided 900 million slightly higher than the request and about 109 million more than the house the conference agreement adopts the housepassed level of 791 million peacekeeping funds would have grown by 10 including the expansion of global peace operations initiative gpoi 114 million that trains and equips foreign troops to strengthen their capacity to support global peace support operations the program incorporates previous efforts focused exclusively in africa but with crs45 substantial increase in resources the house bill included 178 million for peacekeeping 74 million more than fy2005 regular funding but 18 million less than the request although the house appropriations committee said in its report that it supported the gpoi proposal it believed that the scope of the program beyond africa cannot be implemented fully in fy2006 and therefore reduces the gpoi request by 18 million the other major components of this account the africa contingency operations training and assistance 788 million and the multinational force observers 19 million were fully funded the senate bill recommended 196 million for the pko account slightly more than the request the total included 114 million for gpoi as requested conferees provide 175 million level below the request house and senate amounts contributions to the world banks international development association ida and to the african development fund the united states recently joined new replenishment agreements for both institutions the fy2006 request included 107 million and 31 million more respectively for ida and the african fund the housepassed measure included the full amount requested for both institutions 950 million for ida and 1357 million for the african development fund the senate bill reduced the ida level to 900 million and recommended full funding for the african fund the conference agreement includes 950 million for ida and 1357 million for the african development fund as requested contributions to the global environment facility gef the president proposed 1075 million for gef slightly higher than fy2005 and in line with scheduled us payments in the house however hr 3057 deleted all gef funds noting that gef is the only concessional international lending institution that has not implemented performancebased allocation system the senate bill fully funded the gef conferees set gef funding at 80 million for several other foreign operations accounts the fy2006 submission represented reduction below regular amounts approved in fy2005 the proposal cut funding in three main areas assistance to former soviet states and eastern europe collectively would have declined by 85 million or 10 from fy2005 levels the house recommendation reduced these accounts further setting combined funds 114 million below regular fy2005 levels in the senate the bill set funding at 960 million 84 million higher than the request for former soviet states and 13 million more for eastern europe major additions include those for russia 37 million armenia 20 million georgia 8 million ukraine 7 million kosovo 8 million and serbia 15 million the senate measure also reduced economic crs46 assistance for uzbekistan by 15 million the conference agreement provides 361 million for eastern europe and 514 million for former soviet states worldwide totals for foreign military financing fmf the main us military aid account would have declined by over 150 million or 3 under the request this reduction however was entirely the result of military aid for afghanistan 400 million in fy2005 shifting to dod appropriations adjusting for this transfer the fmf request was 5 higher than fy2005 regular levels the house provided 444 billion in fmf funding 146 million below the request the recommendation reduced requested amounts for pakistan 80 million and turkey 296 million and denies funds for uzbekistan 4 million the senate companion bill however provided 90 million more than requested for fmf with the addition of security in asia provision that increased military aid levels for the philippines and seven other regional states and 50 million additional support to the african unions mission in sudan regarding uzbekistan the senate measure conditioned but did not deny fmf on determination by the secretary of state that the government of uzbekistan is among other things making continuing substantial progress on human rights and is investigating the events of may 31 2005 the conference agreement sets fmf funding at 45 billion between the house and senate levels voluntary contributions to international organizations would have decreased 13 under the request with reductions proposed for unicef 10 million and the development program 13 million hr 3057 as passed in the house restored the proposed cuts raising amounts to 329 million 3 million more than fy2005 and 47 million more than the request the house bill provided 110 million for undp 20 million more than requested and 127 million for unicef 3 million more than fy2005 and 13 million higher than the administration the house also included 25 million of the 34 million unfpa earmark in this account the senate measure provided 330 million for the account including 128 million for unicef 110 million for undp and 20 million reserved for unfpa the conference agreement includes 3295 million with 110 million for undp 127 million for unicef and 225 million

will receive considerable amounts of us aid through worldwide emergency humanitarian assistance accounts for disaster refugee and food relief for example assistance for sudan in fy2005 totals more than 1 billion after including these emergency programs in many cases this emergency assistance is not identified on country basis it should be kept in mind however that for these selected countries us assistance is considerably higher in some years than the figures noted here another major cluster of top recipients are those in the andean region colombia peru and bolivia where the administration maintains large counternarcotics initiative that combines assistance to interdict and disrupt drug production together with alternative development programs for areas whose economies rely on the

and maintenance account by establishing new subaccount referred to as worldwide security upgrades for fy2006 the president requested 616 million for regular escm expenditures and 910 million for worldwide security upgrades for total account level of 152 billion 15 increase over fy2005 the most significant portion of funding for this account amounts needed for the us embassies in iraq and

cultural exchange act of 1961 such as the fulbright academic exchange program as well as leadership programs for foreign leaders and professionals government exchange programs came under close scrutiny in past years for being excessive in number and duplicative by july 1997 executive order23 the office of us government international exchange and training coordination was created for the

european and former soviet union countries are to be built into the base of the educational and cultural exchanges but congress did not provide the money necessary to fully fund those programs the

million slightly less than the senate for the centralized information technology modernization program international organizations and conferences in recent years us contributions to international organizations and peacekeeping activities have been complicated by number of issues such as the withholding of funds related to international family planning policies recently some controversial issues have included 1 the lack of agreement about the uns role in the current worldwide dispute on how to deal with iraq and 2 the loss of the us seat on the commission on human rights in past years overdue us arrearage payments had been an issue shortly after the september 11th terrorist attack and at time when the us government was seeking support in its coalition to fight terrorism however

the state department reorganization debate in 1999 the 105th congress agreed that credibility of us international broadcasting was crucial to its effectiveness as public diplomacy tool therefore congress agreed not to merge broadcasting functions into the state department but to maintain the broadcasting board of governors bbg as an independent agency as of october 1 1999 in 2004 the 911 commission recommended that international broadcasting receive an increase in funding and the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of fy2004 pl 108458 included language supporting programs to strengthen free and independent media in countries with muslim populations congress enacted total of 592 million for international broadcasting in fy2005 30 million more than the presidents fy2005

department traditionally has had sole authority to issue visas overseas the homeland security act of 200227 now provides the secretary of the department of homeland security dhs with exclusive authority to 1 issue regulations regarding administering and enforcing visa issuance 2 impose upon any us government employee with consent of the head of hisher agency any functions involved in visa issuance 3 assign dhs employees to each overseas post where visas are issued and 4 use the national foreign affairs training center to train dhs employees who will be involved in visa issuance the act states that these authorities will be exercised through the secretary of state the homeland security act of 2002 further provides the secretary of state and consular officers with the authority to refuse visa applications the act stipulates that within one year after the act is signed the secretary of dhs and the secretary of state must report to congress on implementation of visa issuance authorities and any proposals that are necessary to improve the activities surrounding visa issuance specifically regarding visa issuance in saudi arabia the act stipulates that upon enactment of the act the third party screening program in saudi arabia will terminate but onsite personnel of the dhs shall review all visa applications prior to adjudication there the homeland security act of 2002 did not alter the current authority for the department of state to use machine readable visa fees as part of its expenditures states total allocation of machine readable visa fees in fy2001 was 395 million in fy2002 it was 443 million in fy2003 it was 623 million and the fy2004 estimate was 688 million the fy2005 appropriation included 662 million from mrv fee collections the budget for fy2006 included request for the use of 672 million in mrv fees the fees are typically used for state department border security programs technology and personnel now as part of the war on terrorism the visa issuance process takes much longer and the usled war may have reduced demand for travel to america thus officials are seeing gap between the mrv fee total estimates and actuals the emergency supplemental appropriation helped to fill that gap in fy2004 fy2005 emergency supplemental28 on february 14 2005 president bush submitted an 82 billion supplemental appropriation request for fy2005 to

lawmakers provided 578 billion in new appropriations for state department foreign aid tsunami relief and other foreign policy activities this represents 512 million or 8 reduction to the presidents 63 billion request conferees as had earlier house and senatepassed versions of hr 1268 offset part of these costs by rescinding 1 billion in fy2003appropriated funds for aid to turkey that had not yet been obligated30 as result the net appropriation for foreign policy programs in hr 1268 is 478 billion or 15 billion below the request the entire amount is designated as emergency appropriations beyond congressional decisions to reduce selected supplemental requests the conference agreement and the 512 million cut may have significant implications for congresss consideration later this year of regular fy2006 appropriations for foreign operations and the state department in some cases house and senate appropriation committees had expressed the view that some supplemental requests did not require immediate funding and could be addressed during the debate on fy2006 appropriation bills this is particularly relevant to the funds proposed for afghanistan reconstruction and economic aid programs in southern sudan as noted earlier congress approved budget resolution for fy2006 hconres 95 that assumes reduction in the presidents foreign policy funding request of about 24 billion or 7 if house and senate appropriation committees add to the pending fy2006 request some of the items not approved in the fy2005 supplemental conference agreement the challenge of meeting the budget resolution target for international affairs program will be an even greater challenge major recommendations in pl 10913 include the following 29 with the exception of 150 million in food aid that is funded out of the agriculture appropriation bill the entire 63 billion was sought for foreign operations and state departmentbroadcasting programs 30 congress appropriated 1 billion in the fy2003 emergency supplemental pl 10811 that could be used by turkey to guarantee loans of about 85 billion to bolster its ailing economy with substantial economic recovery during the past two years turkey has not drawn on the 1 billion loan guarantee funds crs59 afghanistan reconstruction and police training 178 billion 262 million less than requested this level falls between the housepassed measure 14 billion and the senate 205 billion the conference agreement fully funded counternarcotics activities but reduces police training by 40 million darfur humanitarian aid at least 238 million roughly the amount proposed by the president the conference agreement however added 90 million in food aid worldwide some of which might be available for darfur and permitted the transfer of 50 million in support of african union peacekeeping operations in the region the house measure had increased the funding level for darfur to 3424 million the senate version approved 242 million as requested but added an additional 320 million in food assistance some of which could be used in darfur and 90 million that could have been transferred to meet humanitarian and peacekeeping needs sudan peace implementation aid 37 million as had been included in the house measure conferees deleted 63 million in rehabilitation and reconstruction funding the senate bill had included the entire 100 million request palestinian aid 200 million as requested and passed in earlier house and senate votes the conference measure set aside 50 million similar to the senate version for israel to help facilitate the movement of palestinian people and goods in and out of israel none of the funds can be used for direct aid to the palestinian authority pakistan military aid 150 million as requested jordan economic and military aid 200 million as requested iraq embassy 592 million 66 million below the request this is the same level as in the senate bill while the house measure included an amendment barring the use of the funds for construction of the embassy peacekeeping 680 million 100 million below the request the conference amount is higher than both the house 580 million and senate 442 million tsunami relief and prevention 656 million for relief and 254 million for prevention the same as in the senate bill the house passed amount was slightly higher the conference agreement provided authority but not the 45 million requested to defer and reschedule debt owed by tsunamiaffected countries the house bill had not granted such authority crs60 partners fund and solidarity fund funds were provided for the partners fund 200 million proposed while the full 200 million request for the solidarity fund was included in addition the conference agreements added 30 million for other global war on terror security assistance as determined by the president the house had denied all funding for these purposes while the senate approved 2255 million for the two contingency funds ukraine aid 60 million as requested and including in the senate measure the house had approved 337 million in addition similar to the senate the conference agreement provided 10 million for other regional aid requirements in belarus and the north caucasus haiti assistance 20 million of which 25 million for criminal case management case tracking and the reduction of pretrial detention in haiti similar to the senate position the 20 million had not been requested or included by the house iraqi families and communities affected by military operations 20 million for civilians who have suffered losses due to military
