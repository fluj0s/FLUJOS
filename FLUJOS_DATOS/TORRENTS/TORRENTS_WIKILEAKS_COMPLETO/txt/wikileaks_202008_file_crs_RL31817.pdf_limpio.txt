expected that in fy2004 almost 923000 children would receive head start services including 62000 in early head start the adminis tration contended that the increased funding coupled with the presidents proposal to allow states to administer head start in coordination with other preschool programs w ould enable the program to maintain current service levels and increase enrollment by up to 10500 children fy2004 program data are not yet availabl the fy2004 budget explained that in order to improve coor dination between head start and other federal state and local programs affecting preschool children the president plans to move responsibility for managing the head start program from the department of health and human services to the depa rtment of education14 it proposed that this transition begin in 2004 with the department of education ssuming full responsibility for the program in 2005 the administrations transfer proposal was not included in any legislative proposals introduced during the 108th congress however the house reauthorization bill hr 2210 would have allowed state administration for up to maximum of eight states the bill reported from the senate help

educator professional devel opment in fy2004 the same leve l provided in fy2003 prior to the 98000 rescission according to budget ju stifications the request would support new round of grants for use in helpin g local communities especially those with high concentrations of young children in poverty to improve the knowledge and skills of early childhood educators and care givers the fy2004 appropriations law in cluded 25 million for early childhood educator professional devel opment as requested by the president in his fy2004 budget early reading first the administration requested 100

initiative first announced by the president in april of 2002 good st art grow smart focuses on three overall areas 1 strengthening head start 2 partnering with states to improve early childhood education and 3 providing info rmation to teachers care givers and parents as mentioned above the presidents fy2004 budget proposed to transfer the head start program to the department of education as well as to provide states with the option to administer the program the head start reauthorization bill passed by the house hr 2210 did not include the proposal to transfer the program to ed but did include provisions to allow maximum of eight states to administer the program provided they meet designated requirements the administration moved ahead with two additional efforts that are in keeping with the good start grow smart initiativ but that did not require legislative changes to the head start act one is the strategic teacher education program also known as project step described by the head start bureau as comprehensive multifaceted sequential professional devel opment endeavor to ensure teachers use researchbased strategies to implement early and emergent literacy as part of this development during the summer and fa ll of 2002 3000 head start staff and 100 state child care administrators received 32 hour s of training in strategies to support childrens emerging literacy those who were trained are expected to serve as mentor coaches for staff within their respective head start programs the second effort is the development nd implementation of national reporting system that can be used to assess the effectiveness of head start programs in achieving successful outcomes for child ren in terms of school readiness particularly the areas of literacy and number knowledge th is national reporting system was implemented starting in the fall of 2003 and assesse s head start four and fiveyear olds twice year on edu cational performance measures using indicators that were
