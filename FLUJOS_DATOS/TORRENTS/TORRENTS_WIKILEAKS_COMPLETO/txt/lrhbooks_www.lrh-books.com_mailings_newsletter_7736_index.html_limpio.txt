bridge publications inc newsletter date keeping energy and pictures so when you get this car you actually have an object well this is tremendously desirablean object its big mass of energy fine theres nothing wrong with owning energy nothing wrong with owning cars or anything else but theres something wrong with the next abstraction losing the car finance company and heres car and then its gone well when that first happens to fellow he keeps picture of it its very touching and nostalgic person only keeps pictures around of things he cant have he only keeps blocks of energy around when he cant have energy isnt that sweet nostalgic and touching the only reason really matter what the preclear saysthe only reason hes got that picture the only reason hes got that picture of papa that keeps recurring to him all the time papas dog papas good and so forththe only reason hes got that picture is because he cant have papa so hes got picture of papa l ron hubbard excerpted from the first international congress of dianeticists scientologists lectures exteriorization and the creation of energy an article by l ron hubbard from the first international congress of dianeticists scientologists lectures you know every once in while somebody will walk down the street and he will need hat and hell see that theres hat sale and he will have an excess ten dollars in his pocket and hell look at the hats and theres hat there he likes very much and he looks at the hat and then walks down the street without buying the hat why well he knows his insufficiency of supply is so great that he cant have hat this is stimulusresponse it is not rational theres reasonableness to this he has the money in his pocket he has the time to go in and buy the hat he needs the hat there is the hat he wants and he doesnt buy the hat because he cant have hat why cant he have hat now you could go over and talk with somebody on this line and try to argue him into realizing that he doesnt have an insufficiency of supply and he will still have an insufficiency of supply you can reason talk cajole bribe do anything you want to this reactive mind in an effort to lead it into reasonable activity and adjudication of its environment and it will still go on being normal human being you can however reduce its motion its motion reduces but doesnt increase the reason the motion of the reactive mind doesnt actually increase in terms of controlled motion which is to say increase in terms of better procurement of energy is because it isnt manufacturing any energy it is borrowing energy from elsewhere and using it now it starts barrowing this energy from the beingness of the person himself which iswe call thetanagain mathematical symbol and the reactive mind has an insufficiency of supply and the thetan the being of the personthats you by the way people who go around talking about my thetan thinks youre just listening to some more of this reactive mind because person doesnt have another thetan hes it when he says i and what he means by i and everything he means by i is him and thats the thetan and the thetan gets lot more things added to him that are not necessarily him but hes appropriated them too and freud called it alter ego because it was nice term well in the same way we use thetan as nice term and thetan there it may be still perfectly competent to usecreate and useenergy but the reactive mind with which this being is still connected is energyhungry terrifically hungry for energy and so every time the being puts out little erg of energy the reactive mindthe thing the analytical mind is runningthe reactive mind soaks up from the actual reasonability of the person slurp what little bit of energy the reasonableness of the person puts out because of an energy starvation do you see that person could be very very competent in creating and directing energy and every time he creates little energy it sort of disappears and he doesnt quite know where it goes and before this he never knew where it went now you ask this person to exteriorize that is to say you ask this person to be at little distance from the body this will come to lot of people as shock when you do this to preclears you justin off the streetsyou just say be three feet back of your head now the fellow says all right ii am nowhey big shock he finds out just in that moment there that he doesnt happen to be an integral part of this mest thing now when hes three feet back of his head he has some little chance of putting out couple of ergs of energy without getting them soaked up as long as he doesnt have his attention immediately upon the body but if you could put him out there several miles he could then safely generate some energy because it wouldnt immediately be taken away from him by the reactive bank now the reason the reactive bank can take it away from him is because large portion of the reactive bank is his own this is just old stuff that he picked up like goats chew up tin cans and he just sort of picked this up here and that up there and hes got this old favored facsimile that he swiped someplace and hes just got junk junk junk junk all around and it didnt mean anything and it didnt do anything to him till one day he got into confluence with the body and when he got connected with the body he put this stuff into the body too like you put things into trunks in the attic and now it matches his wavelength and he can control the body better and this works out just fine only he isnt just quite sure how its working out but it works out but every time he thinks hes matching the wavelength of what he put in there and all of his controls of the body and everything hes ever taught the body is matching up with his wavelength and so every time he thinks the body picks up an energy which is creates and it starts to act as sponge on starvation of energy and as result when he makes facsimile the facsimile itself is pulled in just like it was water going into sponge and when the thetan puts out little beam of energy pam that goes into the body now im not talking about anything strange or esoteric because all of these things have been strange and esoteric one has feeling that maybe they still are but if you just take pc after pc and you say be three feet back of your head now be eight miles back of your head now thats fine now put out beam of energy now walk across the ceiling now findchange something and then now come back and pick up the body and throw it over on the couch and he does and every once in while you get preclear that does it just like that he doesnt know anything about what youre doing you have to assume if it keeps happening person after person that it must be an objective phenomenon instead of an objectionable one l ron hubbard excerpted from the first international congress of dianeticists scientologists lectures test your knowledge of the first international congress of
