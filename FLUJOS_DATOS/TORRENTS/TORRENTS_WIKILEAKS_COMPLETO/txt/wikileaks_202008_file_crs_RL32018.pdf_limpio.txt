to be administered which has subsequently raised some issues for the how the program operates for example does the fcc have the authority to use usf funds for oversight of the erate program the erate program is both highly regarded for its ability to bring telecommunications to rural and poor school s and libraries but it is also highly criticized because of the increasing incident s of fraud

owner of connect2 and th employees who were charged subsequently pleaded guilty and are barred from participating in the erate program for three years12 the sld created both task force and whistle blower hotline to deal with fraud waste and abuse th task force initially reported13 that the structure of the erate program and the ambiguity of certain policies and procedures likely contributed to wasteful program management they recommended that the sld develop and publicize list of products and services nd reasonable prices for the products and services in 2005 webbased database of ligible

ordered usac to prepare financial statements for the usf during this period it was determined that the fcdls previously discussed that were sent to grantees constituted obligations because the ada does not allow an agency or program to make financial obligations in excess of the amount that is available it was determined that the erate program was in violation of the ada as result of this discovery in august 2004 the usac suspended the mailing of additiona l fcdls for funding year 2004 and was ordered to liquidate investments to comply with the antideficiency act requirement for the fcdls that were previously issu ed it was reported that the liquidation which occurred over twoday period co st the fund approximately 46 million in immediate losses and possibly more in future interests17 during the suspended funding period it was reported that many schools were unable to continue programs that pended upon financial support from the erate program18 the decision received significant amount of attention from the media and the congress the suspended funding and lack of clarity regarding the ada resulted in the passage of the universal service antideficiency temporary suspension act pl 108494 which exem pted the usf from the antideficiency act until december 31 2005 in november 2005 it was extended by one year in the annual appropriations bill for science state ju
