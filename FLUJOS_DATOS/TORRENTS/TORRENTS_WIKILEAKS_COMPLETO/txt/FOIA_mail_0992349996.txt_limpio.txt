mannvirginiaedu rbradleygeoumassedutom crowley tomoceantamuedu mhughesltrrarizonaedukbriffaueaacuk folland chris ckfollandmetogovuk xflowed dear all id just like to echo all the points made by mike and kevin the logic behind saying that there isnt enough paleo data before 1600 yet there may have been even early millennia which experienced warming of almost 2 c per millennium escapes as kevin points out they have mixed up all the various factors that force climate on interannual to intermillennial timescales one of the main points of ipcc is to synthesize the science with particular reference to potential future changes changes in the distant past glacial and deglaciation are of less relevance to the 21st century because of differences in boundary conditions the last few hundred to thousand years are clearly more important to the near future at least from my quick reading there seems explicit reference to changes in the thermohaline circulation perhaps the paleo people on this list need to redouble their efforts to empahasize the importance of the last few thousand years stressing absolute dating calibration and verification another issue that is mixed up in the report apart from the forcing is spatial scales i will try and address these at the chicago meeting what are the 4 useful sites i just hope in the us that people read the full ipcc reports and the summaries rather than this hastily cobbled together document i also hope that europeans dont read it it has already got some air time here and may get some more with bush here this week issues like star wars and capital punishment were commented upon whilst i came to work kyoto wasnt mentioned cheers phil at 1045 110601 0400 michael mann wrote hi tom thanks for your message i know how hard you worked to make the report as balanced as possible and realize this experience must have been bit frustrating for you after all the careful and hard work you and chris put into our ipcc chapter while the idea that the limited panel involved in the nas report can provide an improved or more objective assessment of the science relative to ipcc seems of course ridiculous to lot of us but im very thankful you were on the panel needless to say my criticism below is in way directed towards you but rather some of the other panel members whom i think did real injustice to the science having seen the list of authors and reviewers of the report i think i have pretty good idea what the source of good deal of that skepticism is and i think much of it is spurious and unfair there are legitimate caveats and uncertaintiesi think weve been very honest about these in our publication and we as phil keith and others are working earnestly to improve the reconstructions but the claims we make eg the anomalousness of recent warmth are guided by the substantial uncertainties in the reconstructions which of course take into account uncertainty due to increasingly sparse information back in time and i have yet to see any legitimate argument that our reconstruction or phils toms keiths etc is wrong within the context of the diagnosed uncertainties unfortunately much of the criticsm that has been advanced recently is kneejerk and unsubstantiated particularly with regard to dendroclimatological issues which malcolm and keith can comment on best much of this has to do w lack of understanding of tree ring information to be honest tom i didnt see one name in the list of authors or reviewers of the nas report whom i think is qualified to comment on dendroclimatological climate reconstruction and its strengths and weaknesses and that is real problem in such vaccum it is easy for example for wally to wave around some highly nonstandard peerreviewed treering analysis that he has been promoting which ed cook himself coauthor on this admits makes use of questionable standardization approach in an attempt to dismiss all other climate reconstructions which use tree ring information the criticism that there are only 4 useful sites for reconstructing climate over the past 1000 years is especially irksome and ignorant does tom c agree that there are only 4 meaningful records that contribute to his reconstruction does phil or keith where does that number come from the same source as rls ghg sensitivity factor of 10 ie the ether i suspect the discussion of paleo in the report which i realize you had very limited control over is disturbingly misleading and flawed to many of us who actually work in this area there are throwaway statements about millennial trends of 2 c in global temperatures being typical during the early holocene that have basis in fact they are again probably based on this increasingly disturbing notion that arctic ice core borehole thermometry or other ice core information tells us anything at all about the hemisphere let alone globe small number of scientists are really misleading the scientific community in this regard how odd that the panel was happy to claim that there were millennial periods with 2 degree c warming in global temperature during the holocene for which there is reliable empirical evidence whatsoever and yet focuses its skepticism on much more detailed and careful assessments of the most recent millennium i think you can see why some of us are frustrated by this type of inconsistency and suspect some degree of bias or agenda at work there was clear bias in the panel in the promotion of ice cores which sample very limited portion of the globe and are very questionable in their ability to say anything about hemispheric or global temperature variations i am disturbed by this because the nas report shouldnt have been promoting particular specific area of funding it seems to have finally with regard to one of the primary supposed discrepancies in the paleo record of the past 1000 years temperature reconstructions from boreholes vs other proxies ill be presenting some results in chicago which i think youll all find quite elucidating turns out there is discrepancy after all more on that soon ill also try to confront both the real and imagined sources of uncertainty and bias in paleoreconstructions in my presentation there and we should all be able to have very healthy discussion of this i really think that there was bias in this panel which cannot be considered representative of the community as whole so i vote that we not overreact im anxious to see lindzen broecker or mike wallace publish peerreviewed critical analysis of proxy data over the past 1000 years until that day i take their comments w shaker of salt mike at 0941 am 61101 0400 thomas r karl wrote kevin i agree with most of your points it was very interesting panel i should emphasize however that the paleo record at least the last 1000 years has many critics and we really need to show how the data prior to 1600 stands up some contend there are only 4 good sites in the first part of the record i am not sure of this perhaps mike and others will explain this in chicago regards tom kevin trenberth wrote fyi some comments on the nrcnas report on the ipcc and global warming kevin trenberth 672001 while the report overall is an endorsement of the ipcc report and the process it has lot of buts in it and the overall tone is to somewhat downplay the problem it does not focus on policy relevant issues the report was done in very hurried fashion and perhaps as result there are several factual errors or misstatements and there are errors of omission my impression is that it tends to overstate the caveats and need for questioning of results and understate the certainties and likelihoods 1 in dealing with natural variability there are two aspects that are mixed in this report there is natural variability of climate that is tied to external forcings such as variations in the sun volcanoes and the orbital variations of the earth around the sun the latter is the driver for the major ice ages and interglacials the second kind of natural variability is that internal to the climate system arising from interactions between the atmosphere and ocean such as nino for instance this variability occurs even in an unchanging climate in the section dealing with this and in the summary both kinds of variability are discussed as if they are the second kind glacial to interglacial differences are discussed without any mention of the known causes and as if these can happen without cause this is misleading at best consequence is that there is clear statement that the recent warming is outside the realm of natural variability and that cause is needed and the cause is human induced changes in the atmospheric composition 2 the report does not clearly address issues in attribution of recent climate change to human activities at the end of p 3 in the summary it makes an equivocal statement it avoids the issue that the recent temperature increase is outside any estimates of natural variability without any forcings what else is the warming due to on p 14 it does not sum up the forcings and make clear statement about the total nowhere does it say that the recent warming has to be because of an increase in heating this reasoning also put limits on how large aerosol cooling can be on p 17 the ambiguity over the term natural forcing is used to say that causal link can not be unequivocally established it does not mention estimates of variability from the paleo record and how well they agree or not with model estimates it does not note on p 17 that many models show the signal of greenhouse gas effects emerging from the noise of natural variability about 1980 the attribution statement is weak 3 several statements about the hydrological cycle rainfall and warming are misleading and even wrong one direct consequence of this is that statements about changes in extremes are missing understated and incorrect another is to understate the threats in the tropics and subtropics it begins in the first sentence of the summary greenhouse gases are accumulating as result of human activities causing surface air temperatures and subsurface temperatures to rise later in the paragraph it states secondary effects are suggested by computer model simulations and basic physical reasoning these include increases in rainfall rates and increased susceptibility of semiarid regions to drought while the first statement is true is is misleading the increased greenhouse gases cause increased heating also called radiative forcing in this report it is also referred to as warming the latter term is ambiguous and misused in this report by confusing where it should mean heating versus where it should mean increased temperature so while some of the increased heating does in fact cause an increase in surface temperature much of the heating goes into evaporation of surface moisture this changes the moisture content of the atmosphere and rainfall this increase in the hydrological cycle is not secondary effect it is primary one moreover the increase in atmospheric moisture content is much greater than the increase in evaporation because it is controlled by the temperature which determines the water holding capacity of the atmosphere through the socalled clausius clapeyron effect while the evaporation is controlled by the surface heating for doubled co2 evaporation and the overall hydrological cycle speeds up by about 3 but the moisture in the atmosphere increases by about 6 per degree c or about 15 for doubling of co2 the rainfall intensity is determined by the available moisture and so it increases at about the latter rate but the total precipitation increases only at the former rate and so the frequency of precipitation must decrease in some way this also means that the residence time for water vapor increases in world with increased heating the increased drying means increased risk of drought everywhere not just semiarid locations and increased intensity increases risk of floods these increases in risk of extremes are direct consequences and are not adequately mentioned in the section on future climate change p 19 one statement is wrong an increase in the recycling rate of water in the hydrological cycle is anticipated in response to higher global average temperatures the increased hydrological cycle is in response to increased heating not increased temperatures and may not occur if only the temperature is increased the term recycling is normally used to refer to moisture that evaporates and precipitates in the same catchment and is misleading here consequence of all this is that in the summary on p 4 in addressing the question what will be the consequences of global warming eg extreme weather there is statement about increased risks of extremes of floods and droughts and heat waves it also underplays the risks of increases in pests and diseases like fungal diseases in agriculture 4 the report contends that emissions in the last decade have averaged less than in ipcc predictions notably for co2 and methane however the is92c scenario had flat co2 emissions till 2020 and then declining emissions to 2100 and for methane values projected are quite close to those observed in any case they are not forecasts but scenarios to be used for planning purposes statements in the summary on p 4 and on p19 are misleading also the claim that co2 emissions will accelerate for midrange estimates is not true those have emissions increasing at close to constant rate 5 the report dodges the issue of what is safe level of concentration of greenhouse gases and has strong us bias it does not list on p 21 for instance the vulnerability of small island states to sea level rise and of poorer countries to all aspects of climate change again it avoids discussion of changes in extremes it is also incorrect in stating the largest changes occur consistently in the regions of the middle to high latitudes this is true only for temperature and not for precipitation also p 8 perhaps because of the issues raised in item 2 therefore it understates the threats to tropical countries some details p 6 the accepted value of forcing for doubled co2 with stratosphere in adjustment which occurs rapidly is 35 w m2 not 4 p 11 sheep are just as much source of methane as cows and cattle p 24 the list of variables needed for an observing system should include those for the ocean kevin trenberth email trenbertucaredu climate analysis section ncar ml wwwcgducareducas p box 3000 1850 table mesa drive 303
