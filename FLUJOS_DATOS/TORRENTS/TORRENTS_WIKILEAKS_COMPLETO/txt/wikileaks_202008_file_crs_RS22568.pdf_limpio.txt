smole specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division summary subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loan s are the primary sources of federal loan aid available to assist students finance th costs of postsecondary education these loans are made available under both the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d ford direct loan dl program through these programs students may borrow loans with terms and c onditions that are generally more favorable than loans from private lenders effective july 1 2006 the interest rate on new stafford loans is fixed at 68 for loans made on or after october 1 1992 and prior to july 1 2006 interest rates are vari able and adjust annually among other things hr 2669 as passed by the house would reduce intere st rates on subsidized stafford loans that are disbursed to undergraduate students from july 1 2008 to june 30 2013 this report provides brief overview of selected terms and conditions of stafford loans characteristics of borrowers and descri ption of how reduced rates proposed under hr 2669 would compare with term s and conditions under current law1 introduction the increasing return to obtaining posts econdary education rising college prices and concerns about paying for college have increased the visi bility of federal student aid programs of particular c oncern is the amount students borrow for college and their resulting debt burden also recently implemented changes to the ffel and dl programs have resulted in stafford ans disbursed on or after july 1 2006 carrying fixed interest rate of 68 whereas in prior years ans were disbursed w ith variable annually adjusting interest rates in the early part of this decade interest rates had dropped to historic lows but recently have risen to levels more consistent with historic norms the combination of recent interest rate changes rising college prices and concerns about student loan debt burden have put student loans on the agenda of the 110th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22568crs2 2 for additional information see crs report rl34077 student loans st udent aid and fy2008 budget reconciliation by adam stoll david p smole and

and provisions by adam stollin the 110th congress proposals are being consid ered to reduce interest rates on student loans to make them less costly to borrowers on july 11 2007 the house passed hr 2669 which would incrementally reduce inte rest rates on subsidized stafford loans for undergraduate students over fiveyear period beginning with academic year ay 20082009 under hr 2669 interest rates would be reduced from the current fixed rate of 68 to fixed rate of 612 for ans disbursed in ay20082009 544 for loans disbursed in ay20092010 476 for loans disbursed in ay20102011 408 for loans disbursed in ay20112012 and 34 for loan s disbursed in ay 20122013 rates would then revert back to 68 for loans disbursed in subsequent years unless the rate reduction was extended through other legi slation similar interest ra reductions were passed by the house as standalone measure in h r 5 hr 2669 would also make numerous other changes to the ffel and dl program2 ffel and dl stafford loans subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans are made to undergraduate and graduate students under both the ffel and dl programs3 under the ffel program loans are made by banks and other lenders to students in attendance at institutions of higher education ihes loan capital for ffel pr ogram loans is provided by private lenders and the loans are guaranteed by the federa l government against loss due to borrower default death permanent disability or in limited instances bankruptcy state and nonprofit guaranty agencies administer the federal loan guarantee the federal government provides certain incentives to lenders most notably the special allowance payment sap which is marketindexed loan subsidy payment designed to compensate lenders for the difference between the statutorily established borrower interest rate and different statutorily estab lished lender interest rate under the dl program the federal govern ment provides loans di rectly to students using federal capital ie funds from the us treasury and owns the loans dl program loans are originated either by the institution student attends or by contractor of the us department of education ed loan servicing ie billing borrowers collecting payments collecting on defaulted loans is done by ed contractors the dl program was initially intended to replace the ffel program but now both programs operate alongside one another each institu tion chooses whether to participate in the ffel or dl program subsidized and unsubsid ized stafford loans there are two types of stafford loans subsidized and unsubsidized currently the same interest rate applies to both types of loans 68 for loan s disbursed on or after july 1 2006 subsidized stafford loans are available to undergraduate and gra duate students to he lp them finance their postsecondary education expenses the federal government subsidizes these loanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22568crs3 4 see crs report rl33673 for more information on subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans 5 lower rates apply during inschool grace and deferment periods however since for subsidized stafford loans interest is paid by the federa l government during these periods these rates are not shown lenders may make loans at lower inte rest rates or reduce rates for timely repaymentby paying the interest that accrues while th student is enrolled in school on at least halftime basis and during gr ace and deferment periods stude nts must establish financial need to qualify for subsidized stafford loans unsubsidized stafford loans are also available to both undergraduate and graduate students th major distinctions between the two types of loans are that for unsubsidiz ed stafford loans the federal government does not pay the interest that accrues while the borrower is in school or during deferment and grace periods and students may qualify for unsubsidized stafford loans irrespective of their expected family contribution efc ie they are not needbased4 interest rates both subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans carry the same interest rate for loans disbursed on or af ter july 1 2006 the interest rate is fixed at 68 for loans disbursed between octobe r 1 1992 and june 30 2006 the interest rate is variable and adjusts annually the formula used to calculate the variable interest rate for those loans is determined by statute and stays in effect from the time the loan is disbursed through the life of the loan or until the loan is consolidated the variable rate is calculated based upon the bond equivalent rate of the 91 day treasury bill plus premium which differs depending on when th loan was disbursed and whether the borrower is in school grace period or defermen t or is in repayment the interest rate on variable rate loans adjusts each year on july 1 prior to october 1 1992 stafford loans carried fixed interest rates table 1 presents history of interest rates in effect during repayment on stafford loans disbursed on or

an examination of the cost to the government of this proposal and issues such as its effect on student access to and persistence in postsecondary education are beyond the scope of this reporthr 2669 would reduce interest rate s only for undergraduate borrowers of subsidized stafford loans the interest rate on subsidized stafford loans borrowed by graduate and professi onal students and on all unsubsidized stafford loans would remain at 68 as shown in table 1 for loans disbursed on or after october 1 1992 interest rates during repayment on stafford loans have been at or lower than 34 only during the period from july 1 2004 to june 30 2005 nd only for loans disbursed on or after july 1 1998 for most of the history of the stafford loan progra m interest rates on variable rate loans have been at or above 679 during repayment6 for purposes of comparison under the federal perkins loan program the other major subsidized student loan program all loans disburse d on or after october 1 1981 carry fixed interest rate of 50 the proposed interest rate reduction would result in increased costs to the government under the ffel program due to larger sap payments to lenders and under the dl

dept of education national postsecondary student aid study 2004 npsas2004 crs calculations notes income data are 2002 total income data on borrowers of subsidized stafford loans and unsubsidized stafford loans are not mutually exclusiv since students qualify for subsidized stafford loans on the basis of need it is not uncommon for st udents whose subsidized stafford loan amounts are less than the statutory maximum to borrow the difference between their subsidized stafford loan eligibility amount and the statutory maximum through unsubsidized stafford loans thus many students borrow both types of loans both dependent and independe nt stafford loan borrowers are distributed across slightly lower income range than undergradua students overall however for dependent students there is considerable variation between the income distribution of borrowers of subsidized stafford loans and borrowers of unsubsidized stafford loans dependent student borrowers of subsidized staffo rd loans had median 2002 income of 44681 compared with median income of 75837 for borrowers of unsubsidized stafford loans there was less variation among unde rgraduate independent borrowers with the median income of borrowers of subsidiz ed stafford loans being 19034 compared with 21483 for borrowers of unsubsidized stafford loans subsidized stafford loan borrowing during ay20032004 277 of undergraduate
