has been deemed an epidemic in the united states1 results of survey by the national center for health statistics found that in the years 2003 to 2004 an estimated 66 of us adults were ei ther overweight or obese2 the american obesity association estimates that approximately 127 million adults in the united states are overweight 60 million obese and 9 million severely obese3 it has been argued that obese individuals have been the targets of discrimination there is federal law that specifically prohibits obesity discrimination however some obese individuals have argued that their weight can be considered disability for purposes of the americans with disabilities act ada or the rehabilitation act of 1973 and therefore they have legal protection against weight discrimination4

services public accommodations and services operated by private entities transportation and telecommunications 7 in order to prevail in discrimination case the plaintiff must prove among other things

promulgated ada regulations that give insight as to what constitutes an impairment within the meaning of the term disability as well as what is considered to be substantially limiting major life activity9 the ada regulations have been used by the courts in determining the validity of obesity discrimination claims obesity discrimination cases have also been brought under the rehabilitation act of 197310 section 504 of the rehabilitation act states that otherwise qualified individual shall solely by reason of her or his disability be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance11 courts have often applied the same standard when deciding cases arising under the ada or section 504 of the rehabilitation act12 also the standards for determining employment discrimination under the rehabilitation act are identical to those used in title i of the ada 13 the ada regulations address whether obesity can be an impairment that qualifies as disability under the ada in general the regulations suggest that the ada offers limited protection to obese individuals the ada regulations state that temporary nonchronic impairments of short duration with little or long term or permanent impact are usually not disabilities such impairments may include but are not limited to broken limbs sprained joints and concussions similarly except in rare circumstances obesity is not considered disabling impairment 14 the eeoc has expounded on how obesity is to be covered under the ada in its ada compliance manual the eeoc states that being overweight in and of itself generally is not an impairment on the other hand severe obesity which has been defined as body weight more than 100 over the norm is clearly an impairment in addition person with obesity may have an underlying or resultant physiological disorder such as hypertension or thyroid disorder physiological disorder is an impairment 15 based on the ada regulations and eeoc guidance it may be difficult for an obese plaintiff to successfully bring discrimination claim16 still courts have found some plaintiffs entitled to protection under the ada 8 42 usc 12101 et seq the meaning of physical impairment is defined in the ada regulations as any physiological disorder or condition cosmetic disfigurement or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems neurological musculoskeletal special nse organs respiratory cardiovascular reproductive digestive genitourinary hemic and lymphatic skin and endocrine 29 cfr 16302h1 9 see 29 cfr 1630 et seq

have considered whether the ada or section 504 applies to obesity and have used varying and sometimes conflicting lines of reasoning and conclusions courts have disagreed on issues such as 1 whether pl aintiff must have physiological disorder in order for the plaintiffs morbid obesity to be covered under the ada17 and 2 whether plainitiffs obesity can cause substantial limitation of major life activity18 the following cases include some of the different arguments that courts have used in finding that plaintiff is eligible or noneligible for ada or section 504 protection19

g138g151g141g561g10g152g156g153g146g157g138g149g156g561 one of the first appellate decisions to address weight discrimination as disability was cook which established that an obese plaintiff can be considered disabled20 in cook the plaintiff applied for position she had previously held as an institutional attendant at the time cook applied she was five feet two inches tall and weighed 320 pounds the institution refused to rehire cook claiming that cooks weight compromised her ability to evacuate patients in an emergency situation and increased her chances of developing aliments that could lead to cook to be out of work or claim workers compensation cook brought claim under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 as well as certain state statutes claiming that the failure to hire her was based on an unlawful perceived disability although she was fully able to perform the job the institution considered her physically impaired the first circuit court of appeals agreed with cook however the court acknowledged that cook could also prevail because she had an actual physical impairment 21 the court pointed to the fact that cook had admitted that she was morbidly obese and had presented expert testimony that morbid obesity is physiological disorder dysfunction of the metabolic system the institution argued that cooks claims failed because her weight was condition that was both mutable and voluntary the court rejected the institutions arguments and noted that nowhere in the rehabilitation act nor in the regulations implementing the act was there mention of either characteristic disqualifying claim the court also discussed whether cooks weight substantially limited one or more of cooks major life activities the court pointed to evidence introduced by the institution demonstrating 17 see eg eeoc v watkins 463 f3d 436 6th cir 2006 connor v mcdonalds restaurants 14 am disabilities cas bna 204 d conn 2003 18 see eg cook v rhode island dept of mental

morbid obesity interfered with her ability to undertake physical activities such as walking lifting or bending on this basis alone the court stated jury could find that the institution perceived the plaintiffs impairment to interfere with major life activity in addition the court explained that the plaintiff could be found substantially limited without having to seek out other jobs that she was qualified to perform the court stated that denying an applicant job that requires unique physical skills due solely to the perception that the applicant suffers from physical limitations that would keep her from qualifying for broad spectrum of jobs can constitute treating an applicant as if her condition substantially limited major life activity viz working 22 the first circuit also concluded that there was evidence that cook could not perform the job and it upheld the district courts decision for cook23

law24 in this case the city of meriden disciplined francis firefighter employed by the city after he failed to meet certain weight guidelines25 francis claimed that this discipline was discrimination based on perceived disability in violation of the ada and the rehabilitation act the court found that francis claims failed because francis only alleged that the city disciplined him for not meeting weight standard not because he suffered from an impairment within the meaning of the disability statutes in its analysis the court discussed the applicability of the ada and the rehabilitation act to obesity the second circuit stated that franciss claim failed because obesity except in special cases where obesity relates to physiological disorder is not an impairment within the meaning of the ada or the rehabilitation act the court also pointed out in dicta that cause of action may exist against an employer who discriminates against an employee based on the perception that the employee is morbidly obese 26 still the court concluded that simply failing to meet weight guidelines was insufficient for ada protection27 22 id at 26 23 id at 31 see also eeoc v texas bus lines in texas bus lines in which the eeoc filed suit on behalf of arazella manuel alleging that the bus company violated the ada when it did not hire manuel as bus driver because she was morbidly obese during required physical examination the physician noticed that manuel had difficulty getting out of her seat in the waiting area and that she waddled to the examining room because of the results of the examination the bus company did not hire her the eeoc argued that the company wrongfully relied on the results of this examination in violation of the ada the court found that the companys reliance on the limited findings of the medical examination demonstrated that the company impr operly regarded manuel as having substantially limiting impairment and denied summary judgment to the bus company 24 francis v

sixth circuit took up the issue of obesity discrimination in eeoc v watkins 28 in watkins the eeoc claimed that the defendant company violated the ada when it discharged morbidly obese employee after the employee sustained an injury on the job the employee whose weight fluctuated between 340 and 450 po unds during his employment was injured during routine job activity the employee claimed he was unaware of any physiological or psychological cause for his heavy weight after taking leave of absence following his injury the employees personal doctor cleared him to work however company doctor found that the employee weighed more than 400 pounds had limited range of motion and shortness of breath after few steps the doctor determined that even though the employee met the department of transportations standards for truck drivers the employee could not safely perform the requirements of his job the employee was terminated as result the eeoc argued under regarded as theory claiming that although the employee had an actual impairment the impairment was erroneously re garded as an inability to perform his job in its analysis however the sixth circuit did not focus on how the company regarded the employee but instead on whether morbid obesity qualified as an ada impairment the court cited the ada regulations 29 stating that an impairment is defined in relevant part as any physiological disorder or condition the court interpreted this definition to require evidence of physiological cause of morbid obesity in order for an impairment to exist under the ada because the
