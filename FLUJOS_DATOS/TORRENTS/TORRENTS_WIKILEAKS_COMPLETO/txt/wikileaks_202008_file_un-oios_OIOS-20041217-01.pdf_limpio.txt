interviewed official 1 at prishtina airport and the official 2 at prishtina airport 7 during the review of available documentation th itf investigators identified number of problems related to the exis ting procedures and practices at atcs finance office having finalized the document review they interviewed available atcs staff that was directly involved in approving the cash withdrawals and subsequently atcs staff that handled the cash nd related documentation at 4 of 12 the atcs finance office or that travelled on train ing to italy and the united kingdom 8 the itf interviewed finance officer 1 working at atcs finance office during the period september 2000 to december 2003 finance officer 1 described the procedures that were in place during 2002 and 2003 and identified employee 1 employee 2 and the division manager as class si gnatories and employee 3 employee 4 employee 5 and the atcs official as b class signatories for the unmik aviation transport and airport prishtina bank accounts those listed class signatories were the only people authorized t withdraw cash from the atcs bank accounts 9 finance officer 1 also confirmed that the divisi on manager and the atcs official supervised the work of the atcs finance of fice heshe further indicated that whenever there was requirement for larger cash payment for example an official travel finance officer 1 or finance offi cer 2 would prepare request for cash withdrawal that would be signed by the atcs fficial and subsequently assessed and approved by the division manager 10 finance officer 1 was given the opportunity to review documentation related to the travel of atcs staff in 2002 prior to the ta keover of the atcs by unmik pillar 4 kta on 1 july 2002 during this exercise finance officer 1 established that requests for cash 462002 492002 552002 and 5 92002 had proper justification sufficient for the authorization of cash allocation but all lacked documentation that would indicate how those funds were spent finance officer 1 was not able to provide satisfactory explanations for the identifie d irregularities and had recollection that the atcs official ever made any c hecks of the financial files at atcs finance office 11 the itf interviewed finance officer 2 working at the atcs finance office who stated heshe has been employed by the atcs ce 01 april 2002 finance officer 2 provided detailed information with regard to the financial procedures and practices at the atcs finance office and indicated that based on hisher previous experience in dealing with finances for number of companies local and international heshe found the atcs finance offic to be quite disorganized for example the office did not have in place prope r structures and computer software to deal with the financial issues includin g cash even though the amounts of money they were processing were quite high fina nce officer 2 allegedly tried to suggest some improvements but the atcs official to ld himher that it was the way the unmik wanted to deal with money and that heshe should follow hisher instructions since finance officer 2 was concerned that heshe might lose hisher job if heshe raised any further objections heshe decided to work as instructed by the atcs official 5 of 12 12 finance officer 2 was given the opportunity to review the files related to the atcs official travel where heshe also identified requests 46 49 55 and 59 of 2002 as lacking basic documentation on how the allocated funds were spent heshe was not able to give satisfactory explanations to those identified irregularities 13 finance officer 2 was shown documentation relat ed to the travel of the atcs staff after 01 july 2002 when the atcs was taken ver by the unmik pillar 4 kta finance officer 2 identified that the lack of documentation that was obvious during the time period when unmik pillar 2 handled prishtina airport remained the same under kta management requests for cash 01 2002 052002 062002 072002 and 082002 all lacked the required documen tation of expenses finance officer 2 stated that the atcs official often claim ed reimbursement for bills for food and restaurants and heshe knew that such expenses were included in the perdiem and that without authorisation should not have bee n included in the claim for reimbursement in some cases the expenses exceeded several hundred euros per travel the atcs official instructed finance office r 2 to file those bills and heshe authorised them as hisher own expenditure for rep resentation 14 finance officer 2 provided qualified insight wi th regard to handling of the socalled petty cash at the atcs finance office f inance officer 2 said that heshe found it very strange that there was need for an authorization or justification for cash expenses of less than 500 and that atcs staff were regularly bringing invoices and bills requesting reimbursement heshe explaine d that hisher role was to check the billinvoice and if it was deemed to comp ly date sum stamp heshe would reimburse the atcs employee most of the soc alled petty cash during 2002 and 2003 was spent in that fashion and it was an ex ception if the division manager or the atcs official asked for justifications the sums per invoicebill paid from the socalled petty cash were anywhere between several euro to over 500 15 finance officer 2 was also given the opportunit to review available files related to the socalled atcs petty cash for any ir regularities these bills were in particular 52500 present for international sta ff 41000 present for official 3 nokia 8850 91800 palm organizer for the atc s official and official 3 and 117600 recharging scratch cards vala 900 202 352 12588 96000 payment for mobile phone and 94000 rent car for the atcs official finance officer 2 acknowledged that there should ve been justification reports filed with those invoicesbills however such r eports were found in the available documentation heshe further pointed out that the atcs official signed the spreadsheet and therefore he assumed responsibility for those expenditures 16 the itf interviewed official 4 at the pristina airport official 4 was requested to review several files related to business travel of atcs staff during 2002 and was 6 of 12 shown documents 462002 492002 552002 and 592 002 heshe concluded that all four might contain sufficient information to ju stify allocation of funds for the planned travel of atcs staff however none had suf ficient information that would document how those allocated funds were spent info rmation contained in the file 462002 suggests that this document might have been created afterthefact as had this request been submitted for approval on 25 may 2002 as indicated it would be impossible for the approval dates written on the do cument to be 21 may 2002 and 22 may 2002 respectively also documents attached to request 552002 were printouts indicating flight reservations but they do not pro ve that the travel was executed none of the four files contained original flight ckets boarding passes or original bills nor do they contain sufficient proof that l the funds allocated to the travellers were provided to them by the atcs official as the travellers did not sign for them without flight tickets and boarding passes it is t sufficiently documented that the atcs personnel travelled on those missions 17 official 4 was also requested to review the fil dated after 01 july 2002 in particular files 012002 052002 062002 072002 and 082002 having studied those files heshe concluded that the files reveal ed the same absence of required documentation as the other cases identified in graph 16 above 18 official 4 was asked to review several files re lated to the socalled petty cash transactions and see whether there were any irregul arities heshe concluded that significant efforts were made by the atcs official to justify the cash withdrawals however while the cash appeared to have been provid ed there was very little effort to properly document how those funds were spent 19 itf investigators interviewed the division manag er on two occasions and heshe explained that staff travel expenses were hi gh because of the necessity to train nineteen air traffic controllers seven meteo rological forecasters and six aeronautical information service officers all of t he above staff received classroom and onthejob training around the world and that p ristina airport was responsible for expenses incurred heshe said that the airpor t has rules or regulations regarding travel and that there are forms to com plete requesting authorization for travel or documentation authorizing travel the division manager was aware that the atcs official as the supervisor of many f those who travelled would frequently visit staff whilst undertaking their res pective courses 20 the division manager said that the atcs officia l would bring to himher request in which heshe would detail the need for c ash and that when the division manager found the justification sufficient and in l ine with needs of the airport he she would approve it the atcs official would then be responsible for the proper use of these funds and keeping the financial record s of the expenditure in fact the atcs official had to sign for the bank check before it could be cashed at the bank 7 of 12 and therefore heshe had the cash in hisher custo dy the division manager indicated that it was not possible for himher to c heck every bill and invoice therefore he she delegated the authority for finan cial management to the atcs official 21 the itf interviewed official 1 at prishtina air port heshe stated that in may 2002 heshe travelled with the atcs official and of ficial 3 to the uk in order to negotiate conditions and finetune the training arr angements for the atcs staff request 462002 during this mission they all rec eived free accommodation all meals were provided as well as transport from shinf ield park to london upon their return when heshe returned to prishtina heshe wa s not requested to return any of the perdiem adding that heshe knew that the tcs official and official 3 also did not return any of the allocated funds 1158 22 the itf interviewed the atcs official on two oc casions and heshe acknowledged that cases 462002 492002 552002 nd 592002 the time period up to 30 june 2002 all show numerous irregularitie s heshe studied those files in detail and concluded that all four contained suffic ient information to justify the allocation of money for the planned travel of the tcs staff but that the documentation of the expenses was very poor 23 the atcs official also acknowledged that cases 012002 052002 062002 072002 and 082002 the time period after 01 july 2002 also showed numerous irregularities such as missing bills to prove payme nts missing signatures of atcs staff proving that they had received the perdiem missing flight ticket and boarding passes proving that the travel was in fact executed the itf concluded that it is very likely that those funds were paid to the atcs emplo yees on perdiem or salaries however sufficient documentation to prove those pay ments was not available to the itf investigators despite numerous attempts made in order to secure such documentation as matter of practice the atcs of ficial was formally certifying hisher own expenses during the business trips the atcs official could not provide any acceptable explanations to those irregu larities 24 the atcs official further indicated that hishe r superiors approved all the bills that were in the petty cash binders includin g for example 52500 present for international staff 41000 present for officia l 3 nokia 8850 91800 palm organizer for the atcs official and official 3 1 17600 recharging scratch cards vala 900 202352 12588 96000 payment for mobile phone and 94000 rent car for head of department the atcs offic ial stated that all the presents purchased from petty cash were also approved howev er heshe could not support this claim with any documentation the atcs officia l added that had those bills not been authorized the atcs would have not been able to get further cash as the approval for further cash withdrawals was condition ed by proper documentation 8 of 12 and certification of previous spending heshe insi sted that the sums paid for refreshmentsfoodrestaurant bills from the petty c ash fund hundreds of euros were all authorized by hisher superiors but that they did not request written justifications from himher the bill was allegedly sufficient proof of expenditure 25 the atcs official stated that in 2002 heshe w as not sufficiently experienced in financial management therefore hes he hired finance officer 1 and finance officer 2 who both had educational backgrou nd and professional experience in this field heshe said that heshe w as sure that the atcs money was spent in line with the requests but heshe accepte d that the documentation was very poor and unacceptable even for the minimal st andards required 26 the atcs official agreed that heshe and hishe r staff were diligent in requesting funds for atcs operations however were generally deficient when addressing the need for proper documentation of the actual expenditures 27 the atcs official indicated that heshe trusted hisher staff that they were professional and it was only very recently that he she realized that heshe should have devoted more effort to their supervision v findings 28 it was established during the itf investigation that atcs management effectively ignored the potential for fraud highlig hted in the forensic audit in 200102 the airport was and continues to be exp osed to financial wrongdoing 29 the itf investigation also clearly established that the oversight and internal controls at the prishtina airport were and still re mains inadequate for satisfactory monitoring and approval of expenditure there is n written documentation for authorizing travel and standard forms for tracki ng travelrelated expenses which are vulnerable to fraud and should be approved and monitored more closely by management 30 throughout 2002 and clearly up to february 2004 the atcs management in particular the atcs official and the division mana ger failed to provide effective oversight of the financial operations especially t hose related to cash at the atcs finance office 31 documentation obtained by the itf from the pris htina airport clearly shows that atcs management failed to introduce or enforc rules and regulations that would guarantee proper use of the allocated funds nd provided transparent documentation of this process 9 of 12 32 significant amount of the cash withdrawals by the atcs was used for training opportunities for employees of the atcs w ho attended courses in number of countries including italy canada and the united kingdom therefore the cash advances were not all related to the atcs officials travel rather for significant number of employees the necessity of t he frequent travel of the atcs official remains questionable as the available doc umentation does not provide clear proof that the atcs officials travel was business related or justified 33 by way of example itf investigators examined vailable files related to travel in 2002 which included details of staff att ending courses this examination was related to the situation before and also after 01 july 2002 note 0n 01 july 2002 the pristina airport was handed over by unmik pillar 2 to unmik pillar 4 kta it was established that at least in nine cases 46200 2 492002552002 592002 and 012002 052002 062002 072002 082002 there were significant irregularities related to distribution of funds documentation and filings of those financial records having examined those listed files it was clearly stablished that in cases 492002 552002 062002 and 072002 spending of 64435 wa s not properly documented it is possible that those funds were in fact used fo r what they had been initially allocated however the documentation that was avai lable to the itf does not support this assumption in case 592002 an overpay ment of 1810 was made without explanation as to where the additional fund s were drawn these findings clearly demonstrate the disarray at the atcs financ office in 2002 34 the atcs financial documentation revealed that the atcs official was certifying hisher own expenses for official travel it was clearly established by the itf investigation that the atcs official made num ber of reimbursement claims for food and restaurant bills or refreshments that were not properly authorized heshe also at least in one case did not repay 9 9 to the petty cash fund from request 012002 additionally the atcs officia l official 3 and official 1 retained sum of 1158 of their dsaperdiem for business trip to the united kingdom in may 2002 even though they had been prov ided with free transport food and accommodation request 462002 35 in june 2002 the atcs official certified perd iem of 6975 for nine department 1 trainees that were supposed to partici pate in meteorology training in the uk two department 1 staff failed their initia l examination and prematurely returned to prishtina the remaining seven trainees signed for their perdiem in total 5425 the itf investigation established that request 592002 does not contain any documentation with regards to what was done wit h sum of 1550 initially allocated by the atcs official for perdiem of thos two atcs employees 36 it was established that the atcs finance office used an excel spreadsheet and had alternative computerized system to deal with financial documentation 10 of 12 the procedure used required manual inputting of det ails of individual bank accounts into the spreadsheet before reconciling ex penditure and income against the bank account the system was open to abuse and was heavily reliant on individual staff integrity 37 the socalled petty cash files were reviewed and it was established that the receipts were properly filed and the figures input into the spreadsheet in most of the cases however it was clearly established by the i tf investigation that during 2002 various items were paid out of the socalled petty cash reserve without necessary written approvals those items included presents for international and local staff valued at several hundreds of euros 52500 pre sent for international staff 41000 present for official 3 nokia 8850 91 800 palm organizer for the atcs official and official 3 117600 recharging sc ratch cards vala 900 202352 12588 96000 payment for mobile phone and 94000 rent car for the atcs official additionally bills for fuel oil car spareparts often did not contain enough information so that there was evidence w hether these payments were done for official business purposes since early 2 004 cash withdrawal over 100 has been permitted as all sums greater than that mount have to be effected by bank transfer and formally justified 38 the kta on official 4s behalf is currently u ndertaking procurement process in order to identify and purchase compreh ensive automated financial software system to replace the outdated and inadequ ate excel spreadsheet currently in use the new system will have the capa city to link all the financial centres at the airport including customs signi ficant delay has been experienced within the kta in initially progressing this procur ement which has now albeit belatedly been addressed 39 in addition official 4 has submitted to the kta board suggested authority list that identifies authority levels for approvin g all aspects of expenditure this document was placed before the airport steering com mittee on 16 july 2004 and awaits ratification official 4 has taken active st eps to ensure that sound financial management practices were initiated and monitored s ince herhis recruitment in february 2004 vi conclusion 40 unmik regulation 200127 essential labou r law in kosovo in paragraph 93 states that employees shall perform hisher obligations and may exercise hisher rights in accordance with the app licable law labour contract and where applicable collective agreement paragraph 11 of the same regulation states that quote 113 serious misconduct shall include the follow ing b theft destruction damage or unauthorized use of the empl oyers assets and in 114 unsatisfactory performance shall include b rep eated mistakes not sufficient in 11 of 12 themselves to justify dismissal but which given their frequency and seriousness disrupt the normal course of the employment relatio nship 41 the investigation conducted by the itf clearly documented that prishtina airport management failed to perform their duties i n accordance with the general principles outlined above in particular the use f the assets allocated to the atcs by the kta in 2002 was inadequately documented and the performance of the atcs finance office in that respect was unsatisfactory this poor performance even caused financial damage to the unmik pillar 4 kta as demonstrated in this report the work of the atcs finance office was und er direct supervision of the atcs official and the oversight responsibility was in the hands of the division manager both of them in their respectful capacity failed to perform their duties according to expected standards and they failed to promote the best interest of unmik pillar 4 kta as their employer vii recommendations recommendation 1 in light of the established irregularities and ck of oversight at prishtina airport unmik pillar 4 kta should take appropriate action against the atcs official and the division manager for mismanag ement of the atcs finances iv0404901 recommendation 2 unmik pillar 4 kta should ensure that senior man agement of prishtina airport comply with observations and r ecommendations provided by external auditors written

management this system of tra vel approvals should not permit airport senior staff to authorise their own travel request and requests for reimbursement of expenses that occurred during said business travel this matter should also be brought to the attention of the airp orts steering committee for their review iv0404904 recommendation 5 unmik pillar 4 kta should ensure that the travel policies should include the need for documentation to be sub mitted by those staff on official travel such as boarding passes ticket stubs nd hotel bills to demonstrate evidence that travel occurred as per the
