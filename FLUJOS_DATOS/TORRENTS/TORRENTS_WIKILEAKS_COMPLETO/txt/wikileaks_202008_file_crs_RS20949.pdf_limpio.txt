conditions through its control of the money supply to maintain low inflation low unemployment and moderate in terest rates to do so th fed targets the federal funds rate the overnight interbank lending rate to alter the amount of reserves available for lending in the banking system it targets this interest rate by buying and selling us treasury securities in the long run inflati on or increases in the general level of all prices is purely monetary phenomenon thus sustained price stability is goal for which the fed is solely responsible in add ition in times of financia l crisis the fed acts as lender of last resort to the financial system the federal reserve system is composed of 12 regional banks and the board of governors located in washington dc seven governors appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate serve on the board ben bernanke replaced alan greenspan as chairman of the board of governors on febr uary 1 2006 monetary policy decisions are made by the federal open market committee which consists of the seven fed governors the new york fed president and four of the other regional bank presidents the latterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20949crs2 serve on

should the fed be mandated to accomplish some economists and policymakers have criticized the feds mandate as being overly broad and vague more precise mandate they argue would lead to more accountability more transparency and bette r economic performance many different goals have been suggested as alternative mandates the proposal that has received the most attention is the adoption of an inflati on target under this proposal which several foreign countries adopted in the 1990s the sole goal of monetary policy would be price stability to ensure that the economy attained certain inflation rate or maintained rate within specific band this proposal has been supported on the grounds that inflation is the only goal that the fed can control in the longer run that other policy goals have allowed inflation to rise to unacceptable levels in the past particularly in the 1970s that high inflation imposes economic costs that lower efficiency and that single goal would make the feds actions more accountable and transparent by contrast opponents of an inflation target claim that inflation is not the only important goal of monetary policy monetary policy may be able to affect other variables for very long periods of time policy lags and imprecision imply that good policym aking requires the maximum flexibility and that achieving an inflation target may not be realistic goal another proposal with s imilar aims known as the taylor rule would replace discretionary policy with mathematical rule that changed interest rates when economic data changed this rule can also be used for oversight purposes to evaluate the current stance of monetary policy some argue that monetary policy should react to the price of assets as well as the prices of goods and services for instance proponents believe that the stock market was overpriced in the late 1990s and this refl ected an economic imbalance which should have been countered by tightening of monetary policy indeed declining equity prices paralleled general economic weakening in 20002002 in recent years the pattern of rapidly increasing asset prices has been ec hoed in the housing market causing concern among some economistshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20949crs3 crs report 9816 should the federal reserve adopt an inflation target by marc labonte and gail makinen crs report rl31702 price stability inflation

labonte federal reserve independence the fact that the fed is quasipublic in structure overseen by an unelected board of governors who are appointed to serve long rms and reliant on its own source of funding causes some commentators to argue that the fed enjoys unique degree of independence that is inimical to the spirit of democracy although this argument is political in nature other observers believe that there are econo mic reasons why independence is desirable as are the economic consequences that stem from its independence most importantly they point out that an overly stimulative monetary policy may in crease economic growth and lower unemployment in the short run but it also increases inflation in the longer run independence from popular pressu res may thus be necessary to prevent monetary policy from being consistently overly stimulative it may also enhance the credibility of the fed in ways that make policy changes less costly from macroeconomic perspective on the other hand independence may d ecrease accountability in ways that allow policy errors to go unchecked and may cause monetary policy to be poorly coordina ted with the efforts of fiscal policy crs report rl31056 the economics of federa l reserve independence by marc labonte crs report rl31955 central bank independence and economic performance what does the evidence show by marc labonte and gail makinen technical aspects role of the money supply since monetary policy involves changes in the supply of money it might seem appropriate to target the grow th rate of the money supply in order to control the growth of money spe nding or aggregate demand for this to occur there must be stable and predictable re lationship between the money supply and money spending while there is re lationship unfortunately it is ne ither stable nor predictable that is because the fed controls only the supply of money while the demand for money is determined by the decisions of private individuals over the past 25 years this relationship has been highly variable for th three measures of th money supply recorded by the fed part of this instability is due to the widespread use abroad of american currency as medium of exchange and store of value because of this instability the fed longer targets the growth rate of the money supply instead it targets shortterm interest rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20949crs4 crs report rl31416 monetary aggregates their us in the conduct of monetary policy by marc labonte and gail makinen crs report rl30904 why is the amount of currency in circulation rising by gail makinen should the fed pay inter est on required reserves the fed requires banks to hold certain percentage of their deposits as reserves either as vault cash or with the fed these reserves do not earn interest whereas other deposits are lent at profit hence reserve requirements impose cost on banks and give them an incentive to minimize their reserve holdings through th process of multipled eposit creation these reserves play role in determining how changes in monetary policy influence the money supply some policymakers have proposed th at the fed should pay interest on required reserves out of their profits they argue th at this would reduce the cost imposed on banks and increase the predictability that change s in monetary policy have on the economy opponents claim that the feds profits are better used by the treasury where these profits are now remitted crs report rl30874 proposals to allow federal rese rve banks to pay interest on reserve
