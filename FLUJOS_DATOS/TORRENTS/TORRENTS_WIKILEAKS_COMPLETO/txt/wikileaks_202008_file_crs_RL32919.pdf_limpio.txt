gned the department of defense appropriation for fy2006 pl 109148 legisl ation that affects foreign operations spending in three ways the defens appropriation includes 38 billion for addressing the avian influenza virus of which 1315 million is available to usaid for international surveillance planning preparedness and response pl 109148 further rescinds 25 million from the exportim port bank as part of large package to offset the costs of relief for victims of hurricane katrina finally the defense appropriation enacts 1 acrosstheboa rd reduction for most nonemergency discretionary appropriations resulting in reduction in foreign operations spending of approximately 209 million from th amount approved earlier for fy2006 previously on november 14 2005 president bush signed into law 2094 billion foreign operations appropria tion for fy2006 pl 109102 hr 3057 the net total for foreign operations af ter adjusting for supplemental funds and rescissions enacted in pl 109148 is 2083 billion the house passed the conference report hrept 109265 on n ovember 4 35839 while the senate approved it on november 10 910 conferees decided to separate the state department and related agen cies portion of the senatep assed measure and address those funding and policy issues as part of the science state justice and commerce appropriation hr 2862 the enacted foreign operations appropria tions adjusted for supplementals and rescissions in pl 109148 falls 21 billion or 93 below the presidents request and represents by far the largest cut in regular nonsupplemental foreign operations spending relative to the administration s proposal during the bush administration the total however remains about 14 billion higher than the regular fy2005 foreign aid spending measure exc luding emergency and supplemental appropriations and falls between the housepasse d 2027 billion level and the senatepassed 2216 billion amount conferees made the largest reduction to the presidents proposed 3 billion millennium challenge account paring the appropriation down to 177 billion for nearly every other account the enacted bill so sets spending at or somewhat below requested levels pl 109102 further reduces the presidents 459 million request for iraq to 61 million httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs2 in few selected areas however the enacted measure adds funds appropriations for the three core bila teral development aid accounts of child survivalhealth development assistance and the global aids initiative are 52 billion or 105 higher than the request and ai d to the former sovi et states is set at 514 million 66 more than proposed the conference agreement further adds to spending for the african and interame rican foundations voluntary contributions to international organiza tions and establishes ne w democracy fund of 95 million as proposed by the senate the tota l amount for hivaids malaria and tuberculosis programs across all fore ign operations accounts is 282 billion up from the presidents 256 billion request this includes 450 million for the global fund higher than the 200 million request for family planning pl 109102 provides 466 milli on 432 million in bilateral funding and 34 million as contribution to the population f und unfpa this compares to 425 million total request on key policy issues the conference agreement deletes senatepassed provisions that would have reversed the mexico city family planning policy and altered the kempkasten restrictions that apply to us contributions to the population fund unfpa the enacted m easure also stipulates that portion of us assistance to egypt must support democracy human rights and governance programs introduction amounts appropriated for fore ign operations programs and for the department of state and related agencies comprise bout 97 of the total international affairs budget and represent roughly 7 of di scretionary budget authority under the jurisdiction of house and senate appropriations committees at the beginning of the 109th congress house and senate committees on appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures the house panel reduced the number of subcommittees to ten and reconfigured several of their jurisdictions these changes however do not affect th previous organizations for foreign operations and state departmentbroadcas ting programs the jurisdiction of the house foreign operations committee remains the same while state department broadcasting and related ac tivities continue to be funded within the retitled subcommittee on science state justice commerce and related agencies ssjc the senate appropriations committee chose to restructure its subcommittees differently from the house by maintaining twelve subpanels the senate configuration combined foreign operations with the state department broadcasting and related agencies creating retitled subcommittee on state foreign operations and related programs subsequently in late october house and senate appropriations committees agreed that for fy2006 appropriation bill jurisdictions would follow the house structure cons equently state depa rtment funds were removed from the senatepasse d

spending measure it does not include f unding for all foreign aid programs food aid an international humanitarian aid program administered under the pl 480 program is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill foreign operations also include funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is regarded as trade promotion program rather than foreign aid in recent years funding for food aid has run somewhat higher than for the eximbank so foreign operations is slightly smaller than the official foreign aid budget nevertheless throughout this report the term s foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeablythis report covers funding and policy issues related to foreign operations as addressed in the house and nate and state depa rtment programs as debated in the

aspects of executive branch foreign policy making generally1 the legislation funds all us bilate ral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and afri can development foundations foreign operations also includes resources for the two

asia foundation national endowment for democracy and several other sma ll educational and exchange organizations this title also appropriates resources for international commissions related foreign policy authorization measures intertwined with both foreign operati ons and state depar tment appropriations are foreign policy authorization bills that by law congress must pass prior to foreign aid and the state departments expenditure of its appropriations when congress does not pass these authorization measures as was the case during the 108th congress the appropriation bills must wa ive the authorization requirement for foreign policy agencies and prog rams to continue to function2 in some cases this results in the attachment of foreign ffairs authorizing provisions to foreign operations and state department ppropriation measures adding increased importance to the appropriation bills in terms of both funding and setting policy priorities for us foreign policy this has been the situation especially for foreign operations for two decades the foreign operations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign ffairs and for congre ssional involvement in foreign policy making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees3 as result foreign operations spending m easures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded thei r scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs5 congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the unite d states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities si nce the end of the cold war the legislation has also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrori sm since the attacks of september 11 2001 and launched afghan and iraq i reconstruction operations these appropriation measures have also b een key instrument used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have

funding foreign aid stat department operations embassy construction public diplomacy and contributions to international organizations can address the entire range of us foreign policy issues the fy2006 budget request posed severa l key matters that the 109th congress closely examined and debated for foreign operations programs major issues included the overall size of the request 157 increase over regular fy2005 foreign operations funds and whether competing budget proposals for domestic programs nd efforts to reduce the deficit would permit full funding of the 2283 billion recommendation foreign aid in support of the gl obal war on terror and whether the fy2006 request fully addre ssed this high nationa l security priority including resources for recons truction efforts in iraq and afghanistan the millennium challenge account and whether progress thus far on this new innovative foreign ai d program justified doubling of its budget in fy2006 hivaids funding and whether the 125 funding increase for fy2006 and the implementation nd allocation of resources including those for the global f und to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria were fully meeting the vision of the presidents 15 billion initiative core development and humanitari an aid programs and whether proposed funding reductions for some activities and account restructuring to enhance flexibility were justified on state department ope rations key policy and f unding issues includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs6 the us embassy in iraq and funding for ongoing operations security and construction

department policy trends and goals arguably from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s the underlying rationale for foreign aid and diplomatic efforts was the defeat of communism us aid programs were designed to promot economic developmen t and policy reforms in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to american allies and friendly states some of which faced soviet or sovietproxy threats aid programs also were used to help the united states gain acce ss to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy american forces diplomacy emphasized strengthening alliances and building coalitions to isolate and confront the soviet threat foreign aid and diplomatic programs so supported number of secondary us policy goals in the developing world ch as reducing high rates of population growth promoting wider access to health car expanding the availability of basic education advancing us trad interests and protecting th environment if these secondary goals were also achieved u s aid programs could be promoted as delivering more bang for the buck with the end of the cold war the focus of american foreign policy shifted to support more extensively other us nati onal interests including stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction curbing th production and trafficking of illegal drugs expanding peace efforts in the middle east seeking solutions to conflicts around the gl obe protecting human rights countering trafficking in persons foreign aid policy shifts foreign assistance in particular unde rwent significant changes during the 1990s the united states launched expansive aid programs in russia and many easternbloc states the influence of which u s assistance previously tried to combat while these and other new elements of american foreign aid emerged broad consensus developed over what the new overa rching rationale for us aid programs should be throughout the 1990s policymak ers and congress explored number of alternative strategic frameworks around wh ich to construct revised foreign assistance policy rationale not only di d policy consensus fail to emerge but efforts to overhaul the largely cold warb ased foreign aid legislation also did not succeed during this period the clinton admin istration emphasized the promotion of sustainable development as the new postcold war main strategy of those parts of the foreign

humanitarian assistance supporting us geostrategic interest s particularly in countries such as iraq afghanistan pakistan jordan egypt and israel and mitigating global and international ills including hivaids4 impact of the september 11 terrorist attacks the most defining change in us fo reign policy however came following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in th united states since 911 american foreign aid and diplomatic fforts have taken on more st rategic sense of importance and has been cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism in september 2002 president bush released his administration s national security strategy that established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with fense and diplomacy also in 2002 executive branch foreign assistance budget justifi cations began to underscore the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority highlighting amounts of us assistance to 28 frontline states in the terrorism wa r countries that cooperated with the united states in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves5 the substantial reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq which totaled more in fy2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid programs are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism state department efforts focused extensively on building coalitions to assist in the war on terror and finding new and more effective ways of presenting american views and culture through public diplomacy at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of us foreign policy the bush administr ation announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened tw additional key foreign assistance goals promoting economic growth and reducing poverty nd combating the globalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs9 6 some of these swings in budget levels are not the result of policy decisions but are due to technical budget accounting changes involving how congress scores various programs for example the large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as offbudget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to

dividend could be derived and believed that foreign policy agency funding could be trimmed to help meet growing budget pr essures reorganization of the international broadcasting tities beginning in

allocations on may 5 providing 2027 billion to the fore ign operations subcommittee level 255 billion or 11 below the administra tions recommendation during each of the past two years the house

account once again the executive branch sought s ubstantial increase for the mca doubling its budget to 3 billion as discussed elsewh ere in this report even though the house subcommittee decided on june 16 again to recommend sizable cut to the mca proposal 175 billion it also had to make reductions across number of other programs and accounts in order to meet its allocation target for state department and related programs the implications of the house sec 302b allocations were less clear because these funds are merged with range of domestic agencies however the 575 billion house ssjc s

concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to the principles and policies of free market economy and democracy and where governments are committed to

influence where us aid is spent and the requirement to solicit progra m proposals developed solely by qualifying countries with broad based civil society involvement the request for fy2006 was 3

reductions in fy2006 they assert may not be the best allocation of foreign operations resour ces the mcc argues however that the signing of additional compacts will accelerat in the coming months that

action the housepassed b ill recommended hr 3057 175 billion for the mca in fy2006 262 million higher than fy2005 but 125 billion below the presidents request the house appropriations committee noted however that the reduction stems solely from the constrained budget environment and the need to allocate resources to other presidential and congressional priorities in order to operate in fy2006 with re duced resources the committee recommended that the corporation not use funds for amending and increasing existing compacts but to maximize resources for new compacts with available appropriations the senate measure also hr 3057 provided slightly higher mca appropriation of 18 billion the senate committee in its report hrept 10996 also said that the constrained budget allocation was one reason for the reduced appropriation the senate pa nel however further noted that the mcc had obligated less than 34 million of the nearly 25 billion in existing funds and that the average value to the two signed compacts was about onehalf of what the corporation stated in its budget justification the co mmittee further expressed concern about coordination and consis tency with other us aid pr ograms in mca countries and directed the secretary of state to report on these issues including an assessment of whether mca programs were duplicative of usaid or other aid activities in compact countries the

fiveyear plan development and humanitarian assistance funding priorities account restructuring and policy differences continuing source of disagreement between the executive branch and congress is how to allocate the roughly 3 billion core budget for usaid development assistance and global health programs among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in r ecent years have been programs supporting child survival basic education and as noted above efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases the administr ation has also backed these programs but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors in years when congress has increased appropriations for its priorities but not included corresponding boost in the overa ll development aid budget resources for other aid sectors such as economic gr owth and the environment have been substantially reduced this was more pr oblematic during the midtolate 1990s when worldwide development aid funding fell si gnificantly in more recent years and especially since fy2003 congress increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive progra m priorities could be funded without significant reductions for nonearmarked activities neverthe less administration officials continue to argue that such pr actices undermine their flexibility to adjust resource allocations to chan ging global circumstances most recently usaid administrator natsios told the house foreign operations subcommittee that part of the problem lay with developmen t contractors non governmental organizations ngos trad associations unive rsities and other groups that have become major impleme ntors of usaid development assistance programs these organizations and indi viduals he asserts lobby congress to earmark higher funds for programs the groups manage mainly in the social sectors but ignore other development programs such as those supporting agriculture infrastructure institutional capacity buildin g and governance the result according to administrator natsios is that the ar eas of

of special congressional importance usaid appropriation account realignment proposals for fy2006 the administration proposed to realign f our appropriation account s one of which is in the agriculture appropriation bill that would require action by the foreign operations subcommittees the rationale in each case according to executive branch officials was to provide usaid with greater flexibility and the means to respond more effectively and appropriately to rapidly ch anging development needs broadening the transition initiatives account growing concern among us national security and developmen t officials is the threat posed to us interests and the complexities of addressing the needs of fragile failing and post conflict states last year the state department created an office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization ocrs in order to strengthen the us capacity to deal with such countries which can be the source of regional instability and terroristscriminal operations the senate has under considera tion legislation that would authorize an expansion of the crs see s 600 while funding for the coordinators office is included in th state department appropriations budget request related to this effort is proposal by usaid to transfer economic growth and democracy program resources currently funded in the development assistance account for four fragile st ates and place them in the agencys transition initiatives account the fy2006 usaid request recommended that 275 million in development aid for ethiopia sudan haiti and afghanistan be shifted to the account and combined with the traditional transition initiatives budget for total appropriation reque st of 325 million see table 8 above the account which was established about 10 years ago s upports countries that face crisis or are in transition from conflict to stable development it is form of assistance that can bridge the gap between strictly humanitarian intervention and the establishment of permanent longterm development strate gy in the past congress has approved core appropriation to the office at usaid from which funds are allocated as needs emerge annual appropriations have ranged between 40 and 55 million the fy2006 request marked the first time that usaid would manage full country development assistance program out of the account from the agencys perspective this offers greater flexibility funds are available notwithstanding restrictions and conditions that might ot herwise apply to development aid resources and would permit usaid officials to design programs aimed at achieving results in shorter time frame than the current fiveyear development program time horizonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs38 17 see comments by usaid administrator

officials argue that this shift would avoid the more common six twelve month period for regular development ai d program to make its way through the contracting and congressiona l notification processes17 besides making it more difficult to co mpare usaid program funding priorities for fy2006 with fy2005 an issue noted above some members have questioned why this account realignment was necessa ry some wondered whether the change would erode congressional oversight of aid programming in th highly volatile environments it was also unclear how these fragile state usaid programs would fit into the broader us st rategy addressing failing and fragile countries overseen by the ocrs for fy2006 usaid said that its field missions would manage the programs in the same way that they

assistance program18 funded in the annual agriculture appr opriation bill to the international disaster and famine assistance idfa account in foreign operations this would not result in net gain or loss of resour ces available for international food aid but change considerably how the 300 million could be programme d currently pl480 assistance must be used to purchase us commodities and transported for the most part on ships owned by american firms idfa resources have such conditions attached buy america and cargo preference required by pl480 help us agricultural and maritime interests but add costs to the shipment of commodities overseas the administration argued that the proposal substantially improves the developmental impact of food aid by allowing the 300 million to purchase commodities in developing nations thereb providing additional markets and income sources to local farmers in some cases the commodities may come from an area close to an emergency situation helping liver the food more quickly and at far lower cost transportation expenses of pl480 commodities often can equal the value of the food itself some in congress however opposed this realignment of the pl480 and idfa accounts to them it repr esented further erosion of support for american farmers they also raised questions regarding the quality of foreign purchased commodities and whether proper standards and inspections are in place to ensure that the emergency food supplies are suitable these critics contended that food could be prepositioned near famineprone regions so that commodities could be made able immediately congressional action house senate and conference measures each deny both of the account realignment initiatives proposed by the admin istration in

controversies19 us population assistance and family planning progra ms overseas have sparked continuous controversy during foreign operations bates for nearly two decades for fy2006 the administration requests 425 million for in ternational repro ductive health and family planning programs an amount that includes 25 million for the population fund unfpa in the event the or ganization is declared eligible for us assistance this represents cut of 8 from the combined 462 million available in fy2005 for total family planning programs although funding considera tions have at times been heatedly debated by congress the most contentious family planning issues addressed in nearly every annual congressional consideration of foreign opera tions bills have focused on two matters whether the united states should contribute to the population fund unfpa if the organization maintains program in china where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years and whether abortionrelated rest rictions should be applied to bilateral usaid population aid grants commonly known as the mexico city policy unfpa funding during the reagan and george hw bush administrations the united states did not contribute to unfpa because of concerns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in china where unfpa maintains programs in 1985 cong ress passed the so called kempkasten amendment which has been made part of every foreign oper ations appropriation since barring us funds to any organiza tion that supports or participates in the management of program of coercive bortion or involuntary sterilization in 1993 president clinton determined that unfpa despite its presence in china was not involved in the management of coercive program from 1993 through the end of the decade in most years congress appropriated about 25 million for unfpa but added directive that required that the amount be reduced by however much unfpahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs40 spent in china consequently the us contribution has fluctuated between 215 million and 25 million for fy2002 president george w bush requested 25 million for unfpa congress provided in the fy2002 foreign operations bill not more than 34 million for unfpa but after the white house placed hold on unfpa funds in january 2002 and sent state department team to investigate in july 2002 secretary of state powell announced that unfpa wa s in violation of the kempkasten provision and that funds would be withhe ld although congre ss has continued to earmark funds for unfpa in subseque nt foreign operations bills the administration has continued to find unf pa ineligible under the kempkasten restrictions and has redirected the earma rked funds for other womens programs the state department announced the most recent determination on september 17 2005 once again finding unfpa in violati on of the kempkasten provision under the terms of the fy2005 foreign oper ations appropriation the 34 million unfpa earmark will be used by usaid for bilateral family planning maternal and reproductive health programs mexico city policy the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began over three decades ago in 1973 when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administrati on and later the george h w bush administration restricted funds for fo reign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or prom oting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of hi s two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involve d in abortionrelated work subsequently on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president george w bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator to rescind the 1993 memorandum of president clinton and to direct the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was co mmitted to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance b ecause he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care on february 15 2001 the day on which fy2001 popula tion aid funds b ecame available for obligati on usaid issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the presidents directive the guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy appliedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs41 20 in debate on unfpa in related appropria tion the house on june 16 defeated 192233 an amendment by representative maloney that would have prohibited the use of funds in the science state justice and commerce ppropriation hr 2862 to prohibit or restrict funding for unfpacritics of the certificati on requirement oppose it on several grounds they believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the rest rictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possi bly more abortions oppone nts also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating s ituation in which the united states challenges their decisions on how to spend their own money they further argue that us policy in effect imposes gag order on the ab ility of foreign ngos and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations this would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states critics note supporters of the certifica tion requirement argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving american taxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abor tion laws and regulati ons the certification process they contend closes the fungibility loophole since reinstatement of the mexico city policy in early 2001 several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy but except for language included in the senate fy2004 foreign operations ppropriations bill s 1426 none has passed either the house or senate and measure has been enacted into law on april 5 2005 the senate approved 5246 an am endment by senator boxer to s 600 that would effectively overturn the mexico city polic s 600 an omnibus foreign policy and aid authorization bill rema ins under consideration in the senate and has not received final vote congressional action as passed by the house hr 3057 earmarked bilateral family planning aid at 432 million for fy2006 with an additional 34 million contribution to unfpa the combined total of 466 million compared with the administrations request of 425 milli on the house recommendation however continued all existing restrictions on such funds including the kempkasten provisions that has resulted in funds for unfpa in recent years in the event that unfpa is found to be ineligible for us support the house measure required that the funds be used by usaid for b ilateral family pla nning programs20 in the senate the companion bill provide d somewhat higher funding levels than the house as well as altere d key conditions under which the money is available the senate bill included 450 million for usai d bilateral programs and 35 million unfpa contribution the unfpa funds must be kept in separate account by the organization cannot be spent in chin and cannot be used to fund abortions if the administration finds unfpa ineligib for us support the senate measurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs42 directs that funds drawn from the intern ational organizations and programs account 20 million shall be transfe rred to usaid for additiona l bilateral family planning activities under the terms of an amendmen t offered by senators leahy clinton and others and approved by the full senate unfpa contribu tions would be available only for six purposes safe child birth and em ergency obstetric care obstetric fistula treatment and care contraceptive supplies for preven ting pregnancie s and sexually transmitted diseases including aids restoration of maternal health care in locations hit by naturaldisasters elimination of female genital mutilation and access by unaccompanied women and other vulnerable individuals to vital services hr 3057 as passed the senate furt her included modified kempkasten language that appears to narrow the terms under which unfpa can be declared ineligible for us funding the senate language stated that an organization cannot receive funds if it directly supports coer cive abortion or i nvoluntary sterilization the term directly is not currently part of the kempkasten re striction the senate measure further stated that an organization cannot be found in violation of this condition only because the government of country in which the organization operates conducts coercive pr actices this would represent new exception to past applications of the kempkasten language the senate bill further included language that would effectively reject the presidents mexico city policy this provision is similar to the text of an amendment offered by senator boxer to s 600 and adopted 5246 by the senate on april 5 the senate appropriation bill language stated that foreign ngos shall not be ineligible for us funds solely on th basis of health or medical services they provide including counselin g and referral services with nonus government funds this exemption would apply so long as the services did not viol ate the laws of the country in which they are performed and th at they would not violate us laws if provided in the united states the provision further provided that nonus government funds used by foreign ngos for advocacy and lobbying activities shall be subject to conditions that also apply to us ngos since it is largely held that american ngos would not be subject to these restric tions under the constitutional protection of free speech it is possible that this latter exemption would lift current prohibitions that apply to overseas ngos the white house opposed both the kemp kasten and mexico city policy changes and said the president would veto hr 3057 if they were included in the final bill conferees agreed to drop senatepasse d language modifying the mexico city and kempkasten restrictions leaving current policy in place on funding questions the conference agreement provides 432 million for b ilateral family planning programs plus an additional 34 million for unfpa if the organization is eligible under the terms of kempkasten if found in eligible the conference agreement stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs43 that unfpa funds would become availabl for bilateral family planning activities conferees did not include the leahyclinton amendment setting out specific activities for which unfpa c ontributions could support conflict response fund the administration proposed to establis h within the state department 100 million contingency fund to allow the united states to respond quickly to unforseen foreign crises with resources targeting immediate stability and reconstruction needs this would include funding the capacity to mobilize and deploy an emergency civilian presence in the field in the past congress has been reluctant to approve this type of contingency fund for wh ich it can apply little oversight the administration had asked lawmakers to launch somewhat simila r crisis funds in several recent emergency supplemental and foreign opera tions appropriation requests proposals that were rejected in each case the conflict response fund however differs from these previous requests in that it is linked with broad state department strategy to mo re effectively respond to w eak fragile nd postconflict states that can pose serious secu rity risks for the united states in mid2004 with considerable encour agement by senator lugar and other members of congress the department created the office of the coordinator for reconstruction and st abilization to manage the us government civilian response to crisis and unstable situations and is seek ing funds to form and train civilian ready response corps presumably the conflic t response fund could be utilized by the coordinator as an operational tool in the immediate aftermath of an international crisis where american interests were thr eatened previous requests for contingency funds had pl aced control of the money in the white house and did not link the resources with specific us policy initiative congressional action although denying the 100 million for the conflict response funds the house bill granted author ity to the administration to reprogram funds from other accounts subject to congressional notification for the same purposes as proposed for the fund in th senate the companion measure provided 24 million for the fund the reporte d bill had provided 74 million but an amendment by senator corzine transf erred 50 million to the fmf account for additional support for the african uni ons mission in sudan the conference agreement like the house denies funding for the conflict response fund conferees however ask the administration to submit prior to the fy2007 budget request more specific strategy for how the office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization will coordinate united states governmentwide efforts to respond to internati onal postconflict contingencies other key elements of the fy2006 request and congressional action beyond these specific and prominent i ssues the foreign operations proposal for fy2006 seeks to increase aid activities in few areas while cutting resources for several programs signifi cant appropriation increases and key congressional actions include the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32919crs44 exportimport bank resources increased in the request from 99
