berlin 504 c 2008 berlin 354 classified by global affairs unit chief don brown for reasons 14b nd d 1 c summary current polling data suggest that the christian democrats cducsu and the free democratic party fdp could receive sufficient votes in the september 27 national elections to form governing coalition the fdp are strong defenders of citizens privacy rights and these views have led the fdp to oppose all of germanys recent counterterrorism legislative proposals as well as voice concerns about usgerman and useu information sharing initiatives throughout these debates the fdp has favored data protection measures over the need for governments to strengthen securityrelated information sharing for counterterrorism purposes the fdps strong views on individual liberties and personal privacy could lead to complications concerning law enforcement security cooperation and data sharing were the fdp to join the government we expect they would closely scrutinize any proposals for security officials to access andor share information concerning private persons with international partners including the usg end summary the fdp and data privacy 2 c the fdp defines itself as independent probusiness party advocating low taxes open trade and minimal government intervention in business and private life the party promotes european liberalism championing freedom and individual responsibility under government as extensive as necessary and as limited as possible the fdps limited government viewpoint shapes their views on counterterrorism policy following the september 11 terrorist attacks and in reaction to number of terrorist plots uncovered in germany successive german governments have passed series of legislative packages that have strengthened germanys counterterrorism legal frameworks and broadened the investigative powers of law enforcement agencies the fdp which was not member of these post911 governing coalitions regularly criticized these amendments for infringing on citizens personal privacy rights the fdps criticisms of securityrelated data sharing agreements have also extended to the usgermany bilateral pruemlike agreement to share personal information on serious crime and terrorism suspects ref c the useu passenger name recognition pnr initiative and elements of the visa waiver program that involve sharing information on travelers fdp objections to counterterrorism laws 3 c fdp parliamentarians and party leaders were strong critics of the cducsu spd governments introduction of two new counterterrorism legislative proposals the bka law and the terror camp law passed in 2008 and enacted at the beginning of 2009 the bka law increased the investigative powers of the federal office of criminal investigation bka the most controversial aspect of the bka law was that it permitted security officials to use variety of technical surveillance measures in terrorism investigations ref b specifically the law provides the bka with the power to conduct remote online investigations of the computers of terrorism and serious crime suspects the fdp strongly opposed these measures as an unnecessary invasion of privacy despite the limitation of online searches to only lifethreatening situations or threats to the constitutional order of the german state these cases would require judges advance approval and are expected to number just dozen cases per year nevertheless fdp parliamentarian max stadler called the measures constitutionally questionable and in meeting with emin stadler feared that authorities would carry out surveillance without sufficient evidence of wrongdoing fdp parliamentarian gisela piltz warned that the law would turn the bka into super spy agency resembling the fbi former fdp federal interior minister gerhart baum blasted the law saying it violated privacy rights freedom of the press and the inviolability of private residences 4 c earlier this summer the government passed legislation developed by the justice ministry that criminalized range of terrorismrelated preparatory actions such as distributing information on bombmaking and participating in paramilitary training overseas ref the law was developed in response to the september 2007 arrests in germany of three homegrown terrorists who had attended an islamic jihad union terrorism training camp in the afghanistanpakistan border region justice ministry officials and prosecutors have told econoffs that the new law has closed gaps in germanys legal framework that had previously prevented german prosecutors from charging german citizens and residents with activities that directly or indirectly supported terrorist groups prior to the passage of the law the fdp criticized the draft as unnecessary claiming that existing legislation was sufficient to arrest and prosecute potential terrorists in germany the fdp also criticized that law for allegedly requiring prosecutors to be able to prove that individuals who participate in training at overseas terrorist camps actually intend to carry out attacks that the law would thereby permit the punishment for thoughts rather than for actions justice ministry officials have indicated to econoffs that these criticisms are unfounded hyperbole and that prosecutors will be able to build strong cases against those who undergo training at foreign terrorist training sites fdp objects to usgerman data sharing agreement 5 c immediately following the march 2008 completion of the usgerman data sharing agreement to enhance cooperation in preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crime aka the pruemlike agreement ref c fdp parliamentarians began to express concerns regarding the agreement fdp members took particular aim at an article in the agreement that calls for additional data protection measures to be taken if special categories of personal data such as ethnic origin political opinion religion trade union membership and sexual orientation are transferred among law enforcement agencies comment in our discussions with fdp parliamentarians we explained that negotiators did not foresee that such information would need to be transferred regularly and that the article was inserted as means of providing extra data privacy protections in the rare occurrence that such information was pertinent to an investigation end comment in meetings with emin stadler and piltz also expressed objections to the data retention periods of the agreement questioned which usg law enforcement agencies would have access to the information and voiced general concern about potential misuse of the personal information names dobs addresses passport numbers etc that would be shared by the agreement piltz further claimed that the us government as whole lacked effective data protection measures in comparison to germany and questioned why the usg does not have overall federal data protection commissioner as germany does comment piltz remark underscores the importance of ensuring german officials receive information about usg data protection policy the april visit to berlin by dhs chief privacy officer callahan was useful in this regard but more needs to be done to ensure german officials understand us data protection policy end comment 6 c fdp leaders have also taken aim at useu agreements that include data sharing elements following the july eu gaerc decision to give the swedish eu presidency mandate to begin negotiating successor agreement governing usg access to the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications swift database of financial transactions fdp head guido westerwelle called the plan totally unacceptable and said that the plan must be stopped parliamentarian piltz who is member of the bundestag interior committee has criticized the useu passenger name record pnr data transfer agreement for collecting pointless information on travelers and she doubts whether the information collected under pnr would be of any value to law enforcement officials in meetings with econoffs piltz broadly spoke of governments particularly that of the us accumulating large amounts of data on their mostly innocent citizens piltz expressed concerns that german commercial interests could be damaged when us authorities obtained pnr data on german business travelers that might somehow be shared with american competitors would the fdp be reliable security partner 7 c the fdps voting record on counterterrorism legislation and the views of leading fdp security policy figures described here suggest that cooperation on security matters particularly those involving information sharing with future german government that includes the fdp could be problematic at times the fdps fixation on data privacy and protection issues looks to have come at the expense of the party forming responsible views on security policy the fdp has been out of power for over 10 years and lack experience tackling security issues in the internet age the fdp appears not to fully grasp the transnational character of terrorism today and terrorists increasing use of the internet and related technology to recruit train and organize current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble cdu has repeatedly drawn attention to terrorist use of the internet which he calls the main medium of holy war against the west it is the communication platform advertising medium distance university training camp think tank and recruiting instrument for terrorists schaeuble understands that combating terrorism in globalized world requires international cooperation and for security officials to use modern technology fdp leader has displayed similar understanding of the need to find proper balance between personal freedoms and security measures the fdp has all too often found it politically expedient to cast these goals as mutually exclusive 8 c at election campaign rallies last week fdp chairman guido westerwelle criticized the online surveillance measures contained in the bka law and championed the fdp as the sole party committed to data privacy and protection issues fdp parliamentarian sabine leutheusserschnarrenberger has been suggested as possible justice minister in cducsu fdp government job she previously held under chancellor helmut kohl cdu given that she resigned as justice minister in 1996 after failing to obtain support for her rejection of cdu proposal to expand the states right to monitor private citizens we would expect her to closely scrutinize all bilateral and useu information sharing proposals in particular fdpled justice ministry could well complicate implementation of the bilateral pruemlike agreement prevent negotiations on hspd6 terrorist screening data sharing arrangement and raise objections to useu information sharing initiatives 9 c an mfa official working in the counterterrorism office noted that one reason the fdp has been so vocal in opposing germanys counterterrorism legislative drafts bilateral and useu security initiatives is due to the fact that they are in the opposition pure political considerations dictate that the role of the opposition is to oppose the governing coalitions proposals following this line of reasoning were the fdp to join the cducsu in governing coalition the responsibilities of power would perhaps convince them to take more constructive approach to counterterrorism and security issues furthermore given that the fdp would be the junior partner in the coalition we hope that cducsu leadership would ensure that german legal frameworks are adequate and that law enforcement and security officials continue our current close cooperation and robust information sharing on operational matters murphy
