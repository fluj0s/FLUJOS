israel in 1998 israeli prime ministers on several occasions requested that president clinton grant clemency to pollard but the clinton administration ended without reprieve it is likely that the

subsequently netanyahus successor ehud barak renewed israeli requests that pollard be freed some observers suggested that pollard would be included among those pardoned during the last weeks of the clinton administration but that did not occur although the president has authority to grant pardons the role of congressional opinion may become an importa nt factor in the review of pollards case the background information provided below is based on material available in the media but not on court documents this crs report does not purport to be legal analysis of the case background according to factual proffer submitted by us attorney joseph digenova to the district count in washington on june 4 19862 pollard us citizen worked as civil servant for intelligence offices of the us navy from september 1979 until november 21 1985 during which period he had access to classified information in the early summer of 1984 pollard contacted israeli intelligence officials and began providing classified documents to an israeli officer who was not working in the israeli embassy subsequently his primary contact became the thenscience consul at the israeli embassy in washington who asked him to obtain specific classified documents pollard met with israeli contacts to provide documents on biweekly basis and received regular payments estimated to have totaled over 45000 according to government sources he provided access to classified documents that would fill space ten feet by six feet by six feet some former government officials claim he also offered classified information to countries other than israel he and his thenwife anne henderson pollard twice traveled to europe and to israel with israeli assistance on the basis of report by coworker pollard was interviewed in november 1985 by federal bureau of investigation fbi and naval investigative service officials regarding his removal of classified documents from his office few days later on november 21 1985 pollard and his wife attempted to enter the israeli embassy but were rebuffed by the israelis and arrested by fbi agents after some hesitation pollard cooperated with justice department officials who promised to inform the court of his cooperation and to seek substantial prison term but not life sentence he was promised that the prosecution would seek lesser prison term for his wife subsequently the secretary of defense caspar weinberger submitted damageassessment memorandum which remains classified to the court arguing that pollard had committed an exceptionally grave offense against the national security including the compromise of intelligence sources and methods pollard pleaded guilty to espionage and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment his wife was sentenced to fiveyear prison term the sentence was appealed because pollards cooperation had been encouraged with promise of leniency which was not granted by the court judges are not obligated to follow recommendations of prosecutors in 1992 the us court of appeals on 21 vote upheld the sentence anne henderson pollard was released in 1989 after servinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20001crs3 3 see wolf blitzer territory of

later divorced jonathan pollard subsequently remarried while in prison pollard is incarcerated in the federal correctional institution in butner nc for some time the israeli government denied responsibility for the espionage effort arguing that it was rogue intelligence effort by misguided officials3 but in 1998 the netanyahu government acknowledged that pollard had been an israeli agent handled by highranking israeli officials of the bureau for scientific relations4 pollard was granted israeli citizenship in february 1996 and netanyahu barak and other senior officials have regularly pressed washington for his release from prison to enable him to live in israel as an israeli citizen pollard could be released from prison through parole or presidential pardon reportedly he has not applied for parole out of fear that it would not be granted and that he would not be eligible to reapply for several years5 his supporters in the united states and in israel have instead sought presidential pardon under article ii section 2 clause 1 of the constitution the president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons for federal offenses except in cases of impeachment the presidents pardon power is not subject to legislative control nor may court overrule or circumscribe presidents decision further reason has to be given for granting pardon6 from 1980 through 1999 some 804 pardons have been granted and 51 sentences have been commuted while much larger number have been denied although pollards supporters continued to lobby for clemency pollard was not included among those who were pardoned in the final days of the clinton administration media accounts do indicate that planned mid2000 move of pollard from one section of the butner facility to another that was perceived as more dangerous was cancelled at the request of the white house after protests by jewish leaders in new york7 public support and opposition after an intensive campaign by pollards family some american groups sympathetic to israel have urged that his sentence be commuted reportedly 15 million persons mostly americans and israelis have signed petitions urging his release and some 40 members of the 105th congress support clemency8 pollards supporters contend that the sentence was excessive and that he worked on behalf of an ally the effort has at times been hindered by changing statements by pollard and by shifting lawyers and spokesmenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20001crs4 9 james risen and steven erlanger cia chief vowed to quit if clinton freed israeli spy new york times

community officials and by congressional leadership according to new york times report9 director of central intelligence dci george tenet said he would resign should pollard be released in response to israeli pressure at the 1998 wye conference seven former secretaries of defense subsequently opposed pardon as did senior congressional leaders four former directors of naval intelligence pollards one time superiors argued in december 1998 that pollards sentence was based fairly on his illegal activities including offers to provide information to three countries other than israel and that pardon of pollard would send most damaging message to the loyal us citizens who are entrusted with our national secrets many of whom have emotional ties to other nations but who nonethele ss have taken seriously their oath to keep our national security information secret10 middle east consequences of clemency israeli political party has made clemency for pollard key issue in its political program majority of the knesset members and many other israelis support pollards release but overall clemency for jonathan pollard is not high profile issue in israel if president were to grant clemency to pollard it is possible that arab commentators would seize upon the release as further evidence of us double standard that treats israel more favorably than the arabs but it is unlikely that pollards release would affect arab relations with the united states or have negative impact on the peace process procon discussion of presidential clemency following are arguments in favor of and opposed to presidential clemency for jonathan pollard the arguments appear as they would be presented by advocates of the positions the arguments are not presented in any particular order of importance in favor of clemency opposed to clemency 1 releasing jonathan pollard will contribute to the peace process because israel requested that pollard be released as demonstration of us intentions to meet its commitments as peace process sponsor in turn the united states will ensure that the palestinians meet their commitments only with such assurances will israel be able to take the risks necessary to make peace reality releasing pollard will act to guarantee the success of the peace1 pollard has nothing to do with the current israelipalestinian peace process israeli prime ministe r netanyahu introduced the pollard issue at the last minute in the wye discussions perhaps in the belief that president clinton would agree to the pollard release to clinch the wye agreement us efforts to maintain the integrity of its intelligence should not be compromised by such diplomatic extortionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20001crs5 in favor of clemency opposed to clemency 2 sixteen years have passed since the incident the information pollard passed to israel or may still possess is out of date by now there is harm to the country if pollard is released2 it is reported that pollard has photographic memory and still retains knowledge of intelligence systems methods procedures and craftsmanship that would be useful to outsiders his interpretations of the material the great bulk of which was not returned to the united states could be of great benefit to outsiders he continues to pose threat to the united states particularly if the final destination of the infor mation he still possesses is unknown 3 pollard was helping an ally not an enemy the informati on pollard provided to israel was vital for israels defense against the arabs and was being denied israel by us intelligence officials israel was entitled to the inform ation under the 1983 letter of understanding on security information without that information israel would have been the target of arab weapons of mass destruc tion the israeli attack on the iraqi nuclear facility and the discoveries made by the inspection team in iraq prove that israel needed the information to defend itself3 laws that prohibit providing classified information to unauthorized persons do not distinguish between allies and enemies if pollard was so concern ed about israel why did he offer to sell information to other countries the united states systematically makes available to israel information that is deemed necessary for israels defense the decision on what material is to be made available to israel does not rest with individuals like pollard who presume to know more than the president the secretar ies of state and defense the director of central intelligence or other us government officials who do decide what information should be given to israel the press has reported that polla rds israeli handlers requested specific information that went well beyond israels defense against the arabs information provided by pollard may have left israel either stolen or as commodity traded for other considerations 4 pollard could be traded nations often trade spies exchanging one captured spy for another or for other considerations there are several possible exchanges the united states would release pollard egypt would release azam azam an israeli druze accused of spying for israel and israel would release many of the 2000 to 3000 palestinians being held in israeli jails for various crimes or israel might trade pollard for samuel sheinbein the young man held in israel accused of murder in maryland 4 nations exchange foreign spies they have captured for one of their citizens captured and incarcerated in foreign country nations do not trade their own citizens for noncitizens or for people accused of criminal activities the united states sought legal extradition of sheinbeinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20001crs6 in favor of clemency opposed to clemency 5 israel gave pollard citizenship in january 1996 and admitted that he was an agent of the israeli gover nment in may 1998 pollard has admitted that he broke us laws and spied for israel and has stated that he is sorry for what he has done after 13 years in prison israels recognition of its role and pollards statement of remorse it is time to send pollard home to israel5 pollard was us citizen when he broke the law and violated his nations trust israels belated granting of citizenship does not change the nature of the crime or the damage it inflicted 6 jonathan pollard agreed in plea bargain that he would plead guilty and would cooperate in the investigation providing the united states government did not give him life sentence jonathan pollard kept his part of the bargain he cooperated fully in the investigat ion and waived his right to jury trial the united states reneged on its agreement based on an exagg erated damage assessment by secretary of defense caspar weinberger 6 the federal prosecutor agreed not to request life but only substantial number of years in prison specific number of years was mentioned the prosecutor kept his bargain with pollard the judge decided on the life sentence after hearing of the enormous amount of damage caused by pollard from the statements of the secretary of defense the director of central intelligence and us government officials the life sentence was upheld by an appellate court 7 pollard has served 16 years more than enough time for the socalled crime of helping friend others caught passing information to friendly governments and allies serve between two and four years on average many who have spied for enemies of the united states have not served as long as pollard7 pollard was eligible for parole after ten years but he has never applied for parole his sentence was based on the severity of damage he inflicted the intelligence methods he revealed the agents he betrayed and endangered
