information from cbo differences between the houses are supposed to be resolved by april 15 but this deadline is rarely met although it is not binding the resolution provides framework for subsequent legislative action on the budget eg annual appropriations bills the presidents fy2007 budget contains number of proposals that would affect medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip some are program expansions and others are designed to reduce federal spending while certain proposals would require legislative action others would be implemented administratively eg via regulatory changes issuance of program guidance etc on march 9 2006 the senate budget committee reported budget resolution sconres 83 which was subsequently amended and passed by the senate on march 16 the resolution did not include reconciliation instructions for the senate finance committee which has jurisdiction over medicaid and schip it did include deficitneutral reserve fund for the uninsured and funding for four of the presidents medicaid and schip proposals on march 29 2006 the house budget committee reported its own budget resolution hconres 376 which was subsequently amended and passed by the house on may 18 the resolution did not include reconciliation instructions for the house energy and commerce committee which has jurisdiction over medicaid and schip its spending levels for medicaid and schip are based on cbos baseline projections under current law and policies with reduction in medicaid assumed although agreement was reached by the house and senate on fy2007 budget resolution current law spending for medicaid and schip is unaffected as entitlement programs their spending levels are based on the underlying benefit and eligibility criteria established in law in the case of schip these criteria include statutory annual funding cap however legislation that would increase medicaid or schip spending above current law could encounter procedural roadblocks in the house or senate if funding is not assumed in budget resolution or in deeming resolution the annual appropriations process also provides an opportunity for congress to place limitations on the availability of federal funds for specified medicaid and schip activities before the 109th congress adjourned it passed two bills hr 6111 and hr 6164 that addressed variety of medicaid and schip

executive branch agencies such as hhs and the office of management and budget omb provide baseline current law estimates of medicaid and schip spending along with estimated costs and savings of proposed changes however cbo and the executive branch differ in their treatment of legislative and administrative proposals in executive branch documents describing the presidents budget implementation of proposed administrative changes is assumed in estimates of baseline medicaid and schip spending and estimates for legislative proposals are presented separately2 in general cbo only adjusts its baseline estimates to account for administrative changes as they are implemented rather than as they are proposed and only provides separate estimates for legislative proposals for this reason and others cbo and executive branch estimates of medicaid and schip spending will differ among the administrative proposals in the presidents fy2007 budget two have received widespread attention limiting the extent to which states may tax certain health care providers to obtain additional federal medicaid dollars and plan to cap medicaid payments to government providers to more than the cost of furnishing services in may and june of 2006 respectively members of the house and senate sent separate letters to hhs secretary leavitt urging him to not implement changes to medicaid via administrative action both letters cited the importance of review and input from congress in modifying medicaid3 as described later before adjourning the 109th congress passed legislation hr 6111 that

cbo noted that it did not have enough information to estimate the part of the proposal that would expand the use of liens for certain liability settlements b in executive branch documents describing the presidents budget implementation of proposed administrative changes is assumed in estimates of baseline medicaid and schip spending and estimates for legislative proposals are presented separately in general cbo only adjusts its baseline estimates to account for administrative changes as they are implemented rather than as they are proposed and only provides separate estimates for legislative proposals medicaid transitional medical assistance background states are required to continue medicaid benefits for certain lowincome families who would otherwise lose coverage because of changes in their income this continuation of benefits is known as transitional medical assistance tma federal law permanently requires four months of tma for families who lose medicaid eligibility due to increased child or spousal support collections it also permanently requires four months of tma for families who lose medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment however congress expanded workrelated tma benefits in 1988 requiring states to provide at least six and up to 12 months of tma coverage to families losing medicaid eligibility due to increased hours of work or income from employment as well as to families who lose eligibility due to the loss of timelimited earned income disregard such disregards allow families to qualify for medicaid at higher income levels for set period of time congress has acted on numerous occasions to extend these expanded tma requirements which are outlined in section 1925 of the social security act beyond their original sunset date of september 30 1998 they are currently set to expire on december 31 2006 proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to extend expanded tma requirements through september 30 2007 hhs estimates that the proposal would cost medicaid 180 million in fy2007 and 360 million over the fy2007fy2011 period the budgetary effects extend beyond fy2007 because families are still entitled to up to 12 months of tma if they qualify on or before the expiration date cbo estimates that the proposal would cost medicaid 129 million in fy2007 and 526 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo also estimates that the proposal would save schip 3 million in both fy2007 and over the fy2007fy2011 period congressional action before adjourning the 109th congress passed hr 6111 which extends expanded tma requirements through june 30 2007 reports see crs report rl31698 transitional medical assistance tma under medicaid by april grady medicaid vaccines for children background the vaccines for children vfc program is funded by federal medicaid appropriations and administered by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc under section 1928 of the social security act children who are crs5 1 medicaid recipients 2 uninsured 3 american indians or alaska natives or 4 underinsured because their health insurance does not cover qualified pediatric immunizations are entitled to receive vfc vaccines free of charge currently children in the first three categories may receive vfc vaccines from any programregistered provider as defined in section 1928c of the social security act while underinsured children may only receive vfc vaccines at federally qualified health centers fqhcs or rural health clinics in 2002 there were approximately 42000 active vfc provider sites 30000 private and 12000 public4 in 2000 an estimated 57 of children receiving vfc vaccines were eligible because they were medicaid recipients another 36 receiving vfc vaccines were uninsured while 5 were underinsured and 2 were american indians or alaska natives5 proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to improve vaccine access by allowing underinsured children to receive vfc vaccines at state and local health clinics rather than only at fqhcs and rural health clinics hhs estimates that the proposal would cost 140 million in fy2007 and 700 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would cost 115 million in fy2007 and 715 million over the fy2007fy2011 period reports for general information on fqhcs and rural health clinics see crs report rl32046 federal health centers program by sharon kearney coleman medicaid expand thirdparty liability background thirdparty liability tpl refers to the legal obligation of third parties individuals entities or programs to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under medicaid in general federal law requires medicaid to be the payer of last resort meaning that all other available third parties must meet their legal obligation to pay claims before the medicaid program pays for the care of an individual states are required to take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the state medicaid plan if state has determined that probable liability exists at the time claim for reimbursement is filed it generally must reject the claim and return it to the provider for determination of the amount of thirdparty liability referred to as cost avoidance if probable liability has not been established or the third party is not available to pay the individuals medical expenses the state must pay the claim and then attempt to recover the amount paid referred to as pay and chase states are generally required to cost avoid claims unless they have an approved waiver that allows them to use the payandchase method however there are two 4 centers for disease control and prevention vfc program data available at httpwwwcdcgovnipvfcst_immz_projdatadatahtm 5 institute of medicine calling the shots immunization finance policies and practices washington national academy press 2000 pp 7785 crs6 statutory exceptions to this rule in the case of prenatal and preventive pediatric care states are required to use pay and chase in the case of medicaid beneficiary whose parent provides medical support eg health insurance coverage via an employer as part of child support order being enforced by the state the state must use pay and chase if provider has not been paid under the medical support arrangement within 30 days in some cases medicaid beneficiary may be required to reimburse the state for medicaid expenses paid on his or her behalf to facilitate such reimbursement the state may place lien on the medicaid beneficiarys property with certain exceptions federal law generally prohibits states from imposing medicaid liens on the property of living beneficiaries in contrast federal law permits medicaid liens on the estates of deceased beneficiaries in wider variety of situations proposal the presidents budget seeks three legislative changes the first would require providers to bill third parties for prenatal and preventive pediatric care services and wait at least 90 days before billing medicaid the second would require providers to bill third parties in the case of medical support provided via child support order and wait at least 90 days before billing medicaid the third would explicitly permit states to use liens against liability settlements to recover medicaid amounts paid on behalf of beneficiaries hhs estimates that the proposal would save 90 million in fy2007 and 525 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the first two parts of the proposal would save 105 million in fy2007 and 265 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo noted in its preliminary analysis that it did not have enough information to estimate the third part reports currently other crs reports address this topic medicaid reduce targeted case management match background under current law case management is an optional benefit under the medicaid state plan that assists medicaid beneficiaries in gaining access to needed medical social educational and other services the term targeted case management refers to situations in which these services are not provided statewide to all medicaid beneficiaries but rather are provided only to specific classes of individuals eg those with aids tuberculosis chronic physical or mental illness developmental disabilities or children in foster care or persons who reside in specific area since case management is not an administrative activity the federal government matches payments for such services at the rate applicable to medicaid benefits this rate ranges from 50 to 83 statutory upper boundary depending on the state in fy2006 12 states had federal matching rate for benefits equal to 50 proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to change the reimbursement level for targeted case management to the 50 matching rate that states currently receive for most medicaid administrative costs hhs estimates that the proposal would save 208 million in fy2007 and 1187 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 250 million in fy2007 and 1485 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period crs7 reports for general information on medicaid administrative costs see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april grady medicaid amend drug rebate formula background under medicaid drug manufacturers that wish to have their drugs available for medicaid enrollees are required to enter into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs on behalf of the states under the agreements pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide state medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries the formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs rebate calculations depend on the type of drug for single source and innovator multiple source drugs basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the average manufacturer price amp for drug the average price paid by wholesalers to the best price which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesaler retailer nonprofit or public entity the basic rebate is the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the amp and the best price additional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of given manufacturers single source and innovator multiple source drugs rise faster than inflation for noninnovator multiple source drugs basic rebates are equal to 11 of the amp proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to eliminate the best price from the rebate formula for single source and innovator multiple source drugs changing the best pricebased formula to flat rebate this change is intended to be made in budget neutral manner hhs explanatory materials describe the proposal as way to simplify drug rebate calculations and allow private purchasers to negotiate lower drug prices hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2007 or over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2007 or over the fy2007fy2011 period reports for general background on medicaid prescription drug coverage and pricing including description of drug rebates see crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid restructure pharmacy reimbursement background under current law state medicaid programs set the prices paid to pharmacies for medicaid outpatient drugs federal reimbursements for those drugs however are limited to federal upper limit ful the ful that applies to drugs available from multiple sources generic drugs for the most part is calculated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to be equal to 150 of the lowest published average wholesale price awp for the least costly therapeutic equivalent the upper limit that applies to brandname and other drugs is equal to the acquisition cost as estimated by the states recently the president signed the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra 2005 which will change the ful formula for multiple source drugs beginning january 1 2007 the ful for these drugs will be crs8 equal to 250 of the average manufacturers price amp the average price paid by wholesalers to manufacturers proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation that would build on changes made by dra 2005 to achieve additional savings in the medicaid program the proposal would reduce the fuls on multiple source drugs from 250 of the amp to 150 of the amp hhs estimates that the proposal would save 130 million in fy2007 and 1285 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 275 million in fy2007 and 2325 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period reports for more information on the medicaid provisions of dra 2005 see crs report rl33131

medicaid and schip provisions in the deficit reduction act of 2005 by karen tritz et additional background information on medicaid prescription drugs can be found in crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid optional managed formulary for prescription drugs background federal statute allows state medicaid programs to establish formularies or lists of preferred pharmaceuticals to be made available to medicaid beneficiaries when health care insurers or providers cover only those drugs on the list and deny payment for others the list is referred to as closed formulary medicaid formularies are seldom as restrictive as the closed formularies found in the private market for insurance because of two requirements 1 states are required to provide any nonformulary drug with the exception of drugs in specific categories described below that is specifically requested and approved through prior authorization process and 2 states are required to cover all drugs offered by manufacturers entering into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs states on the other hand are permitted to exclude certain categories of drug products from medicaid coverage these include drugs used to treat anorexia weight loss or weight gain b to promote fertility c for cosmetic purposes or hair growth d for the relief of coughs and colds for smoking cessation and f prescription vitamins and mineral products except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations g nonprescription drugs h barbiturates i benzodiazepines and j drugs requiring tests or monitoring that can only be provided by the drug manufacturer formularies may also exclude drug for which there is significant therapeutic advantage over other drugs that are included in the formularies as long as there is written explanation of the reason for its exclusion and the explanation is available to the public as of january 1 2006 federal law also prohibits federal medicaid funds from being used to pay for drugs for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction crs9 proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to allow states to use private sector management techniques to leverage greater discounts through negotiations with drug manufacturers supporting material describes these management techniques as common cost control tools for private insurers other description of the management techniques is provided hhs estimates that the proposal would save 15 million in fy2007 and 177 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 10 million in fy2007 and 200 million over the fy2007fy2011 period reports for general background on medicaid prescription drug benefits formularies and other cost control mechanisms used in administering those benefits see crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid administrative cost allocation background because of the overlap in eligible populations states often undertake administrative activities that benefit more than one program under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc cash welfare program afdc and medicaid program eligibility were linked and many afdc families also qualified for food stamps as result states often collected necessary information for all three programs during single eligibility interview or performed other shared administrative tasks and charged the full amount of the cost to afdc as matter of convenience since the federal government reimbursed states for 50 of administrative expenditures for all three programs total federal spending was not affected by the way in which states allocated the programs common administrative costs when congress replaced afdc with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program in 1996 the 50 federal match for expenditures related to cash welfare assistance ended and the automatic link between cash welfare and medicaid eligibility was severed later hhs clarified that states are required to allocate common administrative costs for tanf medicaid and food stamps based on the relative benefits derived by each program remaining issue of controversy stems from the fact that tanf block grants are calculated in part on the basis of pre1996 federal welfare spending including any amounts received by states as reimbursement for common administrative costs as result tanf block grants are higher in many states than they would be if common administrative costs attributable to medicaid and food stamps were excluded from block grant calculations to compensate congress has permanently reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states by flat dollar amount that reflects the administrative costs attributable to food stamps that are included in each states tanf block grant the annual reductions total nearly 200 million congress has not reduced federal reimbursement for medicaid administrative costs in similar manner proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to recoup medicaid administrative costs assumed in states tanf block grants hhs estimates that the proposal would save 280 million in fy2007 and 1770 billion over the fy2007 crs10 fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 280 million in fy2007 and 1770 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period reports see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april grady medicaid refugee exemption extension background under current law most legal immigrants who entered the country on or after august 22 1996 and some who entered prior to that date are not eligible for supplemental security income ssi benefits and thus ssirelated medicaid until they have resided in the country for five years or have obtained citizenship refugees and asylees are currently exempted from this ban for the first seven years they reside in the united states proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to extend the exemption for refugees and asylees from seven years to eight years allowing additional time for individuals to complete the citizenship process without losing ssi and ssirelated medicaid eligibility hhs estimates that the proposal would cost 42 million in fy2007 and 134 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would cost 5 million in fy2007 and 17 million over the fy2007 fy2011 period reports for general background information see crs report rl31269 refugee admissions and resettlement policy by andorra bruno crs report rl31630 federal funding for

medicaid eliminate pay and chase for pharmacy background as described earlier under the expand third party liability proposal if state has determined that probable third party liability exists at the time claim for reimbursement is filed it generally must reject the claim and return it to the provider for determination of the amount of third party liability referred to as cost avoidance if probable liability has not been established or the third party is not available to pay the individuals medical expenses the state must pay the claim and then attempt to recover the amount paid referred to as pay and chase states are generally required to cost avoid claims unless they have an approved waiver that allows them to use the pay and chase method proposal the presidents budget would through administrative action require states to use cost avoidance by eliminating the pay and chase waiver option for pharmacy claims hhs estimates that the proposal would save 105 million in fy2007 and 430 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo did not provide an estimate for the proposal see earlier discussion under legislative versus administrative proposals reports currently other crs reports address this topic crs11 medicaid phase down provider tax background under federal law and regulations states ability to use providerspecific taxes to fund its state share of medicaid expenditures is limited if states establish providerspecific taxes those taxes generally cannot exceed 25 of the state or nonfederal share of medicaid expenditures and the state cannot provide guarantee to the providers that the taxes will be returned to them however if the taxes returned to provider are less than 6 of the providers revenues ceiling created in regulation by hhs the prohibition on guaranteeing the return of tax funds is not violated as result state could impose provider tax of 6 of revenues return those revenues to the provider in the form of medicaid payment and receive federal match for those amounts in effect the state has temporarily borrowed funds from the provider for the purpose of inflating federal matching funds proposal the presidents budget seeks regulatory change to phase down the allowable provider tax rate from 6 to 3 hhs estimates that the proposal would have budget impact in fy2007 and would save 2070 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo did not provide an estimate for the proposal see earlier discussion under legislative versus administrative proposals congressional action before adjourning the 109th congress passed hr 6111 which prevents the presidents provider tax proposal from being implemented via administrative action hr 6111 fixed the provider tax ceiling in statute at 6 except for the period january 1 2008september 31 2011 during which the rate is fixed at 55 reports for background information on provider taxes see crs report 97483 medicaid disproportionate share payments by jean hearne medicaid issue provider tax regulation background see the phase down provider tax proposal above proposal the presidents budget seeks to clarify through regulation existing policies used to determine whether or not provider taxes comply with statute and regulations hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2007 or over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo did not provide an estimate for the proposal see earlier discussion under legislative versus administrative proposals reports for background information on provider taxes see crs report 97483 medicaid disproportionate share payments by jean hearne medicaid cap government providers background aggregate medicaid payments to specific groups of institutional providers eg hospitals and nursing facilities cannot exceed reasonable estimate of what would have been paid under medicare payment principles this is called the crs12 medicaid upper payment limit upl rule in many states medicare payment rates for hospital and nursing home care are higher than corresponding medicaid payment rates the upl based on medicare payment principles has enabled some states to draw down additional federal dollars that exceed what they would have received based on medicaid payment rates these additional funds are paid to government providers which are sometimes required by states to transfer all or portion of the extra payments received ie some or all of the difference between the medicare and medicaid payment rates back to the state through an intergovernmental transfer igt instead of financing more or improved medicaid services in some cases states have used the additional federal dollars for nonhealth services or to make up part of the state share of medicaid costs to draw down another round of federal dollars during 20002002 congress and the clinton and bush administrations revised upl rules by changing permissible accounting methods used to claim federal matching payments these changes significantly reduced the excess federal dollars states received under approved upl plans that involved igts however these reforms did not eliminate all such excess payments because changes were made to the medicaid upl standard which remains tied to the medicare payment rate nor to federal statute or regulations governing igts administration officials have taken additional steps to curb what they have identified as improper state financing mechanisms especially certain intergovernmental transfers in late 2003 cms began requesting detailed information regarding the sources of the state share of medicaid costs from states applying for medicaid waivers and submitting medicaid state plan amendments in some cases these proposals were modified to minimize the use of improper igts ie igts that use recycling mechanisms under which payments to providers are returned to the state artificially inflating the federal matching rate proposal the presidents budget would through administrative action 1 recover federal payments resulting from improper igts and 2 cap payments to government providers to more than the cost of providing services to medicaid beneficiaries rather than to medicare payment principles hhs estimates that the proposal would save 384 million in fy2007 and 3812 billion over the fy2007 fy2011 period cbo did not provide an estimate for the proposal see earlier discussion under legislative versus administrative proposals reports see crs report rl31021 medicaid upper payment limits and intergovernmental transfers current issues and recent regulatory and legislative action by elicia j herz medicaid stricter reimbursement policies for rehabilitation services background since the inception of medicaid in 1965 states have been authorized to cover other diagnostic screening preventive or rehabilitative crs13 services as an optional medicaid service6 in subsequent legislation obra 90 pl 101508 congress clarified the benefit as including any medical or remedial service provided in facility home or other

medicaid disproportionate share payments by jean hearne schip modify redistribution to address 2007 shortfalls background the balanced budget act of 1997 established schip in general this program allows states to cover targeted lowincome children with health insurance in families with income that is above medicaid eligibility levels states may choose among three benefit options when designing their schip programs they may enroll targeted lowincome children in medicaid create separate state program or devise combination of both approaches all states the district of columbia and five territories have schip programs nearly 40 billion has been appropriated for schip for fy1998fy2007 the authorized appropriation for fy2007 is 50 billion annual allotments among the states are determined by formula that is based on combination of the number of lowincome children and lowincome uninsured children in the state and includes cost factor that represents the average health service industry wages in the state compared to the national average states have three years to spend each annual allotment eg states have until the end of fy2007 to spend their fy2005 allotments at the end of the applicable threeyear period unspent funds are reallocated among states based on yearspecific rules in the early years of the schip both states that did and did not fully exhaust their original allotments received unspent funds for more recent years only those states that fully exhaust their original allotments receive unspent funds some states have experienced shortfalls in schip funds meaning at the end of given fiscal year they have spent all federal schip funds available to them at that point in time including original allotments and reallocations of unspent funds from other states proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to better target schip funds in more timely manner to address potential state shortfalls in fy2007 hhs estimates the cost of the proposal at 635 million in fy2007 with net cost of 110 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates the schip cost of the proposal at 570 million in fy2007 with net cost of 460 million over the fy2007fy2011

background the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl 104191 established number of rules for employerbased health insurance plans to improve access to and portability of plans for people enrolled or enrolling into those plans one of those provisions requires employerbased health plans to allow for new enrollment into the plan during periods outside of the typical annual open enrollment period for certain special reasons examples of those reasons include when an eligible employee or their dependent exhausts cobra continuation coverage or when an employee gains new dependent through birth or adoption another hipaa provision limits the ability of private health insurance plans to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions during what are known as pre existing condition exclusion periods the allowable length of such preexisting condition exclusion periods depends on the amount of time the new enrollee had been covered by prior creditable health insurance coverage11 beneficiary can prove they have had prior creditable coverage by providing certificates issued by insurers at the end of each year because hipaa was created in law before schip was established schip was not included on the list of types of health insurance that can be considered as prior creditable coverage proposal the presidents budget seeks two legislative changes relating to hipaa the first would define determination of medicaid or schip eligibility as qualifying event allowing for special enrollment period into employerbased health insurance plans this provision is intended to improve medicaid and schip programs ability to coordinate coverage with private employeroffered coverage the second proposal would require schip programs to issue certificates of creditable coverage this provision is intended to improve the reach of hipaas portability provisions by recognizing schip coverage as prior creditable coverage both of these interpretations have previously been promulgated in final regulation implementing hipaas portability for group health plan provisions12 hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2007 or over the 11 not

schip reached nearly 62 million in fy2003 the number of children ever enrolled in medicaid during that year reached 274 million there have been ongoing concerns about takeup rates among children who meet eligibility standards but are not covered by these two programs estimates of the number of children eligible but not enrolled in medicaid or schip have varied considerably over time by 2002 national survey data showed that 28 million children under age 19 were uninsured but eligible for schip and an additional 34 million were uninsured but eligible for medicaid13 outreach can be financed under the medicaid and schip programs under medicaid the federal matching rate for administrative expenses which include outreach activities is set at 50 for all states there is limit on federal spending for schip administrative expenses which also include outreach for federal matching purposes 10 cap applies to state administrative expenses this cap is tied to the dollar amount that state draws down from its annual schip allotment to cover benefits as opposed to 10 of states total annual allotment proposal the cover the kids outreach program would provide annual grants to states working with schools and community organizations to enroll eligible children in medicaid and schip the grant is not part of the medicaid or schip budget proposals but rather is component of the state grants and demonstrations budget proposals under the jurisdiction of cms which is responsible for oversight of medicaid and schip the grant would cost 100 million in fy2007 and 500 million over the fy2007fy2011 period hhs estimates that the impact of the grant on medicaid spending would result in additional costs of 203 million in fy2007 and 1978 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period likewise hhs estimates that the impact of the grant on schip spending would be 69 million in fy2007 and 330 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo estimates that the proposal would increase medicaid spending by 13 million in fy2007 and 477 million over the fy2007fy2011 period cbo also estimates that the proposal would increase schip spending by 3 million in fy2007 and 26 million over the fy2007 fy2011 period

did not include reconciliation instructions for the house energy and commerce committee which has jurisdiction over medicaid and schip the report accompanying the resolution as reported by the house budget committee hrept 109402 indicates that spending levels for medicaid and schip were based on cbos baseline projections under current law and policies and that reduction in medicaid was assumed16 although agreement was reached by the house and senate on fy2007 budget resolution current law spending for medicaid and schip is unaffected as entitlement programs their spending levels are based on the underlying benefit and eligibility criteria established in law in the case of schip these criteria include statutory annual funding cap17 however legislation that would increase medicaid or schip spending above current law could encounter procedural roadblocks in the house or senate if funding is not assumed in budget resolution or in deeming resolution18 the annual appropriations process also provides an opportunity for congress to place limitations on the availability of federal funds for specified medicaid and schip activities19 for example when the house reported its proposal for fy2007 labor health and human services and education and related agencies lhhs ed appropriations on june 20 2006 hr 5647 hrept 109515 it included provision that would prohibit hhs from using any of the funds
