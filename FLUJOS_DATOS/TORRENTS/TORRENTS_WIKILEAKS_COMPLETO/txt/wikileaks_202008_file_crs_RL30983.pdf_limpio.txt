beijing this report briefly reviews tibets historical status discusses current issues within tibet and as components of u schina relations and discusses bush administration views and pendi ng legislation in the 107th congress brief historical background of tibet tibetan history is notable in two particular respects one is the extraordinarily pervasive influence of buddhism in all asp ects of daily life at one time sizeable number of tibets male popul ation were monks and lama s and eventually this ecclesiastical group becam tibets temporal rulers as well as its spiritual leaders the dalai lama believed to be the reincarnation of tibets patron deity is the highest and most revered among this ruling monastic theocracy the second noteworthy aspect of tibe tan history is the ambiguity and disagreement surrounding tibets long politi cal relationship with china tibetans generally view tibet as an historica lly independent nation that had close relationship with succession of chines empires succession of chinese governments on the other hand have cla imed tibet as political and geographical part of china1 in 19491951 the newly establishe d communist government of the peoples republic of china prc backed up this claim by sending military troops to occupy tibet since then tibet has been under active beijing rule as its westernmost province xizang the tibet autonomous region much of the prcs tenure there has been troubled partic ularly during the tumultuous cultural revolution 19661976 when most monast eries palaces and other aspects of tibetan buddhism and culture were either damaged or stroyed the internationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30983crs2 2 there are varying estimates for how many tibetans may have died as direct consequence of chinese rule the figure of 12 million is the figure generally used by the tibetan governmentinexile warren w smith author of the tibetan nation p 607 calculates that the number of deaths is closer to 600000 3 some assert that past us actions which treat ed tibet as if it were an independent state in effect signaled us recognition michae l c van walt van praag for instance in the status of tibet history rights and prospects in international law westview press boulder colorado 1987 states that was hington supported tibet and treated it as an independent state even recognizing its facto italics included independence p 139 in the daily press briefing of october 8 1987 responding to question concerning what year the united states formally recognized tibet as part of china the state departments public affairs office issued the following statement we have never recognized tibet as sovereign state independent of china we first made the statem ent that we considered tibet to be part of china in 1978 however our earlier formulations were not inconsistent with the statement and we have never challenged chinas claim third country recognizes tibet as state independent of china campaign for tibet claims that over 1 million tibetans died during the first 30 years of prc rule2 in 1959 at the age of 24 the dalai lama fl ed tibet and went into exile in india with group of his followers he remains there today along with tibetan refugee community of tens of thousands and he is still widely regarded as the spiritual leader of the tibetan people their foremost advocat and figure of international stature he has steadfastly maintained that tibe t is an independent country under illegal occupation by chinese government forces but he has also been willing to negotiate with beijing and has advanc ed number of fairly m oderate proposals regarding tibets future status the chinese gove rnment condemns the dalai lamas political activities and his leadership of governme ntinexile although it recognizes him as major religious figure tibet and us policy since the 1980s in the late 1980s tibet became recurring issue in congressional consideration of matters relating to china number of factors have contributed to members greater interest these include the dalai lamas and the tibetan communitys ongoing political activities reports of human rights abuses and chinas continuing repressive social and political controls in tibet and the lack of consensus among us policymakers over what us policy should be toward china on matters involving tibet as on many matters i nvolving china congressional views have often been at odds with those of the white h ouse as matter of official policy the us government recognizes tibet as part of china and has always done so although some dispute the historical c onsistency of this us position3 since normalization of relations with the prc in 1979 ccession of both republi can and democratic us administrations have favored policies of engagement with china in the process they frequently have sought to minimize areas of potential tension with beijing where chinese leaders have taken strong positions such as on the question of tibets political status httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30983crs3 4 these have included representatives charlie rose ben gilman and tom lantos and the late senator claiborne pell 5 these three cities are all still

been the most charismatic and renowned advocate for the tibetan people over the past decade he has number of supporters in the us congress4 the dalai lamas and his exiled communitys efforts to gain international support for bets cause took major step forward in 19861987 when series of meetings between tibeta n and western supporters in new york washington and london launched what has b ecome known as tibets international campaign5 the goal of this campaign was to garner western and principally us support for tibets situation and ultimately to bring this international pressure to bear on beijing to make satisfactory political concessions one result of this new strategy the us congress in 1987 began to put pressure on the white house to protect tibetan culture and accord tibet great er status in us law despite beijings strong objections two events of particular importance occurred in 1987 first on september 21 the dalai lama made his first political speech in the united states at the invitation of the congressional human rights caucus in that speech the dalai lama made fivepoint proposal for resolving the bet question that was wellreceived in the united states and had significant consequences on congressional attitudes toward tibet second congress put nonbinding m easures into place in 1987 declaring that the united states should make tibets situ ation higher policy priority and should urge china to establish constructive dialogue with the dalai lama6 this language not the first that congress had passed regarding tibet7 nevertheless marked the beginning of significant increase in congressional activity on tibets status8 from this point on congressi onal supporters sought to mention tibet separately whenever possible in gislation relating to china in 1990 in considering foreign relations authorization legislation that contained the socalled tiananmen sanctions cong ress singled out tibet for sp ecial mention in senseof congress language that

tibet specifically to include lifting of martial law in lhasa and other parts of tibe t opening tibet to foreigners including the press and international human rights organi zations release of political prisoners and conduct of negotiations between representatives of the dalai lama and the chinese government 10 established pursuant to section 536 of the foreign relations authorizations act

ovisions in the foreign rela tions authorization act of fy19941995 including provision mandating that tibet be listed separately in the state departments annual re port country reports on human rights and provision mandating the state depa rtment to issue report on the state of relations between us and those recognized by congress as the true representatives of the tibetan people the dalai lama his representatives and the tibeta n government in exile and on conditions in tibet10 congressional efforts to raise the profile of tibet over the last ten years or more have been resisted or mitigated by successi ve us administrations but generally in low profile nonconfronta tional manner as early as 1986 when congress passed legislation authorizing exportimport bank funding which listed tibet as separate country president reagan signed the legislation into law11 in his remarks however the president said i note that tibet is listed as country in section 8 the united states recognizes tibet as part of the peoples republic of china i interpret tibets inclusion as separate country to be technical oversight12 in other respects however consistent congressional pressu re has contributed to us administrations acknowledging however subtly the position of the tibetan communityinexile thus president george bush in 1991 became the first us president to meet with the dalai lama while president bill clinton met with the dalai lama several times in casual dropby meetings although these meetings were deliberately lowkey and informal th ey nevertheless offended chinese leaders as did the

efforts to create special envoy for tibet during the early years of the clinton administration congress began c onsidering measures to establish the position of us special envoy for tibet with ambassadorial rank in introducing such measure in 1994 senator claiborne pell stated he belie ved it was necessary to further focus white house atte ntion on issues involving tibet i recall how difficult it was to engage previous administrations in serious knowledgeable discussions on tibeta special envoy for tibet would ensure that this important element of united stateschina relations was continually reflected in policy discussions on senior level13 while legislation to create special envoy for tibet was never enacted provisions similar to those in the 1994 legisl ation were also introduced as sections of authorization bills in the 104th and the 105th congresses14 in each case the provision called for the special envoy to have ambassadorial rank and to actively promote negotiations between the dalai lama and the chinese government clinton administration officials opposed these pr ovisions primarily because of concerns about the creation of an am bassadorial rank position for an entity tibet that the united states recognizes as part of china ra ther than as an independent country in its own right on october 31 1997 in move seen as compromise to appeal to proponents of the special envoy positi on secretary of state made leine albright designated special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department and named gregory craig to serve in the position concurre ntly with his job as director of policy planning although the new special coordinator position did not come with ambassadorial rank its cr eation nevertheless suggested th ere would be higher level of official attention on issues involving tibet consequently the 105th congress dropped the special envoy provisi on from subsequent legislation15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30983crs6 current issues on tibet impli cations for the united states the bush administration appears to have taken somewhat higher profile on tibet than its predecessors and one less mindful of beijings views on may 17 2001 secretary of state colin powell appoi nted paula dobriansky undersecretary of state for global affairs as the next us special coordinator for tibet as undersecretary ms dobriansky is the highestranking of the three us officials who have held the coordinator position in further higher profile move secretary of state powell met personally with the dalai lama during the latters visit to washington on may 22 2001 reportedly to disc uss human nature religious values and the situation in tibet this wa s followed by personal meeting on may 23 2001 between president bush and the dalai lama but there remain longstanding difficu lties over basic issues involving tibet including tibets geographic area the num ber of tibetans living there and the number of ethnic han chinese residents there are ethnic frictions between tibetans and chinese living in close proximity with all the burdens of social discrimination and economic disparity that often accompan such frictions and the still deep rooted influence of religion in tibet as way of life cultural identity and an institutional force clashes continually with the secular traditions and bureaucratic requirements of the chinese communist government system among these entrenched tensions number of issues in particular have u s policy implications status of the dalai lamas negotiations with china although specific mission of the us special coordi nator on tibet is to promote talks between the prc and the dalai lama there has been progress on this front and negotiations are currently sche duled or being planned in the past both the prc and the dalai lama maintained that they were willing to hold discussions about tibets future the dalai lama himself whose views on the subject are more cautious and diplomatic than those of many of hi s followers generally speaks of tibetan interests within the context of rule by chin he has spoken of future tibet that is part of china but which also has cultu ral autonomy within the chinese system but the dalai lama also has insisted that there should be preconditions for any discussions he has with beijing instead th negotiators should be able to address every issue in contention the prc continue s to insist that discussions with the dalai lama should have seve ral preconditions in cluding an absolute ban on the subject of independence for tibet and th dalai lamas public acknowledgment that tibet and taiwan are both part of china some speculate that the dalai lama may have grown increasingly pessimistic about his ability to achieve solution to tibets situation he has implied that the moderate approach he has been pursuing has failed becau of chinas unwillingness to hold freeranging talks and has hint ed that time may be running out for negotiated settlement some are concerned that traditional tibeta n culture and values increasingly are being overwhelmed by the growing chinese presence in tibet they worry about some of the educated and bilin gual tibetan elite trained by the chinese communists who are now serving in g overnment positions in tibet and who therefore have more of ve sted interest in the status quo and they worry that continued delay in achieving negotiated settlement increases the possibility that frustrated tibetans may resort to violence httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30983crs7 economic development in tibet chinese government policies on economic development in tibe t appear to have helped raise the living standards of tibet generally but at high cost to tibets traditions and cultural identity these policies reportedly ve disrupted traditional living patterns and contributed to tensions between tibetans and chinese immigrants in an apparent effort to assuage tibetan resentment beijing s spent substantial sums restoring buddhist temples in tibet at large conference c onducted on tibet in 1994 chinese officials adopted plans to increase economic activity in tibet by 10 per year and continue substantial economic subsidie s to help tibets backward economy since then the prc has moved ahead with number of major economic development and infrastructure projects the dalai lama and othe r tibetans are concerned that chinese economic activity in tibet disrupts cultural identity in part by encouraging large migrations of nontibetans into the region both tec hnical personnel to work on the projects themselves and entrepreneurs seeking ne w economic opportunities some have even suggested that beijing has consciously pur sued an economic development strategy in tibet as way to solve its tibet pr oblem by ensuring that the tibetan economy is tied more tightly into that of chinas eastern provinces the tensions inherent in balancing economic development priorities and cultural preservation concerns will continue to influence how american po licymakers view chinas tibet policies world bank project loan controversy arose in 1999 over world bank loan that was approved for china on june 24 1999 one portion of the 160 million western poverty reducti on loan totaling 40 milli on would have financed construction of dam irrigation system and poverty alleviation activities in an area of qinghai province which ma ny tibetans consider pa rt of historical tibet according to the banks estimates this portion of the project also involved resettlement of appr oximately 58000 people most of whom are nontibetan into this area of qinghai critics of the loan maintained that the resettlement plans would reduce the overall share of the population th at ethnic tibetans now have in this region faced with strong criticism th bank suspended its final commitment on the qinghai portion of the loan pending completion of an investigation by an independent inspection panel that panel found that although the bank had violated some of its own rules in making the an china nevertheless should take remedial steps to address some va lid criticisms on july 7 2000 china withdrew its application for the loan and since then has used its own funds to carry out the project chinas patriotic education and other campaigns in 1991 two years after the tiananmen square crackdow n china launched patriotic education campaign in an effort to promote loyalty to the communist regime in the mid1990s the campaign became government tool in efforts to control monastic activity in tibet and discredit the dalai lama among tibetans under the guise of patriotic education teams of chinese officials visit tibetan mona steries and subject tibetan monks to education and training the campa ign requires monks to sign

western antichinese forces18 the panchen lama succession in 1995 controversy arose over the selection of the successor to the panchen lama the second most important spiritual leader among tibetans when the da lai lama fled to india in 1959 the 10th panchen lama remained behind living in china until his death in 1989 tibetans believe that when highranking spiritual leader dies his soul is then reincarnated to await rediscovery by special search co mmittees in may 1995 the dalai lama announced that after years of searching using search committees sanctioned by the chinese government gendhun choekyi nyima 6yearold boy living in tibet had been found to be the gitimate reincarnation of th deceased panchen lama beijing officials reportedly were furious that the dalai lama made his announcement unilaterally they regarded it as challenge to beijings authority to have final say in this important decisi on prc officials responded by maintaining that only they had the authority to name this spiritual leader consequently in november 1995 chinese leaders rejected the dalai lamas choice and announced they had discovered the real panchen ma 5yearold gyaltsen norbu of communist yak herder on november 29 1995 he was officially enthroned as the 11th panchen lama in cerem ony attended by tibetan m onks and senior chinese communist leaders immediately thereafter both boys and their
