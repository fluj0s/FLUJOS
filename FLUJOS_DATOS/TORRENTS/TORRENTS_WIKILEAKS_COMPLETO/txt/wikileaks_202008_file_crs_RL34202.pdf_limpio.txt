shipme nt under certain conditions limiting stateinspected products to intras tate commerce is unfair many state agencies and stateinspected plants have long argued because the 27 currently state

be equivalent to the us program can export meat and poultry products into and sell them anywhere in the united states advocates for change have contended that they should not be treated less fairly than the foreign plants which they say are not as closely scrutinized as state plants opponents have argued that state progra ms are not required to have and do not have the same level of safety oversight as the federal or even the foreign plants for example foreign meat and poultry products are subject to us import reinspection at ports of entry and agai n when most imported meat is further processed in usinspected processing pl ants opponents also have contended that neither the usda office of inspector ge neral in 2006 report nor relevant 2002 federal appeals court ruling would agree

the current federalstate cooperative inspection program with provision whereby stateinspected plants w ith 25 or fewer employees could opt into new program that subjects them to federa lly directed but stateoperated inspection thus allowing them to ship interstate the senate version re portedly was developed as compromise by those on both sides of the issue the housepassed farm bill would have

is the federal meat and poultry inspection system administered by the us department of agricultures usdas f ood safety and inspection system fsis the other is made up of 27 separate stateadministe red inspection programs federal law has prohibited stateinsp ected meat and poultry plants from shipping their products across state lines ban that many states and small plants have long sought to overturn both the house and senate vers ions of the omnibus farm bill hr 2419 included amendments to the federal meat inspection act fmia and the poultry products inspection act ppia that w ould permit interstate shipment of these products if usda pproves and certain re quirements are met however the senate approach diverged in significant ways from the house version the conference farm bill cleared in may 2008 generally opted for the senate approach viewed by many on both sides of the issue as an acceptable compromise1 proponents of ending the current ba n have long argued that limiting stateinspected products to intrastate comme rce is unfair many state agencies and stateinspected plants have argued that their programs by law already must be and are at least equal to the federal system while stateinspected plants cannot ship interstate foreign plants operating under usdaapproved foreign programs which are to be equivalent to the us progra m can export meat and poultry products into and sell them anywhere in the united states advocates for change have contended that that they should not be treated less fair ly than the foreign plants and that foreign programs are not as closely sc rutinized as state programs opponents of allowing stateinspected products in interstate commerce have argued that state programs are not require d to have and do not have the same

review fsis concluded that the state was not adequately implementing nd enforcing the meat and poultry inspection requirements did not have an effective pathogen testing program and that inspection

inspection program approximately 2100 meat and poultry blishments in 27 states are subject to stateconducted rather than federal inspection programs2 however these state programs are operated in accordance with cooperative agreements that usdas food safety and inspection service fsis has with each of the states the federal government also provides 50 of the cost of state programs the federal and state cooperation provisions of the fmia 21 u sc 661 were added by the wholesome meat act of 1967 pl 902013 congressional quarterly cq at the time of the 1967 legislation observed that the state cooperation provision was the farthestreaching porti on of the measure aimed at helping or if necessary forc ing states to strengthen their own meat inspection systems all plants providing meat for interstate and foreign commerce had been subject to federal inspection regu lations basically since passage of the meat inspection act of 1907 however plants that l imited their pr oduct sales within state were covered by what critics described as patchwork of varying often inadequate laws and regulations seven of them had inspection at all according to cq revelations in the press and during committee hearings about slaughter and packing practices at some state plants made meat inspection the most emotional consumer issue of 19674 currently the secretary of agriculture hereafter usda or

poultry program 7 as with the housepassed bill similar provisions would apply to poultry products as wellto all or certain classes of persons engaged in the state in slaughtering amenable species ie cattle sheep swine goats equines or preparing the carcasses parts thereof meat or meat food products of an animals for use as human food solely for distribution within such state 21 u sc 661a1 emphasis added by crs section 661 also requires usda to assume federal inspection of state plants whenever state decides to terminate its own program or usda determines that fmia requirements are not being met pursuant to the fmia as amended by the wholesome meat act usdafsis must receive formal request for program from the governor and review the states laws regulations and performance plan inc

review of materials like performance plans and an annual report submitted by the state fsis also conducts more compre hensive review of each state every one to five years5 proposed inspection changes section 11103 of the house version of hr 2419 would have rewritten rather than merely amended title iii of the fmia6 it would have entailed number of major departures from current authority the senate language was approved as section 11067 housesenate conferees generally adopted the senate language as section 11015 of the final b ill unlike the provisions in the house bill the conferenceadopted senate lang uage would not replace title iii federalstate cooperation in the current fmia rather it would create new title v inspections by federal and state agencies7 allowing stateinspected products in interstate commerce currently stateinspected meat cannot be sold in interstate commerce under the senate bill as endorsed by the conference committee state programs currently operating under the title iii at least equal to requirements presumably could continue so long as products were not shipped across state lines the new title v would enable many stateinspected establishments ie those already covered by title iii to be selected by usda in c ooperation with the state agency to receive the federal mark of inspecti on and ship products in inte rstate commerce although state inspectors could continue to be in these designated plants inspection in such plants essentially would be under federal supervision more specifically under the conference and senate bill the us secretary of agriculture would be required to desi gnate and directly supervise federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34202crs4 8 state cooperative inspection programs fsis directive 57202 revision 3 november 16 2004employee as the state coordinator for each appropriate state agency this new coordinators responsibilities w ould be to provide oversight and enforcement of title v and to oversee state training and insp ection activities by state personnel the coordinator would have to visit the cove red establishments to ensure they are operating consistently with the fmia submit quarterly reports on each establishments status and compliance and deselect plants or suspend their inspection if they violate any requirement the house language would have explicitly allowed the shipment in commerce of products ie carcasses carca ss parts meat and meat food products under the newly approved title iii programs another house provision would have changed title iv of the current fmia to further direct that state or local government shall not prohibit or restrict the movement or sale of meat or meat food products that have been inspected nd passed in accordance with the act for interstate commerce currently usda is authorized to approve state programs that have requirements at least equal to federal requirements according to fsis at least equal to now means that the food safety and other cons umer protection measur effected by state program address the same issues addr essed by the federal fsis program and the results of the states approach are to be at least as effective as those of the federal program the state program need not take exactly the same action as the federal program8 the proposed house language would have aut horized usda to approve and then enter into cooperative agreements w ith only those state programs that adopt including adoption by reference provisions identical to titles i ii and iv including the regulations directives notices policy memoranda nd other regulatory requirements under those titles states w ould have had to ensure that their products bear mark of state inspection as the official mark titles i ii and iv essentially are all other provisions of the fmia which cover such components as inspection requirements definitions of adulteration and misbranding and enforcement authorities among other provisions restrictions on size of stateinspected plants the conference and senate bill would limit eligible establishments to those with 25 or fewer employees also us da would be authorized to develop procedures enabling stateinspected estab lishments with more than 25 employees to shift to regular federal in spection finally under the conference senate version stateinspected plants with more than 25 employees but fewer than 35 employees could be selected for the new state program but they would have to shift to regular federal inspection within three year s of promulgation of final rule the house version would have imposed restriction limiting the size of an establishment that could be accepted under new state program to more than 50httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34202crs5 employees however it appears that larger establishments coul d have continued to participate if they became stateinspected within 90 days of enactment option to become stateinspected under the conference and senate bill current future and previously federally inspected establishments would be ineligible to join the new state program under the house bill certain establishments that currently are federally inspected could have applied for inspection under the new state program if their states had one cooperative agreement and other support provisions currently usda and the states with pr ograms enter into formal cooperative agreements that provide for among othe r things matching fe deral funds of 50 under the conference bill states would continue to be eligible for federal reimbursement but now for up to 60 of the cost of their meat and poultry inspection programs conferees deleted provision in the senate bill that would have reimbursed state for 100 of eligible costs if th state provided additional microbiological verification testing of selected establishments the conference and senate bill also would create new technical assistance division at fsis to coordinate training education technical ssistance and outreach for very small and certain smallersized establishments earlier legislative proposals new markets for stateinspected meat and poultry act of 2007 hr 2315s 1150 the state inspection provisions

meat and poultry that is not federally inspected coul d be shipped across state lin these and other pending changes raised series of issues that were debated by proponents and opponents of the legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34202crs6 9 fsis manual for state meat and p oultry inspection program reviews august 2007 at httpwwwfsisusdagovpdfstate_programs_review_manual_2007pdf 10 september 11 2007 telephone di scussion with nasda staffwhat is identical at issue have been the impacts if any of these changes on the safety of meat and poultry products concerns about any adverse effects stem largely from the supposition long held by consumer advocates and other critics that state inspection programs do not provide the sa level of safety as the federal inspection programs as noted state measures now must be at least equal to the federal measures notably including mandatory mortem and post mortem inspection reinspection and sanitation requirements the current fsis state review manual pr ovides more specifics on how this is to be achieved for example under fsis rules promulgated in 1996 each federally inspected establishment must have haccp for hazard analysis and critical control point plan that identifies each point in its process where contamination could occur have remedy to control it implement the plan monitor the process and keep detailed records as part of the plans ll operations must have sitespecific standard operating procedures sops for san itation usda inspectors check the establishments records to verify plants compliance accordingly the fsis state review manual directs that state mpi program officials also must verify haccp or equivalent system that evaluates hazards takes steps to address hazards and routinely verifies that product is safe wholesome unadulterated and properly labeled9 fsis must approve and regularly review the states to ensure that they are following these types of procedures the house farm bill language would have gone even further by requiring that they be identical and making it clear that this applies to all regulations directives notices policy memoranda nd other regulatory requi rements moreover condition of acceptance into the new state program would have been that the state implement within 180 days of usda review of its system all changes identified in the review to ensure enforcement of federal requirements possible indication of its more prescriptive nature was that the national association of state departments of agriculture nasda which promoted interstate shipment legislation for many years had once ggested that it might not support proposal with requirement that stat adopt identical rules10 nonetheless supporters of the house bill had argued that it would re place the current collection of 27 separate state programs with single type of state program operating seamlessly with the federal system on the other hand opponents of the hous bill countered that it was unclear whether or not the identical language would also apply to all activities associated with inspection some of wh ich might fall outside of th regulations directives notices policy memoranda and other regulatory requirement s would or could the language apply for example to states certifying procedures and contractual relationships with testing boratories what about sta ffing and training practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34202crs7 11 audit report food safety and inspection serv ice state meat and poultry inspection programs usdaoiga240051at september 2006 the oig report also raised questions about fsiss criteria and documentati on for determining the equal to status of other aspects of state programs which is discussed elsewhere in this report 12 fred l dailey director ohio departme nt of agriculture and president national association of state departme nts of agriculture april 6 2000 testimony before the senate agriculture committee opponents of the house farm bill language had argued that at minimum these types of questions should be answered be fore new program was passed that might continue some at least equal to activities that in their view have been substandard they cited september 2006 report by us das office of inspector general oig that examined fsiss oversight of the stat programs though fsis routinely gathers state staffing data it does not use the data to determine if state staffing levels are appropriate for carrying out inspection activities so some state programs may not have enough personnel to ensure their prog rams are at least equal to the federal program oig concluded fsis state re views did not include determinations of whether laboratories used by the state to test products were providing accurate reliable results oig also c oncluded adding that fsis officials told the oig investigators that these were outsi the scope of the fmia and ppia11 one area where state and federal programs may diverge is in their sampling and testing methodologies used to verify that haccp plans are pr oducing safe products inspection officials have argued that regardless of which particular testing system is used it has to be scientifically and legally defensible critics have asserted that different methodologies can l ead to different safety fi ndings and therefore potentially different levels of safety another area where present state program may differ from the federal system is in staffing and training some states for example avail themselves of at least some usda traini ng others may prefer their own programs but all must meet basic outcomes by requiring federal employee to oversee each new state program and by creating ne w fsis training division drafters of the senate bill adopted by conf erees aimed to address cerns about these aspects of statelevel inspection are state inspectors more lenient than federal inspectors the senate agriculture committee held hearing in april 2000 on proposal s 1988 by senator daschl to permit stateinspected products in interstate commerce if the programs adopted all fe deral inspection requirements at that hearing the director of the ohio department of agriculture argued that state personnel are generally more accessible nd flexible in providing inspection resources geared to the needs and time constraints of small plants and that states offer practical information technical assistance and ot her support to smaller plants that lack the scientific and legal expertise needed to deal with government regulations furthermore the ohio director characterized the federal system as multilayered chain of command with frequently adversarial attitude12 several meat processing companies also testified that communicating with state officials to solve problems was far easier th an with federal officialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34202crs8 13 kara slaughter and others potential impacts of state at and poultry inspection for the state of nebraska

fellow and director food policy institute consumer federation of america re cent releases and statements by foreman and others argue that it is untrue that very sma ll plants cannot operate under federal inspection citing as evidence the nearly 3000 generally those with less than 10 employees that do according to usda data 15 it should be noted that the consumer fe deration of america cfa and other consumer groups had extended their support for this earlier proposal s 1 988 to permit interstate shipment their support was made contingent on retention of the introduced bills language requiring not only that states dopt identical standards but so that stateinspected plants be subject to pathogen reduction program as then being implemented in federally inspected plants for background on pathogen sting and issues see crs report rl32922 meat and poultry inspection background and selected issues by geoffrey s beckerpressed for more specifics on barriers to joining federal inspection the ohio director cited three reasons first usdas plant design and engineering requirements include elements that he said do not relate to food safety but would be expensive to meet changing 3inch drains to 4inch drains for example second plants would rather communicate with the state than federal bureaucracy as noted above third is overtime co sts which plants pay for inspection beyond regularly scheduled shifts the federa l government charges considerably more than states in 2001 report the university of nebras ka examined for the state legislature the potential impacts of adopting state inspection program there it polled other states to determine why some adopt such programs and others do not among those that chose to maintain state inspection the most frequently cited factor was the desire for greater responsiveness to the unique needs of producers and processors13 consumer advocates interpret the communication and flexibility arguments to mean that companies can more easily influe nce states to adopt less stringent safety requirements or to enforce them less ri gorously one consumer advocate who testified at the 2000 senate hearing argued that the state equal to provision was adopted as compromise the 1967 whol esome meat act was driven by the revelation of filthy cond itions and the lack of standards in stateinspected meat plants and the need to improve physical facilities and sanitation practices however it became clear that some of the smallest plants could not meet the physical facility requirements of the proposed law there was discussion in 1967 of the potential public health risk inherent in this acti on but the prohibition on sale across state lines recognized that these products were likely not to be the same as those produced in federally inspected plants14 such advocates continue to assert that state standards are not as strong as federal standards regardless of the equal to determination15 does usda provide adequate oversight of

app lexis 24623 december 3 2002necessarily as safe as federally inspect ed products the oig report concluded for example that although fsis had manua l with detailed pro cedures and checklists for conducting onsite state reviews how the agency arrived at its decisions regarding the acceptability of state mpi m eat and poultry inspection programs are not clearly documented in fsis summary re ports in other words while the manual establishes clear guidelines for identifying problems in state mpi programs how those problems are weighed in the dete rmination and documented in the summary report on state program was less clear this condition was caused by the agencys decision to eliminate specific decisionmaking criteria from its comprehensive review methodology16 oig noted elsewhere in its findings when the agency revised its directives for inspecting these programs an agency official said fsis eliminated specific criteria for weighing violati ons and rendering decisions in order to avoid being overly prescriptive and to allow reviewers to use their discretion offi cials reviewing these programs thus lack clear objective and uni form guidelines for weighing the effect of establishment deficiencies on state mpi program findings and for documenting the relationship between these violations and the final determinati ons oig said for example that fsis had granted at least equa l to status to several states even though they found haccp and sanitation deficiencies in establishments in those states and the deficiencies were similar to those from review of another state program where significant concerns were cited17 in dailey v veneman federal appeals court in 2002 upheld district courts decision to reject ohios legal bid to gain interstate acceptance of its stateinspected products among other arguments ohio d asserted that the lower court should have accepted as true the allegation that stateinspected products were as safe as federally and foreigninspected meat and poultry and the current federal law lacks rational basis for treating stateinspected meats and poultry differently the appeals court responded in part though the usda does keep an eye on state inspection programs it keeps yet closer eye on its own plants and on meat and poultry entering the country and it is possible that state program could deteriorate for time without the usdas knowledge this policy provides rational basis for congress to restrict the interstate transport of stateinspected meat18 crs informal discussions in 2007 with various state and federal inspection experts suggest that many state inspecti on procedures look remarkably similar and often may be identical to those in federal establishments including all key mortem and postmortem

subscription requiredgovernment veterinarian examines all live animals before they are slaughtered just as in the federal system trained state inspectors observe slaughter and processing operations and look for virtually the same problems that federal inspectors are looking for according to these experts where the inspection process may diverge appears primarily to be in how the insp ector communicates with the establishment to correct deficiencies t hose knowledgeable with the programs explain federal officials for example might simply point out deficiency and possibly inform the establishment where it might look for info rmation or assistance to correct the situation state officials are more likely to work directly with the plant providing technical assistance and other resources to remedy the problem these inspection experts explained19 longstanding argument that federal rules require plants to undertake costly plant and equipment changes may be less relevant today since all plants including small and very small ones now are exp ected to be operating under haccp plans according to those knowledgeable about fede ralstate inspection recordkeeping by establishments and verification by inspecti on personnel are used to ensure that the system is working since january 2000 all slaughter and processing operations including small and very small establishm ents are required to have haccp plans in place under the federal inspection progra m and all state programs also have incorporated haccp or equivalent plans these experts state haccp by nature is less

meat inspection program or for fe deral inspection s uch an establishment cannot apply more than once every four years there was concern that under the house bill larger plants could have evaded the size restriction by coming under state in spection if they did it within the initial 90 days of enactment there was some certainty as to whether this 90day window in the house bill would have applied to larger plants that want to enter existing state programs or whether this w ould have applied to the newl authorized state program although it would appear that the existin g programs would longer have been authorized under the proposal assuming that the house legislation implied the latter situation then further uncertainty arose re garding whether stat could apply for and achieve recognition within such short time period the conferenceadopted sena language by adding new title v supplements rather than replaces the existing state programs consumer advocates nd employee unions had found the second house provision to permit fede ral plants to convert to state inspection to be one of the more controversial provisions they cited statistics provi ded by usda that there are 5603 federally inspected meat and poultry plan ts of these approximately 80 or more than 4500 have fewer than 50 empl oyees creating the potential for an exodus from the national program with that change if federal inspector pressures meat packer to improve sanitation the packer could instead try to negotiate more understanding regulatory response from hi s state inspection program these groups recently argued this would have threaten ed not only food safety but also the jobs of thousands of federal in spection employees they cla imed the provisions would also unleash lobbying campaigns to set up state inspection programs in the 22 now 23 states that currently do not have them so plants in those states can also seek more understanding enforcement of f ood safety laws under state programs22 the senate compromise language adopted by c onferees clarifies that current future or prior federal establishments would not be eligible for the new state inspection program how might foreign trade be

specifically the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures the sps agreement article 41 of the sps agreement states members shall accept the sanitary or phytosanitary measures of other members as equivalent even if these measures differ from their own or from those used by other members trading in the same product if the exporting member objectively demonstrates to the importing member that its measures achieve the importing members appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection for this purpose reasonable access shall be given upon request to the importing member for inspection testing and other relevant procedures according to fsis the burden for dem onstrating equivalence rests with an exporting country the agencys initial eval uation to determine foreign equivalence is quite extensive and detailed24 as practical matter it would appear to be difficult for foreign country to demonstrate ccessfully that any system that is not nationally administered ie state local should be recognized as equivalent apparently none are so recognized currently in fact countries that ship meat and poultry to the united states are more likely to have dual safety regimes one for the plants that sell domestically and another certified by the united states and possibly other countries as equivalent for export if the conference bill permits products inspected by states into commerce and if such commerce included foreign as well as interstate shipments it might be reasonable to assume that other countries with their own state systems could seek new equivalency dete rminations which encompass such systems as described earlier the new farm bill would explicitly allow the shipment in commerce of products ie carcasses carca ss parts meat and meat food products under the newly approved prog rams some have argued that the new language should be interpreted to c over only commerce between not outside the states and territories however title i of the current fmia defines commerce as commerce between any state any territory or the district of columbia and any place outside thereof or within any territory not organi zed with legislative body or the district of columbia related usda questions have included whethe r individual states might be negotiating with foreign trading partners about import policies and conducting their own audits of foreign tablishments whether trading partners would audit all state programs whether some states could export products to particular country while othe rs could not and whether the united states would and could segregate products intended fo r export based upon state of originhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34202crs13 25 the source of this estimate is the us depa rtment of health and human

preliminary foodnet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food 10 states 2006 morbidity and mortality weekly report april 13 2007 and april 11 2008do foodborne illness data or pathogen testing provide any clues to the relative safety of stateinspected products food safety advocates and others freque ntly cite the incidences of foodborne pathogens and of foodborne illnesses as r easons to be concer ned about food safety programs frequently cite d estimate used by federa l officials and food safety advocacy groups alike is that each ear 76 million people become sick 325000 are hospitalized and 5000 die fro m foodborne illnesses caused by contamination from any one of number of microbial pathogens25 it also should be noted that these estima tes reflect illnesses re lated to all types of foods not solely to meat and poultry products the cdc does observe raw foods of animal origin are the most likely to be contaminated that is raw meat and poultry raw eggs unpasteurize d milk and raw shellfish because filterfeeding shellfish strain microbes from the sea over many months they are particularly likely to be contaminated if there are any pathogens in the seawater foods that mingle the pr oducts of many individual animals such as bulk raw milk pooled raw eggs or ground beef are particularly hazardous because pathogen present in any one of the animals may contaminate the whole batch single hamburger may contain meat from hundreds of animals single restaurant omelet may contain eggs fro m hundreds of chickens glass of raw milk may contain milk from hundreds of cows broiler chicken carcass can be exposed to the drippings and juices of many thousands of other birds that went through the same cold water tank after slaughter26 in april 2007 and ap ril 2008 re ports the cdc compared the incidence of various foodborne infections in 2006 with baseline data from 19961998 the reports observed that significant declines in the incidence of certain foodborne pathogens have occurred since 1996 but ge nerally the declines were before 200427 the april 2007 cdc report had observed that an earlier decline in shiga toxin producing coli o157 stec o157 infections wa s temporally associated with measures by fsis and by beef processo rs to reduce ground beef contamination measures which were accompanied by decline in the frequency of isolation of stec o157 from ground beef in 2003 and 2004 further although the frequency of finding the pathogen in products in 2005 and 2006 was the sa level as in 2004 reasons for the increases in human s tec o157 infections in 2005 and 2006 are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34202crs14 28 information about pathogen reduction and testing results can be found at httpwwwfsisusdagovsciencehazard_analysis__pathogen_reductionindexaspknown while not attributing this to either meat and poultry or to produce the cdc did take note of stec o157 outbreaks in 2006 caused by contaminated lettuce and spinach the cdc report explained that transmission of salmonella to humans can occur via many vehicles including produce ggs poultry and other meat and direct contact with animals and their environments it also noted an occurrence through tomatoes in 2006 however the report not ed that poultry is an important source of human salmonella infections it also discussed the fsis initiative to reduce salmonella in poultry and other meat and that in 2006 the lowest percentages of chickens tested positive for the pathogen the fsis pathogen testing cited by the cdc is one of the ways the agency monitors the effectiveness of establishments haccp plans28 consumer advocates industry officials and othe rs closely follow both fsis testing results and the cdc disease reports and often specu late about their significance nonetheless neither fsis testing results nor this cdc report appear to offer any conclusive evidence of causal relationshi p between fsis program modifications on the one hand and changes in the occurre nce of foodborne illnesses on the other even if the difficulties in making such an attribution could be overcome it would not likely answer the further question regarding the distinctions if any between federally inspected and stateinspected products as the cause of foodborne illnesses among other potential variables state testing programs can differ from the federal programs making comparisons between testing results difficult at best conclusion as noted the new farm bill would amend the fmia and ppia in order to modify key element of fede ral food safety policy that has been in place for 40 years at the heart of the debate has been emingly simple question do or can state programs provide the same assu rance of product safety as th federal program if the bill becomes law stakeholders will turn their attention to usda which will be required to implement the new provisions this rulemaking process can be expected to fill in many of the deta ils on program operation and u ltimately to he lp determine its effectiveness
