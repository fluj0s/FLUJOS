health an d violence against women some religious believers consider abortion violation of the right to life international law is silent on the question of when life begins and amnesty international takes position on this question the organization recognizes and respects the diversity of religious viewpoints on abortion and believes that one of its greatest strengths has been the solidarity forged among people of diverse beliefs who nonetheless share commitment to ending human suffering in th is spirit the organizations leadership believes that its members and supporters can continue to collaborate on specific human rights issues without having to change or challenge their moral standpoint or views on issues such as abortion it is in this spirit that amnesty international calls on its members and supporters to work with the organization to end violence agai nst women which often lies at the root of ma ny unwanted pregnancies
