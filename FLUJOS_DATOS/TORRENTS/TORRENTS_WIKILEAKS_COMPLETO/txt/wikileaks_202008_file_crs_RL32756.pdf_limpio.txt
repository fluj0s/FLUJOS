the features of ias that would make them attractive to workers pension analysts generally agree th at designing individual accounts would require tradeoffs between individual choi ce and efficient management relatively highcost approach would create system of ias in which contributions to the accounts are deposited quickly participants have substantial control over their accounts and have many inves tment choices but in whic h employers must take on substantial new administrative duties low cost option would deposit contributions several months after they have been deducted from employees pay give participants less control over their acc ounts and provide few investment choices but would minimize the administrative tasks required of employers the lowcost approach to implementing social secur ity individual accounts would avoid imposing significant new expenses on small businesse s but the result would be system that would have few of the investment f eatures common to modern 401k plans the ability of an employer to absorb new administrative costs associated with social security individual accounts would pend in part on its size and whether it already sponsors retirement plan for its employees large employers would be able to spread the fixed costs of administeri ng the accounts over more workers thereby reducing average costs employers that already offer their employees retirement plan have an administrative infrastructure in place to perform any new tasks that might be required to maintain system of individual accounts most employers in the united states are small employers with fewer than 20 employees and most small employers do not sponsor retirement plan for their workers employers could seek to offset cost increases that arise from administering individual accounts by reducing or restructur ing the benefits they currently offer to their employees for example employers who must absorb new costs to help administer ias might reduce contributions to their 401k plans or otherwise reduce their existing pension benefits social security ias also could affect employees contributions to 401k plans with more of their future retirement income dependent on investment returns some workers might invest their 401k contributions more conservativ ely alternatively exposure to greater investment risk could encourage some employees to increas their contributions to 401k plans in an attempt to offset some of this risk as they gain experience with the accounts some workers might develop taste for sa ving that would persuade them to save more

and creating personal wealth for all americans december 2001 p 11 2 presidents commission p 47social security individual accounts and employersponsored pensions introduction the presidents commission in december 2001 the presidents commissi on to strengthen social security issued its final report the report concluded that social security will be strengthened if modernized to include system of voluntary personal accounts1 the commission acknowledged that estab lishing and maintaining system of individual accounts ias coul d impose new costs on employers particularly small employers they urged that in designing and implementing system of ias policymakers should attempt to minimize the cost to employers while maintaining the features of ias that would make them attractive to workers because small employers would have more difficulty absorb ing new costs than large employers the commission cautioned that personal acc ount administration should not add any burden to small employers2 this crs report describe s employers in the united states in terms of their size sponsor ship of employee benefits and other characteristics that might influence the extent to which implementing and administering ias could add to employers operating costs it discusses the features of ias that are most likely to affect th eir administrative costs and how the policies and procedures that might minimize those costs could also affect the extent to which participants would be able to exerci control over their individual accounts over the past several years numbe r of retirement policy analysts have considered the technical and administrative issues that would need to be addressed if individual accounts were to be added to the social security program there has been general agreement among policy analysts that either of two approaches could be taken in designing and implementing system of social security ias one approach would create system of ias in which contributions to the accounts are deposited quickly participants have substantial contro l over their accounts and have many investment choices but in which employers must take on substantial new administrative duties to assure that these goals are achieved for employers this would be relatively high cost opti on low cost system would deposit contributions to the accounts several mont hs after they have been deducted from employees pay give participants re latively little control over their accounts and provide few investment choices but would minimize the administrative tasks required of employershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32756crs2 3 schreitmueller p 11 4 burke and mccouch p 1328 5 ebri 2001 p 4 6 ebri march 1999 p 2 7 ebri april 1999 p 3 8 gao 00187 p 30one pension analyst has described the sign and implementa tion of individual accounts as requiring inevitable tradeo ffs between free choice and efficient management3 while another has observed that the central issues in designing personal accounts i nvolve tradeoffs between relativel standardized lowcost options with constrained individual choice and limited risk on the one hand and more flexible highercost options with enhanced opport unities for individual control and greater risk on the other4 one implication of the tradeoff between individual choice and administrative efficiency is that while it would be possible to design system of individual accounts that would keep admin istrative costs low and avoid imposing significant new expenses on small businesses that system would likely bear little or resemblance to modern 401k plan5 for ia participants keeping the system as simple and inexpensive as possible would mean limiting the choices that make ias attractive in the first place6 overview of employersponsored retirement plans two characteristics of employers that would affect their ability to absorb administrative costs associated with social security individual accounts are their size and whether they already sponsor retir ement plan for their employees large employers can spread the fixed costs of administering accounts over more workers thereby reducing average costs employers that offer their employees retirement plan already have an administrative infrastructure in place to perform new tasks that might be required to maintain system of individual accounts for these reasons it is important to note that 1 most employers in the united states are small employers with fewer than 20 employees and 2 most small employers do not sponsor retirement plan for their workers and therefore do not have an existing administrative infrastructure to handle any new administrative tasks associated with individual accounts because of the limited resources they have available to deal with new administrative tasks small businesses may be particularly affected by reforms that add individual accounts to social security7 the government accountab ility office gao has observed that while large employ ers appear to be be tter able to handle the costs and administrative demands of an individual account system smaller employers may face greater difficulties ch as reduced profitability that could reduce their willingness to provide pensions8 although more than half of all worker s in the united states are employed at firms with 100 or more employees most empl oyers in the us are small firms for example of the 57 million privatesector firms in the united states in 2000 34 million 60 had fewer than five empl oyees and 50 million 88 had fewer then 20 employees see table 1 most small employers do not offer retirement planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32756crs3 9 the minimum universal pension system mups proposed by the carter administration in 1980 would have allowed employers to restrict participation to workers between the ages of 25 and 65 with more 1000 hours of service per yearto their employees accordin g to the census bureaus current population survey cps of the 669 million people who work ed at firms with fewer than 100 employees in 2003 just 197 million 295 worked for an employer that offered retirement plan to its employees in othe r words seven out of ten workers at small firms worked for employers who did not ffer either pension or 401ktype plan to their employees in 2003 employers woul d not be able avoid incurring any new administrative costs associated with ias by declining to participate in the system because even if the accounts are voluntary for employees they would be mandatory for employers all employers would have to accommodate the wishes of employees who wanted to establish soci security individual accounts new administrative costs would not necessarily be limited to employers that do not now offer their employees retiremen t plan some employees who work for employers that sponsor retirement plans are ineligible to participate in those plans the employee retirement income secur ity act erisa pl 93406 allows employers to exclude from their retiremen t plans workers who are under 21 years old who work fewer than 1000 hours per year or who have worked for the employer for less than one year these exclusions reduce employers administrative costs and thus encourage employers to sponsor plans9 employers who already offer retirement plans to their employees could face higher administrative expenses if as the presidents commission recommended all wo rkers who now participate in social security would be eligible to estab lish social security individual account table 1 firms and establishments by employment

individual accounts relative to the acc ount balances would depend in part on the characteristics of the employees who participate in the system of ias relative to account balances admin istrative costs will tend to be lower for employees who remain with an employer for longer periods of time who work full time and who have higher nnual earnings these characteristics are more common among employees of large firms than those of small firms the data displayed in table 2 show that workers whose employers currently offer retirement plans differ in several respects from workers whose em ployers do not offer such plans in general workers whose employers do not offer retirement plans are younger and therefore change jobs more frequently work fewer hours earn lower wages and work for smaller firms than workers whos employers offer retirement plans for many such workers annual contributions to an ia would be small and administrative expenses would be large relative to th eir account balances among the 152 million workers in the united states in 2003 236 million were under 25 years of age and 158 million 67 of those under age 25 worked for em ployers who did not offer

2001 p 9administrative tasks and individual accounts social security ias could increase employers operating costs both directly and indirectly10 employers costs would be affected directly to the extent that they would be required to help administer the accounts some admin istrative tasks may be performed by the social security ad ministration ssa or another governmental agency and some may be performed by private sector financial institutions such as mutual fund providers but responsibility fo r other administrativ tasks could fall to employers whether these costs would be borne fully by the account owners or would be shared among the account owners employers financial service providers and the government would depend on the speci fic features of the ias and the manner in which the accounts are set up administered and regulated for employers administrative tasks ssociated with individual accounts could include informing each employee of the option to participate in voluntary ia enrolling interested employees in the system establishing and maintaining record for each account sending individual account contributi ons to the central administrator or other entity correcting errors in the amounts c ontributed or the fund in which contributions were invested and tracking employees marital status so that account balances can bedivided in the event of divorce 11 centralized vs decentralized administration costs to employers of administering ias would depend in part on whether the administrative and record keeping functions would be centralized or decentralized centralized system could build on the existing tax collection and recordkeeping systems of the ssa and the irs centralized system that allowed employers to continue using their current procedures for reconciling tax payments would be more likely to maintain the current level of employer costs and administra tive responsibilities but it would result in significant delays in crediting contributi ons to participants accounts because many small employers continue to file wage reports on paper once year decentralized system would require employers to r econcile tax collecti ons and individual contributions more frequently to transmit contributions to greater number of public and private entities and might require all employers to submit both contributions and financial reports electronically decentra lized system would provide higher level of service to participants but would increase costs for many employers higher costs for ias might inadvertently cause some employers to reduce or eliminate the retirement benefits they offer to their employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32756crs7 12 schreitmueller p 12 13 ssa 2001 p 5 14 american academy of actuaries 2003 p 2 15 personal communication with ssa office of legislation congressional affairs january 5 2005promptness and accuracy of recordkeeping the current social security program is defined benefit plan in which workers retirement benefit is based on record of his or her past earni ngs although all workers who are covered under social security about 96 of the wo rkforce pay social security taxes an individuals benefit bears direct relationship to his or her total contributions12 an individuals social s ecurity benefit is based solely on the benefit formula written into law by congress regardless of the am ount of social security taxes previously paid by each covered worker in this syst em small errors in employers reports of employee earnings or delays in recording those earnings on each workers social security record rarely affect the amount of the workers re tirement benefit in fact under the current system even in instances in which an employer fails to report earnings workers who can provide evidence of those earnings have them credited to their record13 in contrast in defined contribution plan such as social security ias the workers benefit consists of the balance in the account at the time the worker retires the account balance is the sum of all past cont ributions interest dividends and capital gains minus any pr eretirement withdrawals and investment losses defined contribution plans requi re accurate and timely record keeping14 so that contributions can be invested promptly and begin to earn interest dividends and capital gains remitting income and payroll taxes employers are responsible for sending both social security payroll taxe s and federal income taxes withheld from employees pay to the federal government the majority of employers today send payroll taxes and federal income taxes in lumpsum payments to federal reserve banks or other authorized institutions at least once each calenda r quarter employers must submit report irs form 941 that summarizes their tota l tax deposits this report indicates only the aggregate amount of taxes withheld from workers pay it does not indicate the amount of taxes paid by each worker nor even how much of the total represents payroll tax and how much is income tax reconciliation of gross tax payments with individuals earnings is done just once each year on the form w2 small employers are permitted to file reports on paper and most still do so in 2003 although 60 of workers w2 forms were submitted to the social security administration electronically or on magnetic tape or cartridge 72 of employer reports to ssa form w3 were submitted on paper mostly by small employers according to ssa the reason for this is the vast amount of small and mediumsized businesses under 250 employees that send ssa paper wage reports15 frequency of remitting taxes and contributions the frequency with which contributions must be transmitted to the ia central administrator or other entity would directly affect the cost of administering ias the 2001 report of the presidents commission on strengthening social security stated that personal account owners are entitled to have their c ontributions credited to their personalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32756crs8 16 presidents commission p 44 17 presidents commission p 45 18 ebri has said that making use of the cu rrent payroll system would be the most cost effective way to implement an ia system w ithout adding administrative costs and burdens to employers related to enrollment and contributions ebri 2001 p 17 the gao has noted that building on the current system and keeping records centrally could achieve economies of scale and minimize additiona l burdens and costs for employers and individuals gao 99122 p18 likewise th american academy of actuaries has stated that ia proposals could reduce admini strative costs by taking advantage of the current infrastructure for tax collection american academy of actuaries 1998 p3 19 ssa 2001 p 6 ssa also estimates that if ssa had additional resources processing the majority of reported w2 earnings to earnings records could theoretically be performed within two to 13 months of the date payro ll taxes were withheld from given paycheck ssa 2001 p 18 footnote 20 presidents commission p 47 21 ssa 2001 p 17accounts in timely and accurate fash ion but without imposing additional compliance costs on employers16 the commission recognized that imposing new requirements on employers could also impos new costs stating that to prevent compliance costs from increasing employers must be allowed to continue to submit contributions through the existing pa yroll tax system which requires some centralization17 the two goals of depositing contributions quickly while imposing new costs on employers could be difficult to reconcile in practice using the existing payroll tax system is widely regarded as the lowestcost option for transmitting contributions to ias but it would do so only with considerable delay between the time the money would be withheld from the workers pay and the date on which it would be deposited to the investment account of his or her choice18 the social security administration has estimated that in lowcost system of ias contributions would be credited to specific individuals ias within seven to 22 months after being deducted from workers earnings19 the presidents commission acknowledged that using the current payroll contributi on system it would take about 15 months on average before payroll contributions are credited to personal accounts20 because it would be costly for small employers to transmit contributions more quickly the commission recommended that ia funds shoul d be invested in interestbearing government bonds during the period between the date that the contributions are deducted from employees pay and the time at which they are allocated to each individuals account both the frequency and method of repor ting information would be important factors in determining the administrative costs associated with individual accounts21 the delay between withholding social security taxes and posting earnings to workers social security records occurs in part because the reporting system in place today is designed to keep the demands on employers time and resources to minimum faster processing of contributions would require accelerating the frequency of the wagereporting proce ss and in that case employershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32756crs9 22 ssa 2001 p 6 23 ssa 2001 p 19 24 ssa 2001 p 19 25 cbo 2004 p 10 according to the social security administration although requiring all employers to submit electronically may appear to be an optimistic assumption it is consistent with actions currently under way at the internal revenue service to increase the frequency of electronic re porting ssa 2001 p 20 fn 26 ssa 2001 p 22 27 if the taxes submitted are less than the amount owed the irs may take action to collect the amount due even if the discrepancy is ss than the equivalent of one wage credit 28 ssa 2001 p18responsibilities for sending and reporting payroll cont ributions would grow in number and frequency22 employers might for example be required to report w2 information along with the quarterly wage and tax statements they submit to the irs on form 941 this was the case prior to 1978 when congress ended the requirement for quarterly reporting of w2 information to ssa inevitably however employers would incur additional administrative costs from having to report more frequently23 according to ssa the burden of more frequent periods of reporting would fall disproportionately on the sel femployed small employers over 80 of the employer universe and employers w ho prepare records manually24 the process of crediting earnings to employee records or allocatin g contributions into individual accounts also could be accelerated by requiring all employers to submit wage reports electronically the use of ectronic filing has increased s ubstantially in recent years however the congressional budget offi ce cbo expects th at many small employers are likely to continue to file on paper in the foreseeable future25 employer costs of submitting taxes nd reporting earnings could increase under system of ias even if the frequency of reporting were not increased because under defined contribution retirement system such as individual accounts employer reports would need to be held to high standard of accuracy26 currently if the difference between wages reported and the payroll taxes submitted is less than one social security wage credit 920 in 2005 ssa takes further action because errors of less than one wage credit rarely affect an individuals retirement benefit27 discrepancies much smaller than this amount probably would not be tolerated by participants in system of social secur ity ias consequently the number of errors that ssa and employers need to re solve would increase substantially although maintaining the current syst em of submitting taxes and earnings reports would minimize costs to employers time lag of seven to 22 months would elapse between the date when ia cont ributions would be deducted from pay and when these contributions would be allocat ed to individual workers accounts this lag referred to as float period could re duce workers future benefits by reducing the amount of time that contributions have to accrue investment earnings based on workers individual fund choices28 long delays in crediting deposits to individual accounts are

made however if this we re required of social security individual accounts it would dramatically increase ad ministrative expenses for the millions of employers that do not offer fined contribution plans nd therefore do not have the administrative infrastructure already in place to assist in the administration of ias29 investment losses during the float pe riod could be reduced by investing contributions on pooled basis with inves tment earnings allocated at the same time as contributions are posted30 the presidents commission proposed that the aggregate pool of contributions be invest ed in government bonds until information on contributions by individuals is reconc iled with aggregate employer payments31 reconciling errors in order to protect workers from errors made by their employers in reporting earnings or submitting payroll taxes the social security administration posts earnings credits to participants records even if the employer has failed to send the attenda nt taxes provided that th individual can provide proof of earnings unless workers are held rmless in this way under an ia system some of them could lose substantial contributions and investment earnings because of employers errors or noncompliance however being held harmless in cash based system like ias require s someone else such as th government to contribute money to replace these lost funds32 in the event of an employers bankruptcy lost contributions may never be recovered in those cases th government may be the only possible source of funds to make the workers accounts whole errors in wage reporting to ssa are not uncommon nd some cannot be resolved the congressional budget ffice reports that about 9 million of the approximately 250 million earnings records th at the ssa processes each year cannot be reconciled with the master file33 ssa notes that in system of ias unresolved discrepancies could lead to appeals that would mean additional expenses for ssa and employers34 the high rate of turnover among small businesses also would present challenge to administering system of individual accounts for social security about 650000 employers more than 10 of the total start up or go out of business each year possibly creating difficultie s in ensuring that contributions are collected and applied to individual accounts after an employer goes out of business recovering lost or misplaced funds would be difficult35 distributing funds from accounts employers might have to consider changes to their pension plans to coor dinate them with the rules for

72t of the internal revenue code allows penaltyfree distributions from individual retirement accounts iras and 401k plans before age 59½ in certain instances such as to purchase primary residence or to meet qualifying educational expenses or if take n in series of payments based on life expectancy the presidents commission recommended that such preretirement distributions should be permitted from ias36 to minimize confusion among participants and to ease administrative burdens on employers congress would need to consider how the rules for taking dist ributions from social security individual accounts would interact with those that now apply to social security and to distributions from 401k plans and iras educating the public participants in system of individual accounts would need to be educated about the rules for pa rticipating in the plan the available means of taking money out of their account at retirement and such essential financial concepts as investment diversification market risk and the effects of compound interest on account balances over long peri ods of time investor education would be particularly important for people who are unfamiliar with making investment choices especially lowincome workers those w ith less formal education and those for whom english is second language37 it is likely that primary responsibility for this ongoing educational effort would fall to the federal government because employers would be very unlikely to accept the burden of educating employees about the social security decision38 other issues social security ias and pension integration when designing their pension plans employers so metimes take into account the social security taxes they pay andor the benefits that social security provides pension plans that explicitly incorporate social security benefits or contributions into their plan design are called integrated plans39 adding individual accounts to so cial security could cause some employers to change the type of pension inte gration they use or the type of retirement plan they offer in defined benefit plan s integration is usually related to the benefit paid to participants while in defined contribution plans it most often relates to the contributions made by employers40 in an integrated defined benefit plan the amount of the workers monthly pension is reduced or offset by percentage of

offset method and the permissible disparity in contributions between lower and hi gherincome employees under the excess method of integration adding individual accounts to social security could induce some defined benefit plan sponsors that integrate through the offset method to abandon pension integration because this met hod requires that th ey estimate the participants social security benefit to calculate the appropriate pension offset with ias estimating the benefit to determine the appropriate offset would be difficult some employers might abandon defined benefit plans integrated through the offset method in favor of defined contribution plans integrated thr ough the excess method in an integrated defined contribution plan the employer n eeds only to satisfy irs regulations on the permitted disparity between contributions for workers whose earnings are less than the integration level typi cally the annual social security taxable maximum and those whose earnings are bove the integration level reductions in traditional social security benefits could increase pension costs for employers that sponsor integrated defined benefit pension plans because reducing social security benefits would result in smaller pension offs et and thus bigger pension payment in response employer s could redesign their plans to eliminate that feature absorb the costs or take other actions41 because the integration rules for defined contribution plans are tied solely to employer contributions to social security they would not be affected by changes in promised benefits under the traditional social security program if however social security payroll taxes were increased or if the cap on taxable earnings were raised employers who integrate their defined contribution plans through the excess method might adjust upward the integration level of plans thus reducing the number of c overed workers eligible for higher contributions or accruals42 employers fiduciary responsibilities in 401k plan the employer transmits contributions directly to the financial institution th at manages the account or to an administrator that forwards deposits to number of such financial institutions in handling employees acc ount contributions and performing other activities employers take on fiduciary responsibility with respect to their employees retirement accounts43 in

unresolved issues with individual accounts such as the fiduciary res ponsibility th at employers would likely face for managing their workers contributions ebri march 1999 p 3 45 gao 99122 p 19 46

among other things that in managing their employees retiremen t funds employers have fiduciary responsibility to act solely in the best in terests of the plans participants and beneficiaries in establishing employer responsibilities for ias the role of erisa or some other entity or mechanism to safeguard individual account accumulations would need to be carefully considered45 legislation also might consider need to define the extent to which employers th at offer investment dvice or education for ia participants would be ta king on fiduciary responsibilities possible employer responses to increased costs employers could seek to offset any increases in costs th at arise from administering individual accounts by reducing or restructuring th benefits they currently offer to their employees for example the american academy of actuaries has expressed concern that employers who must absorb new costs to help administer ias might reduce contributions to their pension and 401k plans46 employee contributions to employersponsored plans could be affected too because if employers were to cut back on 401k contributions in response to new co sts from administering ias employee contributions to 401k plans might decline s imilarly the gao has noted that employers might seek to offset any high er costs arising from individual accounts by reducing or restructuring their existing pension plans47 the erisa industry committee eric has suggested that if admin istrative costs of ias are significant they could cause shrinkage of pension sponsorship48 possible employee responses to individual accounts workers may find that social security individual accounts do not offer the same range of investment choices or the amount of indi vidual control over contributions that typical 401k plan offers in 401k plan for example contributions must be deposited into employee accounts soon after the contribution is made if to prevent social security ias from imposing new costs on small employers the current method of collecting social security payroll taxes is used to process ia contributions there would be float period of roughly seven to 22 months between the time payroll taxes are withheld from an employees pay and the date when those taxes are credited to his or her ia investment account du ring that period the funds would probably be held in us treasury bonds as is the case with the social security trust fund today as another measure to preven t ias from imposing new costs on employers the presidents commission recommended that participants s hould be permitted to redirect their contributions among investment funds and reallocate account balanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32756crs14 49 presidents commission p 48 50 gao 00187 p 32among funds just once year49 participants in 401k plans typically have the opportunity to redirect new contributions and reallocate account balances at least monthly how the opportunity to participate in social security ias might affect employees participation in or contributi ons to employersponsored retirement plans would depend on their perceptions of the potential for the accounts to increase their retirement income their expectations about the future benefits they will receive from the traditional social security program and their attitudes toward risk even if there is increase in the payroll tax ias coul d affect employees c ontributions to 401k plans if employees believe that reduced social security benef it plus the ia balance would provide adequate retirement income some workers may offset their individual account saving by saving less elsewhere or borrowing more50 with more of their future retirement income dependent on investment returns some workers might invest their 401k contributions mo re conservatively seeking to reduce the increased investment risk that would result from replacing part of social security with ias alternatively greater exposure to investment risk could encourage some employees to increase their contributions to 401k plans in an attempt to offset some of this risk some workers who cu rrently contribute little or nothing to 401k plans might increase their contributions as they gain knowledge and experience as investors given the opportunity to invest in financial market s some workers might develop taste for saving that would pe rsuade them to save more for retirement through vehicles such as indi vidual retirement accounts iras the possibility that some employees might see the introduction of ias as an opportunity to cut back on other retiremen t saving would need to be carefully addressed in worker educati on efforts for example employees responses to ias also could affect employers if some workers perceive the ia as substitute for their employersponsored retirement sa vings plan rather than complement to it if some workers reduce their contributions to th eir employers 401k plan the employer might find it more difficult to meet the nondiscrimination requi rement of the tax code which prohibits contributions by highlycompensated employees in employersponsored retirement plans from exceeding the contributions of lowerpaid employees by more than specific ratios in some cases this possibility might persuade employers to adopt safe harbor 401k plans in which the employer makes contributions for all eligible employees other employers might seek to satisfy the nondiscrimination require ments by adopting automatic enrollment in their planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32756crs15 51 bush lauds tsp as outline of

commission on strengthening social security and president bush himself have referred to the thrift savings plan tsp for federal employees as possible model for the st ructure of individual accounts under social security51 the tsp currently has more than 3 million participants and has assets of more than 150 billion making it the largest defined contribution plan in the united states the tsp offers participants five investment funds one that invests in us treasury bonds one that invests in private sector bonds and three that invest mainly in common stocks the privatesector bond fund and the common stock funds are passively managed index funds that track the performance of br oad market indices index funds have substantia lly lower administrative costs than actively managed mutual funds in its most recent annual re port the tsp reported administrative costs of just six basis points or sixhundredths of 1 in other words the administrative expenses of the tsp are about 60 cents fo r each 1000 invested this is far lower than the average administrative costs of 401k plans in the private sector where total administrative costs unde r 50 basis points are rare the congressional budget office cbo recently observed that the administrative costs of universal system that offered the same services as the tsp could be higher because different set of employers and employees would be covered52 as the data displayed in table 1 showed most employers in the united states are small firms with fewer than 20 employees the majority of small employers still submit wage reports to ssa on paper most do not have automated payroll systems that could communicate wage data quickly and efficiently to central record keeping agency the employees of small firms also differ markedly from the federal workforce as the gao reported in 1999 the federal workforce as well as the federal government as single employ er differs substantially from the workforce that would be covered under nationwide syst em of ias for example the federal workforce experiences less job turnover tends to be older and has higher average earnings than the general workforce53 the low administrative costs of the tsp have been achieved in part because other federal agencies provide substantia l administrative support for their employees who participate in the tsp the administrative costs for the tsp do not include the services that federal agencies provide for tsp participants54 the agencies where federal employees work are responsible for educating employees about the tsp enrolling them in the plan and transmitting payroll information to the central tsp record keeper as former executive director of the tsp has said the tsp relies heavily on government agencies to provi these services through their

that while you are employed your agency is your primary tsp contact56 in summary number of analysts have concluded that adapting the tsp model to the private sector would be difficult b ecause the nearly 6 million employers in the united states and their 150 million employees differ in important ways from the federal government and its workforce on analyst has pointed out that the tsp functions well because it is essentially singleemployer plan with ready access to centralized record keeping and services57 another has asked how the tsp model could be made to work in the private s ector when most private employers submit contribution information on paper once each year as opposed to the automated payroll submissions now given to the tsp by federal agencies each payday58 while the tsp is an efficient provider of re tirement savings accounts to the federal workforce it is model that would be difficult to duplicate among the numerous and diverse employers in the privatesector references
