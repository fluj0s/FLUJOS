organization unesco and the international council for science icsu nongovernmental organization composed of 95 national science councils or academies formerly called the international council of scientific unions the official goal of wcs is to analyze where the natural sciences stand today and where they are heading wha t their socia l impact has been and what society expects from them finally it will establish what efforts should be invested to make science advance in response to these expectations and to the challenges posed by h uman and social development it will seek to establish1 new international guidelines for science policy and new social contract for science an unofficial and probably more realistic goal is to foster better networking and

technology in the developed world including the private sector also left unresolved was the issue of code f8 conduct for technology tr ansfer between developed and developing countries among the more successful followup activities to uncstd was creation of intergovernmental committee on science and technology for development whose projects wer administered by the development program undp through technical agencies such as the fao and through the world bank unesco and the private sector in 1992 the intergovernmental committee was replaced by commission on science an d technology for

detailed draft framework for ction that will embody the new commitment that the conferen ce calls for as well as its implementation these documents incorporate the views of background report prepared by icsu these three documents are available on12 the internet they reflect the complex notions that st should be supported because of their benefits to society but that science is facing difficulties of confidence and investment as well as problems of an ethical nature and that scientists from the developing nations have less access to science than those from the developed nations 13 some of the sponsors views may be inconsistent with prevailing views in mos t industrialized nations and with u s national interests for example some would disagree with the categorical statements in unesco press release 9966 that says that whil scientific progress has promoted development the general public is alarmed at both the rate and the direction of progress the aftereffects of the chernobyl accident and ne w developments in genetic engineeringwhether cloning sheep and cattle or breedin g transgenic pigs to provide organs for transplantation to man or creating new strains of food cropraise fears of mad scientists fiddling dangerously with nature the pres s release also says t hat the wcs will challenge the industrialized countries to find solutions to complex iss ues such as climate change and adequate food energy and water resources and to do so without ignoring the two thirds of humanity that lack the financial technical and human resourcesand perhaps the political c ommitmentto contribute reportedly unesco is also interested in persuading the general assembly to declare the firs t decade of the millennium as decade for science14 the declaration addresses four main principles

produce scientific knowledge apply science and use science for peace and development 3 establi shing unesco followup to review progress in implementing wcs initiatives16 likely to be discussed at the wcs is the us national ac ademy of sciences proposal to create an interacademy center modeled on the us national research council that would assemble international expert panels to advise the and the

the communication of science fo r journalists broadcasters and exhibition organizers from developing countries18 some controversial issues there are obstacles to meeting the goals in the wcs documents and scientists and polic ymakers from both developed and developing countries have criticized wcs expecta tions for instance sir robert may britains chief scientist19 and delega to the wcs said it was an extremely important event but he challenged it to produc more than pious platitudes and to agree on appropriately realistic an d practical achievements there are diverse perceptions about topics to

formulating its official position on t he wcs declaration and framework for action the nature of us followup to the wcs is uncertain for several27 reasons the united states withdrew from unesco in 1984 but participates in selected28 unesco programs deemed in the us national interest there is debate over whether the united states s hould rejoin unesco in addition the united states currently owes29 the more than 1 billion for its assessed contributions to the regular budget and peacekeeping accounts congress has linked fund ing for these arrears to reforms it expects the to carry out also congress has limited the total us funds available fo r contributions to all international orga nizations making us return to unesco unlikely in the immediate future since us contribution to the unesco regular budget would have to come from the same limited state department appropriations account fo r international organizations tensions could int ensify if the wcs generates expectations for action but funding principal donors are likely to insist that any followu p mechanism be funded through existing resources
