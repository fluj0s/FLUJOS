road l ron hubbard letter to the editor here is one of the thousands of letters that were written to mr hubbard after the initial release of dianetics the modern science of mental health dear mr hubbard after 184 hours work with dianetics i can only say that i have become more and more convinced of its basic value every hour i have worked with it i have seen it work on two of my close friends one an engineer and the other musician and writer they were both quite sane to begin with but now they have mental stability and happiness far greater than the average person the energy and optimism that they now have is above and beyond anything i ever witnessed before dianetics another recommendation for dianetics is that the more intelligent people accept it more quickly than others when i tell them that i have personally seen most of the statements made in the book dianetics proven in my own living room and that anyone who is willing to read the book carefully can in the same manner prove it for himself they usually get the book and read it when dianetics is accepted as it inevitably will be accepted it will by itself bring on golden age world of happiness peace and prosperity sincerely yours norman w james click here for more information or to purchase your copy of dianetics the modern science of mental health organizationwhat is it this article covers why it is important to have organization in business what is the major failure of group or business why would one get very little work done with group t may be that in trying to get something going the basic of organization may be missing the word organize means to form into whole with mutually connected and dependent parts to give definite and orderly structure to from this one gets the term organization organization is the subdivision of actions and duties into specialized functions one can organize series of actions to be done by himself or herself this would consist of seeing what has to be done doing what one can do first and then the remainder as feasible series of events all to accomplish final completion of an action which forwards ones assigned or postulated purposes group is organized so as to permit flows and accomplish specialized actions which are completed in themselves and from which small actions or completions and the group purpose assigned or specialized is forwarded or accomplished there is difference between directing and doing which some people have trouble separating apart person in charge of an activity is sometimes found deficient in organizational understanding and so tries to do all the actions himself this if done to excess effectively can break up group and render it useless since all members but one have function having been robbed by this oneman monopoly on action true an active and competent person can do things better but he can really never do more than he can do whereas wellorganized group each with specialized functions coordinated by the incharge can accomplish many times the work only one can do because it is organized makes group harder to defeat than the individual competent individual who has been let down too often by groups tends to take it all on himself rather than whip the group into shape and get things organized the correct action when faced by urgent necessity arising from incompetence of group or other causes is to 1 handle it 2 organize the group to handle such things and do their jobs one can get stuck on 1 and if he or she does then will have trouble and overwork from there on out because he or she omits also doing 2 the major failure of any group is to fail to organize workers of the world may arise but if they are not quickly organized before or after the fact they will promptly be put back down the major cause of not organizing is just not understanding what is meant by it for example an executive is told he is in charge of seeing that the x project is done he doesnt know much about it he has two men who do know the incorrect action is to try to do the x project himself or issue lot of unreal orders about it the correct action is to call up the man who does know give him the other as an assistant and tell them to get on with it then without interfering the executive who received the order should get more knowledgeable about the x project so he can be sure it is done while still letting the designated people get on with it this comprehension of organization is as simple as thisput somebody on the job and let him get on with it on project make survey of all the things there are to do group types of actions into single jobs assign people to them provide the routes on which communications travel between group members materiel and liaison and let the group get on with it any job matter how junior has to be organized anyone in charge of people has to be able to organize functions and work failing that one gets very little done and is badly overworked and the rest of the group is wasted by understanding that there is subject called organization that the subject has been codified and that it can be learned and applied any individual or group can succeed in its endeavors basic organization organizing and hats organizing board organizing and morale and much more can be found in the scientology handbook click here for more information or to purchase the
