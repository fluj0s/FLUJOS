concerted action initiative project title european climate projects support environment network for the coordinated provision of scientific and technical advice for applying climate data in european climate change research projects short title eclat2 coordinators dr david viner and dr mike hulme climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich start date 010997 1 objectives the overall objectives of the eclat2 project are enhancing the use of climate data observed and modelled within the eu climate and environment programme ensuring that climate data is used in consistent and efficient manner across all sectors within the eu climate and environment programme the development and establishment of support environment that will provide scientific and technical advice to accompany the climate data provision of advice to the eu about future research activities that are required the proposed eclat2 project will provide beneficial enhancement to the current and proposed projects of the euêclimate and environment programme as well as being complimentary and supportive of other major international activities such as the ipcc 2 work content 21 background the eclat1 project env4ct950128 has established network which is providing dedicated and unique focal point for the exchange of information regarding the observed and scenario climate data issues that effect the component projects of the eu climate and environment programme the eclat1 project is due to finish in june 1997 the eclat1 project established an organised network which has provided platform for the exchange of information regarding the issues that surround the construction and application of climate datasets for use in climate change impacts projects the eclat1 network coupled to the eclat1 workshop october 1996 which brought together representatives of the climate modelling and climate change impacts communities represented key step forward in the efficiency with which climate data and associated information may be used by these two communities within europe the eclat1 workshop produced the following recommendations and conclusions i focused interchange of information and ideas between the climate modelling and climate change impacts communities within the eu is necessary for the efficient exploitation of europeõs climate change modelling expertise the eclat1 workshop provided one example of such interchange ii there is need for the research community to have easier access to high quality observed climate datasets these include highresolution gridded climatologies and observed station data at both monthly and daily timesteps iii there is broad requirement by the european climate change impacts community for focal point and network real or virtual that can provide scientific and technical advice to the impacts community that will help to promote the consistent use of observed and scenario climate datasets documentation of relevant climate change experiments and observed climate data and guidance regarding which are most appropriate for use in impacts assessments guidelines for the development and application of climate change scenarios provide framework for sensitivity and risk analysis based upon òbottomupó approach to vulnerability assessments ie define critical change and then search for that change within range of climate change scenarios iv climate change impacts research within the european union should be orientated to answer policy relevant questions eg what mitigation and adaptation strategies to be adopted stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations at what concentration what are the mechanisms available for european impacts research to influence european climate policy v process to assimilate european sectoral impacts assessments into coherent report on the impacts of climate change in the european union should be implemented in time for cop 3 december 1997 and the third ipcc assessment c 2000 vi in order to improve the regionalisation of climate change impacts there is need for dedicated research project that can intercompare the various downscaling methods empirical semiempirical and dynamic that are available to construct high resolution spatial andor temporal climate change scenarios for impacts assessments pic figure 1 the mechanisms currently available for the dissemination of climate data it is proposed that the current eclat1 concerted action initiative be extended for further three years to cover the duration of the current and proposed framework iv projects to the year 2000 in accord with the recommendations and conclusions of the eclat1 workshop there are three key areas which will be addressed by the eclat2 project the maintenance development and extension of the existing eclat1 network which will facilitate the exchange of information betrween the component projects of the euêclimate and environment programme the organisation of series of strategic and technical workshops that will address issues that are of concern to the eclatêcommunity some of which were raised in the eclat1 workshop the development of support environment that will provide flow of scientific and technical information between the climate modelling and climate change impacts projects within the eclatêcommunity so as to help ensure the correct and consistent use of climate data within climate change impacts assessments 21 the eclat2 network the eclat network already established under eclat1 will continue during the lifetime of eclat2 this will be organised by partner and will continue to provide an electronic medium via the worldwideweb and mail for the exchange of information about observed and scenario climate data together with reports constructed from the eclat2 strategic and technical workshops as with eclat1 the eclat2 network will consist of representatives from the component projects of the euêclimate and environment programme as well as representatives within europe from other associated international activities 22 the eclat2êstrategic and technical workshops the eclat1 workshop held in october 1996 can be viewed as success given that it brought together scientists from both climate modelling and impacts communities and scientists from different backgrounds within the impacts community the workshop however also provided unique platform within the eu framework iv programme for the discussion of range of issues surrounding the construction and use of climate scenarios that are common to the component disciplines it is envisaged that two strategic eclat2 workshops be held to mark progress in addressing the issues raised above these workshops would be composed of representatives from the entire eclat community and would have strong links into the framework iv research projects along with these strategic workshops there will also be series of smaller technical task group workshops each of which would focus upon specific technical issue the proposed eclat2 steering committee would take charge of identifying and organising these workshops for example these topics might include the following comparison of the dynamical regional climate modelling and empirical downscaling techniques that are available for scenario construction the nature of climate change experiments which are relevant for impacts assessments and which might be undertaken by the climate modelling centres the construction and characteristics of climate change scenarios that can be used in impacts assessments using simple climate models in conjunction with gcm experiments guidelines on the application of climate change scenarios to impacts assessments an evaluation and the provision of information regarding the uncertainties that that surround climate change scenarios from each of these technical workshops the designated task group would under the guidance of the steering committee report back to the eclat2 community at the strategic workshops and via the eclat2 network and to dgxii andthe wider research community through published reports pic figure 2 the conceptual structure of the eclat2 support environment 23 the eclat2êsupport environment eclat2 one of these issues highlights the shortfalls that exist at present in the way in which climate data are used within the eu climate change research community and the way in which the results of the climate change modelling experiments are disseminated to impacts projects the mechanisms for obtaining scenario climate data within europe at present fall into three broad categories downloading selected set of results on an anonymous ftp site this provides unrestricted but nonsupported and noncontrolled access to modelling results approaching an organised and staffed interface which provides observed and scenario climate data in consistent manner accompanied by user oriented scientific and technical advice by making direct approach to an individual within given modelling centre figure 1 illustrates schematically the operation of these existing mechanisms each of these mechanisms has its own advantages and disadvantages and it is not proposed that one single mechanism be implemented by one centralised dissemination node rather to ensure that the results from the various climate change experiments are used effectively and consistently within the framework of the eu climate and environment programme it is proposed that the eclat1 network should be enhanced to include support environment eclat2 the eclat2 will form an important component of the eclat2 project activities and is schematically illustrated in figure 2 the eclat2 will be designed to facilitate the transfer of scientific and technical advice between the climate modelling and climate impacts projects so as to allow for an efficient use of the results from the climate change experiments the flow of climate model data will still be governed by the mechanism each modelling centre has established whereas the provision of consistent information and advice channelled through the eclat2 will help promote the efficient use of these results in impacts work 3 project milestones and deliverables figure 3 project timetable workshops and report schedules the workplan figure 3 involves the establishment and maintenance of the support environment and the series of strategic and technical workshops that will be held within this environment this timetable will be tuned coincide with the activities of other major international activities in this field eg the intergovernmental panel on climate change 4 benefits it is the overall aim of the eclat2 project to ensure that climate data is used in more consistent manner within the euêclimate and environment programmeõs research projects the continued development and extension of the network that has been established by the eclat1 project will maintain the improved coordination and communication that is starting to develop under eclat1 the increased consistency of the construction and use of climate data will help to enable more effective use and interpretation of the results from the component climate change research projects that are underway and planned within the eu this will also have beneficial input into the international climate change activities as represented by the intergovernmental panel on climate change where requirement for such wideranging evaluation for the third assessment report has already been recognised the eclat2 network will allow for continuous liaison between the eu environment and climate programme impacts projects and those scientists involved in climate change scenario construction and climate modelling thus ensuring the efficient and effective use of results from the gcm climate change experiments performed at the four climate modelling centres in europe the workshop series will bring together scientists from spectrum of environmental disciplines to discuss climate change data issues which are common amongst them exist reports from the technical workshops will feed into the strategic workshops providing the relevant information to the wider eclat2 community the overall aims of the strategic workshops will be to provide information to the wider international climate change research community policy makers and to help formulate the future research plans of dgxii 5 economic and social impacts within the eu there are four major climate modelling centres each of these will be represented within the eclat2 steering committee these centres perform climate change experiments using sophisticated computer based models of the ocean and atmosphere systems in order to make efficient consistent and standard use of these results from these experiments it is essential that the user community as represented by the climate change impacts community be fully informed about the availability of datasets both modelled and observed the workshop series and eclat2 network will develop further the framework that has been established by the eclat1 project for the efficient communication of construction methods standards and applications for impacts assessments this communication will enable more efficient and effective comparison of the results from the eu impacts assessment projects such integrated impacts assessments are an essential component of the research necessary to identify how climate change will alter the environment and economy of europe and what climate policy initiatives should be pursued by the eu 6 project management and structure the management of the eclat2 project will be coordinated at the climatic research unit cru cru will provide the focal point for the organisation of the workshops coordinate and develop eclat2 and produce the relevant reports steering committee eclat2 sc comprising representatives from the four climate modelling centres and the impacts community these are the project partners will provide guidance to this management team the climatic research unit who will provide the primary contact point of the eclat2 eclat2 sc will guide the activities of the project it will be the role of the eclat2 sc to guide the eclat2 project coordinators to design the technical workshops although these will be organised locally by members of eclat2 sc 7 the partnership 71 the climatic research unit cru partner the cru was

selfexploiting within the framework of euêfunded climate change research the coordinated focal point and interface provided by the climatic research unit coupled with the strategic direction provided by the steering committee will allow for the effective dissemination of scientific and technical advice between the component projects of the euêclimate and environment programme this will greatly enhance the communication between the climate modellers and impacts researchers within europe that was established by the eclat1 project and enhance the quality and consistency of the climate data that is used within the component projects of the euêclimate and environment programme 10 ongoing projects and previous proposals this proposal has not been submitted elsewhere for support it is designed to complement develop and extend the activities of the eclat1 project which will come to an end during the summer of 1997 the eclat2êsupport environment however has been designed to utilise and draw together the relevant expertise and complement and facilitate research undertaken by projects that have and are being supported by the eu and the numerous international climate change research programmesand activities that are in place figure 4 lists the current climate modelling projects that are of relevance to the eclat2êproject the eclat1 project developed core network of over 30 climate change impacts projects the majority of which were represented at the eclat1 workshop the eclat2 project will encompass all the relevant projects that are currently funded1 within the euêclimate and environment programme as well as number outside eg the european climate support network figure 4 the current climate modelling projects under the eu climate and environment programme 1
