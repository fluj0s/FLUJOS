d summary 1 c in connection the upcoming april 1617 visit by swedish minister of defense sten tolgfors to washington embassy recommends raising two requests regarding specific additional contributions in afghanistan ref and swedens pending decision on participation in natos rapid response we also recommend thanking sweden for hosting the upcoming international compact with iraq conference end summary supporting isaf in afghanistan 2 c we demarched mfa and mod regarding ref request for the swedish armed forces to deploy battalionlevel operational mentoring and liaison team omlt to afghanistan ref b although sweden has promised to continue and do more in afghanistan we have received reply regarding the omlts we recommend secretary gates raise the issue with defense minister tolgfors at their april 17 meeting 3 c for the battalion omlt to be operationally effective would require change in the current swedish policy that decisions to deploy swedish soldiers outside their prt area be made in stockholm rather than in the field our sources indicate such deliberation is underway in addition the swedish armed forces has indicated its desire on several occasions to deploy medevac helicopters jas39 gripen aircraft and possibly additional soldiers in its prt the ministers current views on these subjects would prove enlightening nato rapid response 4 c swedens mod had earlier expressed an interest and the politicians are currently deliberating swedens participation in the januaryjuly 2010 nato response force 14 we had hoped that like finland sweden would announce their commitment to the effort at the bucharest summit the decision was delayed by haggling within the governing centerright coalition which is led by the moderate party of which tolgfors is member the pivotal center party is hesitant but decision in favor of participati on has not been precluded the likely scope of swedens potential contribution has not been declared though the swedish armed forces had said it would likely be land component sweden currently leads and contributes 2300 personnel to an eu battle group with core mechanized battalion and intends to do this again in 2011 there is however reason to believe this level of effort would be offered for the nrf 14 sweden must fund recruit and train and from pool of former conscripts and reserve soldiers to field force of this nature as it has limited standing forces for this task international compact with iraq conference ici 5 c on april 3 prime minister fredrick reinfeldt nannounced that sweden will host the may 29 ici conference on iraq cochaired by syg ban and iraq pm maliki secretary rice will attend reinfeldt stated what sweden hopes to see is the groundwork for civilian missions that build country in the long term adding that sweden plans to be very active likely swedish contributions to iraq rebuilding efforts are civilian and therefore largely outside the portfolio of minister tolgfors but we recommend secretary gates thank minister tolgfors for the gos hosting this conference 6 c bio comment the ambassador has cultivated close working relationship with tolgfors from tolgfors prior job as minister of foreign trade tolgfors went to high school in the us and told the ambassador he loves the us and maintains friends there wood
