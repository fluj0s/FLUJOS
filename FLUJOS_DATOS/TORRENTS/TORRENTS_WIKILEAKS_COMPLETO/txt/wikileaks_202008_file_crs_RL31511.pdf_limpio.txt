innovation the federal tax burden on the pharmaceutical industry the federal tax code aﬀects private investment in new drug discovery and development in variety of ways and these linkages form the core of the report more speciﬁcally it analyses the industrys federal tax burden from 1995 to 2001 the most recent year for which federal corporate tax return data are available focusing on the provisions in the federal tax code that appear to generate signiﬁcant tax beneﬁts or penalties for pharmaceutical ﬁrms that invest heavily in rd the size of the industrys tax burden inﬂuences its capacity to invest in innovation the report begins with an examination of the distinguishing traits of the pharmaceutical industry directly related to its tax treatment and concludes with description

congress over expanding consumer access to prescription drugs is the forces shaping the domestic climate for the discovery and development of new medicines one such force is federal policy this report examines small slice of the assortment of federal policies that affect the incentive to invest in pharmaceutical innovation the federal tax burden on the pharmaceutical industry and legislative initiatives to modify the burden it will be updated to reflect more recent data or significant legislative activity in the 109 th congress generally an industrys federal tax burden refers to how the federal income tax affects its return on total investment through such critical elements as the definition of taxable income adjustments to this income tax rates and adjustments to tax liability economists typically measure an industrys federal tax burden as its average effective tax rate which is the ratio of its federal tax liability after all credits except the foreign tax credit to its pretax income expressed as percentage this measure is not without shortcomings principal problem is that average effective rates do not fully capture the influence of tax provisions that accelerate the timing of deductions or delay the recognition of income comparison of average effective federal tax rates for the drug industry and major us industries indicates that the drug industrys federal tax burden was significantly less than the average burden for all industries from 1996 through 1998 but that in the next three years it rose to the point that it was nearly identical to the average for all industries in 2000 and 2001 this upward shift was due mainly to phaseout of the possessions tax credit that commenced in 1997 and is to come to fruition in 2005 pharmaceutical firms have been major beneficiaries of this credit as corporate income tax return data for years after 2001 become available it would not be surprising if the pharmaceutical industrys tax burden were to remain near the average for all industries pharmaceutical firms also appear to benefit substantially and perhaps more than many other firms from two tax preferences whose combined influence is not fully reflected in average tax rates 1 the deferral of federal income tax on the retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries of usbased corporations and 2 the expensing of rd and advertising outlays available evidence suggests that current federal tax law has little influence on the pharmaceutical industrys incentive to invest in rd this is be cause rd investment in the industry is driven to far greater extent by the competitive strategies of pharmaceutical firms nonetheless substantial increase in the industrys tax burden would be likely to affect the industrys ability to invest in innovation at least one bill that would alter the tax treatment of many pharmaceutical firms has been introduced in the 109 th congress hr 575 would deny tax deduction for any amount spent by business taxpayer on

controversy on the one hand firms that develop produce and sell brandname or patented drugs have been lauded for their large and rising investments in the development of safer or more effective versions of existing medicines and new medicines that advance the treatment of host of serious illnesses1 on the other hand the same firms have been excoriated for pricing policies that result in us customers paying considerably more for the same branded drugs than many customers in other developed countries in europe and asia their efforts to thwart or delay competition from cheaper generic drugs their relatively high rates of return on investment and their substantial and rapidly rising outlays for advertising and product promotion 2 framing these sharply contrasting sentiments is longstanding policy debate over how best to improve access to expensive but needed medicines among americans of all ages without establishing costly new federal entitlement programs or undermining current financial incentives for pharmaceutical innovation the number of new drugs entering the market year after year and their pricing have important effects on this access key issue in this debate is the forces shaping the domestic climate for the discovery and commercial development of new medicines one such force is federal policy the federal government plays varied and farreaching role in pharmaceutical innovation it is role that encompasses wide range of laws and prog rams including direct federal funding of pharmaceutical research and development rd federal regulation of the safety and efficacy of new medicines and the use and advertising of exis ting medicines federal patent protection for prescription drugs federal support of biomedical research and education in universities federal financing of drug purchases through medicaid and medicare and federal tax subsidies for rd and employerprovided health insurance indeed the influence of federal policy on new drug development is so profound that it is indeed difficult to imagine what the domestic climate for pharmaceutical innovation would be like in its absence this report examines small slice of the federal policies influencing pharmaceutical innovation the federal tax burden on the pharmaceutical industry the federal tax code affects private investment in new drug discovery and developmen t in variety of ways

g4g158g155g141g142g151g561 most industries have distinctive traits essential features born of the singular technologies around which they are built and their evolving requirements for competitive success and longterm growth the pharmaceutical industry is one of these industries in the minds of many what distinguishes firms that develop produce promote and sell patented or branded prescription drugs is their propensity to spend heavily on rd and advertising concentration on certain therapeutic categories to the exclusion of others relatively high dependence on patents to generate sustained growth in profits and bolste r competitiveness and vast network of foreign operations it turns out that most of these traits have important implications for the industrys federal tax burden

receives little in the way of direct rd funding from federal government agencies according to estimates made by the national science board us producers of drugs and medicines spent 98 of net sales on domestic rd in 2000 compared to ratios of 34 for all industries and 33 for manufacturing 3 in the same year us producers of drugs and medicines spent 128 billion of their own and other nonfederal funds on domestic rd it is not known how much the federal government spent on pharmaceutical rd in 2000 but the amount probably was tiny in comparison to industry spending in 1997 for instance federal spending for this purpose totaled mere 3 million 4 the principal trade association for the us pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america or phrma estimates that in 2003 domestic spending on pharmaceutical rd by member firms totaled 274 billion up from 105 billion in 19935 however the industry spent smaller share of domestic sales revenue on rd in 2003 177 than in 1993 216 most pharmaceutical firms invest heavily in rd because they have other choice if they want to survive and grow over time simply put rd is the primary engine of longterm growth in the industry it is said that risk and reward go hand in hand in the realm of business investment and this intimate connection is abundantly evident in pharmaceutical rd on the one hand discovering and developing new breakthrough drugs is timeconsuming risky and costly process6 on the other hand firms that develop ne w breakthrough drugs can reap huge profits 3 national science foundation division

drugs enter the market7 advances in the technology for new drug development over the past 25 years have greatly increased the number of drug compounds with significant therapeutic potential being discovered nonetheless there is some concern that the flow of new breakthrough drugs through the rd pipeline is slowing to the point where some major multinational firms might be forced to merge recent study by the national institute for health care management foundation found that only 15 of the 1035 new drug applications approved by the fda from 1989 to 2000 contained new chemical ingredients offering significant therapeutic advantages over existing drugs 8 in addition in 2002 the fda approved 17 new drugs for sale in the united states the lowest total since 1983 and far below the alltime high of 56 new drugs approved in 19969 new wave of mergers could affect future trends in pharmaceutical rd investment by lessening competition in key segments of the domestic market for prescription drugs 10

given that the pharmaceutical industry invests heavily in rd but the prospects of delivering highly profitable drugs to the marketplace have remained stubbornly slight it may come as surprise that most pharmaceutical firms also spend large sums on promoting their branded products directly to physicians and consumers fi rms that develop new drugs offering significant therapeutic advantages over existing drugs seem especially inclined to spend heavily on advertising and promotion early in new drugs life cycle the advertising and promotion often are aimed at capturing major share of the market as quickly as possible but later in the drugs life cycle their main intent can shift to fending off or thwarting budding competition from generic versions or patented substitutes known as metoo drugs available industry data suggest that many pharmaceutical firms regard advertising and promotion as an indispensable weapon in their quest for ngterm growth according to one reliable source domestic promotional spending by pharmaceutical firms totaled over 23 billion in 2003 up from about 9 billion in 1996 more than 13 billion of the 2003 expenditures went to the distribution of free drug samples valued at retail cost to phy sicians another 7 billion covered the cost of making direct sales pitches to physicians and 3 4 billion were channeled into direct advertising to consumers 11 continued of

among physicians reflects fundamental feature of the market for prescription drugs one that is largely absent from the markets for most goods and services consumers rely heavily on the judgment and consent of third partiesin this case doctorsin deciding which prescription drugs to use when stricken with illness or injury

single firm or small cluster of firms dominates the us market for branded prescription drugs the us census bureau has reported that in 1997 the four largest producers accounted for 32 of the value of domestic shipments of medicines the eight largest for 48 and the 20 largest for 67 12 ten years earlier the share of the four largest was 22 and that of the 20 largest 65 nonetheless some firms are able to gain supremacy in certain key segments of the market such dominance is most likely to arise when firm is the first to bring new breakthrough drug to the marketplace for example in april 2004 75 of us prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs were filled by drugs made by three companies three companies accounted for 60 of us prescriptions for treating migraine headaches and 78 of us prescriptions for cholesterol lowering drugs were filled by drugs made by three companies13 but this dominance can turn out to be ephemeral as it rests partly on the patent protection granted to the medicines sold by these companies and partly on the absence of competition from newer more effective or safer medicines

transformation of the pharmaceutical industry over time highlights another distinguishing trait of the industry the heavy reliance of major pharmaceutical firms on patents to generate large revenue streams and profits and to bolster their competitiveness patents give their owners temporary legal monopoly over commercial uses of an invention in the united states and most other advanced industrialized nations the life of patent is 20 years from the date of application patent holder may license other firms to exploit the inventi on but it would typically do so in exchange for royalties which can be thought of as compensation for relinquishing exclusive control pharmaceutical firms may claim patents for the design of drug compounds their formulation as drug therapies their uses in treating illnesses and their methods of manufacture 14 industry executives regard patents as one of the most effective means of safeguarding the competitive advantages arising from investing

investment partly explains why drug firms have long been among the most profitable of all firms from 1960 to 1991 the reported rate of return on stockholders equity for the pharmaceutical firms included in the annual ranking of the top 500 industrial corporations by fortune magazine averaged 184 compared to 119 for all 500 firms16 and as recently as 2001 pharmaceuticals ranked first in return on shareholders equity 332 among the 48 industries represented in the fortune 50017 perhaps the most persuasive evidence that patents are critical to the profitability of pharmaceutical firms can be found in the differences in selling prices between branded drugs and their generic counterparts medicines protected by patents typically command far higher prices than the generic versions which enter the market after the patents expire18 g7g161g157g142g151g156g146g159g142g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 account of the distinctive traits of

to establish manufacturing and research presence in each market20 the following figures illuminate the extent to which the industry has built such presence in important foreign markets perhaps the most comprehensive source of data on foreign direct investment abroad by us firms is the us department of commerce according to commerce department data by 2001 total of 35 usbased pharmaceutical firms with domestic assets valued at 2841 billion had established total of 1098 majorityowned foreign affiliates with assets valued at 3559 billion 21 sales of the foreign affiliates in that year amounted to 776 billion or 45 of total sales reported by their us parent firms and total employment by the affiliates came to 211600 workers or 54 of total employment reported by their us parent firms second but more limited source of information on the foreign operations of us pharmaceutical firms is phrma in 2003 domestic sales by phrma member companies amounted to an estimated 1546 billion while

while foreign rd spending by usbased phrma member companies and the us affiliates of foreignbased phrma member companies was an estimated 58 billion or 21 of domestic rd spending23 although the importance of foreign markets varies from company to company some analysts estimate that the us pharmaceutical industry derives about 40 of it revenue from foreign sales24 because many countries outside the united states impose strict controls on prescription drug prices foreign markets tend to account for smaller portion of overall profits than sales but there are notable exceptions in 2003 for example six of the largest usbased pharmaceutical firms received over 65 of their combined profits from foreign operations up from about 38 in 199425

income as shown in table 1 represents blend of domestic income earned by usbased corporations and us affiliates of foreignbased firms and income earned abroad by foreign branches and subsidiaries of usbased corporations such blend is appropriate because the united states taxes business income on the basis of residence and not territorial source consequently corporations chartered in the united states owe taxes to the federal government on their worldwide income whether it is earned inside or outside the country usbased firms also pay income taxes to foreign governments on much of the income earned by their foreign affiliates to avoid double taxation of this income us tax law allows usbased multinational firms to claim credit for foreign in come tax payments up to their us tax liability

foreign ta x credit divided by taxable income and multiplied by 100 several noteworthy trends can be discerned in the figures in the table they make clear that the 1990s was period of robust growth for the pharmaceutical industry its taxable income more than doubled between 1990 and 2001 it is also clear from the table that the industry benefitted from available tax credits excluding the foreign tax credit from 1990 to 2001 its average tax liability after credits was 79 of its average tax liability before credits the reason for excluding the foreign tax credit from these calculations is explained below at the same time the value of these credits trended downward after peaking in 1994 reaching low of 1027 billion in 2000 the primary force behind this decline was phaseout of the possessions tax credit that began in the late 1997 and is supposed to continue through 2005 as result the difference between tax liability before credits and tax liability after credits narrowed considerably from 1990 to 2000 before increasing somewhat in 2001 the main tax credits claimed by the drug industry are shown in table 2 their impact on the industrys federal tax burden is discussed

tax benefit on pharmaceutical firms section 901 of the internal revenue code irc holds that corporation chartered in the united states and paying income and related taxes to foreign governments may

the pharmaceutical industry has been major beneficiary of what was known until 1996 as the possessions tax credit under irc section 936 and now is called the puerto rican economic activity credit preac under irc section 30a in 2001 the industry was able to reduce its federal income tax liability by more than 5 by claiming the credit and it accounted for 49 of the total value of claims for the credit by all industries corporations chartered in the united states may be able to exclude from federal income tax as much as 40 of their income from business operations they own in puerto rico the us virgin islands and other us territorial possessions in order to take advantage of this exclusion firm must derive 80 of its gross income from business operations in one or more of these possessions

regular research tax credit is equal to 20 of firms qualified spending on research conducted in the united states and its territorial possessions above base amount 28 it is due to expire at the end of 2005 in order to minimize the likelihood of rewarding firms for undertaking rd they would have done in any event the credits rate structure is incremental instead of flat the main direct effect of the credit is to lower the aftertax cost of qualified research various rules governing the use of the credit make its marginal effective rate much lower than its statutory rate for many firms firms have the option of claiming an alternative incremental research credit with maximum statutory rate far below the statutory rate of the regular credit moreover they may also claim tax credit equal to 20 of payments for contract basic research to certain organizations mainly universities above base amount in addition to either the regular or alternative credits the following expenses are eligible for the regular alternative and basic research credits wages and salaries of researchers supplies and materials used in qualified research leased computer time for qualified research and either 65 or 75 of payments for contract research the pharmaceutical industry is leading beneficiary of the research credit among rd performing industries in 2000 drug industry claims for the credit totaled nearly 802 million or 11 of the total value of claims for the credit but it would be erroneous to infer from these figures that the credit gives major pharmaceutical firms potent incentive to raise their rd spending from one year to the next the reason is that the industry seems to derive little benefit from the credit relative to its huge outlays for rd there is plenty of evidence to substantiate this notion for example total claims for the credit by the pharmaceutical industry were equal to 3 of total domestic rd spending by phrma member companies from 1995 to 2000 moreover relatively few pharmaceutical firms claim the research tax credit in given tax year in 1997 about one in every five federal corporate income tax returns filed by pharmaceutical firms included claim for the research tax credit additionally even the largest us pharmaceutical firms cannot count on claiming the credit despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars or more on rd in 2001 report crs estimated that under current tax law the usbased pharmaceutical company merck was unable to claim the regular research tax credit in 1998 despite spending 18 billion on rd or 137 million more than in 1997 29 the

rare diseases such credit has the potential to stimulate significant increases in investment in the development of drugs to treat such diseases because human clinical trials which are conducted in three phases are the most time consuming and costly step in the new drug development process31 rare disease or condition is defined as one likely to affect fewer than 200000 individuals residing in the united states or one likely to affect more than 200000 such individuals but for which there is realistic prospect of recovering rd costs from us sales alone the credit applies to the cost of supplies and the wages and salaries of researchers used in clinical trials for orphan drugs only the cost of any structures and equipment used in the trials cannot be added to the base for the credit it is permanent and component of the general business credit and thus subject to its limitations since the orphan drug credit was enacted in 19 83 as part of package of measures aimed at stimulating increased investment in the development of new drugs to treat rare diseases and conditions over 225 such drugs have gained regulatory approval in the united states ironically some of them went on to become major sources of revenue for their producers including glaxo wellcomes antiaids drug retrovir azt amgens antianemia drug epogen and genentechs human growth hormone protropin 32

tax code affects an industrys return on investment through the definition of taxable income adjustments to taxable income eg deductions and exemptions tax rates and adjustments to tax liability eg tax credits and minimum tax payments in essence these provisions serve two purposes 1 raising revenue to fund government operations and programs and 2 giving firms incentives to engage in activities favored by policymakers the tax credit for increasing research expenditures exemplifies the second purpose reduced to its simplest terms an industrys federal tax burden denotes how much of its profits are sacrificed in order to comp ly with current tax law as this burden rises firms have fewer funds to invest as they please economists define firms tax burden as its share of real pretax economic income paid in taxes but it is difficult to determine firms economic income from business tax return data because of provisions in the tax code that drive wedge between economic income and taxable income so alternative approaches must be used to measure business tax burdens such as substituting taxable income as determined under current federal tax law for pretax economic income such an approach is taken here common measure of an industrys federal tax burden is its average effective tax rate which is the ratio of its federal income tax liability after credits to its income subject to tax expressed as percentage as such the ratio expresses the net effect of the federal tax code on the industrys pre tax returns on past investments this effect summarizes the ways in which the tax code both penalizes and rewards the economic activities of the firms making up the industry 31 pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america 2002 industry profile pp 1922 32 standard poors

measure an industrys federal tax burden one problem is that the rates reflect the impact of the tax code on the returns to an industrys previous investments and thus may ov erstate or understate the federal tax burden on current or possible future investments furthermore average effective tax rates cannot accurately measure the federal tax burden for an industry because they fail to capture the influence of provisions in the tax code that accelerate the timing of tax deductions or delay the recognition of income for tax purposes better measure might be the marginal effective tax rate for an industry which would capture the net effect of such provisions on the pretax returns on new investment by an industry 33 unfortunately it is impossible to compute such rate for most industries because the value of some important tax benefits eg expensing of rd costs cannot be calculated using available corporate financial or tax return data and not all firms in an industry invest in the same mix of assets to the same extent nonetheless if average effective tax rates are applied consistently across industries and time they can indicate whether or not their federal tax burdens differ and to what extent table 3 shows the average effective federal tax rates for the drug industry and major us industries from 1995 to 2001 the rates compare the industries federal income tax liability after all credits except the foreign tax credit with their worldwide taxable income as reported on their federal income tax returns as such they address neither the domestic tax burden on domestic income nor the worldwide tax burden on worldwide income for the industries instead the rates represent something of hybrid of the two measures showing the federal tax burden on domestic income plus foreign income that has been recognized for federal tax purposes as noted earlier the foreign tax credit should be excluded from an industrys net tax liability because its purpose is to avoid the double taxation of foreignsource income including it would understate the federal tax burden on the industries it is clear from the table that the federal tax burden of the pharmaceutical industry gradually increased from 1996 to 2001 bringing it into line with the average tax burden for all industries this trend may come as surprise to those who believe that the industry has long been taxed relatively lightly the principal force behind the industrys rising tax burden was the phaseout of the possessions tax credit that commenced in 1997 as was noted earlier pharmaceutical firms have been among the largest beneficiaries of the credit one way to illustrate this point is to compute the industrys tax burden in the absence of the credit if the credit had been unavailable in 1998 and 1999 the pharmaceutical industrys average effective tax rate would have been almost identical to that of all industries 336 compared to 335 33 the marginal effective tax rate on business income is the expected pretax rate of return minus the expected aftertax rate of return on new investment divided by the pretax rate of return it typically accounts for the statutory tax rate accelerated depreciation allowances and economic rates of depreciation adjusted for inflation nonetheless the rate can be adjusted to reflect the influence of other detailed provisions of the tax code in essence the rate summarizes the tax incentives to invest in particular asset or set of asse ts as such it may bear little relation to an industrys average effective tax rate which measures the actual tax paid in given year as share of actual capital income in that year earned from all past investment for more information on the computation and uses of the marginal effective tax rate see don fullerton marginal

typical investments by the industries shown in table 3 it is likely that the drug industry would still have the lowest rate the reason lies in certain tax preferences that tend to benefit

tax preferences in particular may yield significant tax savings for usbased pharmaceutical firms and thus deserve further exploration 1 the deferral of federal income taxes on net in come retained by

as was noted earlier the federal government taxes corporations based or chartered in the united states on their worldwide income and grants them tax credits for any foreign income tax payments they make on foreignsource income up to their federal tax liability on that income but not all foreign income is treated equally for us tax purposes profits earned by foreign branches of usbased corporations are taxed at the appropriate federal rates in the year when it is earned regardless of whether the profits are repatriated in contrast profits earned by foreign corporate subsidiaries of these corporations is subject to us taxation only when they are repatriated to the parent firms as dividends royalty payments or other income the subsidiaries profits may be taxed by the host countries but any profits they retain are exempt from federal income taxation until the profits are repatriated such an exemption represents deferral of us income tax liability

particularly in cases where firms locate subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates th an the united states the reason lies in the time value of money dollar received today is worth more than the same dollar received in the future therefore the longer taxpayer can defer tax payment the less it is worth in current dollars34 as result usbased firms owning subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates than the united states can reduce their real tax burden by having the subsidiaries retain their earnings indefinitely the tax benefits arising from the opportunity to defer federal taxes on foreignsource income give usbased firms robust incentive to invest in countries with lower income tax rates than the united states 35 there is reason to believe that usbased pharmaceutical firms reap significant tax benefits from this opportunity according to recent report in tax notes the effective foreign income tax rate on the foreign profits of six major us pharmaceutical firms was 176 in 2003 the maximum us corporate tax rate in the same year was 3536 the same report found that at the end of 2003 the nine largest us pharmaceutical firms reported cumulative total of 102 billion in unrepatriated foreign profits37 another report in tax notes pointed out that six pharmaceutical firms were among the top 20 usbased multinational firms out of total of 67 ranked according to accumulated undistributed or unrepatriated foreign earnings included in their 2003 10k reports filed with the securities and exchange commission38 what is more the controlled foreign corporate subsidiaries cfcs of usbased pharmaceutical firms appear to exhibit relatively strong propensity to retain earnings39 at the end of 1996 for instance these subsidiaries reported having retained earnings equal in value to 403 of their assets by contrast the same ratio for controlled foreign subsidiaries in all industries was 11440 34 to some analysts the deferral of tax payments is analogous

given that the pharmaceutical industry is major beneficiary of the ability of usbased multinational firms to defer federal taxes on the profits earned by their foreign corporate subsidiaries it should come as surprise that the industry might also benefit more than many other industries from provision in the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca pl 108 357 allowing temporary tax reduction for the repatriation of those profits under irc section 965 which was added by ajca us corporations may claim deduction equal to 85 of cash dividends in excess of baseperiodamount they receive from their cfcs and invest in the united states under an eligible plan approved by top corporate officer and the board of directors for corporations subject to marginal tax rate of 35 the deduction lowers the rate on any dividends received to 525 035 x 015 corporations may claim the deduction once and they may do so either in their last tax year before october 22 2004 the date of enactment for the ajca or their first tax year during the 12 months starting on october 22 2004 the baseperiod amount for corporation is the average amount of cash dividends it received from cfcs in three of the five most recent tax years ending on or before june 30 2003 the years with the lowest and highest repatriation amounts are disregarded there is limitation on the amount of cash dividends that may be deducted it is the greater of 500 million or the amount shown on firms financial statements as earnings permanently reinvested outside the united states or in the case of firms whose financial statements do not specify an amount of earnings permanently reinvested outside the united states but do report tax liability for those earnings the amount of that liability divided by the maximum corporate tax rate of 35 in recent months four of the six largest us pharmaceutical firms have announced plans to repatriate 56 billion in foreign profits to take advantage of the temporary deduction on dividends received one analyst expects that pharmaceutical firms will account for about half of all the profits repatriated by publicly held companies 41

expenditures under irc section 174 the provision permits business taxpayers to deduct qualified rd expenses in the year when they are incurred such treatment is known as expensing to be eligible for expensing rd expenditures must meet the following criteria they must relate to firms trade or business they cannot be considered capital costs and they must be directed at activities intended to discover information that would eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of product 42 in practice only the wages and salaries of research personnel and cost of supplies and materials used in qualified research and related overhead costs may be expensed by contrast the cost of structures and equipment used in this research must be recovered over 15 years and three years respectively using allowable depreciation methods for most firms spending on rd creates intangible assets such as patents that can generate substantial flow of revenues over number of years more often

using an appropriate depreciation method rather than fully recovered in the year when the expenses are incurred43 but when the tax code treats rd costs as current expense rather than capital expense subsidy arises in the form of lower marginal effective tax rate on the returns to rd investment in fact expensing reduces the marginal effective tax rate on the returns to investment in affected assets to zero44 this means that the user cost of capital for rd investment is typically lower than for many alternative investments firm might make including purchases of new plant and equipment pharmaceutical firms are likely to benefit more from this tax subsidy for rd investment than most other firms because of their relatively strong propensity to invest in rd in 2000 according to estimates by the national science foundation nsf pharmaceutical firms plowed an estimated 98 of their domestic sales revenue into domestic rd compared to domestic rdtodomestic sales ratios of 34 for all firms 33 for manufacturing firms and 38 for nonmanufacturing firms 45 in the same year pharmaceutical firms spent 122 billion on rd according to the nsf given that the average effective federal tax rate for the pharmaceutical industry was 32 in 2000 and assuming that the entire 122 billion in rd expenses was eligible for expensing the tax savings that year for the industry as whole attributable to irc section 174 may have totaled 39 billion46 g7g161g153g142g151g156g146g151g144g561g152g143g561g3g141g159g142g155g157g146g156g146g151g144g561g21g153g142g151g141g146g151g144g561 pharmaceutical firms also benefit from the tax treatment of outlays for business advertising under current law advertising expenses are deductible in the year when they are incurred if they pass two tests 1 they are reasonable in amount and 2 they relate to firms lines of business these expenses can serve the purposes of developing goodwill among customers or soliciting immediate sales there is clear parallel between the tax treatment of outlays for advertising and outlays for rd both are expensed it will be recalled that expensing leads to the taxing of any income generated by affected assets at marginal effective rate of zero in the case of advertising such tax treatment would be justified on economic grounds if advertising yielded benefits for firm lasting beyond the same year when it is done yet there is reason to think that some spending on advertisin g is equivalent to acquiring an intangible asset with an economic life greater than one year in certain markets including prescription drugs 43 estimates of the rate of depreciation for rd capital range from 15 to 30 per year see james r hines jr place like home tax incentives and the location of rd by american

the nsf definition of rd covers compensation for researchers and the cost of materials supplies and overhead 46 it should be noted that this tax savings would not necessarily change if the rd expenses had been depreciated according to formula reflecting the economic lives of the intangible assets they created but the savings would be spread out over longer period possibly number of years reducing

recognition and consumer loyalty and these assets have the potential to boost firms sales and sustain them at levels they might not otherwise attain for instance ernst r berndt and three colleagues found in 1994 study of the us market for antiulcer drugs that efforts by leading manufacturers to promote h 2antagonists prescription drugs to physicians through detailing and medical journal advertising had substantial effects on the growth of domestic demand for the drugs and the sellers market shares from 1977 to 1993 47 in reaching this conclusion they divided these marketing efforts into those aimed at expanding overall demand for h 2 antagonist drugs and those aimed at expanding the market shares of the leading sellers they then estimated that the cumulative value of the marketing intended to expand overall demand depreciated at rate of zero but that the cumulative value of the marketing intended to expand market shares depreciated at an annual rate of close to 40 48 other analysts have estimated that the depreciation rate for the intangible assets created by commercial advertising in general falls in the range of 20 to 3049 to the extent that advertising creates intangible assets with economic lives extending beyond one year the immediate deduction permitted by current tax law favors investment in advertising over investment in assets with longer tax lives what is uncertain however is the actual rate at which advertising loses economic value there is conflicting evidence about the economic life of advertising in general and the same evidence indicates that the depreciation rate may differ considerably by type of advertising eg television advertising magazine advertising radio advertising 50 as result it seems reasonable to conclude that it is uncertain to what extent the tax code subsidies investment in advertising pharmaceutical firms are likely to benefit more from the expensing of advertising expenditures because of their relatively strong propensity to invest in advertising in 2001 the pharmaceutical industry claimed deductions for advertising equaling 48 of business receipts for all industries the comparable ratio was 12 51 the industry claimed total deduction of 105 billion for advertising in 2001 yielding tax savings of 33 billion at the industrys average effective federal tax rate of 315 that year

through which the federal government influences the domestic climate for pharmaceutical innovation in theory tax law could bolster this climate by lowering firms user cost of capital and increasing its internal funds or retained earnings for such investment relative to other kinds of business investment 47 ernst r berndt linda bui david reiley and glen urban the roles of marketing product

owning tangible or intangible asset it embraces both the opportunity cost of passing up other investments and the direct costs of ownership such as depreciation the acquisition cost of the asset and taxes in general the user cost of capital indicates the rate of return an investment project must earn in order to be profitable as firms user cost of capital declines the number of investment projects it can profitably undertake increases all other things being equal empirical research indicates that business investment responds to changes in the user cost of capital although the magnitude and stability of the response over the course of the business cycle are subjects of ongoing debate and research among economists 52 one factor affecting the user cost of capital is the tax burden on the return to an investment firm makes generally the lower this burden the lowe r the cost of capital all other things being equal53 measure of this burden widely used by economists is the marginal effective tax rate this rate which is calculated by subtracting the aftertax rate of return on new investment from the pretax rate of return and dividing by the pretax rate of return reflects the statutory income tax rate faced by firm modified by any tax provisions that effectively reward and penalize the firm for making particular investment under current law the federal tax burden on the returns to rd investment could be relatively low because of two tax subsidies for such invest ment discussed earlier 1 the tax credit for increases in research spending above base amount under irc section 41 and 2 the option to expense qualified research outlays under irc section 174 in combination they raise the aftertax rate of return on rd investment relative to other investments firm could make such as purchases of plant or equipment or instituting new training program for employees in fact the combined effect of the credit and the expensing allowance is to subject the returns to rd investment to negative rate of taxation which is to say that aftertax rates of return exceed pre tax rates of return 54 the same two tax subsidies can also boost rd investment by increasing firms cash flow or supply of internal funds some firms base their annual rd budgets on the amount of money they expect to have on hand after paying all expenses in given year for them the cost of internal funds may be significantly lower than the cost of external funds such as money raised through borrowing or issuing new stock small startup firms are particularly likely to find themselves in this position because potential investors or lenders may lack the information needed to evaluate carefully their prospects for commercial success firms supply of internal funds depends on how much it earns in profits and how much of those profits it must set aside to pay its income tax liability firms that rely heavily on retained earnings to finance new rd investments should be able to invest more as their tax liabilities fall all other things being equal of course the increased cash flow could be used for many other purposes including hiring new employees training current employees or paying higher dividends to shareholders 52 harvey s rosen public finance 6th edition new york mcgrawhillirwin 2002 p 409 53 for discussion of the impact of taxes on the user cost of capital see jane g

on the incentive to invest in pharmaceutical rd but the seemingly weak effect of the research tax credit on domestic spending on this rd noted earlier see research tax credit does suggest that federal tax policy has little influence on this incentive better indicator of the link between tax policy and pharmaceutical innovation might be the pharmaceutical industry federal tax burden as measured by average effective tax rates in 2001 the industrys rate was nearly the same as the average rate for all industries nonetheless the average pharmaceutical firm spends much higher percentage of its revenue on rd than the average firm this contrast underscores the central role played by innovation in the growth and competitive dynamics of the pharmaceutical industry current tax law may have little impact on the incentive to invest in pharmaceutical rd but substantial increases in the industrys federal tax burden could affect its ability to invest in new drug development

whole or in part at influencing certain aspects of industry behavior by changing its tax treatment55 it is conceivable that some of their sponsors were responding to the widespread disaffection among americans with the pricing policies profitability and advertising strategies of the pharmaceutical industry many of these initiatives would have imposed tax penalties on pharmaceutical firms that failed to curb or jettison certain practices or that engaged in certain activities eg spending on directto consumer advertising few would have given these firms robust tax incentives to achieve certain desired objectives such as investing in domestic vaccine production only one of these measures hr 4520 became the focus of significant legislative action the house passed the bill by vote of 251 to 178 on june 17 2004 and the senate followed suit by approving an amended version by substituting the revenue language from s 1637 on july 15 2004 an agreement between the conferees from the house and senate was reached in early october and the house approved the agreement on october 7 followed by the senate on october 11 the version of hr 4520 signed into law by president bush does not include provision in the housepassed version modifying the orphan drug credit but it does contain number of provisions that have important implications for the future federal tax burden of the pharmaceutical industry such as phase out and repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion for exports phasedin deduction for income arising from domestic production and temporary sizable cut in
