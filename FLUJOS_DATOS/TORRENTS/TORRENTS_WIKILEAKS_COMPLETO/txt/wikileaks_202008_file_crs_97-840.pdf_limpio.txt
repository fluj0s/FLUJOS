yilmaz close behind the first government was shortlived coalition of archrivals yilmaz and ciller designed to avoid islamist rule when prime minister yilmaz refused to shield his partner ciller from parliamentary inquiries into her alleged corrup tion dyp pulled out of the coalition1 the second government was formed when ciller sought shelter in an unprecedented alliance with refah enabling islamists to head government for the first time in turkishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97840crs2 history refahs populist domes tic policies were not unlike t hose of its predecessors but its foreign policy was different as it tried to redirect turkey from its traditional ties with the west toward selected muslim countries including iran and libya when refah brought its domestic islamist agenda to the fore in early 1997 it provoked the military the constitutional guarantor of turkish seculari sm and sense of crisis befell the country on february 28 the militarydominated na tional security council issued series of ultimatums to the government demanding in itiatives to combat the threat of islamism erbakan stalled implementation and clung to power prompting the military to mobilize secular forces against the government to stay in office erbakan and ciller agreed to exchange positions and have the secularist ciller become prime minister this required the government to resign and president suleyman demirel to select ciller to form new government the government resigned in june but demirel chose mesut yilmaz not ciller to form government demirels action reflected the will of the military and of other secular elites he also resented the upstart ciller who had succeeded him as dyp party leader in 1993 gradually eased out hi s cronies and failed to heed his advice political situation the present government formed in ju ly 1997 is coalition of yilmazs anap bulent ecevits democratic left party dsp the fledgling democratic turkey party dtp formed by demirelsupported defect ors from the dyp and several independent deputies it is minority government depending on the s upport of deniz baykal of the leftist republican peoples party chp who chose to stay outside the government is seen as transition to early elections whic h yilmaz prefers to hol d in autumn 1998 after he creates record to present to the voters but may call sooner the political scene remains fluid the long desired merger of centerright parties to serve as bulwark against islamism is not in sight dyp appears to be disintegrating beneath ciller over 40 dyp deputies have defected to anap and dtp or became independent the ambitious dtp may be anaps new rival it is headed by former speaker husamettin cindoruk mirel ally whom ciller d outmaneuvered within the dyp he chose not to accept government pos t in order to build his party although dtps numbers in parliament are low it is growing and insists on equality in the governing partnership it obtained the defens portfolio and some other ministries and has been pressing yilmaz for closer c onsultation on bureaucra tic appointments yilmaz and the leftist ecevit are getting along better than yilmaz and his seemingly more natural centerright ally cindoruk ecevit former prime minister clearly relishes his return to power after 18 years and has emerged as the governments pre eminent foreign policy spokesman ecevit is deputy prime minister and his party holds the foreign ministry and other state min istries with foreig n affairs responsib ility for cyprus and central asia th left remains divided with rivals ecevit and

yilmaz is an unlikely standard bearer for secularism his personal convictions are unclear before the 1995 election yilmaz brought islamists back into the anap fold and struck an electoral alliance with the small islamist grand unity party bpp3 after the election yilmaz scuttled the co alition with ciller in orde r to expedite her political demise enabling refah to come to power yilmaz then competed with ciller for refahs favor and probably would have joined refahled government if ciller had not won that contest yilmaz was not prominent among the critics of refahs islamist agenda his government made secular edu cation its priority mainly because it was military demand some within anap criticize the deals that yilmaz struck to form the coalition they complain that ecevits dsp is
