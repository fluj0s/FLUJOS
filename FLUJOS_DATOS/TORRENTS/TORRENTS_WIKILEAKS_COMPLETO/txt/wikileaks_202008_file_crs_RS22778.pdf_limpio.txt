girls than boys enrolle d in secondary sc hools and universities1 in recent years latin american governments have implemented variety of programs to increase the supply of and dema nd for education in their countries many of which have specifically targeted disadvantaged students and school districts in general the success of those programs has hinged upon the accuracy of their targeting mechanisms in reaching the poorest most disadvantaged students one recent review of education interventions in latin america suggests that providing free textbooks and creating classroom libraries are the most costeffective ways to improve equity in education other interventions that are thought to be effectiv when implemented in poor districts are in service teacher training programs and tutoring programs for students free food distribution programs while showing positive effects on some learning outcomes are not regarded as particularly costeffective education interventions2 on the demand side many countries in latin america have successfully boosted enrollments by providing compensatory cash transfers to families in ex change for keeping their children in school remaining challenges despite these recent improvements latin americas education indicators still lag behind the developed world nd many developing countries of comparable income levels in east asia students from latin america tend to underperform on international assessment tests even when comparisons are limited to countries with similar income levels3 test scores on nationa l exams for students across all education levels remain low with students from rural poor afrodescendant and indigenous households having less access to quality education than the general population in brazil nonwhite students score significantly lower than white students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds on nati onal tests across the region indigenous people complete fewer years of schooling than nonindigenous people and have lower economic returns for each ear of schooling completed4 these gaps in access to quality education are most pervasive in countries with high levels of income inequality in addition to equity issues grade repetition and dropout ra tes are still high particularly at the secondary level with boys tending to have hi gher dropout rates than girls this problem is particularly pervas ive in the poorer countri of central america where dropout rates stood at roughly 52 in guatemala 53 in honduras and 41 in nicaragua in 20055 haiti the poorest country in th western hemisphere with

budgets to funding primary schools and subsidizing public universities rath er than secondary schools recent world bank study maintains that in order to reach secondary target enrollment rate of 85
