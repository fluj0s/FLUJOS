to fear of incrimination in fo reign countries and they have reached similar conclusions5 vacating and remanding the decision of the di strict court the c ourt of appeals said that granting the privilege to those who f ear foreign prosecution is consistent with the language of the fifth amendment with its aims and with the reasoning of the most relevant supreme court cases6 and therefore held that the petitioner may invoke the privilege7 in addition the court of ppeals concluded that inasmuch as the balsys visa application process in 1961 and the present portation investigation by osi are separate proceedings he did not waive the privilege by answering questions about his activities during world war ii when he co mpleted his visa application8 the supreme court granted the petition for certiorari in united states v balsys and on june 25 1998 reversed the court of appeal s and decided by 72 vote that witness may not invoke the fifth amendment privile ge against compelled

although gecas faces real and substantial risk of actually being convicted under foreign law based on the alleged conduct the fifth amendment does not protect against this risk20 the supreme court did not agree justice souter writing for the majority in balsys held that concern with foreign pros ecution is beyond the scope of the self incrimination clause21 the constitutional amendment regarding the selfincrimination clause states that person shall be co mpelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself22 the court noted that series of court decisions have extended the privilege of silence beyond criminal proceedin gs to civil and administrative proceedings as well23 however it has never said whether in any criminal case means possible prosecution outside the united states24 we are unable to dismiss the position of the united states in this case that domestic law enforcement would suffer serious consequences if fear of foreign prosecution were recognized as sufficient to invoke the privilege25 the court further stated since the likely gain to the witness fearin g foreign prosecution is thus uncertain the countervailing uncertainty about the loss of testimony to the united states cannot be dismissed as comparatively unimportant that some testimony will be lost is highly probable since the united states will not be able to guarantee immunity if testimony is compelled absent some sort of coope rative international arrangement that we cannot assume will occur while the cour t of appeals is doubtless correct that the expected consequences of some foreign pros ecutions may be so severe that witness will refuse to testify matter what not every foreign prosecution may measure up so harshly as against the expectable domes tic consequences of contempt for refusing to testify we therefore must suppose that on balsyss view some evidence will inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98490crs5 26id 27murphy 378 us at 7778 28balsys 66 uslw at 462021 29id at 4621 30id at

net result of the benefits and burdens that would follow from balsyss view would be scotch verdict if then precedent for the traditional view of the scope of the clause were not dispositive of the issue before us if extending the scope of the privilege were open to consideration we still would not find that balsys had shown that recognizing his claim would be sound resolution of the competing interests involved26 the court expressed concern for the fact that to recognize the protection as balsys requests based solely upon the threat or f ear of foreign prosecution would be contrary to the scope of protection which the selfincrimination clause recognizes the clause applies the principle that the privilege against selfincrimin ation protects state witness against incrimination under federal as well as stat law and federal witness against incrimination under stat as well as federal law27 pursuant to this principle federal and state jurisdiction are treated as one and the exclusionary rule created by the court prohibits the federal courts from using testimony compelled by state courts28 there is extension of this analogy and coopera tive balance regarding the selfincrimination principle to foreign courts and consequently there is basis for appealing to cooperative internati onalism by analogy to cooperative federalism29 the court noted that this does not preclude the r ecognition of cooperativ conduct between the united states and foreign nations whereby cl aim could be made fo r recognizing fear of foreign prosecution under the lfincrimination clause in the future but there is presentation of facts giving rise to such level of cooperative prosecution in this particular case30 justice breyer with whom justi ce ginsburg joined dissenting said this court has often found for example that the privilege recognizes the unseemliness the insult to human dignity created when person must convict himself out of his own mouth at its core the privilege reflects our fierce unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel choice of selfaccusation perjury or contempt the privilege can reflect this value and help protect against this indignityprotection that can be overcome by other needs and that value is less at stake where foreign but not domestic prosecution is at issue31httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98490
