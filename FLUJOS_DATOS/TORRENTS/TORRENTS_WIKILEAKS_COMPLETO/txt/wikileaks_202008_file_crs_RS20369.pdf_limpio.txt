specialist in american public law american law division summary the most significant capital punishment cases decided by the supreme court during the 199899 term did very little in terms of reversing the lower courts where the petitioners were the defendants at the trial level1 significantly among these cases the court settled splits in the circuits on issues of statutory interpretation and other trial related issues the court also made clear that withholding an element of an offense from jurys consideration can be harmless error in the strickler case the court gave some guidance on what materality means for purposes of the disclosure rule of brady v maryland additionally the court took its first look at the new federal death penalty statute decisions during the october 1998 term the four capital punishment decisions which were decided during the october 1998 term involved issues concerning 1 erroneous jury instructions prior to sentence of death 2 prosecutorial misconduct 3 jury instructions on consequences of deadlock in sentencing hearing conducted under the federal death penalty act of 1994 and 4 challenge to use of lethal gas over lethal injection as method of executionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20369crs2 2jones v united states 119 sct 2090 1999 calderon v coleman 119 sct 500 1998 3strickler v greene 119 s ct 1936 1999 4stewart v lagrand 119 s ct 1018 1999

constitutional error has occurred in the jury instructions at the penalty phase of capital proceeding it is not for determining whether the error is harmless after court determines that constitutional error occurred federal court sitting in habeas corpus review must go on to apply the substantial and injurious effect or influence test from brecht the majority confirmed the jury instruction at issue had to do with the governors authority to commute sentence of life imprisonment without parole the state had conceded that the jury instruction was erroneous and the majority did not review this conclusion however the majority pointed out that the precedent upon which the ninth circuit relied has not been approved by the supreme court and the decision in california v ramos 463 us 992 1983 constituted violation of the us constitution in capital jury instruction regarding the governors commutation authority in two cases2 the court rejected the defense arguments for specific jury instructions in the third3 the court decided that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused did not violate due process inasmuch as the accused failed to demonstrate the prejudice necessary to establish materiality in the fourth4 the court refused to entertain an action challenging the states use of lethal injection rather than the use of lethal gas calderon v coleman5 in 54 per curiam opinion the supreme court held that the ninth circuit erred in failing to apply the harmless error analysis of brecht v abrahamson6 to determine whether to grant habeas corpus relief to prisoner sentenced to death following an erroneous jury instruction about the power of the governor of california to commute sentence of life without possibility of parole under brecht relief may be granted only if the erroneous instruction had substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jurys sentence of death 7 this criterion insures that state will not be put to the arduous task of retrial based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error8 rather than pursue the brecht test the ninth circuit applied the boyde v california9 test to determine whether there is reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the challenged instruction in way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence10 the opinion indicated that this boyd analysis is not harmlesserror test at all but rather test for determining in the first instance whether constitutional error has occurred 11 the court returned the case for application

penalty act fdpa congress established procedures for imposing capital punishment for several federal capital crimes13 in what appeared to be the first case to be tried under the fdpa the issue was whether the submission of invalid nonstatutory exacerbating factors was properly found to be harmless14 and whether the jury should have been instructed that failure by it to agree on sentencing recommendation would automatically result in courtassessed sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release15 upon the jurys recommendation he was sentenced to death16 on appeal he complained inter alia of the district courts refusal to instruct the jury that sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release would be imposed if the jury could not agree on the proper sentence or if it agreed only that the sentence should not be less than life without possibility of release the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit read the statute as providing that in the event of deadlock on punishment second jury would be empaneled therefore the court of appeals held the requested instruction was properly denied17 the supreme court in 54 decision said the interpretation given the statute by the court of appeals was incorrect after providing for the courts imposition of sentence of death or life without possibility of release if the jury recommends section 3594 continues otherwise the court shall impose any lesser sentence that is authorized by law18 as the defendant argued the deadlock position is covered by the quoted language and not by section 3593b2cs provision for the empaneling of new jury if the first one is discharged for good cause said the majority19 the defendant did not prevail however on the constitutional issues on which his hopes for reversal depended the courts refusal to instruct the jury that the court would impose sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole if the jury was unable to reach unanimous agreement on sentence did not violate the eighth amendment20 the supreme court declined to exercise its supervisory power to require that an instruction on the consequences of deadlock be given in every capital case21 in this case the court gave the jury three options 1 it could by unanimous vote recommend the death penalty 2 the death penalty or life imprisonment without possibility of parole or 3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20369crs4 22id at 2100 23id 24id at 2102 25id at 2103 26id at 2104 27id at 2103 28id at 2108109 29119 s ct 1018 1999 30id at 1020 31id at 1021some other lesser

error even though lesser sentence was not authorized in this case24 there is reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instructions incorrectly25 the instructions read in their entirety were not misleading as to the consequences of the jurys failure to reach unanimous verdict26 any confusion over the effect of lesser sentence recommendation was allayed by the courts instruction that the jury should not concern itself with such matters27 loose drafting of nonstatutory aggravating factors was harmless error if it constituted error at all28 stewart v lagrand29 in 1984 the petitioner and his brother were convicted in an arizona court of capital crime and were sentenced to die in the gas chamber which was the only method of execution at that time provided by arizona law the petitioner did not challenge the method of execution on direct appeal or in his petition for state post conviction relief by the time of his current petition the state had changed its law to provide that death sentences will be carried out by means of lethal injection unless the prisoner opts for lethal gas the petitioner exercised his option in favor of gas and challenged that method of execution as violative of the eighth amendment s cruel and unusual punishnment clause the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued an order restraining the state from executing the petitioner by means of gas it did not stay the execution but it ruled that he could not be executed under death warrant that allowed him to choose gas as an execution method the court relied on its reasoning in an opinion it issued just days before in the case of the petitioner s brother who has since been executed in that opinion the court noted that the constitutional challenge was not available at the time the petitioner defaulted in the state court and held that in light of circuit precedents eighth amendment protections could not be waived in capital cases30 in per curiam opinion the court held that the petitioner waived any objection he might have had to the constitutionality of execution by lethal gas31 the petitioner also procedurally defaulted by failing to raise the claim on direct appeal after having been sentenced to death by lethal gas prior to the states adoption of the lethal injectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20369crs5 32id 33id 34id 1020 35federal republic of germany v united states

capital context would violate the new rule prohibition of teague v lane 489 us 288 1989 the supreme court noted34 the companion decision stemmed from germanys effort to obtain enforcement of an ex parte order by the international court of justice directing the united states to prevent the scheduled execution35 germany claimed that lagrand german national should have been informed at the time of his arrest that the vienna convention gave him the right to contact the german consulate the supreme court held that the united states did not waive its sovereign immunity and it is doubtful that article iii 2 cl 2 which extends jurisdiction to cases affecting ambassadors and consuls provides an anchor for the action36 the federal republics suit against the state of arizona as was paraguays suit against virginia in breard v greene37 is without evident support in the vienna convention and in probable contravention of the eleventh amendment38 strickler v greene39 the petitioner was convicted of kidnapping college student and killing her the evidence linking the petitioner to the crime included physical evidence and the testimony of an eyewitness by the name of anne stolzfus the prosecution failed to disclose evidence which consisted of notes made by detective during interviews he had with stolzfus and letters she sent to the detective this evidence cast doubt on the detailed testimony she gave at the trial the prosecut or permitted the defense to see everything in his file except for some documents which were not in the file the documents surfaced after the affirmance of the petitioners conviction and the denial of the state postconviction relief when the federal district court ordered that the files be made available to the petitioners counsel the district court subsequently vacated petitioners capital murder conviction and death sentence on the grounds that the state had failed to disclose those materials and that petitioner had not in consequence received fair trial the fourth circuit reversed because the petitioner had procedurally defaulted his brady claim by not raising it at his trial or in the state collateral proceedings in addition the fourth circuit concluded that the claim was in any event without merit the supreme court held that virginia did not violate the rule derived from brady v maryland that suppression by the prosecution of

defendants role in the crime than her later testimony could have been used by the defendant to impeach her credibility42 the petitioners procedural default in not raising the brady claim in state courts is excused by an adequate showing of cause and prejudice43 the petitioner did in fact rely on the prosecut ions open file policy and on assurances that everything known to the government had been disclosed44 the petitioner could not however establish the basic brady violation45 two of the three components of violation were established 1 the evidence was favorable to the accused and 2 was suppressed by the state46 the petitioner failed however to demonstrate the prejudice necessary to establish materiality because he failed to show that there is reasonable probability that his conviction or sentence would have been different if the materials had been disclosed47 even if the witness had been severely impeached there was other evidence in the record lending strong support for the conclusion that the petitioner still would have been convicted and sentenced to death48 furthermore the testimony in question did not relate to the petitioners eligibility for the death sentence and was not relied upon by the prosecution in its closing argument during the penalty phase of the trial49
