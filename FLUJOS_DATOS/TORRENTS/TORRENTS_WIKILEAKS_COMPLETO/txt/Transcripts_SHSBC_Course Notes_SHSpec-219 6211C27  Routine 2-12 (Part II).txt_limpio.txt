6211c27 shspec219 routine 212 part ii lrh has been auditing r212 for about eighteen months now and he has made all the mistakes the procedure as now released is the nomistake way to do it as an invariable action even when it is done perfectly it will occasionally lay an egg why because you might pick up an item on the first assessment that isnt part of gpm and the cleanup that it gets on tiger drilling may not clean it up entirely in that case you are currying dead horse ie you are not going anywhere the source of the dead horse is some withholds or something on the item when it is not part of the gpm what is dead horse it is list whether represent or an oppose list that contains wide slams after you have gotten midruds in for the session if you have gotten nothing but dirty reads and dirty needles and nothing has slammed by the time you get up to fifty items you will lay an egg the best thing to do is to carry it to fifty items and if there is slam abandon it the likeliest way to get dead horse list is wrong assessment the auditor doesnt check if he is in doubt about read he missed reads arc breaks the pc etc you can also have an item reading on an arc break because the pc doesnt understand the word the emeter is reality indicator another way to get misassessment is for the auditor to misduplicate what the pc said on listing and to write down something else then when the auditor assesses it the pc will protest it since it is not what he intended if you dont understand what the pc said you have to get it understood even if he arc breaks every time you ask him the way you ask pc to repeat something is to take responsibility for not understanding in way that doesnt challenge the pc you can ask him to spell it thats fine unless he cant spell do not repeat the item after the pc it will drive him around the bend it can make him feel like he is spinning and it tends to shut him up dont ask did you say _______ that causes him to protest and can leave mark on the list it also looks like you are correcting him also never point to an item on list dont ever point towards pc anyway cf not pushing in anchor points the thetan will put his theta beams against that finger and his theta beams will get bent this includes pointing to list items it makes wrong items stay in pc must be able to put anything on list but he must never be allowed to take anything off if he wants word changed take it down and add it as new separate item eg the pc says oh that should be cow and not the cow acknowledge and add cow to the list at the bottom of the list and leave the cow on the list if you null list that has given you persistent dirty needle and then oppose that you wont wind up with much the invariable actions of r212 eliminate that pretty well if you are listing on list and nothing is slamming get your midruds in but dont get them in when the pc originates if the auditor isnt sure whether or not he is doing it right and has guilty conscience about it that auditor is very vulnerable because he thinks he might be committing overts therefore he tends to withdraw from his pcs even an auditor who is doing letterperfect auditing can be shaken up by pc who snarls about midruds being put in treat this as an origin when the pc is protesty keep him talking dont punish him with the missed withhold question but get it handled sneakily by finding what you havent found out about his state of mind or something then go ahead and get the midruds in that is the way to handle this situation not with q and the next big source of dead horses is an incomplete list if the pc says that last item he gave you is it that is sure sign that the list is incomplete and that there is slamming item coming up dont quit listing when the pc tells you that the last item he gave you was it what he means is that is the last safe item the list is incomplete and the rock slam is just over the horizon and the pc has chickened out dont ever quit until the list is complete the pc will never forgive you for not getting the item however much he protests further listing so get the list done that is the only road out unless the pc has legitimate beef for instance if the pc insists that an item is reading on protest check protest clean it up and recheck it dont take items from what the pc is giving you as protest or 2wc that is robbing the pc in the process of listing list you are liable to run into dwindling or sporadic rock slam if you dont get an item that slams while listing you dont have list the classic dwindling rock slam is common dont stop listing just because the rock slam stops you can get midruds in and ask the question you are listing from to see if it reads that is not certain but it is good indicator the proof that list is incomplete is that when you are nulling and the needle is dirty when you ask did you think of something the pc gives you something that doesnt clean up the needle if you find yourself having to keep using this question to clean the needle it is an indicator that the list is incomplete it also invites more items the pcs arc breaks about not completing the list do not stem from the auditor or auditing flubs they come entirely from the pcs unwillingness to confront when list is complete the pc will be willing to go on listing forever he only balks when the list is incomplete so any balk by pc is an indication of an incomplete list so you keep going on list until you dont have to get midruds in to null it on assessing list two consecutive items in almost always means that the midruds have gone out the list will be more than ten to twenty items long but some pcs go for long lists 500 items or so 80150 items is more usual anything that restrains pc or keeps him from giving complete list will wreck r212 as well as 3gaxx the more you harass or worry pc the less you will get done dont ever yap at pc about his dirty needle it does good never stop pc from listing you can get as many as three dwindling rock slams from one item there is an accidental on list one since you didnt just do list midruds arent in so get them in before you assess list one one reason not to let the pc add items to list one is that once you start the pc is listing and you will have to let him list it out or you will have dirty needle so just dont start in r212 what you are trying to do is to find tag first in scientology then in the present time environment off of gpm that is hooked into pt by the nature of the bank you are doing this because if it is there the pc has chronic ptp recognize that the other side of the package the side that opposes the pt item is keyed in all the time recognize also that it is lie to say that it is in pt it is only keyed in to pt the moment you start your represent list the pc will fly out of pt thats fine on represent what else is there to list on the represent list very likely the pc will go back track recall 1 identities 2 similarities 3 differences see p 198 above the pc has the gpm mass identified with pt item the ptp is in pt because of aaa the gpm item is identified with the item in pt minds being what they are when you represent anything you are peeling identifications off of it this is not true of opposing listing is auditing by taking anything someone is worried about and by representing items the pc will see similarities instead of identities get the represent off first that helps him differentiate you could do this as an assist not even on the meter using eg what does bellyache represent to you also many pt items dont have opposites you need the represent step for them also in fact any time you say who or what would _______ you are really doing represent list so it is therapeutic because it separates out items it separates what is true from what is false the more identified person is with something the more items will come off of that thing as you list or null you are auditing like crazy this is solid auditing and about the soundest and most condensed auditing you can do it produces the most gain per auditing hour so long lists are lots of auditing every time you null you are differentiating done right getting items it is fantastic
