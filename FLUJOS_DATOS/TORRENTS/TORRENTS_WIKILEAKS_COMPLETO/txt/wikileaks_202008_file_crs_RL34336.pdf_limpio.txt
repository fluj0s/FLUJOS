foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division september 3 2008 abstract sovereign wealth funds swfs are investment funds owned and managed by national governments such funds currently manage between 19 and 29 trillion and are expected to grow to over 12 trillion by 2015 this is due to the rapid growth of commodity prices and large trade surpluses in several emerging market economies during the second half of 2007 interest in swfs increased as asian and middle eastern swfs fueled by surging foreign exchange reserves invested large sums of capital in us and other western companies policy makers in the united states have raised two broad policy concerns about swfs 1 their lack of transparency and 2 their possible misuse for political or other noncommercial goals hearings have been held by several congressional committees including the house financial services committee and the senate foreign relations and senate banking committees in response to these concerns many analysts and policy makers are evaluating the operations of existing swfs and are looking to the international ﬁnancial institutions such as the international monetary fund world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development to establish guidelines for swf operations all of these institutions are currently developing proposals that will be deliberated during

owned and managed by national governments such funds currently manage between 19 and 29 trillion and are expected to grow to over 10 trillion by 2015 this is due to the rapid growth of commodity prices and large trade surpluses in several emerging market economies beginning in 2007 interest in swfs increased as asian and middle eastern swfs fueled by surging foreign exchange reserves invested large sums of capital in us and other western companies policy makers in the united states have raised two broad policy concerns about swfs 1 their lack of transparency and 2 their possible misuse for political or other noncommercial goals hearings have been held by several congressional committees including the house financial services committee and the senate foreign relations and senate banking committees swfs pose complex challenge for policy makers on one hand swfs are longterm investment vehicles looking beyond quarterly results and therefore serve as stable funding sources during financial turbulence on the other hand however there are operational concerns stemming from government control ie lack of transparency and possible noncommercial investment goals without transparency it is difficult to attain clear picture of swf investment activity lack of swf transparency can also obscure governance and riskmanagement problems within swfs many are also concerned that countries will use swfs to support what one analyst has called state capitalism using governmentcontrolled assets to secure stakes around the world in strategic areas such as telecommunications energy and mineral resources and financial services among other sectors in response to these concerns many analysts and policy makers are evaluating the operations of existing swfs and are looking to the international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development to establish guidelines for swf operations all of these institutions are currently developing proposals that will be deliberated during 2008 this report will be updated as events warrant

funds swfs are investment funds owned and managed by national governments originally created in the 1950s by oil and resourceproducing countries to help stabilize their economies against fluctuating commodity prices and to provide source of wealth for future generations they have proliferated considerably in recent years although their lack of transparency makes estimating swf investment levels difficult it is estimated that they currently manage between 19 and 29 trillion 1 estimates of their growth over the next several years vary with the consensus hovering around morgan stanleys projection of 10 trillion by 20152 early estimates were higher but it appears that the global financial crisis has led swf growth to slow due to losses by swfs on the value of their existing portfolios lower commodity prices and the likelihood that some developing countries will tap into their swf resources for domestic purposes swfs can be funded through variety of means including profits from the sale of commodities such as oil or current account surplus swfs can be established to serve several different objectives these may include diversifying national assets stabilizing the domestic economy against volatile commodity prices saving for future generations getting better return on investment than traditional foreign exchange reserves and promoting political or strategic interests the dramatic recent increase in swf activity has raised concerns about this relatively unexamined class of international investors this report provides background on swfs including what countries operate swfs and the size of th swf market and discusses two broad areas of concern to members of congress and the international financial community governance and transparencyrelated issues and possible noncommercial investment goal s including the potential use of governmentcontrolled investment vehicles to attain global strategic and political goals some us policy makers stress that their concerns about swfs are not meant to undermine the us commitment to open investment they maintain that the united states is one of the most open economies in the world and note that foreign investment in the united states provides many benefits including lower interest rates increased employment productivity and access to capital for american enterprise indeed for countries such as the united states which have both high national budget deficit and historically low levels of public savings foreign investment has been crucial 3 1 all figures are in us dollars 2 stephen jen swfs growth

is direct consequence of the massive accumulation of global foreign reserve assets over the past decade while reserve accumulation has occurred in many emerging market economies it has been especially sharp among oil producers and asian countries that have large tradesurpluses with the united states and other developed countries in these countries reserves have swelled to levels far in excess of the amount needed for balance of payments support thus presenting an opportunity for foreign exchange reserve managers to maximize returns foreign exchange reserves are traditionally invested in lowrisk assets such as us treasury bills but their recent growth has seen an increasing shift of excess reserves to higherrisk higherreturn investments in contrast to traditional foreign exchange reserves swfs invest in much broader array of assets including stocks bonds fixed assets commodities derivatives and alternative investments such as real estate and hedge funds like private hedge funds and government pension funds swfs often rely on outside expertise and professional fund managers 4 two key forces drove congressional interest in swfs during the 110th congress 1 the introduction of new funds and 2 major acquisitions by existing swfs following large losses by western financial institutions from the us subprime mortgage crisis many point to the september 29 2007 launch of the new china in vestment corporation ltd cic with 200 billion of capital as catalyst of the initial western interest in swfs 5 while swfs represent small percentage of all investment classes globally their rapid and projected growth could increase demand for riskier assets including equities and bonds deutsche bank estimates that future swf asset allocation could lead to gross capital inflow of over 1 trillion into global equity markets and 15 trillion into global debt markets over the coming five years 6 merrill lynch using more aggressive assumptions estimates that 31 to 6 trillion is likely to be invested in riskier assets by swfs in the next five years7 while swf investments peaked during the financial crisis in 20078 with many foreign swfs taking large stakes in western financial institutions it appears that the pace of investments has tailed off

assets and which manages those assets separately from the official reserves of the monetary authorities the central bank and reserverelated functions of the finance ministry9 the us treasury departments definition is meant primarily to distinguish swf investment from official reserves managed by countrys central bank because the primary goals of official foreign reserves are liquidity and security the investment horizon for these for reserves is short some observers provide more detailed definition of swfs stephen jen currency analyst at morgan stanley expands on the treasury definition to provide broader understanding of swfs and how they differ from official foreign reserves and other governmentsponsored funds according to jen there are five key traits of swfs they are 1 sovereign government entities with 2 high foreign currency exposures 3 explicit liabilities such as national state pension fund 4 highrisk tolerances and 5 long investment horizons 10 the imf divides swfs into several categories based on their stated goals in practice however many swfs combine elements of the following three categories the three primary types of swfs according to the imf are as follows 1 stabilization funds v olatile international market prices are primary concern for resource and commodityintensive economies some commodities face price fluctuations of an average of 2025 per year to mitigate this volatility several countries have established funds to sterilize capital inflows 11 and stabilize fiscal revenues because stabilization funds serve more immediate function than longterm savings funds they tend to be more conservative in their investment decisions focusing on fixed income rather than equity investments12 examples include russias stabilization fund of the russian federation and kazakhstans national oil fund 2 savings funds savings funds are intended to share wealth across generations for countries rich in natural resources savings funds convert nonrenewable natural resources into diversified portfolio of international financial assets to provide for future generations or other longterm objectives according to the imf while newer oil funds predominantly focus on stabilization objectives the recent increase in oil prices has allowed swfs to emphasize savings objectives because savings funds have longer investment hori zons than pure stabilization funds they invest in broader range of assets including bonds and equities as well as other forms of alternative investments such as real estate private equity hedge funds and commodities examples include the abu dhabi investment authority kuwait in vestment authority singapores government investment corporation and the china investment corporation 9 report to congress on international

wealth fund morgan stanley research october 25 2007 11 currency sterilization is form of monetary action in which countrys central bank attempts to insulate itself from the foreign exchange market to counteract the effects of changing monetary base by selling or buying the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the value of the domestic currency for more information see

funds established to reduce the opportunity cost of holding excess foreign reserves or to pursue investment policies with higher returns reserve investment corporations adapt more aggressive investment strategies including taking direct equity stakes these funds typically seek higher returns than other swfs and use leverage ie debt in their investments historically theses vehicles tend to be more secretive than other swfs that are primarily portfolio investors13 examples of such funds are singapores temasek qatars invest ment authority and abu dhabis mubadala14 among funds there are substantial differences in riskreturn profiles investment horizons asset allocation eligible instruments risk tolerances and constraints15 because each fund is different and has varying goals and objectives it is difficult to generalize about the investment strategies of swfs as class for example an oilexporting economy may initially establish swf for stabilization purposes however if the assets under management by the swf grow to exceed the levels needed for stabilization the country may either change the priorities and investment strategy of the fund or establish separate f und with more aggressive investment approach thus several countries have multiple sovereign wealth funds for example the united arab emiratess primary fund the abu dhabi investme nt authority adia was established in 1974 to invest surplus cash in assets that provide steady gains and returns over long timehorizon using portfolio investment strategy in 2002 the united arab emirates established mubadala development to pursue direct investment projects targeted at higher returns g25g145g138g157g561g5g152g158g151g157g155g146g142g156g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g142g561g21g25g8g156g501g561 the first swf was established by kuwait in 1953 as means to help stabilize the economy from fluctuating oil prices16 in 1956 the gilbert islands now kiribati established the revenue equalization reserve fund to manage profits from phosphate mining following kuwait and kiribati the next major swfs were created in the 1970s in the wake of the oil shock the most recent wave began in the 1990s with the norw ay government pension fundglobal in 1990 and continues to this day in the last five years funds have been established by china iran russia qatar and the united arab emirates as noted previously the recent growth of swfs is consequence of rapid growth in emerging market reserves driven by 1 the impact of rising oil prices for middle eastern economies and 2 large trade surpluses net foreign direct investment flows and high savings rates among asian economies reserve accumulation has been especially sharp in the case of china where there has been extensive intervention in the foreign exchange markets to limit the yuans appreciation against the dollar 17 13 similar entities to swfs that raise many of the same concerns are statebacked companies engaged in foreign acquisitions for example in 2005 an attempt by the ch ina national offshore oil cooperation cnooc to purchase the us energy company unocal raised substantial congressional concerns and was eventually abandoned for

funds do not disclose much information about their operations and assets the funds believed to be the largest do not disclose their size investment strategies or current holdings estimates for the size of the largest fund the united arab emirates adia for example range widely between 500 and 900 billion reportedly adia has achieved 20 rate of return for many years and rarely considers deals less than 100 million 18 official and private sector analysts estimate that there is between 19 and 29 trillion under management by swfs this is significantly smaller than other investment classes figure 1 figur 1 segments of the global capital mark et usd t rillion 2007 source norges ba nk however analysts expect that if oil prices re main and there immediate correction of current global imbalances swfs will grow rapidly over the next few years morgan stanley estimates that if foreign reserves continue to increase at current pace they could grow to 12 trillion by 201519 several

the senate banking committee on november 13 2007 senator evan bayh in neatly summarized the two primary concerns about swf activity in the united states and the challenge they present lack of transparency that characterizes many sovereign wealth funds undermines the theory of efficient markets at the heart of our economic system in addition unlike private investors pension funds and mutual funds government ownedentities may have interests that will take precedence over profit maximization just as the united states has geopo litical interests in addition to financial ones so do other countries just as we value some things more than money so do they why should we assume that other nations are driven purely by financial interests when we are not 23 the political challenges facing us leaders are aptly summarized by senator charles schumer ny right now the us finds itself in difficult position some of our financial institutions have made mistakes and need capital so were shor t of capital because of the credit crunch and in the longer run because of our own habits we import more than we export we consume more than we save the best choice would be that financial institutions could raise capital within the us but we dont have that choice so they raise capital from where it exists and sovereign wealth funds are the most available form of capital right now or financial institutions can dramatically shrink and we can lose thousands and thousands of jobs the choice is simple one and the issue with sovereign wealth funds can be defined in single sentence because they are governmentowned noneconomic factors may influence their decisionmaking and the pressure they put on companies that they own piece of 24 given these concerns congressional attention on swfs has focused on two broad areas namely 1 the lack of swf transparency and 2 the potential use of swf capital for strategic or political ie noncommercial purposes these concerns as applied to specific swfs are mapped in figure 3 the x axis illustrates fund transparency or levels of disclosure the axis measures the active or strategic nature of their stated or perceived investment philosophy for example the funds of norway alaska and alberta canada are conventionally invested in wide range of investments and are highly transparent malaysias swf and singapores temasek while also highly transparent pursue more strategic approach to their investments targeting various industries that are of interest to their respective governments the funds in the upperleft quadrant are of most concern to western policy makers these are the funds that disclose the least information about their funds and are the most strategic in their investment philosophy third issue that has sparked some congressional interest is how the united states taxes gains on investments in the united states made by swfs continued 6 senate foreign relations committee hearing sovereign wealth funds foreign policy consequences

projected growth of swfs many analysts stress the need for increased transparency of swf activity there are supranational regulations or disclosure requirements for the size of swfs their investment strategies or their current holdings unlike privately owned nationally regulated funds swfs are not required to provide information to stockholders and stakeholders in terms of disclosure on fund performance investment strategy or even basic philosophy many swfs rank below the most secretive hedge fund according to gary kleiman senior partner at kleiman international consultants an emerging financial markets consulting group 25 of the existing national funds only norways fund is universally considered to be transparent and publically accountable minimal swf transparency masks swf investment activity and can obscure governance and riskmanagement problems within the funds this can have distressing consequences for policy makers first without insight into swf activity it is difficult to assess systemic risks or to determine whether swfs are in fact pursuing strategic noncommercial investment strategies see next section second limited disclosure makes it difficult to assess the management and governance of the funds and therefore difficult to identify mismanagement or corruption by fund mangers conflating this problem many of these swfs are established in countries that currently lack the underpinnings for good swf governance or swf oversight this is of concern to policy makers because sizable failures due to poor management particularly if concentrated within certain sectors could affect national or global markets 25 tony tassell and joanna chung the 2500 question financial times may 25 2007

transparency the peterson institute of international economics iie has tabulated swf scorecard that among other variables looks at transparency and accountability26 for its transparency and accountability figure iie scored several questions including the following do regular reports on the investments by the swf include the size of the fund information on the returns it earns do reports provide information on the types of investments information on the geographic location of investments information on the specific investments for example which instruments countries and companies information on the currency composition of investments is the swf subjected to regular audit is the audit published is the audit independent consistent with figure 2 above the iie found that the largest funds ie those owned by the united arab emirates qatar kuwait and china scored very low on the transparency and accountability rankings

creation government control could mean that swf may be motivated by noncommercial considerations in its investment decisions felix rohatyn prominent investment ba nker and former us official has noted that for many funds political and commercial objectives are closely intertwined according to mr rohatyn they are making investments that they probably think are ok but not spectacular27 however for these funds there has to be political objective over and above the rate of return28 many us policy makers are concerned that countries will use swfs to support what one analyst has called state capitalism using governmentcontrolled assets to secure strategic stakes around the world in areas such as telecommunications energy resources and financial services among other sectors 29 recent deals in the energy and finance sector suggest that securing access to natural resources and developing domestic financial markets appear to be the two primary swf strategic objectives30 26 edwin m truman

purely to achieve financial returns and portfolio diversification while others have broader economic or social agenda31 such an agenda could be benign many countries have expressed their interest in

specifically longstanding exemption from us income tax that applies to certain passive investments made by swfs and other investments made by foreign sovereigns under section 892 of the us internal revenue code foreign governments are exempted from income tax on certain passive investments in the united states thus foreign governments income from investments in the united states in stocks bonds and other domestic securities financial instruments held in the execution of governmental fiscal or monetary policy and interest on deposits in us banks are exempt from us tax section 892 also carves an exception for income derived from commercial activity by foreign government or foreigncontrolled commercial entity the gains on passive investment however is not considered by the us internal revenue service irs as commercial activity in march 2008 senators max baucus and chuck grassley chairman and ranking member of the senate committee on finance requested that the joint committee on taxation jtc nonpartisan housesenate committee of the us congress undertake study to analyze the history current rules and policy underpinnings of the us tax rules applicable to us investment by foreign governments including investments made by sovereign wealth funds 32 the jtcs final report found that treatment as foreign sovereign imparts limited but significant advantages to foreign governments over foreign private investors according to the jtcs final report in practice some of the most important statutory us income tax advantages that foreign sovereign investor enjoys over foreign private investor are exemption from us withholding tax on all us source dividends paid by noncontrolled corporations exemption from us withholding tax on interest paid by corporation where the foreign sovereign owns at least 10 so the general portfolio interest exemption is not available but less than 50 so the payor is not controlled by the foreign sovereign of the payor and exemption from

as foreign private investors are victor fleischer law professor at the university of illinois has proposed that the baseline tax rate on any swf investment in the united states could be raised to equal the flat 30 rate on income from passive investment levied on foreign individuals or corporations according to prof fleischer this approach would raise significant amounts of tax revenue and it would give the us new policy lever to achieve nontax objectives such as encouraging swfs to comply with best practices of transparency disclosure and accountability 34 to date legislation has been introduced that would move to remove the tax exemption granted foreign swfs

legislation that specifically regulates sovereign wealth funds as unique class of investors however certain sectors of the american economy such as the financial sector telecommunications energy among others have statuary limitations on the types and amounts of investments in which nonamerican individuals and entities can participate in addition the united states has legislation that allows the

is the bank holding company act which regulates bank holding company that is any company that controls an american bank mean ing any bank chartered by the federal or state government to do business in the united states it is important to distinguish between bank holding companies from foreign banks which are chartered in their home countries but do business in the united states the bank holding company act defines control of bank or bank holding company as follows the acquisition of 25 share or more of any class of voting securities controlling the election of majority of the directors or trustees or having been determined by the federal reserve to be exercising controlling interest over the management or policies of the entity the law presumes that any company which owns controls or has power to vote less than 5 of any class of voting securities of given bank or bank holding company does not have control over that bank or company 34 victor fleischer taxing sovereign wealth funds

member board led by the secretary of the treasury to review certain foreign investment and determine whether such investment raises national security threat to the united states and then make recommendation to the president whether or not to prohibit the transaction36 by law cfius can review covered transactions which includes any merger acquisition or takeover by any foreign person which could result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states the statutory limitation on mergers acquisitions andor takeovers appears to lead to the conclusion that cfius is not legally required to review the types of transactions that sovereign wealth funds have invested in to date however if sovereign wealth funds were to begin assuming ownership stakes of american companies in critical sectors there may be larger role for cfius in reviewing their transactions in the future

time noting that they are increasingly important participants in the international financial system and that our economies can benefit from openness to swf investment flows the final g7 communique for the meeting stated that the imf world bank and the oecd should explore best practices for swfs in key areas such as institutional structure risk management transparency and accountability 37 secretary

maintains open investment policies is in the best interest of countries that have these funds and countries in which they invest the imf is uniquely positioned to identify best practices for swfs building on the existing guidelines for foreign exchange reserve management best practices would provide multilateral guidance to new funds on how to make sound decisions on how to structure themselves mitigate any potential systemic risk and help demonstrate to critics that swfs can be constructive responsible participants in the international financial system recipient countries of swf investment also have responsibility to maintain openness to investment and should work through the oecd to develop best practices for inward governmentcontrolled investment 38 to address concerns related to the lack of swf transparency some have called for an international body such as the imf to establish guidelines and monitor countries compliance with transparency efforts proponents maintain that increased transparency would limit the potential negative impact of greater swf investment by allowing financial markets to better observe swf activity and exercise any necessary market discipline edwin truman of the peterson institute for international economics argued during november 2007 senate banking committee hearings on swfs that the development of set of best practices for sovereign wealth funds and similar understandings covering other crossborder government investments offers the most promising way to increase the accountability of these activities which are likely to increase in relative importance over the next decade the associated increase in transparency which is means to the end of greater accountability would help to reduce the mysteries and misunderstandings surrounding these governmental activities at the same time the environment for them would become more stable and predictable 39 during the october 20 2007 g7 finance ministers meeting us treasury secretary henry paulson hosted an outreach dinner with top swf managers from around the world to begin the process of negotiating increased levels of swf transparency there appears to be some positive reception from leading swfs according to dr tony tan executive director of singapores gic we believe there is case for further disclosure on the part of sovereign wealth funds in the interest of transparency such disclosure can include clarity on the relationship between the funds and the respective governments their investment objectives and general strategies and their internal governance and risk management practices any guidelines on sovereign wealth funds should encourage them to opera according to commercial principles with longterm orientation free from political motivations singapore will participate in formulating set of principles and best practices for sovereign wealth funds 40 38 statement by henry m paulson jr secretary of the us treasury

roundtable of sovereign asset and reserve managers at the meeting delegates from 28 countries discussed how best to address the policy and operational issues faced by managers of growing reserves and sovereign assets41 the imfs work agenda on swfs was approved at meeting of the imf executive board which includes representatives from both sovereign investors and recipients of sovereign wealth on march 21 2008 g22g145g142g561g21g138g151g157g146g138g144g152g561g18g155g146g151g140g146g153g149g142g156g561g561 in september 2008 following four months of negotiations and several international meetings members of the newly formed international working group of sovereign wealth funds agreed to voluntary code of conduct at meetings in santiago chile 42 although voluntary guidelines may likely help policy makers better understand the motives and methods of existing and emerging swfs it is unclear whether the voluntary guidelines will satisfy western governments which had sought more restrictive rules requiring greater swf transparency reportedly the debate of how much financial transparency swfs should provide was one of the more contentious issues in the working group while some countries agreed that greater transparency would allay concerns that swfs may use their wealth for noneconomic reasons and also reassure domestic constituents that the national wealth is being appropriately invested many countries insisted that swfs be allow to maintain high degree of secrecy regarding their operations 43 the chairman of the australian fund board of guardians david murray chaired subgroup of the iwg responsible for drafting the principles the group met three times in oslo singapore and the final meeting in singapore where on september 2 2008 the iwg agreed on set of voluntary principles the generally accepted principles and practices for sovereign wealth funds gapp or santiago principles the santiago principles are comprised of 24 principles and additional subprinciples in three broad categories 1 legal framework objectives and macroeconomic linkages 2 institutional framework and governance and 3 investment policies and risk management frameworks see box while country endorsement and adherence to the santiago principles is voluntary and must be ratified by authorities in each national country by committing to financial objectives and guidelines for increased transparency and disclosure of investments the creation of the santiago principles appears to be the beginning of the normalization of swfs as global institutional investors 41 imf
