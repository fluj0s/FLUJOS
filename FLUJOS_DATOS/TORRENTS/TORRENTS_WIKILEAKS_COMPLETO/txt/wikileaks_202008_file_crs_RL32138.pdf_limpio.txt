insurers are now regulated by the 50 states since the 107th congress committees in both houses of congress have considered whether that framework of insurance regulation meets the demands of the marketplace and the needs of businesses and individuals key issue is the relative merit of fede ral regulation of the insurance industry compared to the current statebased regula tion less emphasized but also significant are the differences that arguably exist am ong kinds of insurance for the industry is hardly monolithic there ar also fundamental policy issues concerning why and how each kind of insurance might be regula ted and about what na tional interests may be involved in resolving these questions this report discusses federal regulati on of insurers whether optional or mandatory in that broader context to assist that discussion it traces the evolving rationale for regulation gene rally explains insurers roles as risk managers and financial intermediaries and reviews briefly important aspects of the major lines of insurance many economists and scholars now generally agree that competitive markets can allocate resources including capital more effectively than regulation empirical studies have cast some doubt on common rationale for insurance regulation ie that insurance is public utility and that regulators can achieve socially optimal pricing and socially desirable pricing studies have also shown that the insurance market is competitive courts have so narrowed its antitrust exemption that it functions competitively managing risk of financia l loss is fundamental to th us economy insurance is one way to manage risk for businesses there are economic substitutes for insurance insurers serve the us econom as financial intermediaries like banks and their investment portfolios are significant different kinds of insurance can be cl assified in several ways one option when considering why or how to regulate is to classify by whether the purchaser is business or an individual businesses ma not need the same level of regulatory protection that individuals might this report will be updated in the ev ent of major legislative

considerations introduction the power to regulate insurance currently rests primarily with the individual states this primacy however has been slowly decreasing over time congress has become increasingly involved in regula ting insurance and in overseeing states regulation of insurance and the corpor ate national association of insurance commissioners naic has assumed national role1 insurers and state insurance regulators are now discussing whether to modify the current federalism balance and if so how resolving the question intellectually or politically involves reviewing the risk management market generally and the insurance market specifically deciding on purposes for regulating and crafting federalism framework that can accomplish those goals the debate over optional federal regulation insurance is one way to finance risk of loss large us insurers both life and propertycasualty are competing with othe r providers of risk financing nationally and internationally such as banks and the capital markets they believe that they have less efficient regulation than those crosssectoral competitors in their view that imposes adverse macroecono mic and microecono mic consequences2 because it steers capital away from insurers they believe that having single federal regulator might provide more efficient regulati on which would enhance their competitive position attract capital and redu ce macroeconomic distortions state insurance regulators smaller in surers and consumer groups have different view of insurance state insurance regulators view their purpose as consumer protection not macroeconomic or microeconomic capital allocations smaller insurers do not view themselves as competing for capital with other types ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32138crs2 3 for

case of insurance albany continuedfinancial intermediaries c onsumer representatives view insurance as vested with public interest that market competition is ill equipped to meet collectively these interests believe that current state insu rance regulation provides the best form of consumer protection and that though states regulation is not uniform it can be made efficient enough to serve the public interest3 the debate gets into the purpose or purposes of insurance regulation some might argue for example that insurers s hould be regulated to ssure availability and affordability of insurance for consumers and businesses others might argue that insurers should be regulated to assure competitive market in financial services an argument that presupposes cons ensus on what the market is4 these arguments though heated within the insurance indus try and between it and its state regulators generally do not incorporate broader public policy issues this report examines what regulation if any would be appropriate in subsets of private sector that is competitive and not monolithic what might be the goal of regulation of each basic kind of insurance why regulate each line at all should commercial policies for example be regulated just like individual consumers auto policies if so why if not why not what is the cost of regulation for businesses for consumers should life insurers be regulate d like propertycasualty insurers should reinsurers be regulated why regulate th market at all what is the market why regulate conventional theories early theories about why government does or should re gulate insurance companies persist even though many sc holars and economists longer find them useful one persistent perception has been that the insurance industry has captured its regulators and that statelevel regulation therefore benefits insurers rather than consumers5 empirical study has cast serious doubt on that theory however finding that capture does not

the exemption over the last 50 years11 however competition has increased12 mccarranferguson is now understood to allow insurers to share only historical information about the timing nd scope of their

act of 2002 by baird webelcurrent theory of regulation experience and research generally suppor t the current theory that competitive markets can allocate resources more effectively than regulation14 although consumer representatives often disagree15 on the other hand economists generally recognize that markets are not always perfectly competitive and that they can fail to capture the full benefits or costs of so activities or inactions that is why some economists suggest that government intervene in private markets only to prevent systemic risk promote market efficiency or accomplish social policy16 systemic risk is the risk that single institutions default will trigger chain reaction of defaults leading to loss of c onfidence that undermines an entire financial system17 the term has generally been used in the banking context referring to concerns about consolidations crea ting more banks too big to fail promoting market efficiencies is another rationale for government intervention since insurance markets like other markets can be imperfectly competitive parties to an insurance contract might have less than comple information about each other for example economists call that potential infor mational asymmetry us securities laws have addressed informational asymmetry by requiring prospectuses for example insurance regulato rs have required insurers to submit their contracts and often their rates for prior approval the us antitrust laws to which the insurance industry is subject are another example of government intervention to promote market efficiency accomplishing social policy is third rationale for government intervention congress has for example creat ed the flood insurance program18 and the terrorism backstop19 state legislatures have mandated certain health insurance coverages and created pools for those unable to obtain insurance in the private market these are examples of intervention with social or public policy purpose it is

in several ways contract terms were subject to prior pproval and regulation because the consumer it was thought had bargaining power pri ces were regulated to keep insurers from charging too little
