pgov cvis it italy national elections italian politics iraqi freedom subject scenesetter for pm berlusconis october 31 meeting with the president classified by ambassador spogli for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary pm berlusconi specifically requested this meeting and spring address to joint session of congress to bolster his prospects in italys april elections behind in the polls and facing his toughest campaign berlusconi will juxtapose his proactive and prousforeign policy with that of his likely centerleft opponent romano prodi who prefers to follow an eu foreign policy lead and has called for timetable to withdraw italian troops from iraq goi officials are concerned about potential terrorist attack either during the turin winter olympics or the spring elections 2 c berlusconi will seek presidential statements of support on shared values b support for extending in 2005 the mandate on iraq c tangible progress on plan to enhance iraqi security capabilities and allow coordinated drawdown of italian forces and d the presidents possible intervention to waive or delay new passport requirements for continued italian participation in the visa waiver program we should offer appropriate praise for italys foreign policy support without jeopardizing our relationship with prodi and b engage berlusconi on russia and iran end summary italian elections 3 c pm silvio berlusconi prides himself on his warm relationship with the president and has carefully planned this meeting and spring address to joint session of congress he meets speaker hastert before going to the white house to bolster his prospects in italys national elections tentatively scheduled for april 9 berlusconis centerright coalition is down eight points in the polls undermined by internal leadership spats and continued economic stagnation the centerleft also is plagued by internal disputes but former european commission president romano prodi just won triumphant electoral victory in the primaries pending electoral law changes may slightly increase the odds for the centerright and it is too early to deal berlusconi out however most political observers predict prodis centerleft coalition will win in april iraq seeking way forward 4 c we expect berlusconi will juxtapose his proactive prous foreign policy with that of prodi who prefers to follow an eu foreign policy lead and has publicly called for timetable to withdraw italian troops from iraq berlusconi has remained adamant that italian troops will stay in iraq until the security situation warrants and the iraqi government requests drawdown of italian troops the centerright has already accused prodi of encouraging terrorist attacks on italy through reckless calls for withdrawal however italian public opinion remains overwhelmingly opposed to the war in iraq and berlusconi will be under increasing pressure to make public statements about plans to withdraw troops he will be reassured by commitments of continued highlevel consultations but would better appreciate progress in enhancing iraqi security capabilities in way that allows measured italian drawdowns by april italy is also seeking an extension of the iraq mandate by the end of the year the italian presence is premised on the mandate and parliament will vote in january on the next sixmonths of funding for thier troops italy also feels that the mandate extension should specifically reference political progress in iraq 5 c we can and will work with prodiled government should the centerleft win next year despite prodis calls for withdrawal timetable other elements of his centerleft coalition have assured us that italy will not make any dramatic zapaterostyle actions and will coordinate changes in troop levels with both us and the iraqi government prodi himself has hinted at compromise formula involving continued italian involvement in iraq for reconstruction initiatives strongest ally in continental europe 6 c berlusconi will be seeking presidential statements of support on shared values for our freedom agenda and praise for italys substantial commitment of resources overseas in addition to being the third largest contributor of troops to mfni italy also funds reconstruction and justice projects in iraq leads isaf prt and justice initiative in afghanistan just took over kfor command pledged 3 million to the fund for democracy indicated it will fund the new foundation for the future cohosts democracy assistance dialogue initiatives with turkey and yemen and provided earthquake and hurricane relief for pakistan and new orleans we want to provide appropriate praise without jeopardizing potential future relationship with centerleft government budget woes 7 c high public debt rising social welfare costs and stagnant economy are limiting berlusconis ability to maneuver in the face of growing domestic economic discontent pocketbook issues will drive the campaign and be berlusconis biggest challenge although prodi has yet to offer any credible alternative economic policy the draft budget now being debated by the italian parliament must be approved by the end of the year and it appears it will include painful cuts in many sectors this includes potentially dramatic to about 85 of gdp cuts in the defense budget and 20 reduction in the overseas deployment budget that could undermined italys ability to sustain its overseas commitments terrorist threat looms large 8 c following the london bombings the goi approved strong antiterrorism law and began crackdown of arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants and suspected terrorists however italy continues to be targeted in fundamentalist websites and many italian officials expect italy will be attacked in the near future they are worried specifically about potential attack during either the february turin olympics or the spring elections we continue to work closely with the goi on security preparations and intelligence sharing for the olympics as well as on increasing readiness for possible attacks on usg facilities or londonmadrid scenarios reformiranrussiabalkans 9 c berlusconi is likely to thank you for us support in opposing the g4 plan for unsc reform while italys specific concern is blocking germany from obtaining seat they support our view that any changes to the security council should be based on wide consensus of support within the as irans largest european trading partner italy remains concerned that it has been excluded from the eu3 negotiations and complains that the eu3 has not sufficiently consulted other eu member states italy shares our concern about proliferation and supports moving the issue to the unsc overall however italy favors engagement over confrontation and will be concerned about the economic losses associated with potential sanctions berlusconi and putin remain good friends and berlusconi continues to insist he has delivered our messages of concern about putins increasingly antidemocratic actions another nudge from the president would strengthen our message italy remains fully engaged on the balkans and supports continued international presence in bosnia and kosovo until there is international consensus that both entities have made sufficient progress on democratic reforms the candidacy of amb laura mirachian for the post of the high representative in bosnia is of key interest to the italians they have lobbied strongly for usg support arguing that italys high military profile deserves an equally strong policy voice department and embassy officers who have met with mirachian believe she shares our outlook for the future of the region while she has not received official usg support at this point the usg does not want to be seen as opposing her candidacy since she could emerge as the frontrunner visa waiver program 10 sbu dhs has confirmed that there will be blanket waiver official policy favoring parole and exceptions to the october 26 2005 requirement for digitized photos in passports for any beneficiary of the visa waiver program vwp the goi plans to issue machine readable passports with digitized photographs in five italian prefectures rome milan naples palermo and cagliari with the possibility of successive extension to other prefectures italians who obtain passports after october 26 from prefectures other than these five offices or who obtain passports from an italian consulate abroad will require us visa us consular sections in italy are working with airlines and travel agencies to ensure that italian passengers caught unaware of the change in visa requirements are directed to the closest embassy or consulate for expeditious visa processing 11 c president ciampi fm fini and senior aides to pm berlusconi have all raised the vwp issue with the ambassador insisting that the new requirements will be major embarrassment to berlusconi just when he is trying to use his us connections to improve his election prospects berlusconi may ask the president to intervene to fix the problem arguing that italy is staunch partner in the war on terror and is in the process of implementing previously announced us requirements for biometric passports spogli
