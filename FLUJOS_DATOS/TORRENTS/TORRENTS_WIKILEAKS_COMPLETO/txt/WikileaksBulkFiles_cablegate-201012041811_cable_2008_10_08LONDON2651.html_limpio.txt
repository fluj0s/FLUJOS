one hmg supports nato membership action plans maps for georgia and ukraine but in an effort to maintain allied unity is preparing compromise bucharest implementation plan for the december nato ministerial that will contain the elements of map hmg has been pleasantly surprised by the pragmatism of the french eu presidency according to the chief of the defense staff jock stirrup the mod did not welcome the unexpected cabinet reshuffle that replaced defense minister des browne with john hutton but stirrup described the new defense minister as keen on defense keen on his job end summary 2 sbu usdp edelman and major general allardice met with uk officials in london october 15 on broad range of issues including pakistan afghanistan iraq iran and russiageorgia at the mod edelman and allardice met with the chief of the defense staff jock stirrup and policy director john day at fco with permanent under secretary for security affairs peter ricketts and at the cabinet office with foreign and security adviser to the prime minister simon mcdonald and the cabinets deputy head of the foreign and defense policy secretariat margaret aldred bleak situation in pakistan but few glimmers 3 snf although uk interlocutors were generally pessimistic about pakistans prospects including the governments ability to manage the financial crisis they expressed cautious optimism about president zardaris efforts to cooperate with afghanistan president karzai mcdonald noted that prime minister brown wants to encourage communications between zardari and karzai since he believes that if the top levels can work well together the lower levels will follow suit ricketts who had just returned from visit to pakistan praised zardaris efforts to reach out to karzai 4 snf ricketts characterized zardari as having not much sense of how to govern countryi fear he talks and talks but not much happens ricketts stated that hmg would like to believe in zardarihe says the right things but he faces big challenges including the economy which is in really bad way stirrup stated that pakistan is arguably worse now than month ago asserting that although zardari has made helpful political noises hes clearly numbskull real progress in pakistan requires government with stability and selfconfidence with goal beyond hanging on to power stirrup stated that major obstacle to progress is an enormous strand of deep antiamericanism among the public although such views have diminished considerably among the political classes according to day zardaris principal strategy appears to be asking for lots of development aidand meanwhile circumstances on the ground are getting worse day described zardari as more positive and stable leader than wed feared and his relations with karzai are plus but zardari does not know what to do and is waiting for someone to provide him solution mcdonald also deprecated zardaris passing the hat quite energetically and stated that during recent meeting with british officials he presented specific shopping list despite encouraging first signs when zardari took office it has become clear he is not running the country 5 snf mcdonald acknowledged us concerns about former premier nawaz sharif including ties to islamists but asserted that hes indicated hes willing to change and some in the system believe he has already done that although sharifs moment may not come for couple of years he is in line to be pakistans next president mcdonald said ricketts observed however that many members of the opposition are publicly irresponsible although some like sharif are reasonable in private 6 snf stirrup agreed that clear intelligence has demonstrated that us predator drone strikes in waziristan have had an impact on terror networks ricketts noted that cross border operations are resonating hard in pakistans political world but ricketts and other interlocutors concurred that the pakistani leadership was not presently troubled by us predator strikes that kill arabs and taliban although stirrup cautioned that such attitudes could change 7 snf stirrup asserted that general ahmed pashas recent appointment as head of the interservices intelligence isi the army spy agency by pakistani army chief ashfaq kayani former isi head reflects kayanis efforts to get control of the isi and make sure that zardari wont control the isi stirrup claimed that hmg has urged zardari and civilian leadership to get control over isi but when we put pressure on the pakistanis they rearrange the furniture ricketts described pasha as kayanis man but also noted that during his recent trip to pakistan everyone spoke highly of pasha afghanistan getting the message right q cnf several interlocutors expressed concern that rising casualties in afghanistan could result in waning public support in allied countries for the mission there mcdonald stated that in great britain the electorate wants some movement in afghanistan public sentiment could turn against the good war as casualties mount he asserted consequently the public in allied countries requires realistic narrative that explains the goals in afghanistan stirrup noted that jcs chairman mullens october 9 congressional testimony in which he predicted that 2009 would present increased challenges in afghanistan and that trends across the board are not going in the right direction was headline news in the united kingdom 9 cnf security is our top concern but we need political progress in afghanistan stirrup emphasized ricketts asserted that were holding our own in the fight against the taliban and that uniquely military solution is not sufficient as we need to find social and economic solutions part of the problem he continued is that in afghanistan the perception of security is diminishing and fear of taliban reprisals impede progress consequently efforts to build civilmilitary links are crucial to building stability ricketts stated 10 snf day stated that hmg continues to feel deep frustration with karzai wryly adding that i remind people that we the international community selected him for all karzais faults day continued the real question concerning karzais future is whether there is constitutional alternative one dire possible scenario would be failed elections in 2009 with karzai having reduced legitimacy and with violence attributed to the campaign stirrup remarked on the importance of ensuring respectable elections mcdonald stated that building up the afghan national army to the goal of welltrained force of 122000 soldiers plus 12000 in training would take long time aldred wondered whether one solution might be to follow pakistans model and give the army some sort of economic benefit some interlocutors shared their disappointment at the performance of envoy kai eide ricketts qualified his critique of eide with the observation that he had weak back up from the system iran bigger carrot bigger stick 11 snf all uk interlocutors agreed that fiscal pressure against iran has had an impact on the regime and that the international community needs to keep up the pressure even if immediate changes are unlikely ricketts observed that pressure on irans financial sector coupled with falling oil prices have been effective and that the squeeze against iran should continue according to ricketts supreme leader ayatollah khameini feels that president ahmadinejad has not deliveredand the bourgeoisie in tehran is openly dismissive of ahmadinejad also concluding that he has not delivered therefore we must plug along with sanctions and our advice is to increase the size of the carrot and the stick in dealing with iran he raised the possibility of the united states opening visa section in tehran suggesting that lines of people around the block queuing for visas would send an effective message to irans leadership iraq sofa uk looks to us for help 12 cnf mcdonald stressed that the uk could not have an orderly transition of its forces in iraq without sofa to provide legal framework and the uk seeks to piggyback on the usiraq sofa day noted that prime minister brown seeks low key transition of british forces in iraq stirrup emphasized that from military perspective uk soldier cannot show up in an iraqi court expressing concern that he was not sure the sofa will get through the iraqi system usdp edelman provided an update on the progress of the usiraq sofa and reassured his interlocutors that the us and uk shared similar concerns on jurisdiction issues avoiding wretched row over map 13 cnf mcdonald stated that hmg rejects the view of some partners who want to get back to business as usual with russia he continued that prime minister brown shares president bushs emphasis on the importance of allied unity on the georgia crisis although the uk supports maps for georgia and ukraine hmg does not believe the alliance will agree on maps at the december 23 nato ministerial consequently hmg is working up bucharest implementation plan that will contain the elements of map but would not be as frightening word as map to some allies mcdonald stressed that such plan would help cement alliance unity and he said he would raise it with nsa hadley during his meeting with him in washington in few days day characterized the plan as like map but without the name also noting that the risk of allied disunity is huge ricketts affirmed hmgs support for georgian map but allies should seek compromise in order to maintain unity and avoid wretched row aldred observed that depending on the result of ukraines elections ukraine may not have government come the ministerial temporarily mooting the question of map for ukraine france eu presidency and nato 14 cnf ricketts stated that hmg has been pleasantly surprised by the pragmatism of frances eu presidency day remarked that the current french plan to reintegrate into natos military command is the third such effort i am not sure france understands the implications of what they need to do to provide officers and staffers for nato integration the new defmin 15 snf stirrup offered preliminary assessment of new defense minister john hutton who replaced former defmin des browne in the october 3 cabinet reshuffle he stated that the reshuffle was unexpected at the mod and that defense was the only portfolio hutton would accept when peter mandelson replaced hutton as business secretary citing political considerations that dominated the cabinet reshuffle stirrup opined that it was disappointing from our perspective that so little thought was given to what was best for the ministry of defense since we did not need change at the mod however we were lucky we got who we got since hutton is military historian who is keen on defense and keen on his job 16 u usdp edelman cleared this message visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit ed_kingdom lebaron nnnn end cable text
