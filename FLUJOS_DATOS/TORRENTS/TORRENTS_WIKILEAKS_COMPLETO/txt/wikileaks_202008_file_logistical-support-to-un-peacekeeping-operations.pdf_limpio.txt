peace and security could not be implemented as envisaged peacekeeping was pioneered by the united nations in 1948 with the establishment of the united nations truce supervisi on organization in the middle east peacekeeping operations which are authorized by t he security council are crucial instrument at the disposal of the internati onal community to advance international peace and security

coherent framework for their activities this frame work must be drawn from the mandate of the mission coordination between the security council troopco ntributing countries and the secretariat in the definition and implementation of peacekeeping mandates should be strong the secretarygeneral has constituted tas k force consisting of the under secretariesgeneral of substantive departments deal ing with peacekeeping to provide policy guidance at the highest level the special representative to the secretarygeneral srsg is the recognized institutional head of the united nations family in mission area and under the srsg should be unified cohesive structure all substa ntive decisions in the field with political ramifications are taken in the name of the srsg th srsg must be an experienced political negotiator as well as an effective manage r of complex operation frequent changes in the top leadership of an operation incl uding component heads detract from the objective of developing

organizations are at variance with those of the pea cekeeping operation senior official could be assigned as liaison to manage such diffe rences constructively without detracting from the common goal all entities in mission area must be headquart ered close to each other for effective coordination an interagency agreement d efining the responsibilities of each entity in the implementation of the peace agreement s could be considered the appointment of deputy srsg at the assistant secretarygeneral level to act as general manager responsible for daytoday administration and coordination allowing for an integrated militaryhumanitariande velopment approach the deputy srsg should be familiar with the united nations str ucture and procedures there should be clear chain of command between peacekeeping mission and headquarters ideally all individual units and dep artments should work through the srsg as heshe is the head of the mission all req uests or instructions should be issued in

lesson 2 lesson objectives lesson 2 defines and discusses basic logistic term inology principles and concepts because over 100 countries assign staff nd experts both military and non military to world wide peacekeeping mission duties logistical planning must encompass international perspectives in this lesson logisti c terminology introduces the student to the broad parameters of what it takes to provide to tal physical and moral support to thousands of personnel who have been sent to an unf amiliar land for broad range of reasons by the same token this lesson will introd uce the student to the actual details of logistical planning thus the student gains both macro and micro view of mission and its logistic needs by the end of lesson 2 the student should be able to meet the following objectives discuss logistics terminology list and define the principles of logistics discuss logistical support concepts understand the types of logistic support lesson 2principles of international logistics 19 introduction this lesson outlines basic logistic terminology finitions principles and concepts providing logistic support for the wide r ange of potential missions both civilian and military is discussed the lesson also outlines what is involved in the integration of logistic support and highlights why clear logistic command and control is paramount especially in the case of multination co ntributors logistic concepts for various types of missions are presented as the required level of support regardless of the size of mission car ried out in the most cost effective manner consistent with operational requirements an d which can serve all concerned this involves maximising available resources and also in volves adopting stockpiling policy that ensures reasonable future contingencies can be adequately met 21 definitions logistics logistics is defined as the science of planning an d carrying out the administration movement and maintenance of forces and materials ne eded on mission and includes activities related to communications engi neering and aviation services in its most fundamental sense logistics is the art of transporting housing supplying and providing technical support to military troops how ever in the context of operations because support is often required for nonmilitary personnel and circumstances this definition is broadened thus the definition of logistics covers not only the needs of military and police units but also of related civi lian personnel originating from 189 different countries and widely diverse cultures it s definition includes support to be provided to civilian police staff from numerous agencies as well as civilian specialists who serve on multirole missions logis tics covers all aspects of the needs and physical support for missions to be carried out th is covers finances supplies transportation technical support and housing needs as well as administrative communications engineering and aviation services integrated logistic support integrated logistic support is the process by whic h all available materials administrative and sustainment systems are combin ed to form the most effective and cost efficient support system international logistics international logistics is the process of negotiat ing planning coordinating and implementing logistic support between civilian and military components of nations and international organisations it incorporates all th member states facilities technologies material and services and aims to intermesh polici programs and procedures to produce an integrated logistic system between all m ember states contributing to sponsored mission further list of definitions can be found in the d ictionary of terms attached as an appendix to the course material lesson 2principles of international logistics 20 22 principles of logistics logistics for all missions have common principle s as all missions require mobility flexibility and is multination venture these are outlined in the following paragraphs responsibility contributing member states and the have colle ctive responsibility to ensure that forces deployed on any operation are fully equipped and supported this may be achieved either through national or cooperative arr angements but must be clearly agreed upon prior to deployment member states and the have collective responsibility for the care custody and safeguarding of assets foresight the administrative and logistic planning for any ssion begins well before the commencement of any operation this includes first identifying resources within or close to the deployment area and obtaining information re garding the infrastructure of the site concerned consideration should be given to any spe cial onsite requirements such as clothing munitions accommodation and mobility co ntingency planning for strategic movement should begin at the earliest opportunity such logistic reconnaissance is an important step in preparing for mission flexibility flexibility in the field of logistics means the ab ility to conform to operational plans that will almost inevitably be subject to fre quent change particularly in the early stages of any operation in conditions where lines of communication are liable to be disrupted it may be necessary to deviate from pre set procedures and to modify standard methods of operation to meet unexpected events economy on any mission resources are rarely plentiful and must be used effectively efficiently and economically early integration of all availabl assets provided by the contributing member states should be main goal when possible this integration should be planned prior to deployment to avoid duplication of resourc at the mission site notwithstanding desire to rationalise logistic assets at the earl iest opportunity there is likely to be surge of operational requirements to assist with th initial deployment of any force and this may in the short term create duplicati on of some resources simplicity the simpler the logistic plan the easier it is to understand the greater the understanding of the plan the more effective will be the cooperation between contributing nations and the speed with which an or iginal plan can be adapted to meet changing circumstances lesson 2principles of international logistics 21 cooperation cooperation will always be the key to producing workable logistic structure for mission levels and standards of support diffe r by nations often there are variety of nationalities with different languages cultural requirements and capabilities in order to achieve workable logistic end product c ooperation is necessary high level of mhq cooperation to the force logistic headqua rters is required in order to achieve maximum cooperation sufficiency the levels and distribution of logistic resources must be sufficient to meet the sustainability and mobility needs of the operationa l plan stock levels should take into account the expected nature and duration of the sion and consumption pattern peacetime stock levels tend to be inappropriate for most operations and some items may approach limited war rates even in relatively m inor deployments accountability accurate accounts must be kept for all assets that are purchased and issued to contingents for the support of mission this incl udes any equipment classified as contingent owned equipment visibility logistic assets are vital to an operation and repre sent huge sums of money it is important that full audit trail is available for all assets dispatched to in and from the mission site this can be achieved using number of methods rang ing from barcode satellite tracking or basic card systems the force headquarters must have access to inventor ied information at all times this includes information regarding the numbers of men quantities and types of materials and supplies held usage rates pipeline times for resupply and future requirements of any portion of the mission prior t deployment the logistics staffs of member states must have clear plan regarding how they will keep and supply such information on demand or by timed return the forc commander should develop on site standing operating procedures outlining requir ed information maintenance 23 an overview of logistic support processes the logistic system expects deployed units of mber states on mission to be selfsufficient for given initial period norm ally between 60 and 90 days this gives the time to organize the mission headquarters an d onsite logistic structure to acquire real estate and to finalize the status of forces agreements contracts and local memoranda of understanding after this time period the provides bulk supplies of important items such as water fuel and rations clothing domestic consumables batteries and some vehicle spares it will also he lp with needs such as accommodation storage space and basic services such as cleaning laundry and waste disposal in the case of all but the smallest of missions co ntinuation of support depends on the finding one or more member nations to accept respon sibility for forming force logistic lesson 2principles of international logistics 22 support group flsg member state that accepts t his role establishes local contractual arrangements in support of the mission which it then carries out in coordination with the chief logistics officer at ssion headquarters despite the formation of force logistic support group member states will be required to be self sufficient for elements of resupply particularly f or technical spares clothing and the replacement of national equipment therefore there will be requirement for independent national lines of supply 24 basic concepts of logistic support logistic support needs to be tailored to specific mission as missions can vary in size from small group of observers who m ay be civilian police military or mixture of personnel types to combined operation of land sea and air assets involving tens of thousands of personnel because there are wide range of possible missions there is also wide range of logistic concepts logistic support is tailored according to the task required space and time considerations manpower material environment climate on site infrastructure and availability of resources the support system may be mobile or static civilian or military have onsite warehous ing or national resupply lines or in most cases is combination of all of the above numb er of such concepts have proven to be workable and valuable and are discussed as follows smaller missions the selfreliance concept in some cases reliance on the local economy may be the best method of support it may require small reception team at point of entry that maintains logistic links with contributing member states and the however spe cialist repair of vehicles communication or technical equipment would generall be brought in from outside the mission site if one of the contributing countries is nation that has modern civilian infrastructure selfsufficiency is effective lead member state concept medium size missions may centre around one princip member states contingent in such cases that member state would usually assume responsibility for all logistic support and maintain resupply links to its home base other nations contingents would rely on the principal member state for their administrative and logistics needs before the mission begins unnegotiated bilateral agreements may be required between the and the different nations engaged in the sion to ensure financial reimbursement of services provided the lead member states logistic organisation would nevertheless contain representatives of oth er contributing member nations in order to ensure that all national interests are tak into account the force logistic support group flsg concept large missions with considerable equipment and volu of transactions can be supported by specialized logistic support groups t hese groups are organized as an extension of the lead member state concept ie ne member state assumes overall responsibility for the coordination of the force gistic support group it incorporates logistic units originating from contributing nation s into the force logistic base as part of lesson 2principles of international logistics 23 iss these are called national support elements logistic support group may also be created through civilian service support contract the force logistic support group concept is impleme nted at the planning stage of mission thus its implementation is coordinat ed by the uns main logistics planning bodies the office of mission support because full interoperability is difficult to achieve and thereby unlikely such corporate appr oach is often required once the force logistic support group is establishe d it contains number of specialized logistic support units the specific m ix varies according to the size and role of the mission it contributes and executes specifi c logistical tasks such as supply planning which is the process of identifying requi rements range and quantity of items required to support unit andor its equipment it s phases include identification of items of supply cataloguing scaling and issuing of requ isitions the task of acquisition of material is the process of obtaining material and s ervices whether of military or commercial origin it includes receiving care and storage of material and issue to first line units the task of disposal is defined as the removal of material from the supply system through sale tradein or destruction inven tory control is the control of material by means of established accounting and management p rocedures this includes maintaining stocks at the required level civilian contract support concept as mission progresses the attempts to determin requirements for base area logistic support the overall aim is to achieve log istic organisation in the most economical way and way which meets the demands f the force as well as what is needed to release military manpower for redeploymen t decisions are coordinated by force headquarters and constitute unique set of r equirements for each mission these aims are often achieved by including civilian contr act support assuming that civilian support is possible and cost effective the militar logistic support group would then be phased out 25 types of logistics support logistics activities in the are grouped by the f unction they serve administrative services include all managerial administrative an d clerical support services provided where required at all vels of the mission supply support requires obtaining needed goods and materials and to continue to supply them throughout the mission these include f ood provisions furniture office supplies cleaning materials clothing military eq uipment as well as recreational materials and whatever else is required for part icular mission transportation logistics include supplying transport as needed equipment maintenance requires that all vehicles and equipment be mainta ined in working order this includes communications and land based equipment technical support covers training and upkeep for field or constructi on engineering and technical requirements this includ the provision of water and accommodation which at times needs to be construct ed for particular missions aviation support requires the provision of aviation and air service s including maintenance of aircraft and flight safety procedure s lesson 2principles of international logistics 24 communications logistics covers provision of signals and communic ations needs including postal and courier services for l those involved in mission personnel needs are logistic concern logistics cover the admini stration of personnel which may require choosing personnel or assigning them to tasks services also cover all needs of personnel such as overall welfare needs recreational needs and the provision of amenities as much as is possible n particular mission security services include establishing and maintaining mili tary police for military missions and the provision and upkeep of all securi ty services accounting services provide budgeting and financial services missio n is required to keep accounts of all expenses incurred and also to keep track of whether the expense is incurred by the the contributing cou ntry the host country or another source medical services require the logistic provision of all health servi ces including dental needs procurement services procure all material and services required for all aspects of mission general services provide mail courier travel and traffic services and office supplies summary the above concepts describe general framework to provide logistic support for mission that can be adapted for any size or type of operation small missions may be selfsufficient and depend largely on host nation s upport large scale operations involving specialized equipment may require contrib uting member states to set up their own national resupply lines rationalisation of the force logistic bases may be possible if one member state is prepared to accept the lead role for logistic support before any mission can be deployed funding arrangements have to be clarified by dpkos logistics planning arm the office of mission support lesson 2principles of international logistics 25 lesson 2 endoflesson quiz 1 the following are logistics concepts that apply to all missions logistics is the required level of support regardle ss of the size of mission in the most cost effective manner consistent with oper ational requirements b involves maximising available resources and adoptin g stockpiling policy which ensures future contingencies can be met c requires that the host nation provides fixed perc entage of cost of the services d and b 2 logistics is defined as the science of planning and carrying out the administration movem ent and maintenance of forces and material b conducting activities related to directly negotiati on peace options c conducting activities related to communications gineering and aviation services d and c 3 international logistics is the process of obtaining international approval for mission b negotiating planning coordinating and implementin g logistic support between civilian and military components of nations and int ernational organisations c connecting policies programs and procedures to pr oduce an integrated logistic system between the member states contributing to sponsored mission d b and c 4 in the logistics concept of responsibility contributing member states and the have collec tive responsibility to ensure that forces deployed on any operation are fully equipped and supported b national or cooperative arrangements but must be c learly agreed upon prior to deployment c member states and the have collective responsibi lity for the care custody and safeguarding of all assets d all of the above 5 the logistics concept of foresight means that the administrative and logistic planning for any ssion begins well before the commencement of any operation b it includes first identifying resources within or c lose to the deployment area and obtaining information regarding the infrastructure of the site concerned c special onsite requirements are determined only af ter the first contingents arrive d and b lesson 2principles of international logistics 26 6 flexibility in the field of logistics means the ability to conform to operational plans which w ill almost inevitably be subject to frequent change and to modify standard m ethods of operation to meet unexpected events b change in logistic plans most frequently occurs at the end of an operation c maintaining flexibility in the face of different cal customs at the mission site d and c 7 the concept of economy in logistics describes that on any mission resources are plentiful but ne vertheless must be used effectively efficiently and economically b that early integration of all available assets prov ided by contributing member nations should be main goal c integration is achieved as soon as possible on arri val at the mission site d b and c 8 the concept of simplicity in logistics describe s the simpler the logistic plan the easier it is to understand b the greater the understanding of the plan the more effective will be the cooperation between contributing nations and the sp eed with which an original plan can be adapted to meet changing circumstances c although logistics can be complex and detailed bject it is however largely matter of common sense simple yet flexible plans w ill have greater chance of success than more complex ones d all of the above 9 the concept of lead member state suggests that other nations contingents follow the lead of the l argest contributing member state in diplomatic decisionmaking b the lead member states logistic organisation would not contain representatives of other contributing nations which ensures the ast amount of confusion in logistic planning c medium to large size missions may centre around one principal member states contingent which usually assumes responsibility fo r all logistic support and maintains resupply links to its home base d all of the

the civilian and military components of mission describe the structure of oms understand the interaction with its internal and ex ternal counterparts lesson 3the peacekeeping logistics structure 31 introduction who carries out operations wide range of personnel carry out united nations field missions this can include infantry units military and civilian obser vers military and civilian monitoring forces electoral and referendum officials civilia n police as well as military and non military personnel involved with refugee needs and repatriation and those who assist disaster victims because there is such wide arra of personnel to operate varied range of missions welldefined logistic procedures need to be in place for different kinds of missions the logistics mandate the logistic responsibility in support of peacekeep ing operations is to plan organize mount sustain and account for dulyautho rized operations since there are many types of logistic support which can come from various sources this mandate includes integration and coordination of the variou s types and sources of logistic support which inevitably weaves complexity into the task logistic integration implies that the needs of all concerned be they military personnel civilian staff or civilian staff prov ided by governments are considered as common to the mission as whole support is provid ed on an equitable basis after assessing and setting priorities the logistic coordination function of mission refers to the need to consolidate and draw together diverse elements requ ired at the mission site logistics personnel coordinate diverse needs and interests at the mission site with those of the contributing nation as well as with personnel at t he secretariat in new york who are involved in furnishing logistic support for parti cular peacekeeping operation this entails establishing communications between each so urce establishing access to decisionmakers at each source and protocols for ob taining consensus on required decisions lesson 3the peacekeeping logistics structure 32 31 integrated support services mission statement to provide effective efficient and timely logisti c support to the mission to enable it to achieve its mandated tasks commensurate with operational and political constra ints and using supplies and services of the appropriate quantity and quality at the lowe st cost commensurate with value for money missions are often unique in nature they may ra nge from peacekeeping functions where personnel act as observers to m onitoring functions where personnel oversee election processes disaster reli ef or war intervention situations thus they require enormous variations in logistics suppo rt arrangements and because individual missions often change in nature as they evolve their organisational setup needs to be continuously reviewed in terms of opera tional requirements basic organisational structure of mission initially new mission relies heavily on military support subject to cost effectiveness to do so it may gradually evolve int mission of civilian police civilian staff and contracted support the basic organisatio nal structure of peacekeeping mission is as follows senior official is responsible for the mission this senior official can be special representative to the secretary general special assistant to the secretary general or military officer designated as chief m ilitary observer or force commander civil affairs office handles interactions with t he local community and the local authorities there is also civilian police component sometim this component is the mission itself it performs local police duties mo nitors guides and advises local police under control specialist civilians are an integral part of m ission among other functions they oversee electoral referendum and legal proces ses the civilian component director of administration doa or chief administrative officer cao is appointed by hq usg administration and manageme nt and the controller and is responsible to dpkooffice of mission support at headquarters and acts as its representative at mission headquarters on behalf f the office of mission support and under the overall authority of the head of mission the doacao is responsible for all administrative functions of mission heshe acts as the principal advisor to the head of mission on all matters relating to civilian adminis tration heshe plans and forecasts the lesson 3the peacekeeping logistics structure 33 missions personnel and financial requirements pro vides overall management exercises budgetary control and administers international an d local staff the doacao is also responsible for the mission s comptrollers tasks these include preparation nd submission of the budget estimates for the mission and reconciliation of the financial and substantive requirements of the mission service sections the office of the doacao liaises with appropriate administrative and milita ry logistics support staff to provide doacao with the necessary management information and conducts management and procedural reviews as r equired number of services provide support to the doacao as follows communications section provides access to global communications between missions and headquarters in new york and on site communications services between civilian units and military installations n ot covered by military signal units it also provides maintenance of unowned communication s equipment computer support services section provides computer services to all components of mission and arranges for programmin g and hardware support general services section provides 1 mail courier and central registry operations 2 travel and traffic services in coordination wit h the movement control staff of the military component 3 office supplies and general stores in coordinat ion with supply staff of the military component procurement section procures all material and services required for l aspects of mission as civilian component it interacts in multifaceted ways with the military procurement component and as such is the most dem anding section to coordinate the finance section maintains the missions accounts and all financial settlements such as travel expenses perdiem payme nts salaries and benefits of locally hired personnel and overhead for materials and ser vices the transportation section is responsible for coordinating allocating distribution of and accounting for and maintenanc of all unowned vehicles as and when required the chief transportation officer may also run pool of unowned and rented vehicles the civilian personnel section is responsible for the administration of the civilian staff of the mission in accordance with th staff rules and regulations and other administrative instructions and provides adv ice on the interpretation of the staff rules and regulations the engineering section is responsible for the building and facilities management the security section is responsible for security and safety of all p ersonnel and property lesson 3the peacekeeping logistics structure 34 the military component military component is part and parcel of all peacekeeping missions i t comprises troops and technical specialists the ext ent of the military component depends on the mandate of peacekeeping operation logistic functions are assigned to units specialisi ng in required activity some of these are described below according to the tasks they are assigned to fulfil the composition of logistic units depends on many facto rs these include the level of self sufficiency of each unit the extent of local and i nternational contracting for materials and services and the overall infrastructure at the sion site such as its geography industrial base economic situation etc military components generally found on missions are signal units b aircraft and helicopter services c military field engineer and multirole engineer

operations the task s of the field engineer unit include explosive ordinance reconnaissance and mine awareness sweepingremoval tasks if construction engineering expertise is req uired this unit covers both horizontal and vertical construction engineering multirole ngineer units must also be capable of providing portable water production and treatment plant equipment may only be deployed when it has been confirmed that the missio n site is unable to provide such equipment technical engineering expertise such as engineer tradesmen draftsmen structural designers electrical designers specifi cations writers and inspectors also form part of the engineering unit where local hiring is limited for operational reasons engineer units may be grouped and should this occu r the chief engineer would assume command of the grouping lesson 3the peacekeeping logistics structure 36 supply units two types of supply units may be required for par ticular mission 1 missionwide supply depots when the size of sion exceeds 4000 personnel and the territory is very large 2 conventional composite supply units the supply units may operate as part of multiro logistics unit and are responsible for supply transport and maintenance supply units responsibilities can include ordering receiving warehousing and issuing materi and stores destined for all components of mission b control of materials including physical control re ceipt and issue operations as well as packaging c inventory stock and replenishment d disposal of owned material transport units as in the case of supply units transport units ma be part of larger national or multinational logistic organisation transport unit s involve personnel to manage both nationally owned as well as unowned vehicles alth ough types and quantities of vehicles deployed depend on what is available from local commercial sources transport units are expected to deploy mostly generalpurpo cargo and bus vehicles maintenance and repair units the extent of maintenance support and resources re quired for particular mission depends largely upon the local economy and selfsuf ficiency of mission sites in the case of supply and transport units maintenance personne l may form part of larger logistic group the major task of maintenance units is vehic repair and the associated vehicle recovery requirement including electromechanical and electronic repairs maintenance units therefore deploy with sufficient vehiclereco very trucks to cater to the worst possible cases such assets generally being in shor t supply at mission sites movement control the headquarters of the movement control unit is rmally colocated with the mission sites traffic section where effective coor dination of movement can be exercised the unit is expected to cater to detached operation s so that it is composed of number of detachments operating at airports seaports and rai lheads lesson 3the peacekeeping logistics structure 37 postal unit the postal unit provides mail service for deployed personnel and interfaces with local and national services it may have units in m ajor locations and can be responsible for movement of classified and unclassi fied official

logistics support to peacekee ping operation arise only in response to sc resolution sc resolution defines the scope scale and duration of peacekeeping operation financial challenges all mission support activities must be funded by an approved budget the budget approval process is lengthy and detailed sc approv mandates and ga approves budgets process cannot begin until sc resolution i s approved each dpko mission is funded independently there is legitimate scope for using one missions budget to support anothers operations challenges resources dpko does not possess large material reserve unlb brindisi currently holds limited resources ms reserve consisting of whatever surplus material happens to have been r eturned by liquidating missions dpko does not possess its own ships and aircraft fo r strategic deployment these assets are spotchartered for every mission d eployment which takes at least 46 weeks challenges procedures lsd is small component of the overall united nati ons organisation as such it is subject to all normal procedures rules and r egulations for example ultimate authority for procurement lies outside dpko which is part of policy of separation of powers to ensure transparency in global procure ment dpko usg cannot buy single thing on his own authority dpko priorities must compete will all other departments priorities challenges partners lsd is heavily dependent on reliability of its par tners eg troop contributing countries tccs and contractors lsd can not initi ate contingent move until the tcc has provided detailed load lists itemising what is to be moved also it is not unknown for contingent to arrive without required equipme nt or selfsustainment capabilities it becomes problem of lsd to make good the shortfall s usually at short

authorities and the public at mission hq the civil affairs policy and plans u nit is the focal point for mission wide strategic planning as well as undertaking the full range of mission reporting requirements officers may be also outposted to sp ecific militarycivpol programmes such as minority recruitment the state border serv ice regional police cooperation initiatives and missionwide training programmes in transitional administration ta the has fi nal decision making and executive authority this often requires precisely the same skills of negotiation political analysis and assessment mandate implementation pla nning and reporting engagements in reconciliation and confidence building as in traditional mission moreover there are times in the life of traditional mission when m ix of skills and competencies is required broadly speaking the functions of civil affairs co mponents mostly depend on the mandate of the mission in some missions the u n may even assume the role of the civilian government eg more recently in kosovo and east timor following are couple of examples of different mandates wide mandate for example in the united nations tra nsitional

responsible for the former while the dep artment of humanitarian affairs dha for the latter however close cooperation be tween the demining units of both departments is necessary to ensure that plans for perational and humanitarian demining complement each other adequate funds for operational demining should be i ncluded in the budget of the peacekeeping operation so that it is not dependent on voluntary contributions in order to build indigenous capacity for longterm demining i t may be necessary to conduct demining and mineawareness training in such cases adequate budgetary staffing and administrative provisions must be planned well in dvance mineawareness briefings for mission personnel should be conducted regularly while civilian contractors to conduct demining are preferred by national military contingents these contractors should be on the gro und and operational before troops arrive intheatre and are ready for deployment if this is not possible then demining should be conducted by military units for the initi months of deployment political initiative to ensure that new mines are not laid must be conducted in tandem with demining otherwise the effort would be in

tion which are usually well received and may be the only source of outside information in addition the also disseminates regular news and bulletins in some missions the u n organizes town hall meetings this is another opportunity for the and the loca l population to share information and receive feedback from the community respect for the cultural traditions and social more s of the local population is an important part of maintaining good relations with t he local population briefings on history culture and other aspects of life of the host country are conducted for staff in its peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts the operation is best advised to work through existing local authorities and communi ty elders and its peace initiatives must be closely tailored to indigenous practices of conflict management provided these do not contradict accepted international standards of human rights and humanitarian law however in areas of recent and ongoing conflict t he operation must exercise great caution in identifying local community leaders ce it is often unclear as to who actually represents the community due to strife population displacements and other extenuating circumstances traditional societal patterns and ro become blurred or submerge under new often militaristic hierarchies as peacekeeping missions are becoming more multifa ceted peace building has become an integral part of their activities emphas is is placed on support of processes and institutions that reinforce reconciliation between warring parties and reconstruction of economic and social

logistic support for peacekeepin g operations varies in size from support of small group of civilian observers fulfilling preventive diplomacy mission to large military force involved in peac enforcement operations regardless of the type of operation to be supported the logistic planning process remains the same logistic support concepts and requirements are tail ored by the planner to meet specific mission requirements but the planning cycle must be gin with the use of standard logistic planning factors logistics operational and logistics plans should be fully int egrated and developed together as soon as concept of operations is formulated logistics concept should be developed followed by comprehensive operational plan and logistics plan to support it standard operating

regulations and rules in addition it outlines spe cific logistic planning actions that must be considered lesson 4mission life cycle 72 41 planning considerations common to all phases mission analysis mission analysis determines which operational tasks need to be performed and as result what are the logistic requirements some tasks are specified by the mandate while others are merely implied for example pla n might specify disarming opposing factions which is clear task the implied tasks however may include storage of weapons and accountability for them destruction pr ocedures and reissue procedures if the mission analysis notes only the specified task but overlooks the implied ones needed resources will be underestimated once both specifi ed and implied tasks are identified the logistic planner next examines the environment in which tasks are to be executed the environment includes overall regional factors at th mission location such as local populace support terrain weather available local resources and the time available for planning and execution initial planning factors initial planning must address broad range of fact ors strike an effective balance in capabilities to meet changing requirements and retain flexibility to support the forces requirements planners must have clear understand ing of the operational objective format of operation sources of supply available in the mission area and capabilities to build supply support the fact that most mission s are multinational introduces an additional complexity into the planning process th us considering these overall factors the supply planner should take the following into ccount supply capabilities of participating nations force s should be identified early the resources of the host nation should also be ide ntified early it is also important to locate sources of supply and determine the most effective system of supply b attempts should be made to integrate resources as m uch as possible namely the support capabilities of participating nations host nation support contracted services and resources c the condition congestion distance and security f sea air and ground lines of communication impact directly on supply plans u nique communication circumstances may dictate combination of distribu tion methods that increase the complexity of the logistics mission as whole thereby communication factors need to be assessed d mission areas may lack the infrastructure eg ele ctrical power transportation networks and port facilities required to provide supply support planning must arrive at solutions that recognize and overcom such shortfalls the types and quantities of commodities to meet sion requirements should take geographical conditions and cultural diversiti into consideration lesson 4mission life cycle 73 logistic planning factors once tasks have been identified and the mission ana lysis is completed the planner needs to determine the specific resources and the amounts of each required to accomplish mission in national planning general requirements such as water fuel and rations is commonly defined as kglbs per man per day more sophisticated planning formulas are used to compute resupply requirements for specialized items such as spare parts for large and complex missions the office of mission support is normally augmented by logistic experts contributed by member states who determine specific needs and amounts inputs from these experts coupl ed with previous experience provide the basis for determining support requireme nts determination of logistics support by applying logistic planning formulas against the tasks outlined in the mission analysis the specific logistic requirements are termined4 once gross logistic requirements are known the planner can determine t he most cost effective and efficient methods to obtain and distribute supply reaching accurate gross estimates is especially important to predetermine whether military or host nationcontractor resources are the most effective thus in the initial assessments stimates of specific requirements are grouped according to whether they can be undertaken by the host nation or by contractor sources of logistic support once specific and gross estimates of materials nee ded for mission are known source of support must be determined the draws logistic support for its field and peacekeeping missions from the following sources the united nations the contributing nations private sector resources contracted by the civilians or resources contracted directly by the c ontributing nation and individuals or organisations who are voluntary cont ributors as for example the red cross 4 for example if the mission analysis requires fo rce presence of 1000 personnel and the planning formula for water is five gallons per person per da then the daily water requirement is 5000 gallon s per day once the daily requirement is determined the planner can compute the onsite level that needs to be stocked for example if the onsite stock level fo r water is set at 5 days of supply then the requir ement becomes 30000 gallons which includes 25000 gallo ns for storage and 5000 gallons for distribution lesson 4mission life cycle 74 the the provides support from all levels of its inf rastructure including the secretariat in new york headquarters in geneva and vienna and field missions headquarters on occasion it also draws support fr om other agencies such as the united nations high commission for refugees the wo rld health organisation unicef undp etc reporting to the secretary general of the united na tions are some 25 separate departments offices and commissions in addition the secretary general is responsive to some 189 member nations about 20 special agenci more than 80 special committees 300 offices world wide and finally an everincreasing number of peacekeeping operations 15 peacekeeping missions nd 13 political and peace building missions as of 2001 contributing nations one or more contributing nations may also provide l ogistic support for individual missions support may cover one or combination of logistics needs including personnel advisors specialists or materials and goods their contributions need to be co ordinated with those of the yet distinguished f rom support for purposes such as accounting and transportation commercial sources arranged through the the may itself contract resources or supplies th rough private industry to support mission logistically these need to be i ntegrated and coordinated with other sources of support and yet remain distinguished fo r accounting purposes civilian personnel contracted directly by the contr ibuting nation civilian personnel may also be contracted directly by contributing nation on behalf of the such contracted personnel are co ordinated with other sources of support yet remain distinguished for accounting pu rposes volunteer support not under contract logistic support may involve volunteers who are t under contract to either the directly or to contributing nation this may b volunteer medical personnel or organisations such as the red cross their services are recognised as legitimate part of mission logistically volunteer noncontra cted personnel or organisations remain distinguished for accounting purposes and re not paid by the or by contributing nations lesson 4mission life cycle 75 soliciting member states for logistic contributions the brings logistic requirements to the attentio n of member states that may potentially act as contributing nations for missi on member states that possess the required logistic capability to provide all or part of the needed logistic force review the requirements against their logistic capabilities an d nominate what support forces they can make available determination of logistic shortfalls once the contributions of member states are determi ned the total logistic package is analysed to determine whether there are any poss ible shortfalls if shortfalls are identified first attempts to resolve them through additional member nation solicitations or increased host nation or contractor support are made if this is insufficient to cover shortfalls appropriate recommendations are made to unhq staff otherwise the accomplishment of the mission may be in jeopardy 42 planning phases planning phase requirement for logistics support to peacekeepin g operations arises in response to the establishment of such operations by security council sc resolution such resolution gives direction to the secretary general sg on the scope scale and duration of peacekeeping operation dpko turns th policy directives of the sc into specific operational requirements for among other things the logistics support of the required peacekeeping operation logistics support requirements are mainly influence d by tasks and capabilities required of the mission geographic and climatic conditions in the mission rea level of member state participation especially tro op strengths and the provision of contingentowned equipment coe the objective of the planning phase is the producti on of feasible economic and realistically costed logistics plan for the deploym ent or expansion of mission there is heavy emphasis on the rapid and accurate collection of all the facts and data required for the preparation of the proposed concept of operatio ns this is essential in order to accurately identify the proposed missions material requirements together with the time scales for deployment since at least one technical survey reconnaissance mission to the prospective mission area is usually required oms dispatches technical survey mission to the mission area this conducts detailed logis tic estimate verify requirements and establish what resources are like ly to be available in theatre throughout this phase it is fundamental that close liaison is maintained between the military planning service who produces the propose d concept the office of operations in dpko who provides the political direction and f ramework for the mission and the logistic planners in oms lesson 4mission life cycle 76 once all the required data is available cohesive logistics plan is prepared for the proposed mission indicating airports and seaports of entry logistics base locations equipment requirements contractual requirements deployment timeline logistics plan is also used as the basis for identi fying what resources may be re deployed from other locations eg unlb brindisi to support mission deployment in addition the logistics plan forms basis for nego tiations with potential troop contributing nations tcn on their provision of co ntingent owned equipment coe the equipment that each individual troop contributo r is required to bring to the mission and selfsustainment services it is essential to c oordinate the force generation process with the logistic planning this occurs once troop contributors have been identified and detailed discussions have taken place between them and the secretariat ultimately note verbale is issued by the secretariat asking th potential contributor to provide contingent but this is only done once the secretar iat knows that the contributor in question responded positively problems that troop contributors might have in equi pping or supporting their contingents are also identified this is worked out on the basis of combination of the data given by the troop contributing country tcc and inspections carried out by dpko personnel oms recognizes that many member sta tes do not possess all of the equipment that is needed for todays complex peacek eeping operations and these are the arrangements for what is referred to as contingent owned equipment coe the uses template for each military organisati on from battalions to hospitals this can raise difficulties when the uni ts being offered by member states do not match the criteria being laid down and while there is some flexibility there remains requirement to ensure that the force that is being put together comes with the capability that is needed inevitably this means that there ar occasions on which some potential troop contributors find it difficult to meet the re quirement dry and wet lease in order to ensure that units being offered by memb er states come with the required capability there are number of options f or the provision of major equipment and their support these come under the headings of wet and dry lease and the option chosen is directly linked to the rate of reimbursem ent lesson 4mission life cycle 77 wet lease under wet lease arrangements contingent deploys w ith its coe and is responsible for its maintenance and support this c an be achieved in one of two ways the troop contributor provides the equipment relat ed minor equipment workshop support spares and maintenance personnel the provides accommodation storage facilities and utilities t he troop contributor is reimbursed at set rates one troop contributor provides the major equipment and second under bilateral arrangement provides the support again the provides storage facilities and utilities in this case the first troop contributor is reimbursed by the and the second under whatever bilateral arrangement has been made dry lease under dry lease arrangements contingent deploys w ith its coe but the makes arrangements for its support this can be ach ieved in number of ways under the first the troop contributor provides the equipment and the takes responsibility for the minor equipment support sp ares and maintenance the troop contributor receives reimbursement but obvio usly at much lower scale the troop contributor provides the equipment and th arranges for another to provide the support the former receives reimbur sement at the dry lease rate and the latter on scales laid down for mainten ance and support the troop contributor provides the equipment recei ves reimbursement at the dry lease rate and the provides the support via either local or an international contractor the preference for all parties is for the straight wet lease arrangement the gets the capability that it needs and the troop tributor receives reimbursement at the higher rate reimbursement is based on the assumpti on that individual personnel are equipped to minimum standard although the actual requirement may vary from one mission to another once the detailed negotiations with troop contribut ors are complete the mission staffing table is prepared all of the information developed so far is then used as the raw data needed to prepare draft budget for the new m ission if the mission is approved by the sc this draft budget in combination with the logistics plan forms the basis of request for the release of the advance funding nece ssary to ensure timely mission launch in view of the financial and operational significan ce of ensuring that contingents are correctly equipped dpko arranges to conduct in spections before deployment once this is completed memorandum of understanding is raised between the troop lesson 4mission life cycle 78 contributor and the this covers personnel majo r equipment sustainment and mission factors and is essentially statement of w hat each of the respective parties will provide at much the same time oms completes the p rocess of negotiating the status of forces agreement sofa5 with the states into which the mission is to be deployed in addition to being statement of the legal statu s of the personnel being deployed this encompasses number of other key as pects such as the level of host nation support that is available the status of mission agreement soma must be fina lized at the earliest and should provide for certain facilities for contracto rs providing services to the united nations including the prompt issuance of visas fr eedom of movement and the right to import for the use of the united nations supplies equipment and material free of tax or duties the final stage of the planning phase is the produc tion and issue of guidelines for troop contributors this document summarizes the ba ckground to the mission and its mandate sofa and personnel issues flow chart on premandate phase mission support is attached at the end of this lesson as annex deployment phase the objective of the deployment phase is the effect ive and economic deployment of new mission or expansion of an existing missi on this may involve the physical movement of small numbers of individual personnel ver relatively short distances or large numbers of troops and large quantities of equ ipment over great distances in accordance with timetable dictated by operational requirements the deployment phase is based on the logistics plan previously developed during the planning phase but it is often necessary to respond flexibly to unforeseen c hanges in circumstances or requirements continuous close cooperation with the dpko political and military staff the office of operations and logistics base on requirements and asset availability respectively therefore continues to be essential in addition it is necessary to liaise closely with troop and observercontributing membe r states to ensure that their contributions arrive in the mission area on time an d properlyequipped there are many detailed tasks that must be accompli shed during the deployment phase many of the activities are concurrent but th ey fall into two main categories those that need to be completed to deploy the basic infra structure and support and those associated with the deployment of the contingents t hemselves in this first category the key requirementstasks re the approval of the mission budget provision of mission living and working accommodati on 5 sofa is discussed later in this lesson lesson 4mission life cycle 79 establishment of the mission headquarters and it s associated communications support internal communications and edp systems recruitmenttransfer and deployment of internati onal staff to meet staffing table requirements and recruitment of local staff to meet staffing tabl requirements in the second category deployment of contingentsmilitary observerscivili an police forward deployment of contingentsmilitary observer scivilian police to operational locations within mission area establishment of lifesupport contracts continge nts are normally expected to deploy with 30 days self sufficiency in order to allow time to set up the appropriate contracts such as water food fuel and service support contracts to be established additionally this period can includ provision of mission transport requirements provision of missions transport requirements land air water and the installation of missionwide itedp systems the scale of the requirement for large mission h as some problem areas any delay in approval of the budget has an immediat effect on the procurement process there have been occasions on which equipme nt needed for setting up the headquarters has arrived after the personnel even the failure to provide fairly mundane items such as office equipment can have d isproportionate effect on headquarters effectiveness when delays occur in the provision of more critical items such as vehicles and communications the effectiveness of the mission as whole is affected this can occur due to insufficient assets in unlb as they d been allocated to other missions and it had not been possible to replace th em in the timeframe there is additional funding for stockpiling equipment aga inst future contingencies problems such as these can be overcome by diverting assets from other missions movement of contingents is responsibility that is funded on the basis that formed units will rotate every six months this is different for individuals who are expected to deploy for twelve months when there i s need to deploy large numbers of personnel and quantities of equipment ov er short period the pressure on strategic lift becomes considerable th attempts to use sea or ground lift as much as possible for the less essent ial items but major emphasis on airlift has significant implications for costs the ideal situation for the deployment phase is for the mission to be supported by military logistics that are able to deploy on com mensurate timeline and have there own integral protection experience has shown how difficult it is to find these assets and increasing reliance has been place d upon civilian contracts this carries penalty in terms of the time that it take s to set it up 6 to 8 weeks and the reduced flexibility of deployment in country lesson 4mission life cycle 80 mission startup kits containing critical operation material could be readied and warehoused centrally to offset procurement delays d uring the initial deployment phase in view of the fact that military logistics units re not readily provided by troop contributing countries it may be necessary to prov ide logistics support through commercial contractors another option is to use litary logistics units during the initial deployment phase and thereafter civilian contract ors the lead logistics agency at the beginning of this phase is oms at unhq but as the missions own headquarters becomes established its chief administrative officer takes increasing responsibility for the local logis tics support task the process of establishing the mission headquarters may be accele rated by the immediate deployment of startup team from oms such startup team i s granted the necessary financial delegations of authority at the earliest possible s tage and is likely to include logistics officer procurement officer property control offi cer and an officer with financial certifying authority at the minimum in typical year it can be assumed oms will be ta sked with launching one new mediumsized mission of about 5000 troops and 2 n ew small missions of 100300 observers the target time scale for deploying new missions taking the passing of the relevant scr as dday is as follows d day security council

deployment of advance logistics elements completed d45 to 60 contingents deploy other mission components deploy described mechanisms are designed to ensure that tr oop contributors arrive in the mission area with the appropriate personnel and equ ipment the main areas of interest are the deployment itself staffing arrangements fi nancial and logistic support and what equipment and services the will provide and by implication what it wont the system is intended to be proactive and able to reac t to changing requirements but while the can put the structure in place its effectiv eness is directly proportional to the support of member states lesson 4mission life cycle 81 getting contingents to the mission area is responsibility t he staff tables agreed during the planning phase are used as the basis for letti ng contracts for movement of personnel and equipment provision of accommodation and support in the mission rea and the setting up of contracts in order for the to meet its obligations for supporting the contingents few points that can cause difficulties first oms cannot begin to arrange the necessary sea andor airli ft contracts unless it receives detailed load list from the troopcontributing nation this must include every equipment type quantities weight dimensions and identifica tion of any dangerous cargo second the only funds the movement of contingents to the agreed number s anything above those numbers is national responsibility for both m ovement and support there is little flexibility for additional equipment in or der to ensure the appropriate levels of operational availability and effectiveness thi s is unlikely to exceed 10 and requires prior agreement with the through the force commander to the milad for military equipment and through the chief administrative officer cao for other items third the tour length for individuals and contingents is set at 12 month and 6 months respectively any movement costs incurred due to different nati onal policies fall to the individual tcc an adequate number of suitably qualified staff must be recruited and deployed to the mission area at the earliest opportunity the effectiveness of mission in its early days is affected by number of factors these are many of the challenges facing the force commander in melding his force together but the one thing that can be guaranteed to cause serious problems is ineffective logistic support the consequ ences of weak start in this area can be felt long after individual problems have been rectified and it is easy to see the difference between mission that has got its logistic act together and one that has not the cao is supported by staff drawn from number of sources regular staff members on temporary assignments to the field temporary staff members engaged solely and specifically fo r service in particular field mission these might be either international or local employe military personnel loaned to the for service in part icular field mission these might be either individuals or members of formed contingents in the former case the individual may be entitled to mission subsistence allowance msa while in the latter case the troop contributing nation tc n is reimbursed on per capita basis the logistics organisation within the mission area is designed t assume maximum responsibility and control where it is required the key per sonnel are the chief administrative officer cao and the chief logistics officer the responsibilities of the cao only the cao not even the srsg has authority to commit funds for any purpose lesson 4mission life cycle 82 contractual arrangements are set up to supply those items for which the has responsibility these include food water and fuel during the sustainment phase of the mission it is the uns responsibility to provi the material requirements on time and at minimum cost by letting contracts for goods in accordance with rules and regulations every effort is made to let contracts as early as possible but this can still take number of weeks hence the ne ed for contingents to deploy with 30 to 90 days selfsufficiency the actual pe riod is determined by the availability of resources on the local economy and is agreed in advance between oms and the troop contributor the cao normally has limit on the size of the tracts that heshe can let without reverting to oms for authority usually 50000 on his own authority or up to 20000000 with the authority of the miss ions local committee on contracts while designed to confer degree of fle xibility with accountability these sums clearly can not buy much support in this day and age for contractual needs above these limits the cao must seek unhq ap proval which adds more time to the process the general details of host nation support are work ed out during the negotiations of the sofa but experience has shown t hat the practical details create continuous process if the cao is to ensure that the necessary facilities and support are available and remain available missions initial budget was prepared during the planning phase it is subject to review in the light of the experiences nd new requirements identified during deployment any changes will be costed by th cao and his staff and submitted for approval through oms while the cao enjoys considerable degree of auton omy he must stay in regular contact with oms this ensures that he c an draw on the resources of the as whole and keep the secretariat appraised of any impending problems the cao is assisted by chief logistics officer wh is the focus for the detailed implementation of logistic support for the military component he is the senior military logistic staff officer on the force hq staff in th is capacity he is responsible for coordinating the logistic support for the contingen ts which include the setting up and running of logistic support and the establishment f logistic support framework provision of suitable infrastructure at seaports an d airports is necessary in the larger missions coordination of all logistic assets is on ly part of the problem the other essential step is to the early promulgation of clear guidelin and procedures to ensure that the logistic plan is supported by proper accounting for equipment and expenditure trols failure to do this has inevitable consequences for the effectiveness of the mission by the end of the deployment phase the aim is to ve fully established and functioning logistic support structure within the m ission area following logistics support arrangements should be in place at the end of the d eployment phase logistics organisation communications servicingr epair financialbudget systems construction and enginee ring services procurement system air transportation lesson 4mission life

technical support and the specialized units req uired can become critical factor in the ability to deploy mission in missi on areas in which there is an established infrastructure into which the can plug in it st ands to reason that there is less emphasis on the having to provide its own but i n those areas that have been subjected to major conflict or in which facilities just dont exist the problem can be huge the sort of support that is needed covers b road spectrum of functions ranging across runway repair air traffic control airport management and cargo handling movement control air port emergency services comm unications and communications repair and this is just for the airport beyond tha t there is need for transport helicopters construction and engineer services vehicle repair and servicing warehousing and distribution property control fuel storage handl ing testing and distribution and medical support etc getting this list of requirements all together fro m vast variety of sources and with limited funding takes time this is the time during which the deployment of the troops themselves is likely to be delayed one way of speeding up the process is for tccs to produce military qualified personnel as th would invariably be able to deploy much faster than the process of putting the functio ns out to civilian contract dpko recognizes that member states resources are limited when it comes to the more specialized units nonetheless this is always the p referred option at least in the shortterm until contracts can be established flow chart on deployment

4mission life cycle 87 scrupulously avoiding any action inconsistent with the standards of conduct required of them by their international status summary most support problems encountered in operations are the direct result of incomplete or superficial logistic planning thus it is critical that all logistic planners whether assigned by the contributing nation or by t he ensure that adequate mission analysis and surveys are performed before deploymen t once mission is approved the logistic planning requirement intensifies and must be constantly revised and managed until redeployment is complete although every m ission is different the steps in the planning process do not change and must be carried out properly if the mission is to be successful lesson 4mission life

lesson 5rapid deployment 97 introduction the challenge of deploying peacekeeping operatio n within 30 to 90 days of the adoption of security council resolution is consid erable few member states maintain such capability and it is very expensive under taking to sustain furthermore specialized support units for peacekeeping operat ion such as communications engineering transport maintenance and medical uni ts are difficult to assemble and organize on short notice experience has shown that although some units can come with complete support package in relatively timely man ner such as the standby high readiness brigade shirbrig most national contin gents now require the majority of their support from the united nations directly or t hrough letter of assist loa with other member states rapid deployment strategies are developed under th assumption that most of the military forces provided for peacekeeping operati on require all their strategic lift and most of their service support from the united natio ns civilian and police components would require all their support from the united nat ions effective deployment is defined as the minimum perational capability required for mission to begin implementing its mandate rapid and effective deployment of peacekeeping m ission requires the capability to deliver military troops and civilian police ser vice support and key civilian staff to the theatre of operations in timely manner rapid deployment and strategic reserve the objective of strategic reserve is to provide the organization with the capability to deploy peacekeeping missions within t he rapid deployment time frames in this regard the main components of peacekeeping op erations have been established as follows standby arrangements with member states for militar and civilian police personnel standby roster of key civilian personnel material reserve involving such items as vehicle s communications equipment and accommodation called strategic deplo

strategic deployment st ocks material reserve has been identified as key fea ture for ensuring operational readiness for rapid deployment of peacekeeping oper ations the components of strategic deployment stocks were determined through an analys is of criticality and time lines for procuring equipment and materials the components t hat were deemed critical and were not readily available within the rapid deployment t ime lines make up the strategic deployment stocks strategic deployment stocks are intended to meet op erational requirements for supporting the deployment of new peacekeeping missi ons in general strategic deployment stocks should consist of equipment that is new and has its full servicelife expectancy except for longlife equipment that is considered as good as new after reconditioning commodities in the office of mission support reserv must be assessed for use in strategic deployment stocks which could help defra costs or reduce procurement time the reserve consists of items that have become avai lable because of changes in an existing mission or the liquidation of mission t he reserve is not controlled stock however and could include items that have appli cability to the strategic deployment stocks hence there is guarantee that the reser ve can be counted upon as means to reduce the overall costs of strategic deployment st ocks to the full extent of its value equipment from the reserve considered suitable for strategic deployment stocks could be distributed to peacekeeping missions in ac cordance with their approved budgets missions that receive commodities from the reserve or from mission startup stocks will be required to defray the investment cost of strate gic deployment stocks by financing the replacement of such equipment strategic reserves strategic reserves are envisioned to enhance capability for rapid deployment large materials in stock or ready for deployment solid capability to support complex missions inclu ding for troops storage of material reserve and service contracts in order to deploy peacekeeping operation in 30 to 90 days the united nations has chosen number of options to deliver the key m aterials and support services for the establishment of new mission the organization wi ll prestore mission materials in its warehouses in unlb brindisi italy and ship them through prearranged contracts or it will enter into extensive prearranged service agree ments for materials such as vehicles and generators services such as fuel water and f ood and strategic lift when entering lesson 5rapid deployment 102 into contractual arrangements the united nations p ays retainer fees to vendors in order to ensure that they maintain the items in sto ck and are able to deliver them on demand retainer arrangements entail costs involvin g storage depreciation and other associated expenses incurred by the vendor these r etainer arrangements do not include procurement costs the united nations enters into fee service arrangements that accelerate procurement processes but reduce the rel iability of rapid delivery the material reserve is funded from onetime expendit ure budget which is established for the united nations logistics base unlb this woul d ultimately be replenished by mission budgets in addition maintenance of the ma terial reserve and service contracts is funded from the unlb

mission that receives them lesson 5rapid deployment 103 strategic deployment stocks at the united nations l ogistics base material readiness is key to rapid deployment of pe acekeeping operations the sds budget is onetime expenditure to finance sds stocks with an annual peacekeeping budget in excess of 3 billion the vel of sds represents relatively modest investment that could be essential in the ccess or failure of the organizations future endeavours in peacekeeping strategic deployment stocks sds critical items requiring long procurement lead t ime are prepurchased and maintained in brindisi

upfront procurement of strateg ic reserve materials for brindisi which require funding from onetime expen diture budget and mix of nofee and retainer contracts it does not rely heavily on contractors for the delivery of critical lesson 5rapid deployment 104 items and enables the delivery of most critical it ems within 3090 days from the upfront investment the remaining items which are purchase d using the premandate commitment authority and retainer and nofee cts may entail slightly longer period to deploy this provides reasonable guaran tee of timeliness with less longterm costs baseline of

requirements enhancement of the strategic deployment stocks at u nlb brindisi and increased capability at unlb entry into prearranged contracts and loas for key s ervices increased reliability of standby arrangements espe cially for support units improved personnel surge capacity particularly for staff in areas of administrative support although sds enhances the organizations rapid and effective deployment capacities it does not assure deployment within th 3090day deployment time frame this can only be achieved by the provision of fully selfsustaining and completely self sufficient troops provided by member states use of contractual services the procurementrelated leadtime involves acquisit ion production delivery shipping and other associated tasks while strategi c deployment stocks include many of the key items the secretariat will procure other m issioncritical items and services using precommitment authority through the following arra ngements underfee service

at brindisi unl b the peacekeeping missions have more recently been characterized by relatively short mandates with the respective missions lastin g only few years the material purchased to support these missions has involved in vestments of millions of dollars and has given rise to the question of reusing the equip ment left over from one mission to support another in view of the above it became nec essary to create storage facility to hold temporary surpluses resulting from the downsiz ing and closure of missions and to constitute standard supply of essential equipment required in the initial phase of future missions committee of experts examined the different prop osals and chose brindisi in italy as logistics base based on its geographica l position the communications network lesson 5rapid deployment 106 port airport railway and highways and the avail able services including telecommunications couriers etc on 23 november 1994 the united nations and the italian government signed memorandum of understan ding on 23 december 1994 the secretarygeneral announced the decision to open in brindisi the first permanent logistics base of the united nations unlb this arrangement has resulted in increased efficie ncy and considerable savings in addition the depots strategic location has helped to achieve lower costs of shipping to newly created missions and redistributing equipment the brindisi logistics base also provides satellite communications relay system pporting operations at united nations headquarters peacekeeping missions and number of other field offices on

secure reimbursement for ligible expenses the student is given an overview of how mission is funded steps in setting up budget and steps in getting it approved the methods of financing united nations peacekeepi ng operations vary depending on the type of operation and on the decis ions taken by the security council in respect to each all budgets of peacekeeping operat ions must be approved by the general assembly taking into account the advice of the adv isory committee on administrative and budgetary questions and the assemblys fifth c ommittee as another level of expertise consulted before approval the security council gives direction to the secreta rygeneral sg on the scope scale and duration of peacekeeping operation the sg delegates the responsibility for executing the security councils mandate to the und er secretarygeneral usg dpko who in turn delegates the task to the dpko office f operations oo this latter office with the assistance of the military planning servic mps turns the policy directives of the sc into specific operational requirements for among other things the logistics support of the required peacekeeping operation the logistics support requirements are mainly influenced by the tasks and capabilities req uired of the mission the geographic and climatic conditions in the mission area and th level of member state participation within dpko the office of mission support oms as it is known is responsible for providing all logistic support this is the key to ensuring that the secretariat presents plan that is both militarily sensible and logistica lly supportable lesson 6financing logistical support 126 61 finance finance for the direct support of peacekeeping ssion is provided through assessed contributions levied on member states in accordance with the relevant security council mandate in addition headquarterslevel ba ckup is financed partly from the regular budget and partly from the support account in all of these cases both the proposed budgets and the actual expenditures are sc rutinized by the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions acabq nd approved by the fifth committee of the general assembly sometimes these funds will be augmented or even replaced by mission or task specific trust funds these are usually scrutinized and controlled by the relevant donor member states missions may be financed in one of three different ways or by some combination of the three ways some missions are financed from the regular united nations budget however because military observers on such mission s are provided at cost to the by contributing countries it can be said that such missions are partly financed by such voluntary contributions of contributing countries mission may be financed by contributions assessed in accordance with formula determined by the general assembly this system of financing is applied to large number of current operations missions may also be financed entirely from volunta ry contributions the regular budget covers the routine running costs of the united nations excluding the specialized agencies and programm such as the united nations development programme and the world food programme it is reviewed by acabq and approved by the general assembly in 1999 the regular budget amounted to some 126 bn this pays for activities staff and ba sic infrastructure but not peacekeeping all member states are obliged to contribute to the regular budget on scale that is calculated on the basis of their individual share i n the world economy the maximum amount payable under these assessed contributions i s 25 and the minimum 0001 the peacekeeping operations budget is assessed sepa rately from the regular budget similar process of assessment is used but in this case it is weighted in that the permanent members of the security council pay more until recently member states are divided into 4 categories those in group d pay 10 of their assessed contribution those in group c 20 those in group b 100 and those in group pay the amounts not otherwise apportioned in order to offset the lower contributions in groups c d this amounts to just under 50 of the total recently revised version of this assessment was instituted it is very similar to the original cate gories but the number of groups has been increased to ten with each receiving discount bas ed on their relative economic strength the cost of peacekeeping has become contentious i ssue particularly in view of the increased number of operations that have taken plac from 1948 to 1988 there were 15 since 1988 the total has risen to 54 it has result ed in some member states accumulating substantial arrears which has significant impact upon the uns ability to reimburse troop contributors the actual cost of peacekeeping has gone through series of peaks and troughs in 1994 at the height of operations i n the former yugoslavia the bill was in the region of 35 billion dropping to 14 billio n in 1996 and around 1 billion in 1998 lesson 6financing logistical support 127 this reflected troop numbers that dropped from near ly 80000 to 14000 over the same period with the increased deployments since mid 19 99 inevitably the costs have risen again unlike national government the united nations s armed forces apart from what its members provide it specifically for each p eacekeeping operation therefore throughout this process the secretariat is in conta ct with potential troopcontributing countries in order to identify those which are prep ared to provide the necessary personnel and equipment once peacekeeping operation is underway troopco ntributing countries are reimbursed at fixed rates for the personnel they pr ovide and are also compensated for the depreciation of their equipment when member states do not pay theirs assessed contributions for peace keeping in full and on time one consequence is delay in these reimbursements to troopcontributing countries voluntary contributions are also regular feature of finance but they do not relate to peacekeeping other than in the context of specific services or equipment for which reimbursement is not anticipated as the name implies these are contributions made by member states on voluntary basis and they are generally associated with activities related to humanitarian aid and developm ent although this is not always the case it should be noted that voluntary contributio ns are not confined to states number of large corporations have made donations timewar ner 1 billion to development programmes 400 million from the worlds rotary cl ubs to help eradicate polio not to mention joint ventures such as the 20 year 15 bi llion project between the who and smithkline beecham to eradicate elephantiasis preparation of budget the terms of reference general considerations plan of action and the method of financing peacekeeping operation are found in the resolution of the security council establishing the operation andor in the related im plementation report of the secretary general submitted to the council at its request and approved by it the report also contains the secretarygenerals submission regardi ng the size of the force

number of contingents provided by selected countries upon the request of the secretarygeneral the contingents are selected in consultation with the security council and with the parties concerned bearing in mind the accepted principle of equitable geographic dis tribution the type and amounts of lesson 6financing logistical support 128 budget provisions for equipping force with the re sources it requires to carry out its task depend upon the extent to which participating conti ngents are selfsufficient and capable of supporting themselves administratively logistic ally and operationally the secretary general informs prospective troopcontributors of t he operational capability required for contingent d in cases of peacekeeping operations financed by assessed contributions the provisions for reimbursing troopcontributing gover nments are in accordance with the applicable rates and practices as approved by the g eneral assembly in respect of pay and allowances of troops stan dard rate is approved per troop month for all ranks plus supplementary rate per t roopmonth for limited number of specialists in respect of usage factor for personal clothing gear and equipment issued by governments to their troops standard rate per t roopmonth for all ranks for clothing and personal gear and equipment and supplementary rate per troopmonth for all ranks for personal weaponry and

general guidelines agreed upon with troop contributors after the amount for depreciation has been fully reimburs ed the ownership of the item vests in the united nations unless otherwise agreed upon for specific items death and disability awards provision is made for the reimbursement of payments made by troopcontributing governments based upon nation legislation andor regulations for death

for peacekeeping operations sho uld be as comprehensive as possible lesson 6financing logistical support 130 with all substantive components providing input pecially when peacekeeping mandate is being renewed or modified the steps to establish budget and to get it appro ved are sequential and are the same steps for all missions first political depar tments recommend an operation to the secretary general who approves that survey missi on be sent to the targeted area to evaluate mission requirements in terms of resources the secretary general then submits report to the security council which is prepared by the political departments this report indicates the participation level required b contributing member states based on this preliminary information the office f mission support prepares estimates for an overall future budget the office of the controller of office of mission support reviews these once these estimates meet ap proval the secretary general presents them to the security council his report i ncludes detailed estimate of required resources next the security council approves an peration for an initial period of time often six months given such approval as the final stage of setting budget the office of mission support prepares the final budget it is reviewed b the budget unit and submitted as the secretary generals proposed budget this final budget is reviewed by the acabq fifth committee and is resubmitted to the general assembly when the general assembly approves the budget the mission can be be gun finally it is the secretariat that has the ultimat authority to disperse funds for the approved operation and thereby it begins disburse ments as required 63 financial responsibilities within mission ar ea once funds are allocated for mission director of administration doa or chief administrative officer cao is appointed wh ereby the secretary general provides him with document entitled delegation f authority outlining what is expected as the proper functioning of the mission nd his role thereof the document specifies the financial limits of the mission this includes purchases of nonexpendable property and includes the authority to enter into s upport contracts plus limits on property survey and claims review the doacao is the principal adviser to the head of mission on all matters relating to its administration and actions in budg etary terms he is responsible for forecasting and planning financial requirements pervising the financial management systems exercising budgetary control and preparin g and submitting budget estimates for the mission in essence he is responsible for reco nciling all financial requirements of the mission with all that is carried out on the mission to carry out and supervise the daytoday reconcili ation of financial details the doacao appoints chief finance officer as his mai n financial assistant the chief finance officer has number of responsibilities h approves mission payments and lesson 6financing logistical support 131 maintains mission accounts he coordinates and supe rvises the preparation and production of budget estimates and program budgets for the mission finally he is the one to ensure full implementation of and complianc with all existing united nations financial rules regulations instructions and proc edures laid down in the united nations financial manual 64 procurement activities all procurement activities contracts for purchase rental or sale of services supplies equipment or other requirements entered into by the are governed by the financial regulations and rules procurement polici and procedures for the purchase receipt management and disposal of equipment are c ontained in the procurement manual the mission engages in this method of acqui sition either through headquarters in new york or locally only officials duly authorized by the can enter into acquisition activities this includes contracts the invitation of proposals or tenders and negotiation with potential suppliers or purchasers on the basis of detailed sp ecifications the duly authorized individuals on mission are the doacao or head of mission mission committee on contracts also known as local committ ee on contracts is formed to assist the doacao or the head of mission the contingents of member states participating in mission are not allowed to enter into procurement activities in the name of th unless authorization in written form or as note verbale agreed to between he adquarters in new york and the respective government if contingent enters into procurement activities without such prior approval the mission is not liable to refund the member state or contract source types of acquisitions the following types of acquisitions are available to the mission through the authority of the doacao and head of mission purchase order may be processed locally within pr eagreed financial limits for an authorized local vendor direct provisioning document blanket purchase or der on an openended contract may be issued as requisition against an existing approved local or pre approved contract local contract may be issued for supplies or serv ices that are within the mission financial limitations an accelerated procurement may be generated for nee ds that are urgent in which local funds are used to buy materials offtheshelf lesson 6financing logistical support 132 when required item exceeds the mission financial limits draft requisition is drawn up approved and sent to headquarters in new york for processing when required letter of assist loa may be requ ested through headquarters this is contracting document that i s entered into with member states military or government as source of suppl to satisfy the original demand the type and method of procurement used depends on the mission budget financial limitations sources of supply andor its urgency guidance for choosing the method of acquisition is provided in the procur ement regulations and rules of the united nations and in the field administrat ion manual 65 reimbursement procedures financial agreements with the are normally inclu ded as part of the agreement negotiated between respective contributing states nd the an agreement known as the model agreement among other matters the agreement details the financial responsibilities of each party since the covers major costs of mission when calculating costs to be charged to the recovery is generally sought only for the additional expenses that fell to the contributing m ember state in some cases this may equal the full cost of providing service where c apital purchase was involved the full cost is appropriate for reimbursement full account ing of all expenses to be reimbursed by the will be required before payment can be au thorized lack of supporting documentation results in delay or nonreimbursement of the expense there are exceptions to the reimbursement process for example there are rare occasions when member state decides not to seek r ecovery of legitimate expenses from the or as an alternative to direct reimburseme nt the may at times agree that costs incurred be credited against member nation s assessed contributions more commonly member state can decide to deploy more assets than the has requested both parties understand that the additional resourc will be funded by the nation concerned and remain under the direct control of t he nation concerned or at times deployments contain costs that the did not agree to reimburse thus before introducing new equipment or implementing improveme nts for deployed troops participating nations are advised to enquire from u n headquarters whether the expense would be reimbursed the practice of the is that most reimbursement i s authorized through headquarters in new york after the presentation of the necessary documentation by the contributing nation the prime document used to sup port claims for the reimbursement of costs associated with equipment is the inout surve lesson 6financing logistical support 133 66 property control and inventory in terminology property is defined as all of th supplies equipment buildings and land belonging to or entrusted into the charge of the mission or elements of the mission whether acquired by purchase rental loan donation or by some other means categories of equipmentproperty equipmentproperty deployed in support of contin gents are categorized as follows first there is owned equipment unoe which is all equipment supplies and property purchased and maintained by the second there is contingent owned equipment coe which is equipment provided by contributing member state but mainta ined by the the quantity and types of contingent owned equipment provided to the are set out in agreements between the and the contributing member state wnership of contingent owned equipment is retained by member states next there is national owned equipment noe whic h is equipment not approved by the but which the member state cons iders essential for its own security communications medical or welfare purposes suppor t and financial responsibility for such equipment remains the member states responsib ility finally there is host nation owned equipment hnoe which is provided by the host government whether such equipment is owne d leased or otherwise acquired by the host nation for the use of the mission the is responsible for maintaining it 67 in and out survey in survey to determine its liability for reimbursement for co ntingent owned equipment the requires an inventory which shows among oth er details the value of each item deployed to mission site by contributing nation known as an in survey this inventory which is prepared prior to deployment p rovides details of all vehicles stores and equipment deployed upon arrival to the mission site all contingent owned equipment is checked against that listed in the in survey document once this check is completed the in survey becomes the prime accounti ng document and is used to assess liability for reimbursement lesson 6financing logistical support 134 out survey the in survey is maintained for the duration of c ontingents deployment with adjustments being progressively made as contingent operating equipment issues and receipts are posted it is also adjusted to reflect progressive writeoffs of stores and equipment as they occur at the time contingent is ready to redeploy final inspection of all contingent owned equipment is conducted by representative of the doacao office at this time the out survey columns of the inout survey document are completed and the condition of the equipment is rec orded this document now showing the status of the equipment and stores upon arrival in and departure from the mission site forms the basis for contingents consumption and preciation claims to be reimbursed by the steps for completing the out survey is as follows contingents first complete the out survey then the field operation divisions pro perty control and inventory unit conducts the out inspection and provides assistance in compiling the final inout survey document as required next contingents forward th completed certified inout survey document to their respective governments who forwa rd the original copy to headquarters in ny 68 writeoff of equipment the doacao will normally be given authority to wri teoff property on mission to the value of us 1500 the local proper ty survey board which is established by the doacao normally has the author ity to writeoff property to the value of us 2500000 losses greater than this am ount are referred to headquarters in ny for consideration by headquarters property rvey board military units are responsible for initiating write off procedures and forwarding the necessary paperwork in larger mission these papers are forwarded to the chief logistics officer while for smaller missions this is forwarded to the doacao civilian units and personnel must submit writeoff proposals directly to the doacao depending on the amounts involved the chief logist ics officer or the daocao in turn forwards the writeoff documentation to the cretary of the local property survey board or to headquarters property survey board 69 letters of assist loa when essential items or services are not available through commercial sources within mission area requisition known as tter of assistance loa is drawn up to obtain it from the most appropriate source of pply which is usually the government of the contingent which requires the item letter of assist loa is contracting document issued by the united nations to government to provide goods or services to u nited nations peacekeeping operations the may agree in the letter of assis t lesson 6financing logistical support 135 to purchase goods or services from government or to authorize government to supply goods or servic to its own military contingent in united nations peacekeeping operati on subject to the united nations reimbursing the government for the cost of goods or services reimbursement for an item provided is always proces sed through headquarters the authority to approve letter of assistance rem ains with omsdpko hq ny summary the prime financial concerns of member states contr ibuting to mission are first determining sources of funding and second t he reimbursement of expenses incurred contributing nation first needs to know whether funds allocated to mission will be sufficient to provide the required logistic support in the field and secondly whether the will be capable of reimbursing costs incurred in deploying their contingents with adequate planning and careful fin ancial management at all levels the is normally capable of meeting its commitments b oth to sustain forces and to reimburse member nations because member nations wi sh to receive reimbursement in timely fashion they generally agree to carry out t he financial management procedures as

the completion of all res idual administrative and support tasks such as the closure of accounts fina lization of property records and survey cases settlement of claims etc limiting factors during the early stages of liquidation there is usu ally requirement for number of substantive components of field mission to tinue to function concurrently therefore liquidation planning incorporates suppor t requirements to carry out ongoing substantive or other operational activities the existence of liquidation team necessitates t he continued provision of certain administrative and other support functions usually during the entire liquidation period every effort is made to establish to the extent po ssible alternative contractual or other suitable arrangements with view to minimizing sup port staff requirements nevertheless the overall size of the liquidation t eam has always to be carefully weighed in light of the resulting administrative support re quirements the size of the liquidation team decreases rapidly during the initial winddown phase thereafter and until the closure process is completed the team size should remain comparatively small with very limited intrinsic support capacity it is essential that projects which were started s result of missions mandate will only be continued if they are of direct releva nce to the liquidation process all other projects are either terminated or handed over to ot her entities agencies igos inter governmental organisation or ngos nongovernmental organisation liquidation plan the liquidation of mission is carried out in acc ordance with financial rules and regulations the staff rules the personnel fi nance and procurement manuals the field administration manual and other applicable directives and reference documents generally the following sequential step s and associated typical tasks need to be performed identify all tasks associated with the liquidation of field mission and establish comprehensive list of all

authority g execute the liquidation plan and monitor all relate d activities performed initially in the mission area and later at remote site usually headquarters in new york although in certain cases facilities at the logistics base at brindisi italy may be used responsibilities clear lines of responsibility must be established d uring the development of liquidation plan it is most important that all liq uidation activities are properly coordinated among all components of the field missi on as well as between the field mission and hqoms the prime responsibility for the conduct of the liquidation processes rests with the field mission whilst unhq provides overall guidance and advice on policy and administrative procedures as and when requested responsibility focal points must be established for the various li quidation tasks their composition and responsibilities are in field missions 1 the head of mission who has overall responsibility for developing and implementing the
