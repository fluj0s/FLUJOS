patterson for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary mission pakistan warmly welcomes your arrival in islamabad you are arriving in the midst of largely selfinflicted political turmoil following the supreme courts decision to disqualify from public office nawaz and shahbaz sharif political rivals of president asif zardari zardari engineered the sharifs disqualification and followed that with placing his partys governor in power in the punjab provincial government to replace shahbaz sharif at the moment there are multiple efforts to reconcile zardari with the sharifs and to elect replacement for chief minister punjab unless the punjab issue is resolved by march 12 planned lawyers demonstrationthat is backed by the sharifscould become violent you thus will find your interlocutors distracted by domestic politics at time when the gop is struggling to meet imfimposed fiscal targets and militants are increasing their control over both the tribal areas and swat once idyllic tourist destination 90 miles from islamabad 2 c you will be meeting with key interlocutors in our efforts to press the gop for prosecution of the mumbai detainees assistance in effecting the release of kidnapped americans john solecki and david rohde and expanding law and order cooperation the issue of fbi access to the mumbai suspects remains very sensitive decision to send an investigative team to new delhi currently rests on whetherhow india responds to pakistans 32 requests for additional information president zardari has overreached in this current political crisis but he remains secular proamerican and our best ally in pakistan right now he likely will assure you that he has established new antiterrorism court that will deliver convictions on mumbai zardari will request additional usg support for the northwest frontier province nwfp police we will brief you on our train and equip plans for this critical part of our counterterrorism strategy 3 c dg isi pasha whom you met in last weeks bilateral and trilateral strategic review in washington continues to profess determination to end isis overt and tacit support for proxy forces in the tribal areas afghanistan and kashmir interior minister malik is zardaris point man on law and order and also serves as political negotiator malik is very supportive of the us but he wants to control every key issue personally making it difficult for his staff to take any decisions without his approval intelligence bureau ib director general suddle was personally selected for the job by zardari after bungled attempt to place isi under the ministry of interior zardari brought ib firmly under his control federal investigative agency fia director general tariq khosa is wellrespected cop but he must work through moi malik end summary domestic situation 4 c the civilian government headed by president asif zardari and prime minister yousaf gilani elected one year ago has been fairly stable however president zardari has been preoccupied with his political rival former prime minister nawaz sharif on february 25 pakistans supreme court ruled that both nawaz and his brother shahbaz sharif are ineligible to hold public office zardari followed that decision by appointing his partys governor to rule in the punjab pakistans most important province pending elections to replace shahbaz sharif as chief minister this has sparked countrywide protests and general political unrest nawaz sharif is by far the most popular politician in pakistan with an 83 approval rating compared to zardaris 20 in the latest iri poll but he does not have the votes to bring down the government instead nawaz sharif is using popular outrage at the supreme court decision and governors rule to launch street protests zardari may win the shortterm tactical battle against nawaz however nawaz is gaining ground by comparing zardaris highhanded rule to that of former president musharraf nawaz sharif is inspiring street demonstrations to coincide with lawyers long march on march 1216 the chance for violence and chaos is likely during continued street protests 5 c although we do not believe pakistan is failed islamabad 00000454 002 of 004 state we nonetheless recognize that the challenges the state confronts are dire the government is losing more and more territory every day to foreign and domestic militant groups deteriorating law and order in turn is undermining economic recovery the bureaucracy has settled into thirdworld mediocrity as demonstrated by corruption and limited capacity to implement or articulate policy the court and legal system is slow to the point of inertia due to almost nonexistent case management these problems extend to law enforcement agencies where the police are underpaid lack technical capacity and face stiff political pressures security 6 c the good news is that the armyfrontier corps are engaged in combat in the fata and have just declared victory after six month long battle in the bajaur agency zardari is committed to the fight he knows that osama bin laden has publicly targeted pakistan and admits the militants are after and my job the bad news is that the militants increasingly are setting the agenda the governments antiterrorism strategy is based on dialogue deterrence and development however it lacks the military capacity to deter militants and the financial resources to develop the fata and nwfp its historic fallback has been to play for time by conducting negotiations with militants disastrous tactic that only has made the extremists stronger the government insists it will negotiate with tribal leaders but not with militants 7 c however in the latest agreement in swat once tourist resort approximately 90 miles from islamabad the provincial government agreed to negotiate for peace in exchange for imposition of sharia law with the taliban this was recognition of defacto taliban control which produced beheadings closure of girls schools growing exodus of terrified citizens and the desertion of outgunned and outmanned police hamhanded military tactics which included indiscriminate artillery bombardment have further alienated population that simply wants the fighting to end in just few short weeks the deal is already proving to be an unpalatable one with the militants demanding more ground and continuing violence against the civilian government 8 c the militarys decision in 2008 to strike deal with pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud in south waziristan helped to reduce the number of suicide bombings in pakistan but gave mehsud free rein to infiltrate his forces throughout the federally administered tribal areas fata he has exploited sectarian tensions and sent his fighters into bajaur via afghanistan to attack government positions this has eroded chief of army staff general kayanis strategy to gradually regain control of the fata agency by agency rival pakistani taliban leaders mehsud maulvi nazir and gul bahadur have formed new alliance which they claim will focus on crossborder attacks as recent media reports indicate the us has been remarkably successful in disrupting alqaida operations in pakistans tribal areas in the past year 10 of the top 20 alqaida operatives including those responsible for the east africa embassy bombings in 1998 and tied to islambads marriott bombing have been eliminated policelaw enforcement 9 sbu although pakistani security forces are now engaged in active combat against extremists they lack the capability to deal with militants and criminal activity in the fata and nwfp the resulting decrease in security is impeding our efforts to implement development projects in support of critical us national goals of eliminating terrorist safe havens in pakistan and stabilizing afghanistan while there is need for pakistani military action now to deal with the large number of heavily armed militants operating in the border areas the longterm solution to ensuring law and order throughout the country lies primarily with the civilian law enforcement agencies not the military to strengthen civilian law enforcement state departments bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement inl expanded program in 2009 involves two tracks the first focusing on establishing gendarmerie style force in nwfp suited for islamabad 00000454 003 of 004 engaging and defeating heavily armed militants and criminal gangs the second track involves expanding the current icitap dsata and other efforts in providing specialist and advanced training to specific elements of the pakistani police establishment 10 sbu in conjunction with inls police program the department of states antiterrorism assistance program ata will focus on providing expanded training and consultation opportunities to the nwfp balochistan and federal areas to expand rapidly the gops antiterrorist capabilities this expanded training will focus on building tactical technical and investigative skill sets in specialized pakistani law enforcement agencies training for these and other units will focus on hard skill tactical training ie protecting vips quick reaction forces explosives detectiondisposal most urgently needed by the gop given the deteriorating security environment that it confronts there will also be an expanded effort to develop national and provinciallevel forensics and investigative capabilities and antikidnapping procedures ata was instrumental in establishing and funding the fias special investigative group sig in 2007 ata offered to fund expansion of the sig by 100 officers and pay salaries for the new officers we still await an official response from moi 11 c through the rewards for justice program the usg is ready to assist pakistan in establishing national safety hotline through which moi can collect information from pakistani citizens on terrorists and plannedexecuted terrorist incidents in pakistan the gop would serve as the public front of the rewards program all us funding and cooperation would remain discreet the gop would serve asthe conduit for any eventual reward payments and dod mist team has developed media campaign in support of the rewards program the gop will provide daily logistical and administrative support rso will provide to administrative personnel to assist in collecting the tip information visa processing 12 c post911 changes to improve us border security have dramatically increased the length of time it takes pakistani citizens to obtain us visitor visas the local press and many politicians repeatedly criticize delays in visa processing and difficulties encountered at us ports of entry often citing them as examples of us bias against pakistan on practical level the delays impair us efforts to train law enforcement and military personnel and to promote exchanges and academic programs with civilian authorities while the usg does not comment on the reasons for the delay pakistan authorities know that an interagency security clearance process which includes the fbi is the main factor you may hear complaints about this issue during your meetings in islamabad as well as calls for more effort on the us part to improve the process mumbai 13 c indopak tensions are still simmering but to avoid potential indian military strike the gop needs to continue to show progress on prosecuting those lashkaretaiba let operatives responsible for the mumbai attacks on february 12 the gop filed official charges against 13 suspects including let leaders javed iqbal laqvi zarrar shah and abu alqama currently the federal investigative agency fia has at least 7 of these suspects in custody and they face charges under pakistans penal code cyber crimes regulations and the antiterrorism act india has welcomed the gop decision to file formal charges against the key masterminds of mumbai islamabad now awaits an indian response to requests for additional information 32 questions including request for forensics ballistics reports etc from new delhi to support prosecution based on the indian response pakistan will consider sending an fia team to new delhi to follow up we should encourage that team to go to new delhi and continue to press for additional closures of let camps and jamaatuddawa charitable activities particularly in punjab the issue of fbi access to the mumbai detainees remains politically sensitive one you will want to raise directly with moi malik islamabad 00000454 004 of 004 kidnapping cases 14 s the embassy appreciates ongoing fbi support to resolve significant number of kidnapping cases involving amcits in pakistan we will update you on current efforts to secure the release of unhcr representative john solecki and new york times reporter david rohde video of mr solecki was released on february 13 which was accompanied by statement demanding the release of baloch prisoners in the hands of the government the baloch liberation united front bluf previously unknown group is holding solecki and made fresh demands on march 1 that all incarcerated women be released within 72 hours or bluf will kill solecki the gop continues to insist that brahamdagh bugti baloch separatist leader is responsible for the kidnapping patterson
