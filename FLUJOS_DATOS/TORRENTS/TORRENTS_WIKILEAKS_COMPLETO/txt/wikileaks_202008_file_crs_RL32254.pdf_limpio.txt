federal tax burden on sm all firms and its implications for their performance and rates of formation and gr owth is one of those policy issues that never seems to vanish from congresss legisla tive agenda continuing c ongressional interest in the issue has set the stage for the enactment of string of legislative initiatives in the past decade or so to reduce this burden the 110th congress like many of its predecessors is considering various propos als to expand current small business tax preferences or create new ones this report describes the principal federal tax benefits for small firms and examines the economic arguments for and ag ainst them it will be updated when new benefits are added to the fe deral tax code or current one s are modified or repealed while the federal revenue cost of existing small business tax preferences is not known estimates of the revenue lost because of federal ta x expenditures indicate that this cost could exceed 11 billion in fy 2007 according to the treasury department and joint committee on taxation the followi ng small business tax benefits have the broadest reach outside agriculture the taxation of small firms as passthrough entities the graduated rate structure for the corporate income tax the expensing allowance for equipment unde r section 179 of the inte rnal revenue code the exemption of some small corporations from the corporate alternative minimum tax cash basis accounting and the exclusion fro m taxation of capital gains on the sale or disposition of certain small business stock these benefits raise numerous interesting and significant policy issues for many economists key issue is whether or not preferential tax treatment for small firms can be justified on economic grounds if such justification cannot be found then proposals to further enhance small business tax preferences may distort the allocation of economic re sources among sectors proponents of targeting tax re lief at small firms say such relief is justified for several reasons first they claim that small firms create singular opportunities for social and economic advancement sec ond proponents point to evidence that rates of small business formation are sensitive to tax rates third small firms account for significant shares of national income j obs and technological innovations fourth they can serve as powerful agents for econo mic renewal and structural change and last but not least proponents maintain th at small firms face constraints on their ability to raise capital in debt and equity markets that do not apply to most large established firms critics of small business tax preferences ar gue that it is difficult to justify them on economic gr ounds they say such preferences lessen the progressivity of the federal income tax and raise the return on small business investment in ways that undermine social welfare in addition cr itics contend that some small business tax preferences are inappropriate or poorly signed

va nish from the congressional legislative agenda one such issue is the federal tax burden on small firms and its effect on their performance and prospects for growth many lawmakers view small firms as whole as vital and indispensable source of job creation economic opportun ity and technological innovation many of these same individuals regard current federal taxation of sm all firms both as barrier to their formation and drag on th eir growth and as policy instrument for stimulating their rates of formation and growth such dual perspective has facilitated the enactment of variety of small business tax benefits in recent decades in addition the 110th congress is considering numbe r of proposals to further reduce the tax burden on small busin ess by enhancing some cu rrent small business tax benefits creating new ones or simplifying tax compliance for small firms existing small business tax benefits and proposals to enhance or expand them raise several policy issues one is the substantial resources transferred to small firms through such subsidies and the longterm economic effects of this transfer statements made by some lawmakers suggest that they think the longterm economic benefits of small bus iness tax preferences outweigh th eir shortterm revenue cost another key policy issue concerns whethe r these preferences can be justified on economic grounds if such rationale ca nnot be found or if it appears tenuous at best then small business tax preferences may end up harming social welfare in the long run this report explores these issues by examining the main small business tax preferences and the economic arguments for and against them it begins with brief description of current federa l tax preferences for small firms then reviews what is known about the economic role of small firms and conc ludes with discussion of the principal economic arguments for and against these subsidies firm size how small is small when considering the ways in which the federal tax code favors small firms and what is known about the economic role of small firms it is useful to understand how small firms are defined for tax purposes crafting such definition in manner that is widely accepted is challenge as there is uniform definition of small firm in the many federal laws and regulations offering assistance to small busin ess instead several criteria are used tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32254crs2 1 15 usc 632a1 2 see httpapp1sbagovfaqs 3 ibididentify the firms that qualify for the benefits it is not clear from the language of these laws and regulations why such variation exists the absence of uniform definition of small firm may have its roots in the small business act pl 85 536 as amended which defi nes small firm as one that is independently owne d and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation1 the act goes on to specify that the definition of small firm may vary from industry to industry to reflect importa nt structural diffe rences among those industries2 under the act the small business administration sba has the authority to establish and alter if necessary the size standards and limits for determining eligibility for federal programs to assist small business many of which are administered by the sba all federal agencies administering programs to set aside certain proportion of pr ocurement contracts for sma ll firms are required to use sba size standards and limits but for other small business programs federal agencies have the choice of using sba size standards and limits or establishing their own in general three criteria are used to identify the firms eligible for federal small business programs each specifies the maximum size firm including affiliates can attain and still participate in the programs to which the criterion applies for the most part the sba uses two criteria to determine eligibility for the programs it administers 1 number of employees and 2 av erage annual receipts in the previous three years application of these criteria varies by industry for example the sole criterion for most manufacturing and mining firms is employment size and the upper limit is 500 employees by contrast for most retail and service firms the sole criterion is average nnual receipts and the upper limit is 6 million sbas current size limits for small firms range from 075 million to 285 million for average annual receipts and fro m 100 to 1500 for number of employees3 the sba administrator has the authority to modify size standards for particular industries before proposed change can ta ke effect sbas office of size standards oss must undertake economic studies of th affected industries focusing on the degree of competition average firm size st artup costs barriers to entry and the distribution of sales and employment by firm size and use the results to make recommendations to sbas size policy bo ard if the board agrees with the recommendations then it normally advises the administrator to approve the proposed change third criterion used by federal agencies is asset size under this standard eligible firms would own assets up to certain threshold such as 50 million among federal programs granting special benefits to small business use of this criterion is more limited than the number of employees or average annual receiptshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32254crs3 4 according to one source the internal revenue code contains at least 24 different definitions of small business see doug k barney chris bjornson and steve wells just how small is your business national public accountant aug 2003 pp 46how does the federal tax c ode define small firm again there is uniform definition instead variety of criteria ar used to determine eligibility for current small business tax preferen ces and there is obvious reason why the size limit varies from one preference to the next4 some preferences rely on asset size receipt size or employment size to select eligible firms others confer benefits on small firms not through specified size standard but through the design of the preference itself case in point is the small bus iness expensing allowance under section 179 of the internal revenue code irc lthough allowance is not limited to firms of particular size its design effectively confines its benefits to relatively small firms the lack of uniform definition of sm all firm in the federal tax code has its advantages and disadvantages on the one hand it can lead to firm being eligible for some small business tax preferences but not for others on the other hand the absence of uniform definition gives lawmakers flexibility in crafting tax benefits for small firms regardless of the practical consequences of the lack of uniform definition it makes firm size flexible c oncept that lawmakers can reshape almost without limit to suit their legislative aims main federal tax benefits for small business in general all business income is bject to federal taxation but not all business income is treated equally under the federal tax code its tax treatment can differ in several ways the taxation of business income depends on whether or not firm is organized for tax purposes as corporation corporat net income is taxed twice at the firm level and then at the shareholder level whereas the net income of passthrough entities such as s corporations sole pr oprietorships limited liability companies or partnerships is taxed once t the shareholder level in addition the taxation of business income depends on whether or not corporation or the owners of passthroug h entities pay the alternative minimum tax amt corporations or business owners paying the amt may be taxed at lower marginal rates than their counterparts payi ng the regular corporate income tax the tax burden on business income so depends on how investments are financed for example the returns to cor porate investments financed solely by debt are subject to lower marginal effective tax rates than the returns to investments financed solely by equity because corpor ations may deduct interest payments from taxable income but not dividend payments firm size is another factor affecting the tax treatment of business income various provisions of the fede ral tax code offer benefits to smaller firms that are not available or of lesser value to larger fi rms the code makes explicit or formalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32254crs4 5 in fy2007 the estimated combined revenue loss for seven of the most important small business tax preferences is 11445 billion it pertains to the following seven small business tax preferences 1 expensing of depreciable business property 2 reduced rates on the first 10 million of corporate taxable income 3 cash accounting outside agriculture 4 the partial exclusion of capital gains on the sale of certain small business stock 5 the amortization of business startup costs 6 th tax credit for new retirement plan expenses of small

for more details on the taxation of non corporate businesses see crs report rl31538 passthrough entities not taxed as corporations by jack h taylordistinction between the taxation of small and large firms in that it does not have separate sections for small and large fi rms rather the code contains numerous provisions scattered throughout its many ch apters that confer preferential treatment on relatively small firms but not on relativel large firms most of these provisions come in the form of deductions exclusi ons and exemptions credits deferrals and preferential tax rates in general tax pr eferences such as these lower the cost of capital for new investment by eligible firms relative to non eligible firms certain other provisions benef it small firms by reducing the co st and or burden of complying with tax laws or by making tax relief c ontingent on providing certain fringe benefits to employees the federal small business tax subsid ies with the broadest reach outside agriculture are described below excluded from the list are subsidies targeted at small firms in specific industries such as life insurance banking and energy production or distribution it is not known what the total revenue cost is for the subsidies discussed below nevertheless recent estimates by the joint committee on taxation jct and the treasury departme nt indicate that they reduced federal revenue by over an timated 11 billion in fy20075 taxation of passthrough entities business enterprises operate in variety of legal organizational forms the business laws of each state determine the range of available choices for federal tax purposes five such forms are widely used subchapter c corporations subchapter s corporations sole proprietorships partnerships and limited liability companies llcs firms organizational form has important implications for the taxation of its earnings the earnings of c corporations are taxed twice once at the corporate level and again at the individual level when the earnings are distributed to shareholders or owners as dividends or realized capital gain s by contrast the earnings of all other business entities are taxed only once at the individual level of their owners or shareholders as result these entities are often referred to as passthrough entities their earnings are not taxed at the entity level but pass through to the owners6

times greater than that of the average s corporation8 whether business owner would be bette r off operating as c corporation or as passthrough entity is often complicat ed decision involving host of tax and nontax considerations ke nontax considerations in clude the legal liability of shareholders access to capital markets and degree of shareholder control of management foremost among the tax considerations are the relative tax rates for corporate income individual ordinary in come and longterm capital gains the investment horizon of investor s the holding period for co rporate stock and the rate at which corporate profits are paid out as dividends setting aside nontax considerations for th moment one can see that the current mix of individual and corporate tax rates favors passthrough entities by small margin for investors in the highest income tax bracket such group offers an appropriate focus for this analysis because many small business owners are subject to the highest marginal income tax rate few simple calculations prove this point in 2007 the top personal tax rate is 35 mo st corporate profits are taxed at 35 and the top tax rate on longterm capital gains is 159 assuming an investment horizon of one year after which the firms assets are liquidated tax considerations alone would dictate that highincome i nvestors would be better off owning business

assets are liquida ted after five years and individuals in the top tax bracket can earn pretax rate of return of 20 whether the business is operated as partnership or corporation partnerships would earn higher aftertax rate of return than cor porations 130 versus 11311 nonetheless it would be incorrect to view the taxation of passthrough entities as small business tax benefit the reason is that firms size has bearing on its eligibility to ope rate as passthrough entity firms that are relatively large in employment revenue or asset size are organized as s corporations or partnerships while firms that are relatively small in those measures operate as c corporations in 2003 16 of s corporations and 7 of partnerships filing federal income tax returns reported business receipts of 1 billion or more while 22 of c corporations filing federal income tax retu rns reported business recei pts of less than 25 million12 any tax advantage presently held by small passthrough entities may prove ephemeral as it has in the recent past for instance their present advantage would shift to corporations if legislation were enacted that sharply reduces the top corporate and longterm capital gains

gary guenther the limitation is higher in the case of property used in certain economically distressed areasgraduated rates of 15 to 34 are limited to corporations with taxable incomes under 335000 this graduated rate structure mainly benefits corporations that are relatively small in employment or asset size because their taxable incomes are likely to stay below the 335000 threshold it also gives owners of closely held small firms an added incentive to incorporate in order to shield any profits from higher individual tax rates but not all small corporations are allowed to take advantage of the reduced rates specifically the taxable income of corporations providing services in the fields of health care law engineering ar chitecture accounting actuarial science the performing arts and consulting is taxed at fixed rate of 35 regardless of the amount the graduated rate structure is not w ithout drawbacks specifically it gives smaller corporations disincentive to grow to the extent that their incomes are taxed at rates above 34 in this sense th higher rates serve as tax on growth the revenue loss arising from the re duced rates on the first 10 million of corporate taxable income came to an estimated 43 billion in fy200713 expensing allowance for certain depreciable business assets expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciation for tax purposes it entails treating the cost of depreciable asset such as machine or building as an ordinary and necessary expense rather than as capital expenditure ordinary and necessary costs are deducted in the year in which they are incurred whereas capital costs normally are recovere d over longer periods by applying the depreciation methods and schedules allowe d in the federal tax code under section 179 of the internal reve nue code irc firms may expense or deduct up to 250000 of the cost of qualified business property mainly machinery and equipment and computer so ftware placed into service in 2008 and write off the

starting in 2011 and each year thereafter the maximum llowance is scheduled to drop to 25000 owing to rule known as the dollar limita tion not all firms are able to take advantage of the expensing

firms that are relatively small in revenue asset or employment size because of the phaseout threshold in addition the allowance stimulates investment by firms that can take advantage of it by ferring taxes on part or all of the firstyear returns to investment in qualified assets this deferral yields zero marginal effective tax rate on the returns to this investment through the standard economic model for the determination of the user cost of capital15 in fy2007 the allowance produced an estimated revenue loss of 32 billion16 the revenue effects of the expensing allowance in particular year depend on the level of business inves tment in that year in periods of rising business investment the allowance typically produces net reve nue loss but when business investment falls following period of sustained expans ion the allowance can actually yield net revenue gain this shift from loss to gain reflects the timing of depreciation deductions under expensing some firms write off the entire cost of an asset in its first year of use by claiming the sec tion 179 expensing allowance leaving depreciation deductions to offset fu ture income earned by the asset exemption of certain sm all corporations from the corporate alternative minimum tax under current federal tax law many corporations must compute their income tax liability under both the regular tax nd the alternative minimum tax amt and pay whichever is greater each tax has its own rates allowabl deductions and rules for the measurement of taxable income in general the amt applies lower marginal rate to broader tax base it expands the corporate tax base by includi ng number of tax preferences under the regular corporate income tax in the com putation of taxable income under the amt in addition most tax credits allowed unde r the regular corporate income tax cannot be used to reduce amt liability the current amt originated with the tax reform act of 1986 and is mainly intended to insu re that all profitabl corporations pay at least some federal income tax as result of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 certain small corporations have been exempt from th amt since 1998 eligibility is determined by

when it longer qualifies for the exemption and in every tax year thereafter irrespective of the size of its gross receipts there is some evidence that this exemption may give some eligible small corporations slight competitive advantage over comparable firms paying the amt 1997 study found that firms that invested heavily in machinery and equipment and intangible assets like research and devel opment rd financed the bulk of their investments through debt nd paid the amt for five or more successive years had higher cost of capital than comparable firms that paid the regular income tax only in the same period17 in addition the exemption gives owners of small firms an incentive to incorporate since the taxable income of passthrough entities is subject to the individual amt as well as the regular income tax 2000 report by the treasury departme nts inspector general for tax administration tigta suggested that the implementation of the exemption from the amt for small firms ran into some unexpected problems during the first year or two of the exemption according to the report more than 2300 small corporations paid the amt in 1998 though an examinati on of their federal income tax returns indicated they qualified for the exemption their overpayments of the tax may have totaled more than 25 million18 the report attributed the erroneous payments to the many complex changes in the corporate amt made by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 and the short time available to taxpay ers and tax professi onals to comprehend the changes and apply them in filing 1998 ta x returns it recommended that the irs take variety of steps to increase taxpay er awareness of the exemption explain how it is intended to work and identify and c ontact taxpayers who erroneously paid the amt in recent followup report tigt found that the irs had taken many of these steps but that it still had failed to notify the more than 3600 taxpayers who may have mistakenly paid the amt and fallen short of the agencys commitment to inform and educate tax practitioners on what they need to do on their clients behalf19 it is not known whether there is net re venue gain or loss from exempting small

startup costs one of the principles underlying the fede ral income tax is that taxable income should exclude all costs incurred in earning it this implies that all ordinary and necessary costs incurred in conducting tr ade or business should be deducted from firms taxable income the principle also implies that ordinary and necessary costs paid or incurred in connection with star ting or organizing business should not be deducted from current income rather becau these expenses can be viewed as an attempt to create an asset with useful life extending beyond one tax year it can be argued that they should be capitalized adde d to the taxpayers basis in the business and recovered when the business is sold or ceases to exist under irc section 195 however busine ss taxpayers who incurred or paid business startup and organizational costs nd then entered the trade or business on or before october 22 2004 may amortize r deduct in equal nnual amounts those expenditures over not less than five years beginning in the month when the new trade or business commenced but under provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 business taxpayer s who incur or pay business startup and organizational costs af ter october 22 2004 may be able to deduct up to 5000 of those costs in the year when the new trade or business begins this maximum deduction is reduced but not below zero by the amount by which eligible expenditures exceed 50000 any expenditu res that cannot be deducted may be amortized over period of 180 months begi nning in the month when the new trade or business commences in order to claim either allowance taxpayer must have an equity interest in the new trade or business and actively participate in its management to qualify for amortization or the duction the startup and organizational costs must meet two criteria first they must be paid or incurred as part of an investigation into creating or acquiring an active trade or business as part of starting new trade or business or as part of any activity done to produce income or profit before starting trade or business with the intention of making such activity into an active trade or business second the costs must be the similar in kind to costs that would be considered deductible if they were paid or incurred in connection with the expansion of an existing active trade or bus iness in the same industry entered by the taxpayer business taxpayers who choose not to claim the deduction must capitalize all startup expenses the option to deduct as much as 5000 in business startup and organizational costs clearly benefits fledgling firms with relatively small such costs it permits the owners of such firms to deduct expenses that otherwise could not be recovered until they sell their interest in the business in effect the option accelerates the recovery of certain essential upfront costs for these firms and this acceleration can aid their formation and growth by reducing the cost of capital and increasing cash flow at time when the firms access to capita l may be severe ly restricted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32254crs11 20 joint tax committee estimates of

their books two methods of financial accounting are widely used in the priv ate sector cashbasis and accrualbasis under cashba sis accounting which is the preferred method for self employed individuals income generally is recorded when it is received in the form of cash or its equivalent and expenses ge nerally are recorded when they are paid regardless of when the income is actually earned or the expenses are actually incurred by contrast under accrualba sis accounting income and expenses generally are recorded when the transactions giving rise to them are completed or nearly completed regardless of when cash or its equivalent is received or paid more specifically firm using accrualbasis acc ounting records income when its right to receive it is established and expenses when the amounts are fixed and its liability for the expenses is established each accountin g method has its advant ages in general cashbasis accounting is much simpler to administer but accrualbasis accounting often yields more accurate measure of firms economic income because it matches income with expenses with greater precision and rigor an important requirement in selecting an accounting thod for tax purposes is that it clearly reflect business taxpayers income current federal tax law requires firms that maintain inventories to use the accrual method in computing taxable income the following entities generally must also use the accrual method of accountin g for tax purposes c corporations partnerships with c corporations as part ners trusts that earn unrelated business income and authorized tax shelters nonetheless the cash method may be us ed by these entities provided they are not tax shelter and fall into one or more of the following categories 1 the entity is engaged in farm or tree raising 2 the entity is qualified personal service corporation or 3 the entity is firm including c corporations with 5 million or less in average annual gross receipts during the previous three tax years moreover the irs has ruled that the cash method of accounting may be used by most sole proprietorships s corporati ons and partnerships with average annual gross receipts of 1

tax payments in principle firm earns income when the legal right to be paid comes into existence under the cash method of accounting however firm ma delay the recognition of income until cash payments are received thereby postponi ng the payment of tax on that income although many small firms may be eligible to use cashbasis accounting for tax purposes it may not always be practical or advisable for them to do so the reason lies in the requirements of the income statements and balance sheets used in external financial reports21 cashbasis accounting can dist ort firms financial position in at least two ways first it records only tr ansactions involving cash or its equivalent thereby excluding transactions involving exchanges of ssets or liabilities second the determination of net income under cashbasis accoun ting can be manipulated by recording revenues or expenses long before or after goods and services are produced or sold thus small firms with strong need to produce reliable and accurate external financial reports may be better off eschewing cashbasis accounting altogether the joint committee on taxation estimates that the use of cash accounting outside agriculture resulted in revenue loss of 08 billion in fy200722 tax incentives for private equity investment in small firms the federal tax code also contains several provisions intended to encourage the investment of private equity capital into some startup small firms that might otherwise find it difficult raising the funds needed to finance current operations or expansions these provisions which ar described below do so largely by increasing the potential aftertax returns or reducing the potential aftertax losses on equity investment in such firms the same tax benefits are not available to investors who acquire equity holdings in larger established firms partial exclusion of capital gains on certain small business stock two important considerations in determining an individuals income tax liability are the recognition of income as ordinary or capital and the distinction between long term and shortterm capital ga ins or losses capital gain or loss arises when an asset such as stock or bond is sold or ex changed if the selling price is greater than the acquisition or purchase price then the transaction yields capital gain conversely capital loss results when th selling price is less than the purchase price capital assets held longer than 12 months and then sold or exchanged give rise to longterm capital gains or losses whereas sales or exchanges of capital assets held one year or less produce short term capital gains or losses shortterm capital gains are considered ordinary income and thus are taxed at regular income tax rates by contrast longterm capital gains are considered capital income and thus are taxed athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32254crs13 23 under the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 108 27 the 15 rate applies to assets sold or

of goods sold is calculated by adding the value of firms inventor at the beginning of the year to purchases of inventory items made during the year and subtracting from that total the value of the firms inventory at the end of the year irc section 263a requires bus iness taxpayers engaged in the production of real or tangible property or in the purchase of real or tangible and intangible

production or acquisition of goods and indirect costs are the other costs incu rred through the production or acquisition of goods eg repair and main tenance of equipment and f acilities utilities

or intangible property acquired for resale by business taxpayer with average annual gross receipts of 10 million or less in the previous three tax years this exemption is advantageous because eligible

business taxpayers that main tain inventories to determine the cost of goods sold in tax year must estimate the value of their inventories at the beginning and end of each tax year because it is timeconsuming and costly to do this item by item many taxpayers use methods that assu certain item or cost flows one such method is known as lastinfirs toutor lifo lifo assumes that the most recently acquired goods are sold fi rst consequently lifo allocates the newest unit costs to the cost of goods so ld and the oldest unit costs to the ending inventory the method can be advantageous to use when the cost of many inventory items is rising because lifo yields lower taxable income and inventory valuation than other methods there are various ways to apply lifo widely used application is known as the dollarvalue method under this method taxpayer accounts for its inventories on the basis of pool of dollars rather than item by item each pool includes the value of variety of inventory items and is measured in terms of the equivalent dollar value of the inventory items at the time they were first added to the inventory account or the base year using the dollarvalue method is complicated and costly for most taxpayers28 but irc section 474 which was establis hed by the tax reform act of 1986 allows some small firms to use simplif ied dollarvalue lifo method it differs from the regular

chances of eventually growing into large successful firms are less th an promising twothirds of new firms survive at least two years and 44 last at least four years34 or looking at it from the flip side well over one half dont survive into their fifth year thus while hundreds of thousands of new firms come into existence annually hundreds of thousands existing firms cease functioning this constant churning is reflected in the fluctuating contributions of sma ll firms to annual net job creation small firms also make impor tant contributions to th process of technological innovation according to 2003 study by ch i research inc firms with fewer than 500 employees accounted for 41 of all pate nts filed by us corporations from 1996 to 2000 and firms of that size produced 13 to 14 times as many patents per employee as comparable large firms35 the researchers also found that small firms filed 25 of the patents related to biotechnology 19 of the patents related to pharmaceuticals 11 of the patents related to medical quipment and electronics and 9 of the patents related to chemicals other than pharmaceuticals36 economic arguments for and against small business tax preferences the economic importance of small firms as whole calls into question the underlying economic rationale for existing small business tax subsidies and proposals to enhance them or add new ones it is fair to ask why the subsidies are needed if small firms normally account for substantia l shares of domestic employment and output and play vital roles in the comme rcial development of new technologies the answer to this question has implications for us social welfare as small firms received over 11 billion in tax bene fits in fy2007 in addition to the financial support they receive through other federal prog rams intended to aid small business if the economic arguments made in favor of these tax subsidies turn out to be weak or untenable then using these res ources for other applications eg

such proposals and their merits these arguments are discussed below chief economic arguments in favor of the preferences proponents of small business tax subs idies generally c ite four economic justifications for them 1 the special economic role played by small firms 2 the formidable barriers to their formation and growth in financial markets 3 the impact of relatively high marginal tax rates on the formation of small firms and 4 the unique opportunities for individual economic advancement offered by small business ownership each is examin ed in some detail here special economic role of small firms as surprising as it may seem the economic contributions of small firms are of ten cited as reasons to provide federal support for small business for example in his 2001 senate floor remarks calling for additional tax benefits for small firms senator christopher bond noted that small businesses represent more than 99 of ll employers employ 53 of the private work force create about 75 of the new jobs in this country contribute 47 of all sales in this country and are res ponsible for 51 of private gross domestic product37 similarly senator olympia snowe asked for more tax

private sector output and represent 96 of all exporters of goods38 proponents of small business tax subsidies also point to the gains in economic efficiency dynamic structural changes and important technological innovations often attributed to small firms as justifications for the subsidies the gains in economic efficiency are thoug ht to lie in evidence that small firms supply certain goods and services more effi ciently than large firms as economist bo carlsson has noted this advantage can be found in industries where large production runs and falling unit costs are dominant structural

firms in the 1990s had the effect of further hardening this division in labor between large and small firms among the reput ed advantages of small firms in the vast and complex chain of supply undergirding the us econom is greater flexibility in responding to new market opportunities and competitive threats the belief that small firms can serve as powerful agents of dynamic economic change and technological advance appears root ed in the critical roles played by small startup firms in the origins and rapid gr owth of certain hightechnology industries like computers and microelectronics two notable findings in the recent literature on firm size and technolog ical innovati on are the contribution of small firms to innovation seems to vary by industry and that their contributions are likely to be most significant in relatively young i ndustries with relatively low levels of concentration40 the same literature offers some fresh evidence that in certain industries small startup fi rms are more adept than large established firms at identifying promising commercial applica tions for new technologies and exploiting these opportunities during the 1980s and 1990s many striking examples of this competitive advantage emerged in biot echnology microelectronics computer software and electronic commerce41 experiences such as these have led some economists to conclude that small entrepreneurial firms collectively serve as vital and indispensable source of economic growth and renewal they conte nd that economic growth is marked by the continuous creation and destruc tion of jobs and firms and that small entrepreneurial firms inject needed innovation and compe tition into this process carlsson has claimed that without the heterogeneity and volatility provide d by small startup firms the economy eventually stagnates or even collapses42 opportunities for the social and economic advancement of immigrants women and members of minority groups proponents of small business tax subsidies also cite the benefits of small business ownership for women minority groups immigrants and the communities where they reside as an important justification for the subsidies they argue that owning and managing small business gives them access to the social and ec onomic mainstream in the united states in addition proponents cla im that women minority and immigrant owned small firms benefit their immediate communities and society at large in ways that go beyond direct economic effects there is evidence that female small business owners are more likely than their male counterparts

build tightknit social networks providing job and skills training and creating informal capital markets44 imperfections in capital markets yet another econo mic argument made in favor of small business tax subsidies is that they can ease or offset the barriers faced by many small business owners and as piring entrepreneurs to raising funds to start or expand business if capital markets were truly efficient then every small business investment opportunity offering ra of return above the cost of capital would obtain the needed funding regardless of the creditworthiness of the owners but proponents of government support for sma ll business say that such is not the case in their view many potential and current entrepreneurs are unable to borrow or attract equity capital largely because of inadequate information on the part of lenders and investors as consequen ce small business owners facing such constraint often are forced to finance pr ojects out of their own resources or the resources of friends and family members or to abandon the projects altogether small business owners facing severe liquidity constraints have an elevated risk of failure impact of progressive income taxes supporters of tax relief for small firms also maintain that taxes have significant effect on three key decisions made by any small business owners how fast to grow the firm whether to expand capital investment and if so by how much nd whether to hire more employees and if so how many they cite variety of studies suggesting that as individual or corporate tax rates rise small firms grow at slower rate invest less in new tangible and intangible assets and become increasingly less likely to expand employment45 in their view these effects especially when contrasted with the

economic expansion report prepared for the small business admini stration washington june 2006 table 3 p 26market failures can be thought of as c onditions that prevent or unduly retard the emergence of economically efficient outcomes foremost among these conditions are lack of perfect competition the pr esence of public goods positive or negative external effects or externalities the existence of incomplete markets and imperfect information on the part of consumers46 critics of small business tax subsidies say there is evidence that market failure stands in the way of the formation or growth of small firms moreover by their way of thinking such subsidies are likely to lead to undesirable equity and efficiency effects equity concerns proponents of small business tax preferences generally do not refer to their equity effects in defending them on economic grounds but critics maintain such silence in their view small business tax preferences undercut the progressivity of th federal individual in come tax under progressive income tax an individuals tax liability depends on his or her income so that taxpayers with higher taxable incomes pay higher taxes than taxpayers with lower taxable incomes but small business tax preferences weaken the link between tax burden and income by re ducing the tax burden on the ear nings of small firms it is an axiom of public finance that individuals and not firms ultimately bear the burden of business income ta xes while all owners of capital can be expected to benefit from small business tax preferences most of those benefits presumably end up in the hands of small business owners whose income and wealth tend to be well above average for us households47 efficiency concerns critics also criticize small business tax subsidies on efficiency grounds in theory income taxe s reduce social welfare by distorting the behavior of consumers and firms as re sult the most desirable income taxes are those that raise the needed revenue w ithout preventing economic resources from flowing to their most productive uses this doctrine of neutrality has important implications for tax policy first it implies that the returns

neutral taxation to assist small firms might be warranted if there were some thing uniquely valuable about the economic role of such firms that can flourish only through targ eted government s upport pr oponents of small business tax preferences claim that small firms consistently create more jobs and spawn more important technological innovations than large firms and that government support in the guise of tax subsidies is needed to ensure that they continue to play these roles but critics question both the premises and policy recommendation of this argument critics and proponents alike agree that sm all firms generally are robust source of job creation according to data fro m the small business administration small firms created between half and three quarters of all new jobs from 1990 to 1997 depending on how the employment size of small firm is specified50 critics maintain however that for variety of reasons these data do not necessarily prove that small firms have greater jobcreating prowess than large firms to begin with they note that the data raise more questions than they answer what does it mean to be small when shoul d firms size be measured is gross or net job creation better i ndicator of jobcreating prow ess and how long should job last before it is counted as new job in addition critics say there is an abunda nce of evidence that small firms are not demonstrably and consistently better at creating jobs than large firms first there appears to be considerable variation over time in the share of new jobs created by small firms in widely cited study david birch and james medoff estimated that the share of total net new jobs generated by firms employing 100 or fewer workers varied from about 40 to 140 depending on the stage of the business

if firms with 100 or fewer employees account for net job gain of 100 and all other firms generate net job loss of 25 then the economy as whole would realize net job gain of 75 and the share of that

many of these jobs do not last long time because most new firms fail within their first few years52 third few firms accounted for most small business job cr eation between the late 1980s and early 1990s birch and medoff labeled these fi rms gazelles and these firms grew swiftly from small to large and in some cases from large back to small suggesting that their jobcreating ability was unstable at best53 finally during the 1970s and 1980s large firms and plants dominated job creation and destruction in the manufacturing sector and there was str ong systematic relationship between firm size and net job growth rates54 critics also contend that even if small firms were to create more jobs than large firms over time there is reason to th ink that government support for small business would lead to faster employment growth economic analysis indicates that the economy generates jobs through what can be described as natural process of growth decline and structural change the size distribution of firms seems irrelevant to this process from this perspective the level of national employment results from mix of factors that would swamp the employment effects of any government

short of the socially optimal amount left to their own devices firms are likely to invest too little in rd for two reasons one is that they cannot capture all the returns to rd investment mainly because other firms are able to capitalize on the results of research in spite of available intellectual property protection second reason is that some firms lack access to sufficient capital to invest in rd because they are unwilling or unable to provide investors with the information they require to evaluate the potential returns on planned rd investments55 this tendency to invest too

small business tax subsidies maintain that it is far from clear that government support for this investment should be targeted at small firms they point to abundant evidence suggesting that both small and large firms launch the innovations that help propel th processes of economic grow th and structural change and that it is impossible to disentangle th contributions of one group from the other according to data reported by the nationa l science foundation nsf larger firms perform the vast share of business rd from 1992 to 1997 for example companies with fewer than 500 employees accounted for 14 of total business rd spending whereas companies with 10000 or more employees were responsible for 59 of these expenditures56 nonetheless small firms and large firms each appear to have distinct advantages as agents of technological innovation57 in addition numerous studies have looked at the effects of firm size and market structure on innovation58 on the whole they have found that firm size is ideal for generating new successful commercial technologies rather there is evidence th at in some industries small firms were more innovative than large firms but in ot her industries large firms had decisive edge in the generation of new technologies other concerns critics also question the suitability and effectiveness of some current or proposed sm all business tax subsidies one argument made in favor of these subsidies is that the creation of new small firms is needed to prevent the developmen t of monopoly power by large firms but critics contend that the best way to ach ieve such policy goal does not involve government support for the formation and grow th of small firms they point out that only tiny share of small startup firms survive and grow large enough to pose serious competitive threat to large entrenched firms in the same industry in the view of critics antitrust law is more effective policy tool than small business tax subsidies for preventing the rise of monopoly power and other anticompetitive business practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32254crs28 59 the estimate assumes rate of inflation of 2 and corporate tax rate of 35 it is based on simulation done by gravelle with the aid of the crs capital stock model on may 9 2003 60 holtzeakin should small businesses be taxfavored p 393critics also note that if the aim of public policy is to s timulate employment growth then it makes little sense to offer small firms tax subsidies that lower the cost of capital the current expensing allowance is case in point such subsidy lowers the cost of capital relative to labor thereby encouraging small firms to substitute machinery and equipment for labor in theory tax subsidy like the allowance leads to fewer workers being employed than would be the case in the absence of the allowance finally critics argue that small busine ss tax preferences should be avoided or minimized because they impose an implicit or hidden tax on business growth this tax has been described as the notch probl em and it is an inevitable result of the design of many current tax preferences targeted at small firms under the typical small business tax preference firms lose the tax benefit when their workforce assets or receipts surpass certain limit specified by law such design creates disincentive to grow beyond that limit the expensing allowance under irc secti on 179 illustrates this pitfall in 2003 the maximum allowance was 100000 nd the phaseout threshold was 400000 when firm increased its investment that year in assets that qualified for the allowance beyond 400000 the amount that c ould be expensed was reduced dollar for dollar ultimately to zero when tota l investment reached 500000 in effect this design gave firms an incentive to inve st more than 100000 in qualified assets in single tax year for any investment the cost of capital depends in part on the investors marginal tax rate jane gr avelle of crs has timated that under the expensing allowance for 2003 the marginal effective tax rate on investment in equipment was 0 on the firs t 100000 26 on amount s over 100 000 to 400000 43 on amounts over 400000 to 500000 and 26 on amounts above 50000059 douglas holtzeakin has pointed out that the design of the allowance effectively raises firms cost of capita l at time when its growth is boosting its capital needs60 conclusions there is question that small firms make important contributions to the performance and growth of the us econom of course the magnitude of the contributions depends on how small firm is defined under the definition used by the sba in administering its programs it is fair to say that small business accounts for majority of privatesector jobs nd privatesector output generates many key technological innovations and rves as potent agent of revitalization and structural change in variety of industrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32254crs29 61 ibidthese contributions may explain much of the strong backing inside and outside congress for government polic ies to assist small business prominent example of such policy is the preferential tax treatment received by many small firms the combined revenue cost of current federal small business tax subsidies excluding the tax treatment of pa ssthrough entities exceeded 11 billion in fy2007 variety of initiatives to expand these subsidies are being considered in the 110th congress mainstream economic analysis suggests that it is difficult to justify an expansion of small business tax subsid ies on equity or efficiency grounds small business tax preferences reduce the tax burden on owners of small firms diluting to an unknown extent the progressivity of the federal i ndividual income tax system in addition it appears that small business tax preferences do little to advance social welfare economic theory holds that the efficiency losses inevitably caused by income taxes are minimized when taxes do not distort th production arrangements within firms and all returns to capital are taxed at the same rate deviations from this theory of uniform taxation are warranted to correct clear and obvious market failures in the case of small firms as whole there is convincing evidence that some kind of market failure is linked to their rates of formation and growth or to their performance in wide range of industries this is not to suggest that governme nt support for small firms would never be justified on economic grounds if market fa ilure were to emerge that retards the formation and growth of sma ll entrepreneurial firms government action to eradicate the source of the failure would be warrant ed one such market failure would be imperfections in capital markets that impede the entry of new small entrepreneurial firms or greatly diminish the chances of survival of existing small entrepreneurial firms such problem could be corr ected through policy measures aimed at expanding the flow of capital to small star tup firms but without greatly distorting the allocation of capital within the economy at rge tax subsidies might be useful in this case but to be effective they would need to address the root causes of the capital market imperfections continuing challenge for policymakers is to identify market failures that disproportionate ly harm small firms and devise appropr iate policy responses the discussion presented here underscore s the need for the development of robust model of the formation of small fi rms and their contributions to the economy as it now stands considerab uncertainty surrounds these issues holtzeakin has noted that the development of such mode l would enable policymakers to determine whether any market failures are interfering with the formation and growth of small firms identify the factors driving these fa ilures and develop po licies that address these factors61
