ruling in regents of the university of california v bakke the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains topic of political and legal controversy many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination but also to achieve racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty justice powell in his opinion for the bakke court stated that the attainment of diverse student body is constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education noting that the atmosphere of speculation experiment and creation so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by diverse student body in recent years however federal courts began to question the powell rationale unsettling expectations about the constitutionality of diversitybased affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring after series of conflicting lower court rulings were issued regarding the use of race to promote diverse student body the supreme court agreed to review the raceconscious admissions policies used by the undergraduate and law school admissions programs at the university of michigan in grutter v bollinger 5 to 4 majority of the justices held that the university law school had compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from diverse student body which justified its racebased efforts to assemble critical mass of underrepresented minority students but in the companion decision gratz v bollinger six justices decided that the universitys policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional scrutiny the decisions resolved for the time being the doctrinal muddle left in bakke s wake and because the courts constitutional holdings translate to the private sector under the federal civil rights laws nonpublic schools colleges and universities are likewise affected although the grutter and gratz decisions settled the question of whether racebased policies to promote diversity in higher education are ever constitutionally acceptable the decisions did not address whether diversity is permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting to resolve this question the supreme court recently agreed to review two cases that involve the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools and to avoid racial segregation in consolidated ruling in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 the court struck down the seattle and louisville school plans at issue holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment

faculty justice powell in his opinion for the bakke court stated that the attainment of diverse student body is constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education noting that the

began to question the powell rationale unsettling expectations about the constitutionality of diversitybased affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring decisions in striki ng down the admissions process at the university of texas school of law the fifth circuit in hopwood v texas concluded that any use of race in the admissions process was forbidden by the constitution3 reverberations of the 1996 hopwood opinion are apparent in several subsequent cases which voided race conscious policies maintained by institutions of higher education as well as public elementary and secondary schools some judges avoided resolving the precedential effect of justice powells opinion by deciding the case on narrow tailoringor other grounds not dependent on the constitutional status of student diversity as compelling state interest 4 but in johnson v board of regents the eleventh circuit sided with hopwood by rejecting diversity as constitutional justification for numerical racial bonus awarded minority freshman applicants to the university of georgia circuit court conflict was created when the ninth circuit relied on bakke to uphold an affirmative action admissions policy to the university of washington law school that made extensive use of racebased factors smith v university of washington was the first federal appeals court to rely on justice powells decision

pair of separate trial court decisions one upholding for diversity reasons the racebased undergraduate admissions policy of the university of michigan6 the other voiding special minority law school admissions program at the same institution7 restoring degree of clarity to the law the us supreme court concluded its 200203 term with rulings in the michigan cases in grutter v bollinger 8 5 to 4 majority of the justices held that the university law school had compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from diverse student body which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble critical mass of underrepresented minority students but in companion decision gratz v bollinger 9 six justices decided that the universitys policy of awarding racial bonus

diversity in higher education are ever constitutionally acceptable the decisions did not address whether diversity is permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting to resolve this question the supreme court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools the cases were meredith v jefferson county board of education formerly macfarland v jefferson county public schools and parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 10 in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 consolidated ruling that resolved both cases the court ultimately struck down the school plans at issue holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment11 the first part of this report briefly reviews the judicial evolution of racebased affirmative action particularly in relation to public education recent rulings challenging the use of raceconscious admissions and hiring practices by public educational institutions are then considered for their implications on the future development of affirmative action law

the burger court grappled with the seemingly intractable problem of racial segregation in the nations public schools judicial rulings from this period recognized an affirmative duty cast upon local school boards by the equal protection clause to desegregate formerly dual school systems and to eliminate root and branch the last vestiges of stateenforced segregation 12 these holdings ushered in

along racial lines and extensive student transportation schemes school districts across the nation operating under these decrees have since sought to be declared in compliance with constitutional requirements in order to gain release from federal intervention the supreme court eventually responded by holding that judicial control of school system previously f ound guilty of intentional segregation should be relinquished if looking to all aspects of school operations it appears that the district has complied with desegregation requirements in good faith for reasonable period of time and has eliminated vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable 13 statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education was enacted by the civil rights act of 1964 public and private employ ers with 15 or more employees are subject to comprehensive code of equal employment opportunity regulations under title vii of the 1964 act the title vii remedial scheme rests largely on judicial power to order monetary damages and injunctive relief including such affirmative action as may be appropriate 14 to make discrimination victims whole except as may be imposed by court order or consent decree to remedy past discrimination however there is general statutory obligation on employers to adopt affirmative action remedies but the equa l employment opportun ity commission eeoc has issued guidelines to protect employers and unions from charges of reverse discrimination when they voluntarily take action to correct the effects of past discrimination15 the term affirmative action resurfaced in federal regulations construing the 1964 acts title vi which prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in all federally assisted programs and activities16 including public or private educational instit utions the office of civil rights of the department of education interpreted title vi to require schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination and to encourage voluntary affirmative action to attain diverse student body 17 another title vi regulation permits college or university to take racial or national origin into account when awarding financial aid if the aid is necessary to overcome effects of past institutional discrimination18 affirmative action in higher education was before the congress in 1998 when the full house defeated bill to prohibit federal aid to colleges and universities that consider race ethnicity or sex in the admission process the bakke ruling in 1978 launched the contemporary constitutional debate over statesponsored affirmative action notable lack of unanimity was evident from the six separate opinions filed in that case one fourjustice plurality in bakke

davis medical school which set aside sixteen of one hundred positions in each incoming class for minority students where the institution itself was not shown to have discrimina ted in the past another bloc of four justices argued that racial classifications designed to further remedial purposes were foreclosed neither by the constitution nor the civil rights act and would have upheld the minority admissions quota justice powell added fifth vote to each camp by condemning the davis program on equal protection grounds while endorsing the nonexclu sive consideration of race as an admissions criterion to foster student diversity in justice powells view neither the states asserted interest in remedying societal discrimination nor of providing role mode ls for minority students was sufficiently compelling to warrant the use of suspect racial classification in the admission process but the attainment of diverse student body was for justice powell clearly permissible goal for an institution of higher education since diversity of minority viewpoints furthered academic freedom special concern of the first amendment 19 accordingly race could be considered by university as plus or one element of range of factorseven if it tipped the scale among qualified applicantsas long as it did not insulate the individual from comparison with all the other candidates for the available seats20 the quota in bakke was infirm however since it defined diversity only in racial terms and absolutely excluded nonminorities from given number of seats by two 5to4 votes therefore the supreme court affirmed the lower court order admitting bakke but reversed the judicial ban on consideration of race in admissions bakke was followed by wygant v jackson board of education 21 where divided court ruled unconstitutional the provision of collective bargaining agreement that protected minority public school teachers from layoff at the expense of more senior white faculty members while holding the specific layoff preference for minority teachers unconstitutional seven wygant justices seemed to agree in principle that governmental employer is not prohibited by the equal protection clause from all raceconscious affirmative action to remedy its own past discrimination another series of decisions approved of congressionally mandated racial preferences to allocate the benefits of contracts on federally sponsored public works projects 22 and in the design of certain broadcast licensing schemes23 while condemning similar actions taken by local governmental entities to promote public contracting opportunities for minority entrepreneurs24 however in each of these cases the justices failed to achieve consensus on most issues with bare majorities pluralities oras in bakke single justice determining the law of the case by the mid1980s the supreme court had approved the temporary remedial use of race or genderconscious selection criteria by private em ployers under title

group members remedies that protected minorities from layoff for example were most suspect and unlikely to pass legal or constitutional muster if they displaced more senior white workers but the consideration of race or gender as plus factor in employment decisions when it did not unduly hinder or trammel the legitimate expectations of nonminority employees won ready judicial acceptance 28 affirmative action preferences however had to be sufficiently flexible temporary in duration and narrowly tailored to avoid becoming rigid quotas not until 1989 however did majority of the justices resolve the proper constitutional standard for review of governmental classifications by race enacted for remedial or other benign legislative purpose disputes prior to city of richmond v ja croson29 yielded divergent views as to whether state affirmative action measures for the benefit of racial minorities were subject to the same strict scrutiny as applied to invidious racial discrimination under the equal protection clause an intermediate standard rese mbling the test for genderbased classifications or simple rationality in croson 5 to 4 majority settled on strict scrutiny to invalidate 30 set aside of city contracts for minorityowned businesses because the program was not narrowly tailored to compelling governmental interest while raceconscious remedies could be legislated in response to proven past discrimination by the affected governmental entities racial balancing untailored to specific and identified evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible croson suggested however that because of its unique equal protection enforcement authority constitutional standard more tolerant of racial linedrawing may apply to congress this conclusion was reinforced year later when in metro broadcasting inc v fcc 30 the court upheld certain minority broadcast licensing schemes approved by congress to promote the important governmental interest in broadcast diversity the twotiered approach to equal protection analysis of governmental affirmative action was shortlived in adarand constructors inc v pena31 the court applied strict scrutiny to federal transportation program of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvan taged individuals defined so as to prefer members of designated racial minorities although the court refrained from deciding the constitutional merits of the particular program before it and remanded for further proceedings below it determined that all racial classifications by government at any level must be justified by compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to that end but the majority opinion by justice oconnor sought to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact by acknowledging role for congress as architect of remedies for discrimination nationwide the unhappy persistence of both the

unfortunate reality and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it further guidance is provided however as to the scope of remedial power remaining in congressional hands or of the conditions required for its exercise bottom line adarand suggests that racial preferences in federal law or policy are remedy of last resort and must be adequately justified and narrowly drawn to pass constitutional muster the court applied the adarand rule in miller v johnson32 in miller the court reviewed congressional redistricting plan for the state of georgia the plan adopted at the insistence of the justice department was designed to create three congressional districts that had majority of africanamerican residents the court reversed its traditional deference to remedial race conscious apportionment33 and held that while race could be considered in redistricting the justice departments policy of making race the predominant factor failed the strict scrutiny test the miller

emphasis in adarand on past discrimination prompted an upsurge in judicial challenges to educational diversity as an independent justification for student and faculty affirmative action the notion that diversity could rise to the level of compelling interest in the educational setting sprang quarter century ago from justice powells opinion in the bakke case while concluding that state medical school could not setaside certain number of seats for minority applicants justice powell opined that diverse student body may serve educators legitimate interest in promoting the robust exchange of ideas he cautioned however that the diversity that furthers compelling state interest encompasses far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which ethnic origin is but single though important element 36 justice powell split the difference between two fourjustice pluralities in bakke one camp led by justice stevens struck down the admissions quota on statutory civil rights grounds another led by justice brennan would have upheld the medical schools policy as remedy for societal discrimination justice powell held the dual admissions procedure to be unconstitutional and ordered bakkes admission but he concluded that the states interest in educational diversity could warrant consideration of students race in certain circumstances for justice powell diverse student body

interest did not turn on race alone he pointed with approval to the harvard plan which defined diversity in terms of broad array of factors and characteristics thus an applicants race could be deemed plus factor it was considered on par with personal talents leadership qualities family background or any other factor contributing to diverse stude nt body however the race of candidate could not be the sole or determinative factor other justice joined in the powell opinion although justice powells opinion announced the judgment of the court other bakke justices joined him on that point justice powell ruled the dual admission program at issue to be unconstitutional and the white male plaintiff entitled to admission while four other justices reached the same result on statutory rather than constitutional grounds another four justice plurality concluded that the challenged policy was lawful but agreed with justice powell that the state court had erred by holding that an applicants race could never be taken into account only justice powell therefore expressed the view that the attainment of diverse student body could be compelling state interest for nearly two decades colleges and universities relied on the powell opinion in bakke to support raceconscious student diversity policies consider ation of race in admissions which took various forms stood pretty much unchallenged until hopwood v state of texas 37 panel of the fifth circuit repudiated the powell diversity rationale when it voided special admission program of the university of texas law school unlike bakke the texas program entailed explicit racial quota but in other respects it was classic dual track system one standard for blacks and hispanics another for everyone else and cutoff scores for minorities were lower the powell opinion was not binding precedent the hopwood panel ruled since it was not joined by any other justice thus race could be considered in admissions only to remedy past discrimination by the law school itself which was not shown in hopwood two other federal circuit courts besides the sixth circuit michigan case have looked at race based college admissions since bakke johnson v board of regents 38 struck down the award of racial bonus points to minority students as one of 12 factorsacademic and nonacademic considered for freshman admissions to the university of georgia the eleventh circuit majority was skeptical of the powell opinion but did not take stand on the diversity issue instead the program failed the second requirement of strict sc rutiny it was not narrowly tailored that is it mechanically awards an arbitrary diversity bonus to each and every nonwhite applicant at decisive stage in the admissions process at the same time the policy arbitrarily limited the number of nonracial factors that could be considered all at the expense of white applicants even those whose social or economic background and pe rsonal traits would promote experiential diversity on the other hand the ninth circ uit upheld the minority law school admissions program at the university of washington on the basis of bakke the appeals court in smith v university of washington law school 39 concluded that the four brennan justices who approved of the racial quota in bakke would have embraced the diversity rationale if need be justice powells opinion thus became

the judicial divide over the student diversity policies deepened with the michigan cases one federal district court in grutter originally struck down the student diversity policy of the university of michigan law school while another judge upheld procedure awarding points to underrepresented minority applicants to the undergraduate school 41 based on bakke the sixth circuit reversed grutter and permitted the law school to consider race in admissions42 the supreme court granted certiorari in grutter and agreed to review gratz prior to judgment by the sixth circuit undergraduate admission to the university of michigan had been based on point system or student selection index total possible 150 points could be awarded for factors academic and otherwise that made up the selection index academic factors accounted for up to 110 points including 12 for standardized test performance by comparison 20 points could be awarded for one but only one of the following membership in an underrepresented minority group socioeconomic disadvantage or athletics applican ts could receive one to four points for legacy or alumni relationships three points for personal essay five points for community leadership and service six points for instate residency etc in practice students at the extremes of academic performance were typically admitted or rejected on that basis alone but for the middle range of qualified applicants these other factors were often determinative finally counselors could flag applications for review by the admissions review committee where any factor important to the freshman class compositionrace includedwas not adequately reflected in the selection index score in upholding this policy the district court in gratz found that bakke and the universitys own evidence demonstrating the educational benefits of racial and ethnic diversity established compelling state interest and the award of 20 points for minority status was not quota or dual track system as in bakke but only plus factor to be weighed against others in the selection process thus the constitutional demand for narrow tailoring was satisfied the gratz district court also concluded that vigorous minority recruitment and other raceneutral alternatives to the current policy would not yield sufficiently diverse student body 40 430 us 188 1977 41 gratz v bollinger 122 f supp 811 ed mich

minority statusin their admissions decisions in the course of each years admissions process the record showed minority admission rates were regularly reported to track the racial composition of the developing class the 1992 policy replaced an earlier special admissions program which set written goal of 1012 minority enrollment and lower academic requirements for those groups the district court in grutter made several key findings there is heavy emphasis on race in the law school admissions process that over period of time 1992 1998 minorities ranged from 11 to17 of each incoming class and that large numbers of minority students were admitted with index scores the same as or lower than unsuccessful white applicants writing for the sixth circuit majority judge martin adopted the powell position in bakke to find that the law school had compelling interest in achieving racially diverse student body and that its admissions policy was narrowly tailored to that end soft variables were found to treat each applicant as an individual and to be virtually indistinguishable from plus factors and the harvard plan approved by justice powell in bakke the law schools policy did not setaside or reserve seats on the basis of race rather in pursuit of critical mass the policy was designed to ensure that meaningful number of minority students were able to contribute to classroom dialogue without feeling isolated the majority opinion further emphasized that the admissions program was flexible with fixed goal or target that it did not use separate tracks for minority and nonminority candidates and did not function as quota system without waiting for final appeals court decisi on the supreme court agreed to review the gratz undergraduate admissions case in tandem with the sixth

present the doctrinal imbroglio that had consumed so much recent lower court attention justice oconnor quoted extensively from justice powells opinion finding it to be the touchstone for constitutional analysis of raceconscious admissions policies but her opinion was not without its own possible doctrinal innovations overarching much of her reasoning were two paramount themes that drew considerable criticism from justice thomas and his fellow dissenters first in applying strict scrutiny to the racial aspects of the law school admissions program justice oconnor stressed the

objectionable but may depend upon the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for that particular use of race second and equally significant was the deference accorded to the judgment of educational decisionmakers in defining the scope of their academic mission even in regard to matters of racial and ethnic diversity universities occupy special niche in our constitutional tradition justice oconnor stated such that the law schools educational judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer institutional good faith would be presumed in the absence of contrary evidence justice thomass dissent joined by justice scalia took particular exception to what he viewed as the fundamentally flawed proposition that racial discrimination can be contextualizeddeemed compelling for one purpose but not anotheror that strict scrutiny permits any sort of deference to the law schools conclusion that its racial experimentation leads to educational benefits indeed the dissenters found such deference to be antithetical to the level of searching review demanded by strict scrutiny satisfied that the law school had compelling reasons for pursuing racially diverse student body the court moved to the second phase of strict scrutiny analysis narrow tailoring as noted requires close fit between means and end when the state draws any distinction based on race in grutter the concept of critical mass so troubling to several justices at oral argument won the majoritys approval as necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of diverse student body in this portion of her opinion justice oconnor drew chapter and verse from the standards articulated by justice powell in bakke we find that the law schools admissions program bears the hallmarks of narrowly tailored plan as justice powell made clear in bakke truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in flexible nonmechanical way it follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks nor can universities insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission universities can however consider race or ethnicity more fl exibly as plus factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant justice oconnor drew key distinction between forbidden quotas and permitted goals exonerating the law schools admission program from constitutional jeopardy she observed that both approaches pay some attention to numbers but while the former are fixed and reserved exclusively for certain minority groups the opinion continued the law schools goal of attaining critical mass of minority students required only good faith effort by the institution in addition justice oconnor note d minority law school enrollment between 1993 and 2000 varied from 135 to 201 percent range inconsistent with quota responding in his separate dissent the chief justice objected that the notion of critical mass was sham or subterfuge for racial balancing since it did not explain disparities in the proportion of the three minority groups admitted under its auspices other factors further persuaded the court that the law school admissions process was narrowly tailored by avoiding racial or ethnic bonuses the policy permitted consideration of all pertinent elements of diversity racial and nonracial in highly individualized holistic review of each applicants file justice oconnor also found that race neutral alternatives had been sufficiently considered by the law school although few specific examples are provided importantly however the opinion made plain that exhaustion of every conceivable alternative is not constitutionally required only serious good faith consideration of workable raceneutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks consequently the

traditional academic benchmarksgpa and lsat scoresfor all applicants since these alternatives would require dramatic sacrifice of diversity the academic quality of all admitted students or both and because the admissions program was based on individual assessment of all pertinent elements of diversity it did not unduly burden nonminority pplicants nonetheless as she had during oral argument justice oconnor emphasized the need for reasonable durational provisions and periodic reviews by institutions conducting such programs to drive home the point the majority concludes with general admonition we expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will longer be necessary to further the interest approved today besides justices thomas and scalia and the chief justice another dissenting opinion was filed by justice kennedy who agreed with his brethren that the constancy of minority admissions over period of years raised suspicion of racial balancing that the law school was required by the rigors of strict scrutiny to rebut arguing from different statistics than the majority he found little deviation among admitted minority students from 1995 to 1998 which fluctuated only by 03 from 135 to 138 and at point fell below 12 historically defined by the law school as the bottom of its critical mass range in addition he contended the use of daily reports on minority admissions near the end of the process shifted the focus from individualized review of each applicant to institutional concerns for the numerical objective defined by critical mass for these reasons he agreed with his fellow dissenters that deference to the law school in this situation was antithetical to strict scrutiny not consistent with it g22g145g142g561

gratz basically the same factors that saved the law school policy by their absence conspired to condemn the undergraduate program in the eyes of the majority since the universitys compelling interest in racial student diversity was settled in grutter the companion case focused on the reasons why the automatic award of 20 admission points to minority applicants failed the narrow tailoring aspect of strict scrutiny analysis relying again on the powell rationale in bakke the policy was deemed more than plus factor as it denied each applicant individualized consideration by making race decisive for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant nor did the procedure for flagging individual applications for additional review rescue the policy since such consideration is the exception and not the rule occurringif at allonly after the bulk of admission decisions are made based on the point system the opinion of the chief justice rejected the universitys argument based on administrative convenience that the volume of freshman applications makes it impractical to apply more individualized review the fact that the implementation of program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system finally the majority made plain that its constitutional holding in gratz is fully applicable to private colleges and universities pursuant to the federal civil rights laws we have explained that discrimination that violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment committed by an institution that accepts federal funds also constitutes violation of title vi of the 1964 civil rights act justice oconnor concurring in gratz emphasized the

admissions review committee was kind of an afterthought particularly since the record was barren of evidence concerning its methods of operation and how the decisions are actually made dissenting opinions were filed jointly by justices stevens and souter and separately by justice ginsburg the former argued on technical grounds that since the named petitioners had already enrolled in other schools and were not presently seeking freshman admission at the university they lacked standing to seek prospective relief and the appeal should be dismissed but justice souter argued separately on the merits that the michigan undergraduate admission program was sufficiently different from the racial quota in bakke to be constitutionally acceptable at the very least he felt more appropriate course would be to remand the case for further development of the record to determine whether the entire dmissions process including review by the admissions review committee results in individualized review sufficient to meet the courts standards justice ginsburg found constitutional infirmity in the michigan program since only qualified applicants are admitted the current policy is not intended to limit or decrease admissions of any racial or ethnic group and ad missions of nonminority groups is not unduly restricted more broadly she opined that government decisionmakers may properly distinguish between policies of inclusion and exclusion because the former are more likely to comport with constitutional imperatives of individual equality

latin school44 under the new policy half of the available seats at each school was awarded solely on the basis of students composite scores derived from grade point averages and entrance examination

according to the appeals court however the school committee had not produced sufficient evidence to demonstrate compelling interest in either goal or that the admissions policy was narrowly tailored to those ends first there was solid and compelling evidence that student diversity was in any way tied to the vigorous exchange of ideas nor that any achievement gap between minority and non minority students amounted to vestiges of the systems past discrimination the policy also swept too broadly by dividing individuals into only five groupsblacks whites hispanic asians and native americanswithout recognizing that none is monolithic thus even assuming that diversity might in some circumstances be sufficiently compelling to justify race conscious actions the school committees flexible racialethnic guidelines appear to be less means of attaining diversity in any constitutionally relevant sense and more means of racial balancing which is neither legitimate nor necessary means of advancing the lofty principles credited in the policy 46 meanwhile in pair of decisions the fourth circuit invalidated affirmative action policies for admission of minority students to magnet school s in arlington county va and montgomery county md because neither policy was found to satisfy the narrow tailoring aspect of strict scrutiny as required by adarand however it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether educational diversity may be compelling interest justifying race based admissions in other circumstances at issue in the arlington county case tuttle v arlington county school board 47 was sequential weighted random lottery system developed in response to prior litigation which took account of three factorslowincome background the applicants primary language and race or ethnicityin determining admission to three county magnet schools the probabilities associated with each applicants lottery number were weighted so that members of underrepresented groups as defined by any of those factors had an increased probability of selection in the montgomery county case eisenberg v montgomery county public schools 48 school officials considered variety of factors including diversity profile of affected schools when deciding whether to grant applications for transfer from students assigned school to another county public school the diversity profile in effect precluded transfer of students of particular racial or ethnic backgroundwhite black asian or hispanicfrom any school where the percentage of that group in the student body had declined over the preceding three years and was underrepresented when compared to the county as whole in both cases the challenged policy led to white students being denied admission to schools of their choice for racial reasons tied to student diversity while the arlington county school system earlier in its history had been found to be jure segregated and was required to desegregate by judicial decree montgomery county had never been subject to court supervised desegregation rather the maryland district had dismantled its formerly segregated schools by voluntary means one aspect of which included implementation of magnet school program in neither case however did the fourth circuit attribute remedial purpose to the diversity interest asserted by th school board but found that the admissions and transfer policies in question were an exercise in racial balancing in so doing the appeals court sidestepped deciding whether racial diversity in education could ever be compelling state interest proceeding instead to find the challenged policies failed the narrow tailoring aspect of adarand analysis in the arlington case the school board was found to have disregarded one or 46 id at 799 47 195 f3d 698 4th cir 1999

as alternatives to promote diversity the duration of the plan was criticized for being in perpetuity and without logical stopping point although the weighted lottery did not setaside positions for minorities according to the court the practical effect was the same since it skewed the odds of selection in their favor to achieve classroom diversity in proportions that approximate the distribution of students from racial groups in the districts overall student population finally the plan lacked flexibility and impermissibly burdened innocent third parties who are denied admission for racial or ethnic reasons montgomery countys raceconscious transfer policy was characterized by the court as mere racial balancing in pure form due to many of the same failings and because it was not directed at the correction of any past constitutional wrongs the county annually ascertains the percentage of enrolled public school students by race on countywide basis and then does the same for each school it then assigns numbered category for each race at each school and administ ers the transfer policy so that the race and percentage in each school to which students ar assigned by residence is compared to the percentage of that race in the countywide system the transfer policy is administered with an object toward maintaining this percentage of racial balance in each school although the transfer policy does not necessarily apply hard and fast quotas its goal of keeping certain percentages of racialethnic groups within each school to ensure diversity is racial balancing 49 montgomery county officials were directed to eliminate the consideration of race from student transfer decisions while in the arlington case further proceedings in the district court were ordered to review alternative

status the district court had relinquished jurisdiction of the desegregation case and ordered the school district to stop assigning children to schools or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through racebased lotteries preferences setasides or other means that deny students an equal footing based on race the specific target of judge potters order was the raceconscious policy for

compelling governmental interest and the school district could not make any further use of racebased lotteries preferences and setasides in student assignment slightly different majority ruled that the school board could not be held liable for its use of race in assigning students to magnet schools since the program had originated in then valid desegregation order but if the same plan were adopted after the district is declared unitary it would clearly be unconstitutional under tuttle and eisenberg these judges opined the issue before the fourth circuit in belk focused on whether the school board in creating its admission plan was acting beyond what was permitted to comply with the courts desegregation order another ruling by the fifth circuit in cavalier v caddo parish school board 52 also suggests that educational authorities have broader discretion to consider race in making admissions decisions when the school district is under court order to desegregate cavalier held that magnet school preferential admissions program that mandated 50 to 50 plus or minus 15 racial student mix and imposed lower minimum standardized test scores for minority than white applicants was not narrowly tailored to compelling governmental interest the school board relied exclusively on 1981 consent decree ordering desegregation to prove compelling governmental interest magnet schools had been released from the decree in 1990 however and the appeals court found that while student body diversity provided compelling justification for considering race in law school admissions under grutter it is by means clear that it could be such at or below the high school level 53 the admission plan was additionally flawed for its failure to consider raceneutral means to achieve student body diversity and was quota system student selections were made from two separate lists of applicant students one for black student and one for white students without direct comparison of candidates to the applicant pool at large insulating students of one racial group from competition with the larger admissions pool along with the 50 goal amounted to an impermissible quota the diversity issue has also arisen in another educational setting the university of california operates popular elementary school as laboratory to research urban education and to foster more effective educational system primarily for urban elementary students beyond basic research the school develops new techniques for educating students in multicultural urban settings and conducts seminars workshops and teacher training programs throughout the state the school considers applicants race and ethnicity to obtain adequate crosssamples of the general population and thus to maintain the scientific credibility of its educational studies the plaintiff in hunter v regents of the university of california 54 challenged the schools admissions policy as an equal protection violation while pe rhaps not tantamount to diversity rationale the ninth circuit nonetheless agreed with the district c ourt judge that the states interest in operating researchoriented elementary school dedicated to improving the quality of education in urban public schools was compelling even absent any purpose of remedying past discrimination the challenges posed by californias increasingly diverse population intensify the states

found compelling in grutter are advanced not only by viewpoint diversity but also by racial diversity and these interests are less strong in k12 than in higher education turning to the narrowly

africanamerican enrollment and students were bused if necessary to ensure racial diversity twentyfive years later in 2000 the federal courts ended their supervision of the desegregation plan but the jcps voluntarily opted to maintain its integrated schools through managed choice plan the plan was challenged in lawsuit by black parents whose children were denied admission to central high school which was already at the upper percentage limit for minority enrollment the district court found that the managed choice plan served numerous compelling state interests some of the same reasons for integrated schools that the supreme court upheld in grutter thus judge heyburn accepted the school boards arguments that the plan improved the educational experience that it produced educational benefits for students of all races over the last 25 years and that it helped overcome the adverse effects of concentrations of poverty that impact black students to greater extent than whites integrated schools better academic performance appreciation for our diverse heritage and stronger more competitive public schools are consistent with the central values and themes of american culture

revise for the 20052006 school year for reasons articulated in the wellreasoned opinion of the district court the sixth circuit summarily affirmed judge heyburns decree without issuing detailed

seattles as long as the plan is otherwise narrowly tailored the court held that seattles plan was sufficiently narrowly tailored concluding that the 15 percentage point band was not quota because it

he found that the school plans were unconstitutional because they were not narrowly tailored in addition justice thomas filed concurring opinion and justices stevens and breyer filed separate dissenting opinions in the portion of his opinion that was joined by justice kennedy and that therefore announced the judgment of the court chief justice roberts be gan by noting that the court had jurisdiction in the case thereby rejecting challenge to the standing of the plaintiff organization parents involved in community schools pics 65 chief justice roberts then turned to the substantive merits of the claims involved reiterating that governmental racial classifications must be reviewed under strict scrutiny as result the court examined whether the school districts had demonstrated that their assignment and transfer plans were narrowly tailored to achieve compelling governmental interest in assessing the compelling interest prong of the strict scrutiny test chief justice roberts noted that the court has recognized two interests that qualify as compelling where the use of racial classifications in the school context is concerned remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination and promoting diversity in higher education however the chief justice found that neither of these interests was advanced by the school plans at issue according to the chief justice because seattle schools were never intentionally segregated and because the lifting of its desegregation order demonstrated that louisville schools had successfully remediated past discrimination in its schools neither school district could assert compelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimination 66 likewise the court argued that the grutter precedent did not govern the current cases according to chief justice roberts the compelling interest recognized in grutter was in broadly defined diversity that encompassed more than just racial diversity and that focused on each applicant as an individual because race was the only factor considered by the school districts rather than other factors that reflected broader spectrum of diverse qualifications and characteristics and because the plans did not provide individualized review of applicants the plurality opinion found that the school districts articulated interest in diversity was not compelling added the chief justice even when it comes to race the plans here employ only limited notion of diversity viewing race exclusively in whitenonwhite terms in seattle and blackother terms in jefferson county 67 in rejecting grutter as applicable precedent the court also noted that the decision had rested in part on the unique considerations of higher education and that those considerations were absent in the elementary and secondary education context even if the school districts had met the first prong of the strict scrutiny test by establishing compelling governmental interest in the use of racial classifications to make school assignments the court found the school plans would still have failed the second prong of the test because they were not sufficiently narrowly tailored to meet their stated goals according to chief justice roberts in both seattle and louisville only few students were assigned to nonpreferred school based on race as result the minimal impact of the districts racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications 68 especially in light of the fact that such racial classifications are permissible in only the most extreme circumstances 65 parents involved in cmty schs v seattle sch dist 1 2007 us lexis 8670 3233 us 2007 66 id at 3637 67 id at 41 68 id at 60

had failed to consider methods other than racial classifications to achieve their goals despite requirement that narrowly tailored programs consider raceneutral alternatives although justice kennedy joined the above portions of the plurality opinion thereby forming majority in favor of striking down the school plans he did not join the remainder of the plurality opinion which concluded for additional reasons that the school plans were unconstitutional in these portions of his opinion chief justice roberts faulted the school plans for tying their diversity goals to each districts specific racial demographics rather than to any pedagogical concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits69 in other words each district tried to establish schools with racial diversity that mirrored the percentages of racial groups in their respective overall populations this effort according to the chief justice amounted to unconstitutional racial balancing because the plans were not in fact narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits that allegedly flow from racial diversity but rather were tailored to racial demographics instead indeed chief justice roberts wrote accepting racial balancing as compelling state interest would justify the imposition of racial proportionality throughout american society contrary to our repeated recognition that at the heart of the constitutions guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the government must treat citizens as individuals not as simply components of racial religious sexual or national class 70 such racial balancing could not in the chief justices view amount to compelling governmental interest even if pursu ed in the name of racial diversity or racial integration in another portion of the plurality opinion not joined by justice kennedy chief justice roberts criticized justice breyers dissent for misapplying precedents that recognized compelling interest in remedying past discrimination according to the chief justice the court has recognized compelling interest in remedying past discrimination when that discrimination is caused by governmental action but not when caused by other factors such as social or economic pressures noting that the seattle school district was never segregated due to state action and the louisville school district had eliminated all vestiges of state segregation the chief justice therefore argued that the cases cited by justice breyer as precedents for raceconscious school integration efforts were inapplicable to the current case 71 the plurality opinion concluded with discussion of brown v board of education 72 in which the court held that the deliberate segregation of schoolchildren by race was unconstitutional according to the plurality before brown schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin the school distri cts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once againeven for very different reasons the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race 73 although he joined the court in striking down the school plans justice kennedy wrote separate concurring opinion that provides additional insight into

context as noted above justice kennedy declined to sign on to the plurality opinion in full in part because he disagreed with its implication that diversity in elementary and secondary education at least as properly defined does not serve compelling governmental interest according to justice kennedy diversity depending on its meaning and definition is compelling educational goal school district may pursue74 but neither seattle nor louisville had shown that its plans served compelling interest in promoting diversity or that the plans were narrowly tailored to achieve that goal justice kennedy also pointedly criticized the plurality opinion for implying an alltoo unyielding insistence that race cannot be factor in instances when in my view it may be taken into account in the administration of public schools by the state and local authorities it is permissible to consider the racial makeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encourage diverse student body one aspect of which is its racial composition 75 justice kennedy identified several ways in which schools in his view could constitutionally pursue racial diversity or avoid racial isolation including strategic site selection of new schools altering attendance zones providing resources for special programs and recruiting students and faculty according to justice kennedy such measures would be constitutional because while raceconscious they are not based on classifications that treat individuals differently based on race however justice kennedy would not limit schools to facially neutral methods of achieving diversity saying that racial classifications might be permissible if ba sed on more nuanced individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics similar to the plan approved in grutter 76 although other justice joined his concurrence justice kennedys unique role in providing the pivotal swing vote in the case makes his concurring opinion significant to any future legal developments regarding the use of racial classifications in the education context although justice thomas joined the plurality opinion written by chief justice roberts in full he also wrote separate concurring opinion that took issue with certain aspects of justice breyers dissent among other things justice thomas disagreed with the dissents assertion that the school plans were necessary to combat school resegregation arguing that neither seattle nor louisville faced the type of intentional state action to separate the races that the school districts in brown had77 in addition justice thomas contested the dissents argument that less strict standard of review should apply when racial classifications are used for benign purposes in part because justice thomas disagreed that the school planswhich he wrote inevitably exclude some individuals based on race and therefore may exacerbate racial tensionare as benign as the dissent asserted more importantly justice thomas argued that the perception of what constitutes benign use of raceconscious measures is nothing more than reflection of current social practice that relies too heavily on the good intentions of current public officials according to justice thomas if our history has taught us anythi ng it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories adding in footnote justi ce breyers good intentions which i do

moot by the supreme court after the parties reached an outofcourt settlement the appeal from taxman v board of education of piscataway township 81 had asked the high court to consider whether local school boards desire to promote faculty diversity could legally justify its decision to protect black teacher from layoff while dismissing an equally qualified white colleague in the absence of showing of past discrimination or manifest racial imbalance in its workforce two teachers one white the other black were hired on the same day in 1980 and were deemed equally qualified for their positions in the business education department when reduction in force became necessary eight years later minority teachers were not underrepresented on the overall facultyconstituting 95 of the districts teachers versus 58 of the relevant county labor pooland evidence of past discrimination by the school district was presented at trial coin toss had traditionally been used to determine retention rights among similarly situated employees in the past but because only one black teacher was among the business departments tenmember staff the school district relied on its affirmative action policy to retain the minority employee rather than her white colleague in the interests of promoting racial diversity an banc majority of the third circuit determined that however laudable the school boards objective might be laying off white reacher solely on the basis of race to achieve faculty diversity exceeded the bounds of controlling s upreme court precedent title vii rulings in weber and johnson permitted employers to make employment decisions based on race or gender in order to redress manifest imbalance of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories but judicial teachings generally caution against affirmative action measures that unnecessarily trammel or frustrate the legitimate and firmly rooted expectation in continued employment of affected nonminorities in its 1986 wygant decision the court voided race based layoff protection for minority public school teachers because of its immediate adverse impact on identifiable senior white employees consequently while applauding the boards commitment to racial diversity the taxman appellate opinion rejected the nonremedial educational purposes asserted by the board for its affirmative

white teacher whose interests were unnecessarily trammeled by the loss of her job the racebased policy violated title vii on march 9 1998 the supreme court declined to review the legality of minority bonus policy in an affirmative action plan established for nevadas public colleges to redress lack of minority faculty members in farmer v university and community college systems of nevada82 the plaintiff had been one of three finalists for faculty position in the sociology department that the university awarded to black male candidate from uganda with comparable qualifications the universitys minority bonus policy which the nevada supreme court described as an unwritten amendment to its affirmative action plan allowed department to hire an additional faculty member following the initial placement of minority candidate as consequence the plaintiff was hired by the sociology department year later but at lesser salary than the earlierhired black candidate the differential was defended by the university as reflecting pay premium necessary to prevent bidding war be tween two prestigious universities slated to interview the black candidate farmer challenged both the hiring and pay decisions by the university as race and sex discrimination prohibited by title vii and the equal pay act the state supreme court reversed jury verdict for the plaintiff and upheld the universitys affirmative action hiring policy on both federal constitutional and statutory grounds first according to the court race was only one fact or considered by the universityalong with educational background publishing teaching experience etcin evaluating applicants in contrast to piscataway the university faculty was white enclave with only 1 black members factor persuading the court that the university had compelling interest in fostering culturally and ethnically diverse faculty under standards laid out by the bakke and weber cases here in addition to considerations of race the university based its employment decision on such criteria as educational background pu blishing teaching experience and areas of specialization this satisfies bakkes commands that race must be only one of several factors used in evaluating applicants we also view the desirability of racially diverse faculty as sufficiently analogous to the constitutionally permissible attainment of racially diverse student body countenanced by the bakke court thus severe minority underrepresentation on the university faculty combined with the employers consideration of relative qualifications in addition to race distinguished piscataway the nevada court felt and conformed the case to justice powells bakke opinion in addition the impact of the initial minority hire was mitigated by affording

the pursuit of diversity in higher education but this expansion has been curtailed somewhat by the courts more recent pronouncement involving seattles and louisvilles school plans to promote racial diversity although the courts decision to strike down the seattle and louisville school assignment and transfer plans will have profound impact on similar plans at many of the nations elementary and secondary schools the parents involved in community schools case did not completely foreclose the possibility that school districts may constitutionally pursue certain measures to avoid racial isolation prevent resegregation nd promote racial diversity in their schools however it is not entirely clear what these measures might entail while the facially raceneutral methods identified in justice kennedys concurring opinionsuch as engaging in strategic site selection of new schools altering attendance zones providing resources for special programs and recruiting students and facultyseem more likely to survive judicial scrutiny the fate of other kinds of raceconscious school plans may become apparent only as result of legal developments that emerge over time indeed the seeds of future controversy may lie in questions arguably raised but not fully addressed by the latest rulings for example the courts latest rulings left unanswered the constitutional status of racially exclusive diversity policies not directly involving admissions such as the legality of racebased scholarship and financial aid recruitment and outreach or college preparation courses that exclusively target minority populations in addition the question of whether schools or universities may completely avoid constitutional shoals by adopting race neutral plans to increase racial diversity may not be fully answered by the courts latest rulings such raceneutral alternatives include percentage plans like those approved in texas florida and california that guarantee college admission to top graduates from every state high school regardless of race in addition to percentage plans educational authorities have experimented with other forms of alternative action or polici designed to promote racial diversity without relying on racial preferences classbased affirmative action for example takes socioeconomic status or the family educational background of students into account florida has replaced race and ethnicity with other socioeconomic and geographical proxies for diversity increased the states needbased financial aid program sought to improve the states lowestperforming primary and secondary schools and provided free sa t prep courses at those schools california state schools have targeted financial aid programs toward underprivileged neighborhoods as means of reaching minority students another approach considers diversity or hardship essays in which applicants describe challenging life experiences such as poverty english as second language or having family member in prison some reformers advocate targeting additional resources to underperforming elementary and secondary schools as way to address the root causes of minority underrepresentation in higher education by avoiding the use of explicit racial classifications and dual track admission policies these efforts are far less susceptible to facial challenge as an equal protection violation programs involving the explicit consideration of race remain most at risk but policies that employ nonracial factors as proxy for race may be vulnerable if the purpose or intent

groups is subject to strict scrutiny if it is enacted with racially discriminatory purpose racial motive was made constitutional touchstone for equal protection analysis and whether reflected by racial classification or other evidence of discriminatory purpose strict scrutiny was triggered by evidence of such intent similarly alternatives to traditional racial diversity policies may not escape strict judicial scrutiny if an objecting nonminority applicant is able to show that the plan was racially motivated the same limitations may apply to private institutions which are immune from constitutional limitations under title vi of the 1964 civil rights act beyond education issues may inevitably arise concerning the implications of grutter and parents involved in community schools on efforts to achieve racial diversity in other social and economic spheres to date the court has permitted raceconscious hiring criteria by private employers under title vii either as remedy for past discrimination or to redress conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories 85 but refused to find that states interest in faculty diversity to provide teacher role models was sufficiently compelling to warrant race conscious layoff policy86 lower courts are similarly divided though few have applied an operational need analysis to uphold police force diversity policies recognizing that law enforcement bodys need to carry out its mission effectively with workforce that appears unbiased is able to communicate with the public and is respected by the community it serves
