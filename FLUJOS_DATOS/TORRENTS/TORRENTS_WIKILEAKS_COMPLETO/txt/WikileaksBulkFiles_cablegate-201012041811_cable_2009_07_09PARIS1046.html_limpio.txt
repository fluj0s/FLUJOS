pgov prel fr subject iran eu diplomats to attend ahmadinejad inauguration classified by political ministercounselor kathleen h allegrone for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf european union members will send lowranking diplomats to the first of two inauguration ceremonies for mahmoud ahmadinejad but they will not inform the iranians of their plans according to french mfa acting middle east director assistantsecretary equivalent jeanchristophe paucelle if the iranians find out beforehand that the eu will not send ambassadorlevel representation paucelle told poloff early july 31 then they may rescind the invitations to the august 3 event as they did in similar circumstances prior to former president khatamis inauguration in 1997 its hard to keep secret when 27 nations are involved paucelle noted but we are trying only the swedish eu presidency will be represented by an ambassador paucelle said 2 cnf all eu members will however send their ambassadors to the august 5 inauguration ceremony in the iranian parliament paucelle adopted defensive tone when explaining this decision which he said was finalized in brussels the morning of july 31 he admitted this issue had generated tense and fractious debate among european foreign ministers we are caught between two conflicting objectives paucelle explained on the one hand we want to communicate that we do not approve of this illegitimate election on the other hand we need to be realistic the power is in the hands of khameini and ahmadinejad including the nuclear file and we must negotiate with those in power you are in the same position paucelle insisted that the eu will continue to respect what he described as the durban red lines we will walk right out if ahmadinejad denies the holocaust or declares that his regime will destroy israel note paucelle admitted that since nonmuslims had never before received an invitation to the inauguration ceremony presided over by the supreme leader eu diplomats in tehran have never entered the building where the event will take place and so they are not sure how they will stage their walkout logistically should they need to do so they are worried that the doors may be locked end note paucelle also reported that the german ambassador will return from his vacation on august 4 to ensure that he will miss the first ceremony and attend the second one along with his eu counterparts the british ambassador will attend as well even without credentials the iranians are desperate for recognition and so they have disregarded their usual devotion to protocol and their antibritish vitriol on this occasion 3 cnf paucelle said that the case of detained french citizen clothilde reiss has also influenced the eu decision to attend the inauguration ceremonies we think she may be released soon and we dont want to create another irritant paucelle said there are enough already he reported that the french have reason to believe reiss may form part of group of detainees likely to be released on the august 7 anniversary of imam mahdi paucelle noted that letter released july 29 by ahmadinejad supported the idea of granting clemency to postelection protesters during mahdi celebrations the iranians will need to take facesaving measures and so she will likely transfer to house arrest or some other status paucelle said he added that of course she may not be released at all next week but the french remain optimistic that she will soon be out of prison pekala
