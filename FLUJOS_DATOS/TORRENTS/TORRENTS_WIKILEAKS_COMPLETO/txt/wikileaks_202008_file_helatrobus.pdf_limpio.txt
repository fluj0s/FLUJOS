the helatrobus implant s lecture given by l ron hubbard on 21 may 196 3 than k you people of earth we come in peace we bring plowsha re not sword but we wont use any clouds to spread the message oh i see you characters havent been really up to the front of the track yet all those helatrobus implants of cours came out of clou ds originally you know and this is the 21st of mayo ad 13 galactic ye well thats beside the point you dont look to like youve been making the progress you oug ht to you just dont look to like youve been making the progress but poss ibly if you d taken retread in the keokuk central office maybe you woul d have made better progress an int eresting problem has presented itself and so forth every once in while an industrious d of t will treat an hpa like somebody in coaudit you know and give them all the latest tapes and mat erials and just overwhel m them but good you see and never teach them how to audit and would you like to be handl ing the material you are handlin g without knowing how to audit be rough wouldnt it wel l the degree that we dont make goo d auditors and the degree that we cant give saint hill tra ining to as many as poss ible we are actually holding back scientol ogy you re in just littl bit of breathi ng space right at the present instant this is just little bit of breath ing space i was playing tag with the atomic war and the enthusiasm with which certain misguided degraders wish to laun ch off the bomb and all of this sort of thing actually stood across our track rather hard and it caused tremendous acceleration in research which ordinarily would have been plotted out across much longer space of time and gives us some thing of an emergency characteristic on this because weve still got to beat this lin weve still got to beat this and these characters dont know what the yre doing i can imag ine them now you know saying saying well to be happy or not to be happy you know i i dont know i can see kennedy walking around now well is it really the begi nning of heaven or the end of heaven you see and so on hes going over and see the pope and the res the pope sitting there and so forth and hes got an elec tronic that is cutting his guts out you know and hes saying bless you my uhh bless you my you know wild gam going on and the are the characters who are tel ling you whe ther or not you can laun ch bomb or not launch bomb you see so theres good sense involved in any of this and its sort of in the card s and were winning were winning hands down now our technol ogical advance at this particu lar time is sweeping on much faster than i can give you all of the fine bit s of so that i can give you the technology and the way you arr ive at the technol ogy and this is the best that i can do now wev long talked about clears and so forth and thats fine there is nothing wrong with that and there are cle ars and so forth and we can make clears by our own definition and as far as the public is concerned why this is very interesting advance and as peter once told he says man he says but i need this he says to interest people out in the public dont go knocking out this grade of clear see well hes per fectly right see perfectly right but in actual fact the state of clear is not only att ainable but is being attained today here and there without any hard ly any remark at all now forinstance in the last eight and half hours of audi ting ive found three goals and run three banks on pc three complete gpms well this is this is rather dizzy rate of speed dont you see all right now you havent got any time to cele brate thats whats wrong with that youre achieving these things and theres chance to to stat to the pc now you have to brea k out the champagn you see because it usually happens in the mid dle of sessi on by the middle of the next session or the end of the session hes already gone bey ond it you re achievin g these various points now if your achieving this now you migh t be quite interes ted in the fac t that states of beingne ss undreamed of before exist immedia tely before you theyre in your very immedia future before christmas probably if you keep your nose to the grindst one and keep your case going youre youre right there now the technological win is tremendous and there are only about five percent of the cases youre going to run int that are going to give you bit of thetan ache because they dont have what i choose to call now because it was the nation or small governme nt that did these things helatrobus not to be confused with helatro be helatrobe is the galactic confeder ation its helatrobus call these things the helatrobus implant s for lack of better designa tion because 43 trillion isnt accurat for all cases dont you see and that sort of thing you cant give it by time date and there is reason to keep calling it by time date lets call it by somethin g that was less well known but that we can identify call them the hela trobus implants and it tells you these are the impl ants which begin with the elec tronic clouds over planets and and the dichotomy plus and minu s and so forth and sweep on through in certai n series and peop have been through them once twice three four tim and they have we have the patt erns of the first series very accurately well shortly have the patt erns of the second series all that mak very easy auditing we even have technique that handles this now 3n which has jus t been released and that s the same patter that youve been using speeded up bit and theres even shortened version of that which you will need very soon you need thi s youll go right on needing this from her on out wit h pc you ll need whats called 3n but 3n has to be short ened after pc has gone for three or four banks because the pcs run ning too fas t and for instanc ive gotten pc up to point of the ri blow s on stateme nt this pc has been very carefully textboo k audited and is now blo wing on stat ement theres you cal l it back and it doesnt even flick so you have to say th at rocket read see it that roc ket read but why because well it rocket read when they said it but you havent even got tail on the rocket read lot of the tim eyouve got the accelerated start but instead of tai l on it you ve got blowdown see the thing doesnt have chance to do comple rocket read it disin tegrates it does an accelerated beginning goes like mad the tone arm moves down pc says fine you read the thing back and its quiet as mouse you cant get tick out of this thing you havent even opposed it yet and you cant even get tick out of it all right well that of cour after while when pcs doing this its waste of time to read the ri back to him so you get 3n2 whi ch is an abbreviated form of 3n jus t like 3n is an abbreviated form of 3m2 dont you see but you won t be using 3m2 on these implants because the other is too easy now what can you cut out well i just lea ve it up to you what can you cut out bec ause your job let tell you this very straight from the shoulder your job is to make sure that the charge is blow n out of that ri and tha t is your job as an auditor and let let put bug in your ear right now dont you let any pc talk you out wit h arc breaks or anything else out of gett ing that charge off you underst and because the pc will natter the pc will yap the pc will this and will tha t about your reading it second timehow youre crosschecking or doing anything like tha t because you can do these things without losing too much spe ed but the pc starts suppress ing his cognitions in orde r to make speed you see suppressing this suppressing that and all of sudden youve got little fluky rr that goes flickpow and you see it stop its its choke d down pcs suppressing almost as fast as hes giving it to you and you say the pc is very nattery and the pc is this way and that way and ther efore you mustnt go in and clean that up wel l youve been def eated as an auditor the moment you make that conclus ion you got it let the pc yap beca use your payoff your payoff comes in the next two or three gpms and if youv done that well in the first that youre running then your blows through the second are easier the third the fourth gpm and you re just flying by enunciation and recognition you underst and and youll be runn ing maybe gpm every fortyfive minutes of auditing time you got tha t now now all you have to do is get nelson eye on the emeter british ism he put the telescope to his blind eye they tol d him to withdraw you see and he said he didnt see any thing there is where your dan ger lies bec ause this thing chokes you didn t get nice rr you say we ll ill let it go because the pc is runn ing so well and this pc gets so natt ery and arc breaky every time i stop him and reason reason reason reason reason now youre just mad tremendous quantities of work for yourself every time you strike that item again in the next bank you re going to find out that you didnt clear the charge of it in this bank not only are the next few ris going to be impeded but that ite m in the nex t bank comparably is going to be badl impeded and you are going to stack the case up you hear now arc bre aks wont stack the case up but unb lown ris wil l and its your job as an auditor to get that charge off and thats your job and dont let any pc talk you out of it see youve got two choices on running these days youve got two choices that you can make and one of them is wrong and that is have the pc alwaye happy and chee rful and the other is have the charge gone and you just forget about that first choice because how anybody could run the helatrob us implants and be happy and cheerfu l i dont know oddly enough after while they will be happ and cheerful but only if you get the char ge off early on so nag them all you want to now you can nag them to point where the cha rge wont blow see wher your judgment lies you can get them so upset and so entur bulated and so jumped up that the cha rge wont blow youve gone the wron g direction dont you see but the n that was neces sary thing youre making mistakes then in order to do this you get yourself good clean rr that s disintegrating at the end and its blowing its obv iously going this rr is going to be gone and you read it back and you rea d it back and then you say well it didnt rr again and you read it back and you say are you doing anything are you thinking about anything it didnt read ill read it again wantab ly fantastic it didnt read that time whats the matter and nex t thing you know the pc is saying whats hap whaaa whi where am i going you see well you made mistake the place to really get skilled is to recognize the qual ity of rrs now some hpa thinks well im doi ng pretty good ive lea rned what an rr is you take off from there you get pret ty good and learn what choke d rr is and what disinteg rating rr is and then youll be in business you get some rrs you could actually see the pc supp ress them as they happen for moment there you can see that rr stop and you can say to the pc what happened pc says well it wasnt much i wel l i just had little cogniti on for interest of speed of run they start suppressing their cognitions almost fatal dont you see and you say thats fine thank you call the item again and by golly therell be the full rr see you have to learn to interpr et an rr there is nothi ng anybody can do to help you really beyond you finding out what one is thes wide loose disintegrating rrsspeed rapidly at the beginni ng if you dont get the instant spurt at the beginning youll never see it as an rr because it hasnt got any rr on the end its disintegrated already you see an rr as it goes over has hook tail and many an audi tor gets so educated into recognizing an rr by its hooked tail that when he gets to disin tegrating rr he sees hooked tail but he missed the spur t beginning now of course the met er is already in motion at the time tha t the auditor starts to interpret it you see hes used to having his att ention caught by the fac t that the thing is movi ng he gets his atte ntion so he says if it needl starts moving then i should look at it and see if its an rr well of course then he only sees the end of it and it looks like fall ah but it had spurt beginni ng hes looked at disin tegrated rr the thing has disinteg rated before its gone see that thing has blown its blown complet ely theres nothing smoke left on it you call thi s thing again and it doesnt fire at all and you say we ll i must have the wron g item lets random list for fortyfive minutes oh hel ls bells you cou ld run whole bank in fortyfive minutes its non sense you see why tha ts because the auditor doesnt have his attention on the meter to catch the beginning spurt see an rr is charact erized by spurte d accelerated beginning which is gives it its nam it looks like somethi ng taking off you kno w like being shot shot awa from its start its spurt ing beginnin g it goes psshh see and then its othe r characteristic is curled end after it gets passed over here it go khih h and an rr is always charact erized by these two things beginning goes psshh and the end go slhhp all righ t the disintegrating rr does nt go slhhp it only goes pss ht all rig ht so if you have to have your attention caught by the meter already being in motion you miss the beginni ng spurt so you dont know if youve got an rr or fall then youll see an rr start off bea utifully you can gauge the speed of an rr of how far it will run by just watching it you can get used to that and it starts off beautifu lly it goes pssht and it it didnt go anyplace thats choke d rr and theres suppress or cognition suppressed or the pc has done something there pc has sudd enly wondered if it wsb co vitiviwiwibibly or some thing see half way through having said it something has happ ened here and tha t rr isnt blown and it wont blow until you ask the pc what hap pened and get rid of that suppress and then the pc says well the pc says well i was soandso and soandso and i thoug ht it might be because theres two here on the sheet and so forth and i thought it might be and therefor soandso and you say all right now im going to say the ite m again inevitable catsfish inevitable catsfish all right that rocket read and it will it rocket read beautif ully where was the char ge the char ge is insisted on you must realize that these ris dont have any more charge on them than you see on the met er just mar k that down this meter is not indicating the presenc of charge the rocket read doesnt tell you that there is some charge somepla ce just do total associate see the rocket read is the char ge all the charge that is going to come off of that thing is seen in and has vel ocity in that rocket read that is the cha rge now you could be very pedantic and say well actually the thetan in the facsimile is subjected to certain impulses which causes him to impulsi fy and the 76volt or 9volt current which is being passed through the corporeal resistance chamber known as human body is ther efore modulated and monitored by the various circuits which are appr oached from the righthand electrode and whi ch terminate in the left hand electrode and theres magnet ic influence so that you get visua l response in the ohmmeter ohdamniter some poor dear in scientology every once in while tells huh but you talk so much abo ut electricity ihehheh i dont know any thing about these things i always shake them by the hand and say that makes two of us other people pretend they know somethingabout it see well this is an interest ing piece of magic youve got here in an emeter thats for sure this is an interest ing piece of magic and isnt it interes ting that it doesn t exist elsewhere on the whol track oh recording devices and detecti ve devices and thi sas and that as and the other thing all exist on the whole track and there are all kind s of things and my old pals in certain section s of this universe well in the galactic confede racy particu larly would be absolutely horrifi ed if i said well we developed meter we dont have here because their pride is that they hav all the equipmen t that was all has ever exi sted or that will ever be deve loped and they know eve ry electronic activity that has ever existed or will eve r exist anywhere and that ends the ir modesty on the sub ject see and you say well heres box of tricks that does something that none of our meters do it woul dnt be popular statement but itd be true one its quite remarkable that it does it so let s not worry why it does it lets not worry at all why it does it let s worry much more succinctly about the inf ormation it gives the auditor and the information it gives the aud itor is the re is something there there is nothing there or what is there is beyon d the pcs reality it gives us there is somethi ng there that will be real to the pc and thats all fine we know all that but lets take the next ste p that this thing is charged and is discharging now you ve customarily in the past read this on your tone arm well you dont read the helatrobus implants on your tone arm we dont care whether the tone arm moves or not jus t skip it out in 3n thats too much bother because you do bank or two and the ton arm starts moving down matter how high the thin g has been stuck and all the charge that was on the original bank you were doing is coming off it s coming off on the need but you ll also see the needle action reflect over onto the tone arm so that is all the cha rge there is on an ri dont imagine that sle eping beneath the surface is slumb ering volcano that something elec can tri gger sir the re is such thing when you read one of these things and it goes pssheww and then you read it again ordinarily early on in cas you only get hal f the rr or thereabouts and when you read it again you get fzzt very tiny rr about quarter of an inch and when you rea d it again it goes thi tick thats early on in case well what happened to the rest of the rr you ve got to recogni ze that something happene d to this rr othe rwise youll be nagging the pc to find out what happened to the rr well the rr evapo rated thats what happened to it now youve got to tell the differe nce between an rr that evaporated and an rr that was chok ed to death because they look different on the met er and you just have to get your eye edu cated to be able to tell the differe nce and it s pretty hard to do and its not hundred percentprecision i had to study in meter i dont know hour or two or three and certainly somethi ng on the order of about five or six hours of auditing paying attention to just this one thing until i finall got the subtle nuances of diff erence between them so its case where experience is very good thing to have well we can make som very good general statements you can see the back break on one of these things too although what that mea ns is just more choke see and then youll run into this one the thi ng fell when he said it and then you had him giv you another version covetingativably and some thing and erradi cably catfish and wi ngabingably catfish and all of sudden youll see this fantastic rocket read on something that has nothing to do with the pri ce of oranges you see and you say gi ve the original item again and you get gorgeous rocket read in other words you had rocket read sitting on top of it somethi ng in his own exis tence had pressed down on this thing and had transfer red the read from the ri to this oth er thing in other words it ate up the rocket read and the rock et read was encysted and this one was therefore wasnt on your plo t thats always what happenswhen you cant get plo t item to read it isnt that the plot ite m isnt there electronics were broken down that way the helatrob us boys really ought to get the manufacturers seal of approval and the service seal of approval because i have been looking in vain to have one of thei r damn squawk boxes not fire its obvious with that many squawk boxes and electronic implant boxes in any existing series that well it is obvious that their repairmen werent all that good bec ause theyre on cables and so forth particul arly those strung outside those that are on the last implant of the first series that were just there open to the weather oh i consider it very rem arkable that they stay in oper ation i keep looking for hole to occur in the line plot dont you see ive had my eye open on this now for the last two or three thousand items you know everything working wantab ly fantasti cably catfishably and pow its working there it reads so i just dropped it out of the lin that theres something wrong with the ele ctronic implant equipmen t as the pc went by see i dropped that out the reas on i bring that up that might occur to some of you well i guess that box wasnt working that day see well its always possible that that is true but i haven t found it to be true they always worked they sho uld get the manufacturers seal of approva l and so forth their production boys and the ir service unit should have gotten the leather medal pinned on with blank et pin very deep but the poi nt i am making here is that theres something wrong with the way the pc has approached this thing and as your pc gets to flying on down the line you less and less will hav trouble with thi s the poin t im trying to make to you you do your job well at first and your job gets easier and you do lousy job at first and your job will not get easier and it migh t even get harder now the poin t where you make speed is to do your originals and earlies right and then youll make more and more spe ed more and more speed more and more speed it goes faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and dont pull colossa l blunders like letting your pc miss an item which remains fully charged even tho ugh he hit it you know you couldnt get any rocket read so just went on by it and then find your pc leaping into the sec ond series the source of all skips is missed ri and the res two way s to miss one jus t not have it at all or not discharge it in othe r words skip flyin g into another bank flying elsewhere bouncing off the track not being there in the incident anymore is caus ed by missing an ri eit her by not calling it at all we go from covetably to inevita bly or some thing of the sort and we dont get the nix in see or we call it it didn t fire we dont get the charge off of it and simply go on the next action the pc is liable to do is skip you skip somethi ng so he qsandas and he may go into the identical or the similar implant of the second series and you suddenly find yourself running the seco nd implant series and you won der whats all this the pc is being torn to ribbo ns nothing is rring right the thin g is the words arent right and all of sudden he says impassably and insurmountably inevitably catfish and you say that isnt in the line plot its in the second series not tho words are in the seco nd series i haven t got the second series plot ive got som of it thou gh and you say where did all this com from what happened what happened what happened well good way to do that is to get your pc oriented early as to his surroundings have him close his eyes and take look he doesn t want to look very much when you fir st start to run it he will tel l you its terribly unreal and he can t see very much and aft er you have done bank or two his reality on visio will be gett ing greater and greater and better and better and its usable by the auditor now pcs go up step s and down steps in the fir st implants and they don t always just go down they sometimes also go up because thats more confusing they dont turn around in the mid dle of set of steps and go the oth er way but theyll start abank and itll go back wards to the last bank so forth so this is all very confusing but you get pc so dont tell him you always go downstairs because sometimes they go up see and sometim the oppterms are on the right and sometim theyre on the left which also makes it interesting and sometimes pc is sitting there with line plot and says this line plot ought to be printed in reverse you know well you can say its printed right for at leas t half of the gpms because it is about half of them it is reversed see now as the pc goes along you can actually and you can over do this you can make him put too much attention on and work him into it and yap at him and nag him and so forth but it helps you out and you say take take look there what do you see and he says well i see fligh t of steps and you say well are any of them gray yeah he says theres one down there thats gray thats an ri you did nt get are any of those steps black yeah well theres one over here thats black and the res t of them closer to are white brother somethi ngs wrong here somethi ngs missed see thats pretty crude repair i myself dont use it but i like to hear pc tell those steps are all whit now oh thats very nice thats very nice that tells you you havent got speck of charge left beh ind you because those charge thos steps were black as ink the first time you went over them see but ri by ri they turn white see interest ing isnt it you can even orient the pc this is real trickery i mean these guys really set it up well this is real trickery on part of an auditor tricky sneaky before you list for the next goal have the pc close his eyes and tell you what he sees find the next goal and its top oppterm then have the pc close his eyes and tell you if hes in the same locale that he was in before because if hes in differen t locale youve missed whole bank tricky huh you get what i mean these banks usually end at the top or botto ms of stairs youve just gotten the last item you see he closes his eyes all rig ht where are you well im on this landing all right you got that oh youre on the land ing thats fine all right now were going to get the next goal and we get the next goal and as soon as weve got it and then we ve got its the top oppterm of it we have the pc close his eyes again and we say now where are you well he says im in the same place but just one step down thats fine tricky thats using the scenery to confirm the fac t you dont skip anything youll find out the pc has never had any visio these implants are marvelous to run because the pc has never had any visi has never seen anything has never heard anything has sonic has visio has tactile kine sthetic nothing and hes bee n in this state ever ce anybody has ever tried to run an engram on him now this has been the bane of everybo dys existen ce you run him halfway through bank or quarter of the way through the first bank and all of sudden hes got dim visio you run him all the way thro ugh couple of banks and boy hes got visio you run him thro ugh three banks and hes got kinesth esia you can hear these crazy he can get one of these crazy theta poles wobblin g he can feel it wobble see and he ll come up to full sonic on this quite remarkable weve sweated for yea rs all kind s of tricker to turn on the perceptics of pc well its in the helatrob us implants right on the button you run them you got it well you can use the scenery of the implant to orien t the pc and tell whether or not you ve missed items in fact theres lot of trickery involved in this see as far as the auditor is concern ed he can get pre tty slippy now i dont ask you to get this slippy but on certain flights of stairs apparently there are electric switches on the walls that tell you what goal the next ban k is turned to thats pretty good isnt it its not in engl ish but the pc understo od the language when he went through pc told him well i know its undoubtedly the right goal because its marked up there on the wall theway you turn ove r the switch over to the goal to be happ apparent ly this shifted all the relays and everythi ng that was going on in the squawk boxes by just shifting one lever i like to think that one of the operators accidentally threw the activat ion switch one day while setting up one of the series of goals i like to think that hap pened anyhow because actually the control s were on the land ings and sta irs pretty tricky now all of this is very good news and its very good news from several quarters one the helatro bus implants are incredi ble its unbelievable man in the street can run them however you just find to forget on the top opp terms and just go along with your 3n patte r give him the thing you dont have to writ it all out for him you shou ldnt write somebodys whole bank out for him he should have to think it out that much to keep him in the inc ident you underst and you can give him the num ber and so forth and you just tell him how to do this he maybe even have had to go home and read his dict ionary and study to find out what ably was and so forth but he doesnt know anything more about it than that and hell run this thing and hell run just about so long and all of sudden hell start telling you that this was long time ago and that this was this and this was tha t and hell really start holding forth on the subject in oth er words it runs as gently as that it requires education but the inc redibility of it keeps it from being believed or usurped and used for evil purposes until we can cont rol it you d be surprised the degree that we use incredu lity as protecti ve security mechanism in scientology just never forget that because its marvelous one its marvelous one oh that scientol ogy its balderda sh those people believe that cult believes and so fort h i very often feel like just patting those horses heads just ver smoothly and nic ely and neatly and saying good show brother good show thank you because theyre operatin g as secur ity screen far mor effective than any sec urity screen any of us could devise you realize that the psychiatrist has just now found birth and prenatal s hes been chewing away on birth and prenatals for some tim now and hell eventual ly graduate up to it but whats to stop some russian from putting these one of these banks on tape recorder and play ing it off to some body whats to stop the m they dont think theyll go nuts the only thing that wil l stop them is because well those scientologists they have some ridiculo us beliefs and that actually will protect us right up straight up to the poin t when we dont need any protect ion which point will happen suddenl so dont always revile this type of an attit ude recogni ze that it has its uses it wasnt designed that way but it does have its uses you realize that we migh t very well be under the gun of some government or we might be here we might be there we might be or there might be barbed wire aro und saint hill here until you couldn t get mouse through or an english rabbit you know guards all over the place hup 2 3 4 blah blahraharhgrrrgrrr all this stuff ill jus t show halt whe re you are hush hush see can you imagine what that would do to you supposi ng i just heard today that somebody more or less didnt talk to the public about implants well all right the factor of incredu lity tends to slow them down littl bit theyre afraid somebod will get in thei r faces but remember this theyre putting themselv on withhold i almost classified the line plots then i said i wont put any body on that much of withhol d on this stuff because its too tough it would be too tough on them well just tinue to depend upon incredu lity now that factor doesnt keep you from auditing pc however you dont have to tell the pc anyt hing ian is auditing pc in here that never heard from nothing and she ran down through the bank to forget gorgeously feels fine feels wonderful doesnt even kno w where she is didnt know at the time so whats the difference you dont have to tota lly educate the pc excep t maybe in wordendings or somet hing like that in order to run them cold take the milkman out here sit him down get to forget to fire get forgotten get nix forgotten he says whats this nix well thats just what you say at this stage and you say all right now give numb er 3 there on the paper i gave you you have to fill in the for gotten after it and he says whats that mea n well thats doesnt matter what it mean s say it all rig ht thats fine that rocket reads beautif ully and so forth there we go on 3n just rol l it see keep rolling it this guy goes on and he says these things says ssssssssssss he ends up at the other end of the line you say now we have to find wha t the next goal is you know goal yes yes now who or what would to forget oppose just kee p telling oh well you want it that way and he goes on and he gives it to you whateve r it is rememb er and so on you say that fires thats thats it he says you know ive got feeling that is it take him righ t on down i dont think you could run him halfway through the firs t implant but what he says now wait minute now this happened long time ago now i know you re going to argue with but its sor t of like this i get an idea i was living on this pla net see and thats funny because you know so you see that inc redulity might deny you some pcs and may give you some catcalls but it doesnt actually keep you from auditing anyone you understa nd you don t have to sell them on whole track before you audi t them on whole track now beca use theyre sitting right there man theyre right there theyve been there ever since and it flies and your job as an auditor is just to do technically perfect job on the thi ng the only rough spot in auditing all these is auditin g goal you have that you hav ent had run that is about to be run on you things tend to go kind of solid but for tunately there was quite lot of variation in these goal pat terns and you don t follow that it would be quite strange to have three banks simultaneous between auditor and pc thats lucky break isnt it they change the thing often enough to keep it from being too restimu lative while auditing all rig ht this then gives the auditor little bit of pause the only place you really run into this is to forget therefore one of the first duties an auditor has is to get the bank to forget run out very cleanly indeed and hell feel fine because the second bank doesnt much restimulate while you are auditing the thing ive audited one of these recently on bank that wasnt run out and i felt like i was getting ead knocked off and knew what it was and knew why and it was unc omfortable but that was remediable because the bank to be rest imulative to that degree must be very rip and ready to be run almost at once any way dont you see so its coming straight up and it will be run thats the onl liability there is to this stuff now the fact that they can all be audited out ver rapidly gives you alibi whatsoever not to get them audited out you havent got any excuse at all not to audit them out now the only excuse you pardo n you do have one excuse not to audi t them out if you dont have them now how many people have got the well it s the wildest kind of guess but i think were up to about 5 percen t dont dont have the helatrobus implants or its over their heads its very small percentage and weve certainly moved up in percentage because everybody under the sun moon and stars weve been grabbing hold of have got the but we do have our 5 percent used to be far far gre ater percent age dont you see so weve closed it down to that degree now wha t do you do with that 5 percen t you are going to have certain amount of trou ble with som of the 95 percent because theyve only got the sec ond implant see or something like that i could anticipa running into some tro uble of that character but that isnt any trouble because they audit just like the first implant except they have different pattern until you get that pattern in your hands just dog it off somehow or another and do the job what about thisremaining 5 percent what can you do for those fellows they fall int two categories based on the mech anics of the time track they fall into categories that do have the implants but cannot approach them and thos that dont have and so they arent there to be appro ached theres implants to be run that is to say the res implant s on the cas but they are not the hela trobus implants and tha t fellow to some slight degree is slightly out of luck because hes got implant s that are just as vicio us as the helatrobus implant s one way or the other but the arent the same pattern they dont have pat terns of that character you cant handle them in the sam way and hes und er that much liability and so forth thats sort of bad luck bad luck well how did thi s fellow escape them well he didnt escape them by being tough and hairychested you know and not being picked up and all that sort of thing he escaped them because hes from another galaxy he ain t not native to this er galaxy you may find somebody who is native to this galaxy who never went through it he was in so lousy condition they ignored him or something of the sort i think youll find that very rare if it exists at all now we have to take up the pos sibility not the poss ibility we have to look at the fact or we have to look at the factor of the fac t that this is rim sys tem that we are in right now this is sun 12 and it is rim tiny microsco pic terribly insigni ficant little bunch of apace dust not to do it down particularly but compared to other systems galaxies confederations and that sort of things and othe r possessions of confede rations and so forth this is nothing thats why its left alone but it stand s pretty well alone its peculiarly isolated this is also true of most of the star s out in this end of this wheel you know the galaxy is big wheel and the galaxy has hub and it has rim and we are very close to the rim you look down into the sou thern horizon you notice the stars in the southern hemisphere look terribly big and terribl bright well it isnt that they are so much terribly bigger than other stars thats just the end of the galaxy that you are looking at thats the end theres just tha t many between us and more this galaxy see its very close and people wishing to get rid of troublesome characters captives anybody you can think of you know around city dumps you know they always have trouble around cities because people start using certain areas of the city for dumps you know and they take use it as dumpin g ground for the ice cube and for oth er thing unwanted beings unwanted people unwanted personnel like you overthr ow the old regime you see and you throw them through good stiff implant that mixes them up so they cant tell north from west and you thro w them into an ice cube capsule of some kind or another and wha t do you do with them well the pri mary threat to system is the str ength of thetan thats the primary threat in the view of some very aberrated charact er he think s the main danger in the planet or main danger in the system or the galaxy or so fort h is free thetan the possibility also that person in who is acting as doll or somet hing like that can exterio rize from where he is and go home pick up anoth er body and come back and raise the devil with him in other words these people are have ove rts so they try to prote ct themselves from the vengeance of free thetan and the compound the pos sibility and the potentiality of this particu lar universe as trap and they mak these people very thoroughly trapped well they dum p them they dump them pretty well far from home they try to don t even try to they dont dump them close in they dum p them way out well helatro bus threw any people that it implant ed as far as possi ble oh some of them were wandered back and som of them stayed around and some of them didnt get badly affected and rep orted back and tha t sort of thing but the also dumped people pretty far out so this particu lar system got dum ping and the marcab confederacy and some of the other stars around here just got aterrific concent ration of people being dumped from the cen ter of the hub you know they dont want to go over to the next gal axy so they just take it out to the edge of the city you know all right and this is clos enough to other galaxies that ambitious characters over there trying to get rid of people out of their galaxie s and systems and so forth would also use these rim stars now you get down toward the cen ter of this galaxy and the possibility of finding somebod without the hela trobus implants of finding any fore ign implant system will probably be total ly negligible probably nonexta nt you see but out here you got mixed bag and we dont know what they did in the next gal axy see now science fiction writers following the cue of some chap ive for gotten his name now ein stein beinstein something like that who said that mc squared over c wouldn t go man and tha t the speed of light could not be excessiv and actually i was looking up some speed tables the oth er day and trillion light years per day is not full throttle on space wagon so theres traffic between galaxies and the res traffic between islands of gala xies and oth er islands of galaxie s interesting has lot you say wel l this is science fiction the only part of scie nce fiction there are is the mistakes the sci ence fiction writers have made while writing about their own past theyve made lot of errors there the truth of the case is that its it has lot to do with you as an audit or suddenly not that you have to embr ace science fiction but you have to look at this possibility youve got to face up to the isne ss of the thing mans greatest trouble in solving his own prob lems see he didn t have enough on the ball to face up to the isness of existence and the reasons for that are very plain short succinctly stated that case which evinces the greatest unreali ty about things is that case most subject to bank solidification in an effort to remember thats technic statement i just made and has lot to do with your engram running its dir ectly proportional his effort to remembe r increases the solidity of his bank which is painful to him whi ch then brings about his statement concern ing unreality see thats proportional the amou nt of unreality evinced by case then is proport ional to the amount of solidit caused in his time track by his eff orts to reme mber if his bank goes solid every time he tries to remembe r something this becomes painful so then he counters this by saying it is unreal this fellow that tells you i dont believe in past lives is saying my time track goes sol id when i try to remembe r and it has an awful lot to do with you as an auditor because that cas that evinces great unreality must be given very gentle handling and you cannot run an engram on that case not only you must not run an engram on that case because the bank wil l go solid now you could take alm ost anybody here and run them through an engram once lets take lateonthechai n engram we could run them through the engram once wed get away with it we can run them through twice we can get away with it this is not basic on cha in see we run it three times it starts to get kind of soli d and we run it four times and by golly thats getting awful solid and we run that engram five times and rrahhrrw its get ting tough man and we run it six time s well just freeze him in it it takes three to ten day s for the thing to key out and go soft aga in which it will do now thats true of anyb ody here im talk ing about somethin g late on chain you underst and those engrams have always given us trouble theyve always been sticky and it even say s in book one don t run them you have to brush them off eno ugh sometime s you can always take case thr ough them once you know to get bac k early by the time you ve taken them through two three times you wish you had nt the ban ks going solid well now this case of tremendous unreality goes solid on one pass you practically cant examine the bank its practic ally as much as your lifes worth to even date this cha racter if you cou ld perfectly andaccurately date without any flaw in your auditing yes it would soften up the bank but if your clumsy in dating and you dat this fellow without any great reality anyhow the litt errors you make will throw him off enough to beef up the bank and he gets great er unreality than before there is coord ination between unrealit and solidity which is reversed the greater solidity the more unr eality the person will adverti even though the engram gets very real to him when it gets solid general bank solidification and so forth brings about unreality why is this because the basic mechanism of the time track has the liability of makin g the thetan go solid how does thetan cease to be clear and start going solid how does he beco solid probably by making time track in the first place of course and the more thi s track is jammed and the s he has to do with it of course the less is asised about it well thats just general time tra ck now wha t about implants why do we speciali ze in implants its because an implant is the product of an arc break plus solidification if you wanted to run old arc break straigh twire recall an arc bre ak recall an arc break you woul d find the guy sit ting eventually 3d in an implant this guy sees theta trap thats warning to him tha t hes not wanted around here and it caus an arc break and all these traps and such dev ices and so forth and betrayal s are basically arc breaks now the method thetan uses to handle an arc brea k is to bring about an unreali ty which he usual ly does with notis dont you see and it beco mes the comm on denominator of the bank the n to have an unreal bank because if it gets rea l it hurts too muc h so your effort to persuade him tha t this is real that he is looking at of course does him tremendous disservice because it hurts like the misc hief the only safeguard he has against being caught in sol id bank you see and being upset by solid bank is by sayin g it is not real and not permitting you to find anything real on it now that type of case is going to give you some trouble because you will try to prove to the case the real ity of what youre doing and beca use what you are doing is real you can do that very easily and it just res ults in total overwhel m of the cas you can all too easily prove that what you are doing is real so when somebody starts telling you abou t how unreal it all is if youre running the helatrob us implants you go right on running them man because that will do the most for him that can be done you see the most that can be done for the case is get tho implants run real or unreal but you cant find those implants and he says its terribly unreal and all is unrea l and everything is unreal and you can t find forgotten and nix forgotte n and so forth and you just can t get any place like this brother you watch it one of two things is true you eith er have your paws on somebody who is not native of this univers i mean this galaxy hes native of an adjourning adjoinin g galaxy and you dont know the pat tern of his implants or youve got on your hands somebody who has bee n so implant ed so often that just the thought of five minutes ago give s him headache why does it give him headache because he thinks of five min utes ago and the action of remembering causes solidification of the bank which causes pressure to come in and he got headach so his only protecti on against this is to make you unreal and not is it his last weapon on the bank is to notis and in the absence of his not is he damn near dies you see what do you do with him well this is not i hav ent time to give you all the data on some of the material ive been unearth ing with reg ard to this but ive been developing quite bit of litt odds and ends of tech nology concerning the time track and its automatic nature and its state of manufacture and that sort of thing i just realized just this afterno on that we have straigh twire process that does an awful lot for this case were making him remember and the track is going less solid ill be developing quite few ill tel l you just to not to leave you on thehook there is an involuntary intention ive discovered an involuntary intention you have involunt ary muscles and youve got hab it patterns and training pattern s and all this sor t of nonsens well add to up that in thetan to an involun tary intenti on he wants to open the door and so he just bluh opens the door see see he involun tarily opens the door in other words he just opens the doo r my fathe r used to answer telepho nes this way plunk you know and tel ephone rings plunk you know telephone appears you kno w off the hook and so forth actually youve intende d it up there you got the idea its been intended into new position well thats an involuntary intention and app arently its the same mechanis m that increa creates the time track its an invol untary create you see so thats an involuntary intention and it belo ngs to this set of thetan muscles if youll forgive whic h operate without intention without knowing intention but hav subawar eness intention and thetan can do this he doesnt have to have bank machine ry or anything else he just simply can do it well that forms the time tra ck now solidification of the track is caused by comba t of the pos tulate be solid you see everybody wants you to be solid you don t want to be solid that makes enough fight right there to solidify something well it goes worse than that the solidifi cation mechanism is comp osited by remembering naturally and you as an auditor are actually handling when you handle the time track the inv oluntary intention of the thet an thats what the time track is its an involunt ary intentio n to create it just responds automat ically and you say go here go ther do this do that and he has pictures where do pict ures come from well they com from this involuntary intention youre just handling that mec hanism well you can handle that mechanism directly you can handle the mechanism directly and if you cou ld get case unbailed enough this is actuall the plot you get case unbailed enough and go early enough on the time track and you can actually snip the whole track see it just rolls up like its jus t nowhere now see its the existence of the time track that mak memory impossible but it is the obsessio n to remembe r which makes the time track involun tary intenti on take place in the first place see so any goal like to remember raises hell with solidification or any implant that louses up and they all do thetan s memory or sense of time result in the solidifi cation of the time track by taking over the involuntary create that brings about the time track see that so you say what you say to the pc what instinctive action has been regrett ed i dont care wha t fancy wording just as long as it adds up to that sense in other words what involuntary action have you engaged in which you then choked off and made an enemy out of see what instinct ive action was regretted what instinct ive action have you disl iked you know anything you wan ted to go at it youve got straig htwire process which actually runs implants it runs chem at the rate of snail racing madly alongside of the quarterhorse of doing the hel atrobus implants but you nevertheless there is door open in othe r words the door is not slammed tight in these fellows faces even if they are not nati ve to this uni this particular galaxy and even if thei r sense of reality is so great that all this could happen and ill dev elop few of thos processes and oddly enough i dont think the patterns are innu merable i think possibly maybe five or six differe nt case patterns maybe more than that but if you come up against one of them as an auditor and you decide the only thing you can do is just run engram after engram after engram watch it man because youre going to get solidifi cation of the trac k and youre going to get that pc in trouble so dont go in for this engram after engram after engram you see hit them lightly with feather now if you are lucky enough to be able to get basic like 360 trillion years ago and its an overt and its bas ic on ch oh youre in man you canhandle that because of cour that will erase and so forth but how about this fellow who is very unreal you goin g to get 360 tri llion incident when he cant get brea kfast youre sure not you see in other words its all done with the feather you run into the cas that hasnt got the helatrobua implants you han dle with feather huh dont go charging and barging around open that case up gently and ill try to give you some straightwire processes and things like this that graduall gradually pet the shadow of the cat okay well theres lot of stuff turning up on this that and the oth er thing its all very interesting it mostly comes under the heading of phenome na and data and that sor t of thing and ive recently been understa nd been studyin g the power activities and habits of an oper ating thetan just from an intellectual basis but with some view of reality which i really havent had on this too well before i find we have here fairly complex being and very very formidab one his ethical level and that sort of thing deterior ating was what got him into trouble in the first place so when you put him back together again of course his ethi cal level will hav to be put back togethe r again too otherwise hed just get int trouble and get everybody else in trouble but the point im maki ng here is that the stat of ot is so far above anything we have ever dreamed of that i say our bre akthrough our breakthrough along this lin is tremend ous so trem endous that we had better start getting our hou in order not to prot ect ourselve s from ots that isnt the point but it means that political breakthrough is puh you have any tro uble eating breakfast see we would be shooting mice with an elephant gun dont you see and were not about to atta ck anybody or do anyt hing bad lik that but we might have few hear ttoheart talks so actua lly i have had to be plotting up in front of us bit politically about where did we go and how do we rela to and i find some very interesting data probably some of you have pas t connections of one kind or another when you sud denly say huh i wonde r how i forgot that you probably have to go take care of these things but the basic thing is that this planet is peculiar ly susceptible to be rehabil itation base and so forth at this part of the universe and i think that can be sold to even most of the conf ederations i dont think we have to sell it to much of anybody else i dont think theyll be in position to argue theyve only got atom bombs weve got ots okay thank you very much
