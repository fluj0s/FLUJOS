specialist in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division climate change and the eu emissions trading scheme ets kyoto and beyond summary the european unions eu emissions trading scheme ets is cornerstone of the eus efforts to meet its obligation under the kyoto protocol it covers more than 1000 energy intensive facilities across the 27 eu member countries covered entities emit about 45 of the eus carbon dioxide emissions phase 1 trading period began january 1 2005 second phase 2 trading period began in 2008 covering the period of the kyoto protocol with phase 3 proposed for 2013 several positives resulting from the phase 1 learning by doing exercise assisted the ets in making the phase 2 process run more smoothly including 1 greatly improving emissions data 2 encouraging development of the kyoto protocols projectbased mechanisms clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation ji and 3 influencing corporate behavior to begin pricing in the value of allowances in decisionmaking particularly in the electric utility sector however several issues that arose during the first phase were not resolved as the ets moved into phase 2 including allocation schemes shutdown credits and new entrant reserves and others in addition the expansion of the eu and the implementation of the directives linking the ets to the kyoto protocol projectbased mechanisms created new issues to which phase 2 had to respond more comprehensive response to these issues is envisioned for phase 3 the united states is not party to kyoto however almost four years of carbon emissions trading has given the eu valuable experience in designing and operating greenhouse gas trading system this experience may provide some insight into capandtrade design issues currently being debated in the united states the us requires only electric utilities to monitor co2 the euets experience suggests that expanding similar requirements to all facilities covered under capandtrade scheme would be pivotal for developing allocation systems reduction targets and enforcement provisions in the us debate on comprehensive versus sectorspecific reduction programs the euets experience suggests that adding sectors to trading scheme once established may be slow contentious process as with most eu industries most us industry groups either oppose auctions outright or want them to be supplemental to base free allocation the euets experience suggests congress may want to consider specifying any auction requirement if it wishes to incorporate market economics more fully into compliance decisions euets analysis suggests the most important variables in determining phase 1 allowance price changes were oil and natural gas price changes this apparent linkage raises possible market manipulation issues particularly with the inclusion of financial instruments such as options and futures contracts congress may consider whether the government needs enhanced regulatory and

and the eu emissions trading scheme ets kyoto and beyond overview climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses typically require action at the national level with the 1997 kyoto protocol now in force and setting emissions objectives for 20082012 countries that ratified the protocol are developing appropriate implementation strategies to begin reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases1 in particular the european union eu has decided to use an emissions trading scheme called capandtrade program along with other marketoriented mechanisms permitted under the protocol to help it achieve compliance at least cost2 the decision to use emission trading to implement the kyoto protocol is at least partly based on the successful emissions trading program used by the united states to implement its sulfur dioxide acid rain control program contained in title iv of the 1990 clean act amendments3 the eus emissions trading system ets covers more than 10000 energy intensive facilities across the 27 eu member countries including oil refineries powerplants over 20 megawatts mw in capacity coke ovens and iron and steel plants along with cement glass lime brick ceramics and pulp and paper installations covered entities emit about 45 of the eus carbon dioxide emissions the trading program covers neither co2 emissions from the transportation sector which account for about 25 of the eus total greenhouse gas emissions nor emissions of nonco2 greenhouse gases which account for about 20 of the eus total greenhouse gas emissions phase 1 trading period began january 1 20054 1 six gases are included under the kyoto protocol carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride the united states has not

change the european unions emissions trading system euets by larry parker crs2 second phase 2 trading period began january 1 2008 covering the period of the kyoto protocol with phase 3 planned to begin in 20135 under the kyoto protocol the thenexisting 15 nations of the eu agreed to reduce their aggregate annual average emissions for 20082012 by 8 from the protocols baseline level mostly 1990 levels under collective arrangement called bubble by 2006 collective greenhouse gas emissions in the eu were 27 below kyoto baseline levels 22 below 1990 levels mostly the result of structural shift from coal to natural gas in the united kingdom and the incorporation of east germany into west germany6 in light of the kyoto protocol targets the eu adopted directive establishing the euets that entered into force october 13 20037 the importance of emissions trading was elevated by the accession of 12 additional central and eastern europe countries to eu membership from may 2004 through january 2007 collectively the 27 members of the expanded eus greenhouse gas emissions dropped 77 from 1990 to 2006 the ec believes that the phase 1 learning by doing exercise prepared the community for the difficult task of achieving the reduction requirements of the kyoto protocol several positives resulted from the phase 1 experience that assisted the ets in making the phase 2 process run smoothly at least so far first phase 1 established much of the critical infrastructure necessary for functional emission market including emissions monitoring registries and inventories much of the publicized difficulties the ets experienced in the first phase can be traced to inadequate emission data8 phase 1 significantly improved those data in preparation for phase 2 implementation second the

one10 third according to the ec key result of phase 1 was its effect on corporate behavior an ec survey of stakeholders indicated that many participants are incorporating the value of allowances in making decisions particularly in the electric utility sector where 70 of firms stated they were pricing in the value of allowances into their daily operations and 87 into future marginal pricing decisions all industries stated that it was factor in longterm decisionmaking11 however several issues that arose during the first phase remain contentious as the ets implements phase 2 including allocation including use of auctions and reliance on model projections shutdown credits and new entrant reserves and others in addition the expansion of the eu and the implementation of the linking directives create new issues to which phase 2 has had to respond these new and continuing challenges for phase 2 implementation are discussed below national allocation plans and the ets national allocation plans naps are central to the eus effort to achieve its kyoto obligations each member of the eu must submit nap that lays out its allocation scheme under the ets including individual allocations to each affected unit for the second trading period these naps were assessed by the ec to determine compliance with 12 criteria delineated in an annex to the emissions trading directive12 criteria included requirements that the emissions caps and other measures proposed by the member state were sufficient to put it on the path toward its kyoto target protections against discrimination between companies and sectors delineation of intended use of cdm and ji credits for compliance along with provisions for new entrants clean technology and early reduction credits for the second

2007 need for further emissions reductions it is unclear to what degree the first phase of the ets achieved real emissions reductions emissions are dynamic over time product of countrys population economic activity and greenhouse gas intensity13 to capture these dynamics the member states of the eu develop emissions baselines from models that project future trends in countrys emissions based on these and other factors such as anticipated energy and greenhouse gas policies14 during the first phase the emissions goal was to put the eu on the path to kyoto compliance not actually comply with the protocol which wasnt necessary until the 20082012 time period thus countries developed business as usual baselines based on projected growth in emissions such projected baseline suffers from two sources of uncertainty data uncertainties and forecasting uncertainties on data phase 1 suffered from uncertainties with respect to data collection and coverage in monitoring methods for historic data and data verification on projecting future emissions phase 1 faced uncertainties with respect to economic or sectorbased growth rates fueled in many cases by overoptimistic economic growth assumptions these uncertainties increased the probability of inflated business as usual baselines15 the combination of these factors and modest reduction requirements resulted in the emissions allocations for the 20052007 trading period being higher than actua1 2005 emissions16 this result has raised questions about how much reductions achieved during phase 1 were real as opposed to being merely paper artifacts on the positive side verified emissions in 2005 were 34 below the estimated 2005 13 for more information see crs report rl33970 greenhouse gas emission drivers population economic

baseline used during the allocation process in addition the allowance prices for 2005 stayed persistently high suggesting some abatement was occurring and raising questions of windfall profits as stated by ellerman and buchner first and most importantly the persistently high price for euas eu emissions allowances in market characterized by sufficient liquidity and sophisticated players must be considered as creating presumption of abatement it would be startling if power companies did not incorporate eua prices into dispatch decisions that would have shifted generation to less emitting plants there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that this was the case and the prominent charges of windfall profits assume that the opportunity cost of freely allocated allowances was being passed on without noting the implications for abatement similarly it would be surprising if there were changes in production processes that could be made by the operators of industrial plants17 however eu emissions allowances euas during phase 1 did not maintain value phase 1 euas were basically worthless during the final six months of 2007 this decline in eua prices at least partially reflected the general nontransferability of phase 1 euas to phase 2 only poland and france included limited banking in their phase 1 naps the ec further restricted use of phase 1 euas in phase 2 with ruling in

of phase 1 euas is that prices for phase 2 euas have been relatively firm as indicated by figure 1 above this firmness may reflect the ability of the ec to certify phase 2 naps using more verifiable baseline data than were available for phase 120 scarcity is critical for the proper functioning of an allowance market major reason the ec rejected ex post adjustments21 was fear that such adjustments would have disruptive effect on the marketplace22 phase 1 did not firmly establish this foundation of markets23 based on the phase 2 eua futures market further market development appears to be occurring although several challenges to that development will be discussed later need to adjust ets allocations while the environmental performance of phase 1 may be disputed the need for additional reductions to achieve kyoto is not as indicated by the orange line in figure 2 the european environment agency eea projects that the eu15 existing measures will halt the projected increase in greenhouse gases however as indicated by the red line they are insufficient to reduce eu15 emissions to their kyoto requirements that began in 2008 to achieve this target the eu envisions three

october 2008 p 9 crs10 as indicated by table 1 earlier part of the ec response to the need for additional measures to meet the kyoto requirements was to reduce member states proposed ets allocations in the case of new members these reductions were substantial in some cases only four countries denmark france slovenia and the united kingdom had reductions made in their proposed ets allocations other responses include an ecapproved proposal to impose mandatory co2 emissions standards on lightduty vehicles28 issues arising in phase 2 naps for the ets supplementarity as noted earlier for phase 2 the ec has issued linking directive permitting the use of kyoto mechanisms for compliance including the linking directive has had beneficial effects on the development of ji and cdm markets and more generally on co2 reduction projects in the developing world29 this emerging jicdm supply has the potential to largely compensate for the projected eu15 shortfall in meeting the kyoto protocol requirements30 according to the world bank the estimated aggregate shortfall distance to target for the eu 15 for phase 2 ranges from 9001500 million metric tonnes of co2e co2 equivalent with an average estimate of 1250 million this represents an 810 further reduction from projected levels and is in line with the eu estimated shortfall discussed above31 the world bank cites estimates that 10001200 million metric tonnes of co2e credits from cdm and ji projects are likely to be imported into the euets put in perspective it means that installations using credits from cdm and ji could be in balanced position or marginally short one in the latter case fuel switching would help bridge the gap32 28 see european commission proposal for regulation of the european parliament and of the

washington dc may 2007 pp 1416 3940 32 ibid p 16 crs11 however potential barrier to this scenario is the supplementarity requirements of the kyoto protocol which is embodied in criterion 12 of the ec nap approval process supplementarity requires that developed countries such as most eu countries ensure that their use of jicdm credits is supplemental to their own domestic control efforts in defining supplementarity for phase 2 the ec used 10 of countrys allowance allocation as rule of thumb in approving naps with greater limit possible based on countrys domestic efforts to reduce emissions as indicated in table 2 this process resulted in some significant reductions in some countries proposed limits eg ireland poland spain but some increase in others eg italy latvia lithuania although these reductions appear substantial in individual cases most analysts agree that they do not represent major barrier to the costeffective use of jicdm as stated by the world bank the commission assessed naps for imports of carbon assets including planned and substantiated governmental purchases ostensibly with view to limit imports to more than 50 of the expected distance to target for each member state according to the vast majority of analysts this does not place any practical constraints on the demand for cdmji from eu installations the market received the november 2006 eu decision to impose tighter caps with an immediate increase in the price of euaii while uncertainty at that time about supplementarity caps immediately dampened prices for cers ie cdm credits

second phase national allocation plans comparative analysis at httpwwweconcamacukresearchtseceuets the advantage of eu access to the jicdm market is lower costs under current market conditions guaranteed cdm and ji credits are currently selling at 10 30 discount to euas discount that reflects risks involved in cdmji transactions the degree to which this discount continues depends to some degree on the efforts of participating governments and the cdm and ji executive boards to streamline procedures and regulations firm up methodological assessments and integrate the different markets the chinese government has set credit price floor of 89 euro price setting that reflects its dominant role in the cdm market34 the ability of cdm host countries to raise this floor to reflect more fully the 1525 euro eua price depends on supply in contrast to the world bank point carbon reports that its survey of respondents claimed that cdmji supply will be insufficient to meet eu demand as result price will be set by the marginal cost of eu domestic 34 in 2006 china supplied 70 of cdm credits point carbon carbon 2007 march 13 2007 p 18 crs13 emissions reductions which in turn sets the ceiling on eua prices the availability of jicdm credits will reduce that marginal cost reducing the price of euas but the survey suggests that jicdm prices are likely to rise35 in contrast if the jicdm availability exceeds the need of the eu the price would be set by the marginal cost of jicdm credit supply considerably lower price as reflected by the chinese price floor some observers praise the broadening and increased flexibility that cdm and ji represent in helping annex 1 countries meet their kyoto requirements the world bank argues that the flexibility enshrined in the kyoto flexibility mechanisms and other market mechanisms eg banking is better safety valve for cost concerns than price cap as suggested in some us legislation as stated by the world bank flexibility is key to ensuring that there is builtin safety valve for compliance without resort to market distortion through price caps it would be appropriate to recall here that flexibility is not the goal of climate policy rather it is tool to help achieve the most stringent targets in this regard the use of flexibility mechanisms in phase ii coupled with much stronger reductions in phase iii and the unilateral european target announced for 2020 should be at stringent enough levels that can help stimulate low carbon clean investment future setting an arbitrary price cap distorts the level of innovation required to meet the compliance target and dilutes the ability to meet the environment target footnote omitted36 in contrast some environmental groups are concerned that widespread use of cdm and ji will prevent the investment in domestic efforts that the kyoto protocol envisioned and that will be necessary as emission caps become more stringent and more countries participate37 in addition to concerns about the volume of outside credits that may be used in the ets there are issues over the quality of the credits particularly with respect to additionality the requirement in the kyoto protocol that project credits represent reductions that would not have occurred in the absence of the cdm program in expressing concern about cdm not being additional to current policies wwfuk states it is important to remember that cdm projects do not themselves reduce net global greenhouse gas emissions they merely allow the project investor to pollute more at home ensuring that projects are additional is therefore crucial to maintaining the environmental integrity of the whole system as breach of this means that global emissions actually increase38 such concerns may prevent full exploitation of cdm opportunities for some time 35 ibid p 42 36 the world bank state and trends of the carbon market 2007 washington dc may 2007 p 39 37 for example see world wildlife fund uk emission

entities under the ets during phase 1 the euets directive allowed countries to auction up to 5 of allowance allocations rising to 10 under phase 240 under phase 1 only four of twentyfive countries used auctions at all and only denmark auctioned the full 5 the political difficulty in instituting significant auctioning into ets allowance allocations is the almost universal agreement by covered entities in favor of free allocation of allowances and opposition to auctions41 free allocation of allowances represents onetime transfer of wealth to the entities receiving them from the government issuing them42 the resulting transfer of wealth has been described by several analysts as windfall profits43 as summarized by ellerman and buchner allocation in the eu ets provides one more example that notwithstanding the advice of economists the free allocation of allowances is not to be easily set aside44 despite concerns about windfall profits and economic distortions resulting from the free allocation of allowances there is little change in basic allocation philosophy for phase 2 country proposed auctioning the maximum percentage of allowances allowed 10 most do not include auctions at

that government will not recycle revenues to alleviate compliance costs international competitiveness impacts or other equity concerns resulting in the auction costs being the same as tax46 against these concerns economic analysis provides several arguments in favor of auctions in general and in the case of the eu ets in particular general arguments in favor of auctions include47 purest embodiment of the polluter pays principle reduces distributional distortions that free allocation and accompanying windfall profits can create creates level playing field for existing and new covered entities gives the potential for reducing the impact of compliance on the economy as whole if auction revenues are used to reduce more distorting taxes on investment ie double dividend and can improve emission market liquidity and transparency in the case of the euets the use of free allocations rather than auctions has created some perverse incentives for covered entities and unnecessary complexity to the ets as discussed later in more detail providing allowances free to existing entities can encourage the continued use of inefficient plant and reduce the incentive for investing in efficiency improvements the degree to which this occurs depends on the specific allocation approach taken in contrast an auction can help create price floor particularly if coupled with reserve price that encourages development of new technologies and efficiency improvements in existing plant free allocation scheme generally has to make some provision for new entrants in addition to allocating allowances to existing entities it also raises issues with respect to existing sources that later decide to shutdown this added complexity to the ets is discussed next new entrant reserves unlike previous capandtrade programs the member states of the eu have included provisions for the allocation of allowances to new entrants to the system48 46 martina priebe distributional effect of

allocation theory and the practice in europe the great divide paris september 25 2006 p 4 48 for example the us acid rain program provides allocation of allowances to new continued crs16 the reasoning behind this decision is based on equity 1 it isnt fair to allocate allowances free to existing entities while requiring new entrants to purchase them and 2 the eu doesnt want to put member states at disadvantage in competing for new investments49 these equity concerns trumped concerns about economic efficiency as is the case for existing entities the free allocation of allowances to new entrants is subsidy for the ets the size and distribution of this subsidy is left to the individual member states for phase 1 the reserve varied widely from the average of 3 of total allowances poland set aside only 04 of its allocation for new entrants while malta set aside 26 for phase 2 the spread continues with poland reserving 32 of its allowances for new entrants in contrast to 45 proposed by latvia50 the decision to employ new entrant reserve adds complexity to member states allocation plans and influences the investment decisions of covered entities rules have to be promulgated with respect to the reserves size manner in which the allowances are dispensed and how to proceed if the demand either exceeds the supply or vice versa as indicated countries have not harmonized new entrant reserve rules with respect to size likewise there is standardization on dispensing allowances and replenishing the reserve firstcome firstserve with replenishment is one approach used but variety of procedures have been developed both to dispense allowances and to replenish the reserve if supply is inadequate51 member states also have different formulas for determining how many allowances new entrant should receive member states claim to use form of benchmarking to determine allowance allocations an approach based on standard of best practices or best technology that is applied to the new entrants anticipated production or capacity however the definitions and application of the benchmarks used by the member states are not uniform this diversity in approaches to addressing new entrants results in technology or fuelspecific subsidies which vary by country table 3 presents the results of study of the value of annual allocations for natural gas combinedcycle power plant under different countries phase 2 new entrant allocation rules assuming an allowance value of 10 euro the plants allocation would vary between 0 in sweden free 48 continued entrants instead an epa sanctioned auction is held annually to ensure that allowances are available to new entrants new entrants can also obtain allowances from existing sources willing to sell them either directly through the epa auction or via broker 49 denny ellerman and barbara k buchner the european union emissions trading scheme origins allocations and early results 1 environmental economics and

2 allowance price of 20 euro this annual subsidy is equivalent to the fixed annual costs of the power plant53 subsidies of this magnitude are likely to affect investment decisions as noted by schleich

closure policy the reverse side of the new entrant allocation issue is the what to do with the allocations to existing plants that shut down under us capandtrade programs those allowances are retained by the company based on the assumption that new power plant will be built to replace the closed one for most countries in the ets closure policy is directly linked to the new entrant reserve allowances allocated to existing sources that shut down are fed into the entrant reserve to be allocated to new sources thus free allowances to existing facilities are tied to continued operation of that facility one reason for this approach may be the multiple country aspect of the ets and the political fear that owners of facilities could shut down plants in one country keep the allowance allocation and move to another member state55 52 markus ahman and kristina holmgren new entrant allocation in the nordic energy sectors incentives and options in the eu ets 6 climate policy 2006 p 430

research february 2007 p 23 55 ibid p 19 crs18 unfortunately this closure policy encourages inefficient facilities to continue operating to maintain the subsidy that the free allowance allocation represents as examined by ahman et the withdrawal of allocation based on reduced economic activity or closure makes the loss of the allocation into an additional opportunity cost affecting the production decision in considering the marginal cost of operation the firm will recognize that it receives the allocation if and only if it continues to operate consequently the firm will not maximize its profits only with respect to the cost of production including resource cost and the opportunity cost of allowances in addition it will take into account the value of the allowances that it will lose should it cease to produce output imposing condition that the allocation depends on continued operation of the installation transform the allocation into production subsidy footnote omitted56 one response to the perverse incentives of the closure rule has been pioneered by germany and adopted by few countries under the transfer rule owners of existing facilities being shut down can transfer the allocation from that facility to new replacement facility57 for phase 1 seven countries germany greece hungary luxembourg the netherlands poland and the uk included transfer rules in their nap for phase 2 cyprus flanders part of belgium and malta have joined in including such rules in their naps58 benchmarking third aspect of free allocation is benchmarking as noted earlier for new entrants benchmarking involves allocating allowances based on standard of best practices or best technology that is applied to the new entrants anticipated production or capacity environmental and other groups have advocated the expansion of benchmarking to allocations for existing facilities in addition to new entrants however benchmarking is very difficult given the diversity of processes involved and subject to manipulation in favor of one technology or fuelsource over another for example the netherlands made serous attempt to use benchmarks in its allocation scheme but abandoned the effort after 125 benchmarks were developed59 benchmarks can also be used to encourage investment in one fuelsource over another this issue has arisen in the case of germanys proposed phase 2 nap as 56 markus ahman

for coalfired facility the benchmark is 750 grams co2kwh reflecting conversion efficiency of 45 for natural gasfired facility the benchmark is 365 grams co2kwh reflecting conversion efficiency of 55 these are benchmarks that current technology can achieve without the addition of any carbon capture and sequestration technology or purchase of offsets from other sources in addition the government proposed to provide new entrants with guaranteed allocation of allowances based on actual emissions for 10 years after 4 year allocation based on an 85 capacity factor as result the nap would provide almost incentive to utilities to reduce co2 emissions by fuel shifting and to essentially encourage the use of lignite germanys most abundant and least expensive fossil fuel60 this policy reflects concerns about germany becoming too dependent on imported russian natural gas the price of which tracks oil61 indeed economic analysis suggests that the price of an eua would have to reach 45 euro before lowercarbon emitting natural gasfired facilities become more economic than coal62 as summarized by german utility rwes chief financial officer the name of our oil is lignite we want to develop this energy source using new technology and based on environmentally friendly processes however governments will have to create the right political framework for this to occur63 in reviewing the

november 29 2006 crs20 closure and benchmarking policies allow countries to maintain substantial control over energy policy and related economic investment regardless of the price signals the carbon market might send if the market economics of carbon emission reductions were the sole determinant of future investments this control has been used to preserve existing investment and jobs encourage exploitation of domestic resources eg coal lignite and lower energy prices economists argue that such strategy is based on an economic misconception about how prices are set65 and is inherently contradictory as stated by deutsche bank research the political objective frequently expressed in both the eu and germany of achieving lower energy prices at the same time as implementing climate protection measures should be rejected the objectives of climate protection and lower energy prices for fossil fuels are contradictory higher energy prices are desirable from an ecological point of view although more competition in the electricity and gas sectors could ceteris paribus lead to reduction in prices this will probably be more than outweighed in the medium term by rising commodity prices and higher fiscal burdens in this respect more honesty is needed from all parties66 the ec has put some limitations on countries efforts to influence investment including disallowing any ex post adjustments and allowance guarantees as noted above the ec explicitly disallows any provision of countrys nap that guarantees allowances to covered entities beyond the phase for which the allowances are allocated the ec argues that allocation guarantees give such installations an unfair advantage over other installations that do not get such guarantees67 proponents of allocation guarantees argue it is difficult to plan new investment based on fiveyear allowance allocations68 yet it is precisely the long term effects of new investments and the potential that they will lockin high carbon emitting technologies that worry some including the ec and member governments as stated in the stern review the next 10 to 20 years will be period of transition from world where carbonpricing schemes are in their infancy to one where carbon pricing is 65 as stated by cameron hepburn et in the context of auctions one of the widest economic misconceptions about auctioning is that it would simply add costs which would be passed through to downstream companies and consumers footnoted example omitted yet if firms maximize profits then even with free allocation they pass on the opportunity costs of allowances to downstream prices changing from free allocation to auctioning will have little impact on product prices further explanatory footnote omitted however because

consider how to avoid the risks of locking into highcarbon infrastructure including considering whether any additional measures may be justified to reduce the risks69 avoiding lockingin high carbon energy technology by encouraging deployment of advanced low carbon energy technology under the ets would involve two elements 1 reducing behavioral distortion resulting from the current free allocation system and 2 energy pricing that reflects carbon costs as indicated by the previous discussions the nap 2 submitted to and approved by the ec generally have not reduced the distortions from the free allowance system the primary means of reducing such distortions would be to increase the use of auctions andor by more extensive use of benchmarking based on capacity alone not differentiated by fuel source as indicated above country has submitted nap that requires the full 10 auctioning allowed by the ec for phase 2 although the number of countries auctioning at least some percentage of their allocations has grown from four in phase 1 to nine in phase 2 in addition the ec allows countries to institute or expand auctions at any time without its preapproval uniform benchmarks are also rare with only four countries intending to use them to any significant degree70 with respect to price signal for energy development the phase 1 experience was instructive with respect to the value of accurate emissions inventories and registries but not in terms of developing price floor that would stimulate development of new technology one mechanism to develop such floor banking was not used extensively during phase 1 indeed as noted earlier the lack of phase 1 to phase 2 banking contributed to the collapse in phase 1 prices in 2007 it is likely to be far more important in phase 2 in the context of the ets options to provide price floor beyond banking include expanding use of auctions including incorporating reserve price into auctions financial instruments such as options and futures

allocations would be made to installations that have shut down77 expanding coverage despite the ec interest in expanding the ets its coverage in terms of industries included for phase 2 is essentially the same as for phase 1 the exception is for aviation in december 2006 the ec proposed bringing greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation into the ets in two phases78 as agreed to by the european parliament in july 2008 all intraeu and international flights will be included under the ets beginning in 2012 emissions would be capped at 97 of average 2004 2006 emissions with 85 of the allowances being allocated free to operators the cap would be reduced to 95 in 2013 the cap and auctioning of allowances would be reviewed as part of phase 3 implementation in proposing changes for the third trading period the ec has identified three co2 emitting sectors for inclusion under the ets petrochemicals ammonia and aluminum the ets would also expand beyond co2 to include nitrous oxide n2o emissions from nitric adipic and glyoxalic acid production and perofluorocarbon pfc emissions from the aluminum sector this would expand ets covered emissions by 46 over phase 2 allowance allocations

mw the ec estimates that 4200 installations would opt out accounting for 070 of total ets emissions80 auctions as noted above the eu has made little progress on expanding the use of auctions during phase 2 under phase 3 auctioning would be the basic principle for allocation subject to the need to avoid carbon leakage81 specifically the ec proposes to auction at least twothirds of available allowances beginning in 2013 the introduction of auction would be differentiated by sector in general for the power sector full auctioning would beginning in 2013 for other sectors more gradual phasein would be envisioned with 80 of sectors allocation provided free in 2013 declining linearly to zero by 2020 concern that stringent eu carbon policies may encourage production and related greenhouse gas emissions to shift to countries without carbon policies ie carbon leakage exceptions to this phaseout of free allowances will be made in sectors where carbon leakage may occur the ec proposal also provides for the allocation of revenues from allowance auctions member states will conduct the auctions and receive the revenues in proportion to their 2005 emissions and per capital income the ec states that percentage of the proceeds should be used to fund emission reductions adaptation activities renewable energy carbon capture and storage ccs the global energy efficiency and

states is not party to the kyoto protocol and legislative proposal before the congress would impose as stringent or rapid an emission reduction regime on the united states as kyoto would have however through almost four years of carbon emissions trading the eu has gained valuable experience this experience along with the process of developing phase 3 may provide some insight into current capandtrade design issues in the united states emission inventories and target setting the ets experience with market trading and target setting confirms once again the central importance of credible emissions inventory to functioning capand trade program82 the lack of credible euwide data on emissions was direct cause 80 ibid p 5 81 ibid p 7 82 as stated by crs in 1992 for an economic incentive system to be effective several preconditions are necessary perhaps the most important is data about the emissions being continued crs26 of the ets phase 1 allowance market collapse in 2006 arguably the most important result of phase 1 was the development of credible inventory on which to base future targets and allocations in the united states section 821 of the 1990 clean air act amendments requires electric generating facilities affected by the acid rain provisions of title iv to monitor carbon dioxide in accordance with epa regulations83 this provision was enacted for the stated purpose of establishing national carbon dioxide monitoring system84 as promulgated by epa regulations permit owners and operators of affected facilities to monitor their carbon dioxide emissions through either continuous emission monitoring cem or fuel analysis85 the cem regulations for carbon dioxide are similar to those for the acid rain programs sulfur dioxide cem regulations those choosing fuel analysis must calculate mass emissions on daily quarterly and annual basis based on amounts and types of fuel used as suggested by the euets experience expanding equivalent data requirements to all facilities covered under capandtrade program would be the foundation for developing the allocation systems reduction targets and enforcement provisions coverage despite economic analysis to the contrary the eu decided to restrict ets coverage to six sectors that represent about 45 of the eus co2 emissions86 this restriction was estimated to raise the cost of complying with kyoto from 6 billion euro annually to 69 billion euro 1999 euro compared with comprehensive trading program variety of practical political and scientific reasons were given by the ec for the decision87 the experience of the ets up to now suggests that adding new sectors to an existing trading program is difficult process as noted above stated goal of the ec is to expand the coverage of the ets however the experience of phase 1 did not result in the addition of any new sector until the last year of phase 2 when aviation will be included the eu is attempting to expand its coverage with phase 3 but the ets will still cover fewer sectors emitting greenhouse gases than provided under most us proposals 82 continued controlled such data are important to levy any tax allocate any

rl33581 climate change the european unions emissions trading system euets by larry parker 87 ibid p 3 crs27 us capandtrade proposals generally fall into one of two categories88 most bills are more comprehensive than the ets covering 80 to 100 of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions at minimum they include the electric utility transportation and industrial sectors disagreement among the bills center on the agricultural sector and smaller commercial and residential sources in some cases discretion is provided epa to exempt sources if serious data economic or other considerations dictate such resolution second category of bills focuses on the electric utility industry representing about 33 of us greenhouse gases and therefore less comprehensive than the ets sometimes including additional controls on nongreenhouse gas pollutants such as mercury these bills focus on the sources with the most experience with emission trading and the best emissions data other sources could be added as circumstances dictate as noted the eus experience with the ets suggests that adding sectors to an emission trading scheme can be slow and contentious process if one believes that the electric utility sector is costeffective place to start addressing greenhouse gas emissions and that there is sufficient time to do the necessary groundwork to eventually add other sectors then phasedin approach may be reasonable if one believes that the economy as whole needs to begin adjusting to carbon constrained environment to meet long term goals then more comprehensive approach may be justified the ets experience suggests the process doesnt necessarily get any easier if you wait allocation schemes setting up tradeable allowance system is lot like setting up new currency89 allocating allowances is essentially allocating money with the marketplace determining the exchange rate as noted above the free allocation scheme used in the ets has resulted in windfall profits being received by allowance recipients as stated quite forcefully by deutsche bank research the most striking market outcome of emissions trading to date has been the power industrys windfall profits which have sparked controversy we are all familiar with the background emissions allowances were handed out free of charge to those plant operators participating in the emissions trading scheme nevertheless in particular the producers of electricity succeeded in marking up the market price of electricity to include the opportunitycost value of the allowances this is correct from an accounting point of view since the 88 for an overview of capandtrade proposals under the 110th congress see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobucci for an overview of multipollutant control bills see crs report rl34018 air quality multipollutant legislation in the 110th congress by larry parker and john blodgett 89 unlike carbon tax which uses the existing currency system to control emissions be it euro or dollars crs28 allowances do have value and could otherwise be sold moreover emissions trading cannot work without price signals90 the free allocation of allowances in the ets incorporates two other mechanisms that create perverse incentives and significant distortions in the emissions markets new entrant reserves and closure policy combined with an uncoordinated and spotty benchmarking approach for both new and existing sources the result is greenhouse gas reduction scheme that is influenced as much or more by national policy than by the emissions marketplace the proposed expansion of auctions for phase 3 of the ets could simplify allocations and permit market forces to influence compliance strategies more fully most countries did not employ auctions at all during phase 1 and auctions continue to be limited under phase 2 country combined an auction with reserve price to encourage development of new technology the ec limited the amount of auctioned allowances to 10 in phase 2 limit country chose to meet efforts to expand auctions met opposition from industry groups but attracted support from environmental groups and economists the ec proposed increase of auctioning to twothirds of total allowances for phase 3 would represent major development for the scheme currently all us capandtrade proposals have some provisions for auctions although the amount involved is sometimes left to epa discretion most specify schedule that provides increasing use of auctions from 2012 through the mid2030s with final target of 66100 of total allowances auctioned funds would be used for variety of purposes including programs to encourage new technologies couple of proposals include reserve price on some auctions to create price floor for new technology like the situation in the ets most us industry groups either oppose auctions outright or want them to be supplemental to base free allocation given the experience with the ets where the ec and individual governments have been unwilling or unable to move away from free allocation the congress like the ec may ultimately be asked to consider specifying any auction requirement if it wishes to incorporate market economics more fully into compliance decisions flexibility and price volatility despite eu rhetoric during the kyoto protocol negotiations it moved into phase 2 without significant restriction on the use of cdm and ji credits this embracing of project credits will significantly increase the flexibility facilities have in meeting their reduction targets in addition phase 2 includes the use of banking to increase flexibility across time by allowing banked allowances to be used in phase 3 each of these market mechanisms is projected to reduce both the eus kyoto compliance costs and allowance price volatility as further defense against price volatility the 90 deutsche bank research eu emission

price changes unfortunately phase 1 experience with the ets does not provide much useful information on the value of market mechanisms or financial instruments in reducing costs or price volatility the combination of poor emissions inventories nonuse of project credits and timelimited allowances with effectively banking resulted in extreme price volatility in spring 2006 and virtually worthless allowances by mid 2007 the real test for the mechanisms employed by the ets to create stable allowance market is phase 2 initial indications are that mature market for allowances appears to be developing like the ets us capandtrade proposals would employ combination of devices to create stable allowance market and encourage flexible costeffective compliance strategies by participating entities all include banking all include use of offsets although some would place substantial restrictions on their use one proposal incorporates safety valve that would effectively place ceiling on allowance prices other proposals would create carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary some see this as more flexible response with the potential for avoiding or mitigating the environmental impacts of safety valve ie increased emissions additionally concern has been expressed in the united states about the regulation of allowance markets and instruments based on experience with the ets the potential for speculation and manipulation could extend beyond the emission markets analysis of ets allowance prices during phase 1 suggests the most important variables in determining allowance price changes were oil and natural gas price changes91 this apparent linkage between allowance price changes and price changes in two commodities markets raises the possibility of market manipulation particularly with the inclusion of financial instruments such as options and futures contracts congress may ultimately be asked to consider whether the securities and exchange commission federal energy regulatory commission the commodities futures trading commission or other body should have enhanced regulatory and oversight authority over such instruments92 91 maria mansanetbataller angel pardo and enric valor co2 prices energy and weather 28 the energy journal 3 2007 pp 7392 92 for discussion of regulation of allowances
