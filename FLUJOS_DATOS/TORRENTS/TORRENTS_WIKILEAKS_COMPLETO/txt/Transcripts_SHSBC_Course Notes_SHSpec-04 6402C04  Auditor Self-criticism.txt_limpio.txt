6402c04 shspec4 auditor selfcriticism enough of this goofing off as auditors and students the subject of selfcriticism of auditing is very misunderstood because it is too simple lrh has been researching r6 see p 568 above during january on the theory that it is better for him to get the body knocked off than for the rest of you to get it r6 is incredibly complex but totally necessary you need very smooth basic auditing in order to make r6 work selfcriticism simply means taping your session listening to it and spotting what needs improvement one gets amazing responses to the question what happened in the session selfcriticism of auditing is vital from level iii on up the deeper you go into case the more reach the processes have the more nearly perfect your basic auditing must be flubs impinge to the same degree that the auditing does at levels 0 and i the auditor isnt impinging very much hence his flubs dont impinge much either at level ii with repetitive processing there is more impingement and less tolerance of flubs at level iii you are using the meter to reach deeper than the pcs unaided itsa here we have moved into an area where we can get hold of things that the pc wasnt ready to give there is more impingement so the auditing must be better since the flubs impinge more too the greater the charge you are dealing with the greater the bypassed charge can be the meter mines subitsa it increases the impingement of processing there is one thing that always happens when you run somebody above his level and get him into areas that he finds hard to confront you will get more bpc and arc breaky sessions the level of impingement of an error is greater than pc can tolerate when the pc is audited above his level so up to level iv the best handling of an arc breaky pc is to reduce his level this certainly doesnt apply at levels v and vi where the bpc comes from wrong goal wrong item or whatever at these upper levels reducing the pcs level will just leave the wrongness and the pc will go into sad effect if you give person wrong goal he will dramatize it more than the right goal this happens consistently in psychoanalysis the only thing you get off psychoanalyzed pc is psychoanalytic computations bunch of bunk invented items wrong goal doesnt asis it beefs up find the persons right goal and he will dramatize is less which makes somewhat goofy test for rightness of goal person tends to dramatize validated error more than genuine aberration someone who has had errors validated also tends to be very careful all the time this comes from some old advice he got you can find the error by finding out what the person is being careful of if you scan someone through his psychoanalysis you will turn on all his old symptoms if you keep it up they will turn off by erasure analysis cured its patients by inventing new evils the id etc it is an alteris negative itsa the analysand examines things that never existed an auditor can wrongly date somatic then later auditor can date that somatic getting the same wrong date and he can in fact get some improvement of the somatic by getting off some of the charge of the somatics being wrongly dated but he may be deceived into thinking that he has the right date person dramatizes validated error more than an actual aberration that has been contacted if you find that the pc is selling something to you do case analysis 1 find out where he got the idea where he is sitting 2 get his considerations off 3 find out where it really is or whether it is really true the reason why one attacks process errors in upper level processes instead of since midruds is that everything that happened between sessions is sitting on top of the r6 error and it is much quicker to find and correct the error than to do the midruds see fig 25 figure 25 r6 process errors and since midruds graphics inserted at level iv you are dealing with service facs assessments etc the pc has to be able to spot and asis his own wrongnesses and overts by that time by level v auditor errors impinge and any piece of bpc left lying around will get restimulated at level vi the amount of charge you are handling ri by ri is huge and ferocious now that the precisely correct commands have been formulated you have gotten away from some arc breaks but if the auditor fails to clear the command it can act as giving the pc wrong goal or item or if the auditor fails to understand what the pc said you can get immense arc breaks for instance the pc said the second ri from the bottom the auditor thought it was the seventh ri that the pc was talking about he asks about the seventh ri to repair it the pc has huge arc break new demands are placed on ones basic auditing as one moves up to higher levels so as he moves up the levels this can make the auditor feel as though he is auditing terribly the division into levels is primarily based on what is demanded of the pc and secondarily on what is demanded of the auditor but the two are almost parallel it is not possible to selfaudit r6 r6 requires the impingement of an auditor calling the items to get the charge off there is point where person becomes total cause over his own mind up to that point an auditor is necessary if you have an arc breaky session you can straighten it out by running ow on the auditor to yourself you are in perfect order to use assisttype processes on your own mind but solo auditing doesnt produce ta action because of the twoterminal nature of the universe in this universe one terminal all by itself is inert thetan has become so enmeshed in this universe that he has taken the physical universe laws to apply to himself there are two things that chain thetan down 1 mass including space energy and time 2 significance since 1950 we have known that someone could either dramatize nuttiness physically or in thought the mass gives you somatics and the significance makes you think that you are nuts gpm contains both thought and mass when you get the right mass and significance aligned with other masses and significances it vanishes amazingly enough as the thetan stops creating it it doesnt dissipate into energy although you do get heat it vanishes as nocreate without fireworks if you keep changing only thought and not mass you cannot make change in someones condition you cant handle the mass which is causing eg an illness the levels are approaching the gpm by cleaning up charge on all the locks and ramifications that are hung up on gpms the levels are familiarization with what could blow your head off at the very least the levels familiarize the pc with heavy somatics the auditing cycle is the basic discovery of dianetics and scientology all the way from level 0 to level vi you are using the same auditing cycle this is twopole universe and without an auditor or if you dont use the auditing cycle properly you dont get ta action adequate to case resolution in comm courses the comm cycle does things to people all by itself it is so powerful that by itself it produces results the auditor should recognize it as his main tool it has to be as polished as you have charge that can be bypassed on the case it has to be better and better as the auditor audits higher and higher levels the auditors auditing must be adequate to the level he is running his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing which is creating tone arm action only somewhere in level vii does the auditing cycle cease to be necessary if you havent got an auditor you dont have ta action if you havent got enough charge off your case you wont be able to do anything with it if an auditor is aware that his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing that gets charge off the pcs case because the auditing comm cycle is what makes him an auditor then he also knows that his auditing comm cycle must be adequate for the level he is auditing auditor selfcriticism allows him to see whether it is adequate you have tendency to overcomplicate the auditing comm cycle for the level you are running tr2 is the most important if not the only important tr for raw pc since if you can let someone know that you have heard him that you have really received his comm you could get big result the other trs have to come in as the pc progresses up the levels here is the auditor selfcriticism procedure 1 do normal session 2 record it you should have 1 12 hours of tape with the voices well discernable this is because the auditors error is always earlier than rough spot in the session so you want to be able to listen to good stretch of time 3 as the session goes forward the auditor notes bis in session very carefully meter misbehavior any criticism by the pc dirty needles any worry etc 4 after the session the auditor notices in the session record when in the session the bis dn etc appeared 5 listen to that area 6 go backwards bit by bit few inches at time to find the breakdown of basic auditing that caused the bi or dn this should be few minutes or seconds earlier 7 find what the auditor failed to communicate or carry out 8 do that with every rough spot every noted bi if you follow this procedure you will find the errors and see that you didnt get away with the breakdowns in your auditing cycle although at the time you may have thought that you did you will find that if the pc snaps or snarls there is rough auditing comm cycle just before that pc never has reaction in the session independent of the auditor anything that happens in session good or bad happens with the auditor as cause the auditor is the source of the session 100 lrh found that as he moved up in levels of auditing his auditing had to improve so other auditors can improve too knowing what is wrong one can put it right both with ones auditing cycle and with the pc at the time before the arc break hits youre as good an auditor as you can handle the communication cycle and you are as skilled an auditor as you can choose the right process to put onto the auditing comm cycle
