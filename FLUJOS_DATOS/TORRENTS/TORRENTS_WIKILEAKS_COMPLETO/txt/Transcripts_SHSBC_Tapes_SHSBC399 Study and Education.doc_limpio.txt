study and education lecture given on 13 august 1964 whats the date audience 13th of august ad 14 thirteen aug ad 14 saint hill special briefing course weve got another lecture here on study and education you probably have realized going down the line that weve got this pretty well wrapped up but we didnt expect some of the bonuses that we got this was actually quite an astonishing and adventurous thing to do as ive already mentioned and so forth is all of sudden pick up an analogous field of practice and study in order to study that in order to find something about study so that youre not interiorized on your own subject dont you see so get an exterior view and study this as lowly neophyte that is tyroing his way up the line both of those mean beginners and then carry this subject of study out through not on dilettante but on professional hammer and tongs basis you see theres great deal of difference between these two types of study and what remains undone of that now of course is the professional practice of what one has learned and that will have to be added into it to help you out in that particular field and sphere that doesnt seem to be too much but here isthe whole subject of education has as its end product the accomplishment of certain doingnesses the accomplishment of certain ends or aims and education which doesnt lead toward this of course is just sort of doodledaddle monkey business you know sort of stuff its pure dilettantism by which could be best defined as one doesnt intend to do anything about it except annoy his friends the difference in these two fields of the doodledaddle type of monkey business sort of and so oni really wouldnt call it education i wouldnt dignify it with that particular field i would say its acquaintanceits acquaintancy its getting nodding acquaintance with some data or field to find out what is in it in other words its just becoming acquainted with it slightly and doing light skim around its edges and that would not in my estimation be education education would be in the direction of accomplishing certain actions professionally now that is my own word introduced into there professionally but if one is educated in subject one expects him to be able to accomplish certain things with that subject i dont care if this is merely theoretical line of education one is still expected to come out the other end being good theoretician so educationeducation i would define as something that is for blood and i would say that many things pass under the heading of education which arent im not talking ifthis is good english dictionary definition you see education means learning or knowing or accomplishing the knowingness of certain subject you see well lets take that as flatout definition if one is educated in subject then he knows that subject you see see you know exclamation point he knows the subject hes able to accomplish the actions which are taught in that subject hes able to accomplish the results which are taught in that subject dont you see thats education now to call the modern school system education then is quite laughable because this poor little kid gets in there and theythey keep the kids time occupied lets go down to that well now that doesnt seem to to have to have anything to do with education whatsoever to keep the childs time occupied and yet survey of this field demonstrates that the best reason for formal education of youth and so on is to give their mothers break thats the fact thats the way they look in that direction well what is this kid being taught to do and right away then you see what your quarrel with young schooling is hes not being taught to do anything see voil√† so it isnt education you see if you just took the word in its pure definition with an exclamation point you know educated well this has come to mean sort of an esoteric flyaround that hewell what so you say this fellow was educated you say he was educated at oxford well what is it all right good he was educated at oxford fine hes an oxford man good we expect certain stamps and social reactions and so forth all right if he was educated to be gentlemangood so hes pro gentleman see fine fine but you cant really disassociate education from an active doingness and role and professionalism you see its not possible to disassociate this to take this over so we say well we wanted to give him good education not so that he could do anything but well that is immediately contradiction thats saying we must pick up all the white peas by leaving all the white peas on the ground you cant do that you see you cant just educate somebody without any end in view itbecause then he wouldnt be educated dont you see and that is the modern quarrel we have the largest budget next to armaments in the world is child education thats big budget and i dont care if the teachers all say theyre underpaid and everythingwhich they are it is nevertheless fabulous piece of money which is spent in this particular direction when you look at it all the way up the line and when you include under that heading of expense all the training all the educational actions that are done in this world you see that theres terrific investment now practically everyone in the western world has had considerable sum invested in them to become educated thats considerable sum it runs into the thousands of pounds whichever way you want to look at it it runs into the many many thousands of dollars by the time young man has gotten through college for instance he stands educationally at something on the order of the tenthousand dollar mark or did ten years ago thats an old figure and he probably stands at higher figure today thats lot of money to invest in manfor maybe result all right so lot has been spent upon his education but has he become educated male voice yeah and thats the quarrel see there wasa lot is spent on his education but he didnt get educated i was rather shocked to find the other day that my younguns couldnt write their name theyre being educated quote unquote at remarkable rate of speed but they couldnt sign their name i wouldnt say that then they were being taught to write they were not edbeing educated in how to write matter what they were doing matter how many traveling ovals they were making if it didnt wind up with the end product of being able to sign their nameswell i should think that would be one of the first things that some teacher would think about theyd say well you know kid should be able to sign his name because frankly that is almost the basic test of literacy the fellow that stumps aboard ship and has to make an k on the articles is instantly and immediately considered to be illiterate well maybe he could write in flowing copperplate hand everything else but if he couldnt sign his name hed have hard time convincing people he wasnt illiterate so it would seem to to be first things first and when i found this out i caused quite storm by insisting that they learn how to sign their names theyeven the children got quite upset it hadnt occurred to them that if they knew how to write they should be able to sign their names they couldnt do it so theres lot of holes left along the line now you take arithmetic well this is sort of taught as handy handy thing that isyou need so that you wont get shortchanged i think thats just about the wildest short look at any subject i ever had anything to do with and yet im sure that that is the basic reason why it is taught because ive had children explain to patiently this one point so this has been taught to them as the reason they were learning arithmetic is so they wouldnt be shortchanged nobody ever tells them that theres another way not to have to worry about that is also make enough money well look at it if youif you made enough money you wouldnt have to know arithmetic because it wouldnt worry you if you were shortchanged see there are other ways to get around this i meanso therefore there is some other route on this business of being shortchanged although i offer that one as simply ridiculous one its nevertheless quite factual one midas never worried about being shortchanged so what have we got here in terms of arithmetical education well i defy the bulk of the teachers who are teaching arithmetic to give you much of an end product for knowing arithmetic theyd say well uhuhuhunwell of course he has to have it because its fundamental in so many other subjects well all right now were talking about teaching other subjects well were not interested in other subjects we are talking about arithmetic how about this thing called arithmetic well we wonder why people dont know arithmetic well he cant be educated in it because it has end product the fellow says i dont want to be an accountant i dont want to be bookkeeper i can learn to count on my fingers so i dont get shortchanged elementary why learn arithmetic well you say well you have to have it to learn other lets talk about education and arithmetic lets not go worrying about other subjects yeah well if you put restriction like that on the argument they would say of course nobody can argue with you and you say thats the point who wants to be argued with the point im making here is that arithmetic having finite end in itselfof course it hasit has finite ends and it could be describedbut having described finite end in itself is therefore almost impossible to teach and you have nearly everybody doing very badly in their grammar schools on arithmetic because it itself is not subject so therefore one can become educated its become more and morethis is very manifest in the universityim not talking over your heads here this is something thats very very bang its very obvious you get into university youre all the time having problems being shoved under your nose in engineering schools that youre supposed to do by algebra youre always having problems shoved under your nose that youre supposed to do with calculus any one of which is solvable by sight arithmetic thats something to think about now what has happened here well arithmetic not being subject in itself and being somewhat degraced and degraded subject has gradually shrunk and is ceasing to be subject but is simply an auxiliary subject which moves up into higher mathematics and if you dont know arithmetic you cant do higher mathematics thats the way its represented more or less to the engineer well i was quite interested in old mcguffeys readers at one time to find out how adept at arithmetic somebody was expected to be in 1888 the problems which they were expected to solve in arithmetic were the problems of algebra and they were expected to solve these with arithmetic and what do you know it was great revelation to that it was very possible to solve these algebraic problems with their xs and ys and all that sort of thing by common ordinary gardenvariety arithmetic and it made lot better sensemade lot better sense i looked at this and ive run into some oldtimers who could take column of figures about five figures wide and about ten figures tall and add them up in peculiar way which was very peculiar to of some kind of crisscross addition that i would be quite at loss to explain to you how it was done but arrive with almost an immediate answer and you say how did they do that well they say its very simple you see nine added to something gives you itself so all you do is go down the column and find all the combinations which make nine and forget those and you add the remainder and you get the total what do you know you know well of course thats just tricky stuff but all this at one time was part and parcel to arithmetic and its not here anymore in arithmetic where did it go well you must have dying subject why is it dying nobody is delineating its purpose to the student of it matter if someno matter if some purpose does exist in it thats beside the point yes you could figure out lots of purposes of it but all you have to know is is nobody is delineating marking out showing the purpose of that subject to the student so one doesnt consider that he becomes educated in arithmetic arithmetic is just some auxiliary subject that keeps you from being shortchanged so that as the purpose of subject deteriorates in its advertisement or renditionas the purpose of subject deterioratesthe subject itself also falls away sounds like verya very strange sort of thing to give you but as the purpose of subject falls away why so does the subject disappear from the ken of man manufacture of buggy whips go around and try to find somebody today who knows all about the manufacture of buggy whips theres probably couple of boys sitting around in england who know the subject backwards and forwards and who make all the circus whips see there are practically more whips made dying because it has purpose nobodys got any horses to flip buggy whips over see so becoming educated in how to manufacture whips today would sort of be an enda dead end it would not be very productive career now that doesnt sound very amplified but lets take it in reverse and at once it will make great deal of sense then subject for which the purpose is not delineated will die away not only in the society but in the individual both of those twothose statements are true the first one is so true that its almost nonsense but the other one is not nonsense and its not been detected if the individual to whom you are teaching this subject has not got the purpose of this subject then that subject will die away in that individual it might have tremendous purpose but if the purpose of the subject is not being taught to the individual hes had it do you see so you can get the difference between live study and dead study live study is one which has purpose has use and dead study is one that hasnt any use and the way you make live study into dead study is dual its use dies away as in buggy whips or one simply omits it as part of the educational process and it will make the subject die away not only in the individual but the society not only in the society but the individual do you see that and we have to assume that person cannot become educated just by the definition of the word education as i have been stressing it here in dead subject because it has end product so you find these things become obsessive somebody starts to study miniatures painted in holland by blind painters well now miniatures painted in holland weve got some use for that but miniatures painted in holland by blind painters well we would sort of look around for quite while before we found any use for this particular subject oh you could find uses for it but dont get yourself all cluttered up onon introducing your ingenuity to supply the lack in an educational system thatbecause by being reasonable you cripple yourself its question of what is there not question of what could we dream up to put there oh we could dream up some subjects but lets just say this boy is studying this esoteric studystrange weird useless nowhere do you know that he can easily become obsessed with it he has purpose for it use for it and so of course its impossible for him to become educated in it because he can never display his virtuosity he can never display its use who would listen he cant even tell his friends theyd say this guy is ruddy crank he goes around talking all the time somewhat like your families and so forth have occasionally regarded you on the subject of scientology youre over their heads you see but much worse than thatmuch worse than that we would get it on this sort of basis see nobody knows what he is talking about and nobody knows why he is studying it and it isnt of any use and its not of much interest anyway well this poor bloke can never communicate it he can never communicate it for the best reason that communication becomes difficult nobody will listen did you ever think about communication being difficult because nobody listens well just run this into the field of education if the subject doesnt exist and has use and has application and has this and has that well to that degree their listening ceases because it isnt of any use to them either hes studying miniatures painted by blind painters in holland people sort of say well i could understand his studying miniatures painted in holland i think hes nuts that would be the immediate conclusion dont you see well your families look at you sometimes where you have run into this and collided with this headon and people wouldnt listen to you on the subject of scientology or were impatient with you for studying it and that was because you werent talking to them about the purpose of scientology and you didnt talk to them about the purpose of scientology within the framework of what it could do for them personally now you are coming right on close to home your mother might have been interested if she heard what it had done for you personally because shes interested in you but even your mother would conceive it to be subject only when purpose was delineated now well go bita little bit further when the purpose that was delineated could be executed to any degree you know the purpose youve given it could be executed to any degree now your next stage is is they dont believe it see you could give them the purpose but they dont believe it in other words the purpose isnt real to them so you not only have delineated the purpose but you have delineated it to them in such way that it isseems to be an attainable purpose an attainable or doable purpose so we walk up to this bird and we saywe say to this bird youryour interest in this subject should be very great because this subject will make you clear he immediately says what wall because its not an understandable purpose see the purpose ceases to be understandable when the goal does not seem to him to be attainable or valuable and it can cease to be attainable or valuable merely because it isnt understood so for an educational subject to exist and continue to be subject in which one can become educated or if you ever expect anybody to ever be educated in the subjectlet put it that wayfor it to continue to exist for it to survive it has to have purpose which can be seen to be an attainable action it has to be attainable the purpose must be attainable now the value of subjectthe value of subject depends simply and utterly upon the value of attaining that stated purpose how valuable is it to attain that particular stated purpose is it valuable to be able to accomplish this or is it not valuable to be able to accomplish this and to that degree subject appears to be fringe subject or vital subject so the woof and warp of the culture is made up of educations which are subdivisiblethats the woof and warp of culture woof and warp rug term try not to put too many words on the line here the woof goes that way and the warp goes that way see itsthe makeup of culture is subdivisible into two general types of education culture is held together solely and only by education whether that education is accomplished by experience or by teaching culture as whole is the summation of its education and those are two divisions to the educations of culture and one of those are the vital ones and the other one is the nice ones now an education achieved is remunerated to the degree that its service is understood to be valuable an education is remunerated to the degree that its service is understood to be valuable and it frankly is not remunerated one penny more sometimes they falsely remunerate but not often and that tells you that there must be some mighty funny funny things because there are some things in the societybecause this rule ive just given you is true and the society at large then must be misunderstood to some degree because theres several educations in the subject at large which are remunerated to an enormous extent which are not held by certain educational authorities to be valuable public must like to be fooled theyre always paying men of some kind or another there must be some real value in having hope shot up to the moon in the stock market because those birds are very often paid off heavily you could reevaluate the society on the basis of what ive given you yes you could say well the society makes mistakes in this direction yes the society is lied to well i dont think the society makes mistakes in this direction thats new thought isnt it do you know that the most valuable profsingle technical profession in the united states is burying people hm very highly paid theyve managed to convince everybody that the loved one should be in sealed bronze caskets and in concrete and steel vaults outside the caskets so that seepage wont trouble your loved ones and they had the whole country absolutely convinced that this was congressional law that it was local law and recent congressional investigation disclosed this fact and they found out that there isnt any statutes in the united states that compels anybody in the united states to be buried even in board coffin there are statutes that require them to be buried but there is not even statute that requires them to be embalmed so you roll aunt agnes up in blanket and dump her in hole as long as youve got death certificate man thats all you need so this particular professionthis particular profession was selling what they were sort of selling some weird life after death werent they they were akin to some religious cult or something like that and it was obvious that people did buy life after death and we find out that one of the most expensive things you could do in egypt was to die that was very expensive thing and thats gotten that way in the united states today its very costly to die by the time they get through with you man well youve got estate left but this is very peculiar the society remunerates this and rewards it well its just about the most educated art you ever had anything to do with in your life undertaking is supereducated art and the society of undertakers themselvesmorticians they like to refer to themselvesthese birds run their own schools and their own technology and that sort of thing and they really hammerpound it in and the final end product is very visible but these guys are quite sharpies i know because back in the days when i was having ball around new york as writer why the medical examinerthats what theyve begun to call the coroner around new york nowthey changed their names toothe medical examiner of new york was particular pal of mine he was the coroner of the city of new york and one of the nicest blokes you ever had anything to do with hed embalmed personally with his own paws 15000 corpses i got interested in this particular field by being sent in his direction to do series of stories about undetectable crime and of course i wound up in the lap of the medical examiner of the city of new york and he started my crime education on the subject and of course this was in the field of what they call forensic or legal medicine and this boy he had it all at his finger tips and so forth but the casualness with which he could roll off all of these various things showed great familiarity with the subject this was not an esoteric subject this had to do with lots of dead bodies which had been strewn all over the place in various states of dishabille various states of knockedabout they were untidy at times this was quite boy and oddly enough he conceived that he was not acceptable socially and i was very acceptable socially so he and i formed very good partnership because he always liked toif i was going anyplace and asked him if hed like to come along and so forth he was there on rocket plane you see right away quick but there wasnt anythingthere wasnt anything that was wrong with this bird he had perfect manners he was perfect gentleman and so forth but part of his education was that his subject was looked down on and therefore he felt he was socially unacceptable and so forth well i dont know lot of peoplelot of people look down onstreet sweepers think theyre looked down on and so forth but street sweepers keep the streets swept clean dont they hm well this guy obviously was keeping the streets of new york from being littered with decomposing corpses and oh i used to see him every once in while when i was president of one of the writing societies there and so forth why he used to come over there quite regularly and hed give detective writers talks if id ask him to and so forth and they would go away from the luncheon or something like that the weirdest shades of green but man here washere was data here was data and it had very definite end product if only in the field of detection guy like that could take one look at corpse and hed say carbon monoxide been dead about three hours cyanide arsenic this that the other thing brrrrrr boom oh id say that was botulinus poisoning joe yeah yeah well put him on the slab and well run awell run test on it do an autopsy well im pretty sure thats just botulinus you know someeating green beans in the wrong time of the year that had been in the icebox too long thatslooks like thats what that is to almost always just dead on the button you see this was art the art of observation the world of death but even in the days of egypt this art was not accorded any social status the boys who embalmed the bodies down in the deadhouse and so forth were actually never even permitted to leave the deadhouse they were held in but heres this terrific terrific amount of art terrific amount of detail terrific amount of technicality terrific amount of stuff and its come right straight down through these cultures from the days of ancient egypt and it is totally uninterrupted its interesting that such bird as this could sit down and discuss the relative preservation qualities of modern embalming and egyptian embalming and he was certain he was doing better these days than the egyptians were its the first time id ever heard that because weve seen these egyptian mummies in univerin university museums and that sort of thing and weve seen these things around and theyre still there all wrapped up and so forth but his attitude toward it was the attitude of true professional well their features hadnt been preserved and their coloring was bad thats what he said to one day so forth yeah the next time youre down in the museum ron he said if you dont believe it if you dont believe that were way ahead of them these days you just take look at one of those mummies features havent been preserved and coloring is bad and i said but man those guysthose guys have been dead for thousands of years and he said well in few thousand years one of mine will have been too and he said his features wont be bad and his coloring will be good he said we can do better job thanalmostwe used to do well now heres steadyim talking to you about relatively debased profession but highly remunerated one and keeping the bodies off the streets and prettying up the loved ones and so forth is very highly paid preservation of memory and so forth is very highly paid profession and it has been continuousit has been continuous for very long time without its knowhow dying away wherever theres been civilization they seem to have known the data of the last civilization on this matter how many wars have swept across the top of it and they deal it off the cuff and so forth why even the ancient tribal rites they would go find dry cave that would automatically embalm the corpses of their loved ones so heres thisheres this very interesting technical line thats technical line man what you have to do in order to keep corpse from going bad and what you have to do to and know about what killed this person and what he died of so that you wont get all mixed up in your embalming activities and what you have to do in order to straighten all this out or so forth and how youre supposed to bury them and exactly how youre supposed to handle the grieving family and exactly how you were supposed to sell them the most for thefor the most you know these are technologies matter which way you look at it they are very broad and they are very precexact and boy do they wind up with finite result you know youve got the body you embalm it you bury it you collect your money thud very easily understood so that we would say that the subject isa subject is not only remunerated to the degree of its need but also to the degree that it is understood by the public at large its remunerated to the degree that it is understood all right now how about this longevity how about this longevity the continuing need of purpose can then preserve subject the continuing need of the subject can preserve the subject if the subject continues to be needed it will be preserved thats corollary of what i just gave you few minutes ago but the length of time that it gets preserved is entirely dependent upon the need of and the relay of its technology you see you must have the technology continue to be needed and the technology must also be relayed if it continues to be needed it will be also relayed which is all veryvery fascinating rather obvious but where you get subject coming on down the linewhere you get subject coming on down the line across the millennia and so forth it is only because its purpose is carried with it its purpose has gone along with it and its purpose is understood now one could destroy that subject by destroying its purposeno longer needed you seeor by destroying the relay of its technology in some fashion or another or in being too insistent or tootoo forceful in relaying its technology and tacking lots of other things to its technology which didnt belong on it in other words before you can study engineering you must have had grammar school education high school education gone to finishing school and learned how to knit i can expect that will be about the next one see youre not going to have any engineers after while all the bridges will start to fall down well one of the reasons why you wont have any engineers after while is very elementary and its contained in our own technology but only in our own technology the reason for this and that is youve given him too much takeoff hes had too much of run on takeoff andand the longer in anin educationlets get back on education nowthe longer it takes to approach the education the more opportunity there is for tacks on the runway we could probably state that in much more easily expressed way but thats about the way it is if this character is taking off taking off taking off taking off hes running on the runway hes trying to get up speed everybody is saying well you mustnt pull back on the stick yet you must stay there on the runway and keep running on the runway ready to take off ready to take off ready to take off ready to take off well by the time hes done this for about fortyfive years and finds out he isnt off the ground he doesnt take off the reason for that is is the number of opportunities to fail are directly proportional to the length of the approach thats law number of opportunities to fail are directly proportional to the length of approach or length of time that it is going to take to get up to where youre going to study this thing now that law is balanced by the fact that if you dont study something by gradients person can get into mess by going into too high gradient as i was talking about the other day he went too steep too quick so theressomewhere there is proper length runway for any subject its runway of the right length for the subject runway of the right length for the subject then would not be so long that it needlessly multiplies the opportunities for failure and it had better not be so short that person jumps gradient and gets himself into confusion and what is the right length of runway for any given subject how much preparatory action should there be or how long should course of study be and all of those things those questions are answered in this well it should not be so long that it needlessly oppormultiplies opportunities for failure and it should not be so short that it takes person up too steep hell fall off on his nose like we used to do when i was in flying clubs in college theres many sad young man would pull back on the stick too quick the evolution there was whipstall called whipstalltechnical term aviationyou come up the line and youthere isnt enough forward speed to sustain the vacuum on the top of the wings and you have just never seen an aircraft do anything quite as sickeningly funny as it does in whipstall its flying along very very nicely and all of sudden its flying too slow theres longer any vacuum above the wing and it goes whooof it is fast its not for nothing it was called whipstall and of course when youre only about 100 feet above the runway or something like that and the edge of the field and so on why ityou dont develop enough speed in the process of falling to then be able to pull back on the stick and pull out of it what they do is send notice to your folks and get in touch with my old friend the medical examiner of new york anyway thats what happens to student see he gets himself into state of overconfidence or something like this and he pulls back on the stick and he hasnt had long enough runway he hasnt developed his speed dont you see in other words he goes into too steep gradient now mary sue did it the other night shes studying typewriting of all things she typewrites pretty well but shes decidedstarted to do touchtyping and shes going to make the grade on the subject of touchtyping hammerpoundbang and its quite interesting i ran an educational process on her for very very short period of time on this subject and busted the dam on this i dont know that shes noticed it andshe isnt here just now she wound up with lawyers sobut she probably hadnt noticed that there is coordination between her sudden interest in learning to touchtype and breaking the barrier on one of the old too long runway propositions and too short gradient too i broke that with process and now shes very interested in learning touchtyping and shes spending about an hour night with everything else shes got to do sitting there hammerpounding on machine on touchtyping basis this is very difficult because at the same time she uses the typewriter during the remaining hours to hunt and punch out notes you see so on the one hand shes busy touchtyping you see and the next why shes hunting and punching it out you see doing her work and then shell get back and shell be touchtyping away i threw her i gave her metronome the other night and she suddenly conceived that her rhythm was off which it was and so forth and she couldnt do anything with that metronome running she said she had to shut that off right now it was too high gradient but she went onto the gradient of two rows of keys before she had licked one row of keys now you see what i mean by too tight gradient this was too tough see and boy did she whipstall she whipstalled right now and she just went into total confusion but knowing nowyesteryear she simply would have quit that would have been thatbut knowing now the technology that wethat ive managed to get together here on the subject of education she sits back and says now lets see now what did i do oh yeah well this is just too tough gradient i just went up on too high gradient she went back to one row patter tapatter tapatter tapatter and then went over onto two rows and she had it see see shein other words she moved up over that gradient smoothly so person knowing this can actually guide his own traffic through very nicely nobody had to tell her that dont you see all right then an educational subject is simply that something that winds up in doingness and is approached by the process of getting educated in it now thats hell of thing to have to say but you know hardly anybody really knows this they dont really know it they give it lip service all the time but theyre always engaging in activities which they do very badly and fail at like crazy and it never occurs to them theyve never been educated in the subject ill tell you something used to drive stark staring mad down in hollywood every director every supervisor and as far as thats concerned every actor on the set they all knew how to be writer they knewknew how tothey knew writing they could all write stories the place was just lousy with writers you want to know why hollywood never got out of kindergarten on stories thats just because of it they never recognized that its technology its professional technology which is studied like crazy it has more ins and outs and ramifications actually it has quite terminology but all these birds knew they knew how to write it wasnt anything you ever had to study so of course if they did get pro in their midstand hollywood developed very few professional writers in fact it developed professional writers they come in from elsewhere and go to pieces well the process is done by everybody there knowing the profession of the fellow who just arrived see hes writer hes professional he arrives everybody else knows his profession well now he wont give the movies the beingness necessary to realize that maybe movie writing has few tricks of the trade too so of course he looks little bit stupid to these people whereas hes not stupid at all he just hasnt learned that particular specialty of his own subject which he could learn rather rapidly and hollywood not realizing this never bothers to teach him how to write for hollywood and they have never found out that its necessary to be educated to know how to write so heres this wild profession which is sometimes remunerated to fantastic degree and in which you can very easily starve to death and in which people grant you fantastic quantities of beingness and in which people ignore you utterly so it is through all kinds of contradictions what is professional writer well by test hes somebody who is successful and is getting his stuff published or at least read or viewed but of all the subjects of the arts this is the wildest one to have anything to do with because nobody grants it the beingness of having any technology and yet the boy who succeedsyou would be very interestedthe boy who succeeds is not just somebody who wandered in with an idea you go up to the screen writers guild and you foryou find out that the reason education in writing has gotten bad name is because its taught in american universities they have gone out and hired bunch of failed writers and failed writers either become editors or professors and they dramatize their failure by the way and they try to make writer fail and ive never seen one do anything else i beg your pardon there have been few that worked like mad they were tremendously successful whatever they had to do with succeeded and that sort of thing but they werent under the idea that they were writers all these other birds still had this wild idea that they were kind of writers but here they were editing see they werent trained in it or if they had been trained in it theyd failed at it heres chance subject the whole society seems to run to some degree on the romances and imaginations and so forth of the writer but you talk about hidden piece of technical training well the technical training of this field doesnt exist if professional writer wants good laugh if he wants just to lie right down in the aisle and laugh and laugh and laugh until his sides are sore all he needs to do is read the curriculum of the professional writing classes of princeton for instance you just double up in ball i mean youyou cant help it and i took thea professional writing class at harvard one time and put them into paralysis and i was told by the professor later they never did recover i made the mistakei was very young and very brash and of course when youre invited to lecture on your own subject you see at some very esoteric institution of this particular character it rather goes to your head and you chuck your weight around you know particularly if youre very young and brash and and so i stood up in front of this writing class and i said to them i noticed your current subject here is style now writer really knows whether he has style or not until he has sat down and i was being very reasonable until hes sat down and written couple of hundred thousand words and by the time hes done that he can probably detect in his work whether or not he has style from the professional writers viewpoint this is the most reasonable statement ever made by anybody because pro eveneven dickens would just think nothing of getting out hundred thousand words in month see nothing i dont know where all this idea came from that they all write painfully with their blood while twisted in agony see they dont they dont at all if it took somebody seven years to write great work its because he was drunk six and half they write well they write easily and they write facilely for instance most of dickens stuff was written at the rate of 5000 words day at one time i worked it out and handed it over to the press and it got national press you saw that story kicking around and so forth they thought less of his work then of course i suppose but writer can write what better definition do you have for it see he can write easily facilely and rapidly well all right i said this to those poor blokes sitting there in their classroom and i noticed there was sort of shock went through the classroom and it was very shortly after that that i concluded my lecture and i didnt get hardly any applause they were all sitting there sort of like statues stunned they didnt even bother to get up at the end of the bell and finally one or two of them turned around to one or two of them they muttered something or other and the professor who was pretty good bloke he came back and got off the rostrum and walking out with and so forth and he said well you sure raised hell with that and i said why for pitys sakes why what is this all about oh he said theythey write 1500 words semester and those people were upset man i was back there again and that whole class nobody even would speak to they were upset they had thrown overboard i couldnt possibly be pro you see but yet my stuff was on the newsstands but this must be fluke something was wrong because the data id given them must be wrong these birds had never been told that they should have to write they were all being taught to be writers but nobody had ever said to them brother write you understand and i was the first one to announce to that class that were going into their fourth year that writer should write i dont know what writer was supposed to do he was supposed to discuss or he was supposed to do this or supposed to do that but theycommercialism has dirty word connected with it to such people and so forth why it means hard work they dont disdain money never get those people wrong they dont disdain anything that goes with it they dont disdain being commercial or being anything else it isnt their art theyre holding on to its hard work to produce to them this is just too tough so they had studied for four years and had not covered their first gradient which is that you do it we are now teaching you about ceramics in the field of ceramics you make pottery and glass and other such objects by the end of this course it will be expected that you will facilely and easily be able to make bits and pieces of pottery and tell things that are wrong with pieces of pottery that are not well made and so forth and you will know the technology of making pottery somebody comes along and says well youreyoure really teaching polytechnic subject or something man writing is simply cutting down trees running bulldozers theres many man out there digging ditch that hasnt got the physical energy it takes to write thats right its just another job and when approached in that fashion becomes reasonable and comprehensible and understandable and youthen you sit down writer isnt somebody who wears red fez hat and blue slippers and smokes pipe and gazes out the window writer is somebody who sits down to desk with pencil and piece of paper or with typewriter with some paper in it and he writes what does he write he writes what will be published and what will sell and what people will look at because by definition subject has to be accepted by the society in which it exists for it to be professional subject now this is awful coldblooded hardeyed looking thats right down to earth now i dont exaggerate when i say in university they dont say this the best professors will stand around and say well now when youre out in the field some day and youre looking down that transit dont blame if you havent got it level they dont teach that way they hand them transit after class and tell them to go survey something and dont even give them lecture on what the transit is because its some nasty object the tools of the trade are transits engineering the tools of the trade are levels the tools of the trade are big pieces of drawing paper and blueprints and bricks and pieces of steel and machines and bulldozers and tough foremen and shady contractors these are the tools of the trade they dont teach any course in how to keep your own ethics while working for the bideawee construction company theyre not real in other words theyve gone into some other nevernever land so that was how i shocked the short story course at harvard and i never could figure out exactly why and how i had shocked them it wasnt that i had told them too many words that i assumed for long time but i know now in studying education what i had done what i had done is simply told them that if youre studying writing you write youre expected to write youre expected to turn out wordage and it probably wasnt even in the phrase you wont know style because my whole talk was devoted to this single idea but it was when i finally gave them quantity right after what i meant by words on piece of paper i remember standing up there on the rostrum calculating it rather rapidly i said well ill get some low figure that anybody in his right mind would be able to do in few weeks you know and it wont buffalo anybody so i said couple of hundred thousand words you know gaaargh see well that was what they went gaargh but that isnt what the shock was contained in the shock was contained in the fact that my whole address to the subject of writing is that you wrote and that writer writes and that was what the shock was in if youre going to be educated in subject you should be able to do it now its not dirty word to do things now you dont have to go on obsessively doing this the rest of your life it is very confusing in this course that ive just taught ive just been taught the very best of these teachers have been thoroughly grounded in theory and have worked like madmen with lots of doingness and lots of ramifications of it in their own field now when youve got that combination youve got fellow when he said something is so there was something very believable about it because it was very right it was very recognizablehe might not even know how to write well but he could express this because it was his own subject and he knew what he was talking about now youve got somebody who couldnt do it and that would show upgahhh huge lights going up in all directions the impracticalities of it dont you see this this birdits not the right emphasis he doesnt tell you about the right things in the subject he tells you about something that he thinks might be interesting but he himself through experience doesnt know whether it would ever be useful or not see makes big thing out of some little thing dont you see i had one the other dayit slips my mind right now onin this course it had something to do with the fact the guy was just tearingoh yes yes it was projection it was the projection of transparencies and if you had screen six feet away whyand screen twelve feet away then your light and density of the transparencyyour light was of course much less on the screen twelve feet away fornot only because the footage was increased but because it was more distant and therefore the density of the transparency was very important for projection and transparencies had to be very very carefully developed and printed and so forth in their positive form in order to overcome these differences ofi wasit was one of these boys he was little more esoteric than the others well boy he was talking right up aand reg did we have any trouble projecting any old kind of transparency over there at the circus in the dead black of an open room at an unthinkable distance up to size of twelve by twelve well if youd listened to this guy very carefully you would have gotten the impression throughhe of course didnt have the experience he never had probably given lantern slide in his life you know its an old technology lantern slide shows it is the immediate grandpappy of the cinema see but this boy had probably never given one so he gives this terrific stress of how careful youve got to be to get this point at whichit doesnt matter it doesnt matter how thick transparency is as long as its viewable transparency it doesnt matter how dense it is or how thick it is or how hard it is to look through if its too far away get brighter light and the thing has solution thats all put another lamp in it you dont do it in the darkroom in other words you do it while youre projecting it but he didnt know this fact so he makes this big labored halfpage that you have to sweat through about printing transparencies and making sure that you know beforehand at what distance theyre going to be projected because it makes so much difference between theoh you get the idea now if this bird had beenhad ever done this or had had much to do with this he wouldnt make mistake like that so youwhat you do is get wrong emphasis so true knowledge will give correct emphasis and only theoretical knowledge will give wrong emphasis and i imagine the universities by this time are absolutely strewn with wrong emphasis and you can keep moving something farther and further afield with wrong emphasis up to point of where the technology practically gets lost wrong emphasis wrong emphasis wrong emphasis maddening in other words be very careful now about the varnish on your emeter now emeters are varnished and were going to go through now the next three weeks of study on the manufacture of varnishes for emeters well its matter of how unreal can you get it doesnt have anything to do with the subject matter at all just because there is some varnish in sessionit probably never occurred to you till this moment there was any varnish in session somebody makes big deal out of this you see he sayshe figures out because varnish is shiny he figures out that light falling on this might possibly influence the preclear into being distracted by the meter hes read someplace that something or other you see hes figured out that this must be true but actually an experienced auditor would tell you that he has never had this complaint from any pc every place so its not problem so why solve it so these unrealities simply consist of this and this is very precise definition unrealities enter when an educational activity teaches solutions to problems which dont exist or fails to solve problems that do exist and the mean between those is what should be taken up and the one thing that gives this is experience some bird has thehe has the activity of carving stone heads out of the mountain gutzon borglum hethis is it i imagine you could go up and you could learn more confounded things from bird like that i imagine hes got it down but hed expect you to have whole grounding in the field of the world of arts and sculpting before you even got there but nevertheless theres probably lot of specialized doodledaddle that he would tell you all about like you can tell whether that particular piece of rock that youre going to go into has crack in it by the fact that theres discoloration of the pattern of it and so forth and this would all be very good you see well hes solving something real you start to carve cracked rock and it goes crack and this is very disastrous particularly when youve only got one mountain to cut up you cant order another mountain so this is probably very important problem and you go out there again and you look it over and hes got new assistant who has been taught all about how to fix up faces and heads in mountains by somebody who never did and now gutzon borglum is faced with the fact that hes got to train thisfirst hes got to untrain this assistant and hes got to train him again so hes just got about twice the job on his hands you see this birds been taught that its very very bad to smoke at heights because it destroys your aesthetic sense has nothing to do with carving faces out of mountain see carving faces out of mountain doesnt require very much aesthetic sense it requires lot of leaning on these great big widow maker pneumatic drills and blasting powder and its very violent activity theres lots of motion and mass and doingness connected with it you see but somebody that would never do it hed teach well you have to be very careful of your aesthetic sense and so forth and blyehhh see hed try to extrapolate subject with which he had acquaintance and that would be very difficult thing to try to do to teach subject with which you had acquaintance and yet apparently it is notit is very difficult to do but it is always being done and its given higher education bad name today in many areasits given it very bad name because theyre always being taught by people who havent done it and i have really learned my lesson in this photography course boy i can see one of these birds coming up in the textbook mile away now and iahhhh i say ronnie here we gooooo wharooom we are now going to solve all sorts of problems that dont exist and were going to not have any solutions for the problems that do exist but all of this will be stated in such way that its impossible to extract any meaning out of it anyway but you will have to extract the meaning out of it unless you want to get barriered or blocked on this particular subject now isnt that an interesting problem so it makes about seven times the amount of study just easily seven times the amount of study that should be there he doesnt know what hes talking about but you have to know what hes talking about so you have to read his subject and then sort of dream up one and figure it out for yourself against your practical applications its bum show so all subjects regardless of whether people call them pure mathematics or pure art or something like that all subjects wind up in finite doingness very specific doingness all subjects wind up in specific doingness if they are educational subjects in which person can get educated and if they do not wind up with specific doingness person matter how long he studied them couldnt become educated in them now this isnt just for the definition of the word education i havent given it that meaning i mean you could go on and on and on and feel more and more baffled and more and more baffled by this particular subject and so forth well it is not subject in which somebody could become educated do you follow that well thats your bafflement youre trying to become educated and its impossible because it doesnt wind up in finite doingness so anything that winds up in finite specific doingnessthats measurable you know it has limits and actions anything that winds up in finite doingness is susceptible to being educated in other words you can educate it but if it doesnt wind up that way person cannot become educated in it matter how hard he studies it because there isnt any way he can ever check out if he ever learned anything so it becomes total significance for which the mass is absent and education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will be involved is hard on people education attempted in the absence of the mass is hard on the student its very tough on the student it makes him feelphysiologically it makes him feel squashed actually actually makes him feel squashed makes him feel bent makes him sort of spinny itthese are all physiological and mental reactions makes him feel sort of dead makes him feel bored exasperated makes him feel lot of different ways this isnt the only way person can become those by long ways but that is the result of studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent the mass of it is absent do you understand you could understand that you were studying nothing and therefore you would not expect any mass so that probably wouldnt upset you but youre studying tractors and you aint got tractors tractors and youre studying tractors photographs help motion pictures would help they would do pretty good because theyre something of the mass theyre sort of promise or hope of the mass but the printed page and the spoken word are not substitute for tractor remember that and this isnt the old argument of course we know that person hs to have something of the stuff theyre studying around them it isntit isnt even into the area of youryour practical and so forth dont look for further explanation for this datum because you have to understand this datum in its purity and that is simply that educating person ii mass which they dont have and which isnt available produces physiological reactions that is what im trying to teach you im not even saying it should be done or shouldnt be done im just saying it produces physiological reactions thats just fact you understand youre trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and youre not giving him any tractors well hes going to wind up with face that feels squashed hes going to wind up with headaches hes going to wind up with his stomach feeling funny hes going to feel dizzy from time to time his eyes are very often going to hurt and so forth now have i got this datum across its physiological datum it has to do with processing and the field of the mind so therefore you could expect that you would get the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that field of education most devoted to studying absent masses clever huh and therefore i can tell you knowing that datum exactly what the french educational system consists of i dont even believe they would be permitted to have desk in the room if they were studying desks i think the teachers first action would be to have all desks removed from the room and then he would teach them the theory of desks now one of the ways you get away with it i talk to you for instance in these lectures you are looking at somebody who does have mind and youre looking at body and its very live so youve got more mass actually in lecture than you have in bulletin youd probably much rather be lectured to live dont you see than you would be to bulletin all right your second best is youve got the mass of the tape and the sound and that probably isnt so bad but it starts reducing on down to silence and nowhereness and aso forth and about that time youd start to feel bad and then if you were studying somebody without ever having them therehave you ever read bulletin for instance and suddenly recognized something about the pc you were auditing you actually have an impulse to go find him or her well to the degree that you dont do that you get upset youve got an applied mass now but you havent got the thing there that it directly and immediately applies to so your tendency is to go find it all right one must understand that this phenomenon exists because there is another series of phenomena that exists which are physiological which are based on the fact of too steep gradient thats another source of physical or physiological study reaction because too steep gradient and this is sort of confusion or reelingness goes on this and its probablya distinct physiological reaction distinct from the other now i confess to you i havent bothered to make table of which gives which but im just telling you that there is distinction which could be drawn between these two things and then there is the third one of the physiological reaction brought about throughan entirely different one now an entirely different set of physiological reactions are predicted to exist in this fielda bypassed definition and the bypassed definition gives you distinctly blank feeling washedout feeling notthere feeling and sort of nervous sort of an hysteria will follow in in back of that those are some of the physiologicalmental reactions that follow this definition in other words im talking now about the fact that youd know whether somebody was jamming you in the arm with pin or hitting you on the toe with hammer well these are two different physical reactions two different physiological reactions see well ive just given you three sources of physiological reaction to aspects of study and they are three different areas of study and they are three different sets of symptoms and i havent bothered to bring it out in table form buti havent read it or studied it enough to bring it out in table form but i recognize the differences which exist there might be fourth and fifth you understand im not giving you this as the total grouping these are the three i know and know exist and know that are important youve got the one wherethis is the least upset ones of the thing but it produces the most distinctly recognizable actions and youll wonder in vain at what is producing this if you didnt know it and that is its just studying something without its mass ever being around or its space ever being around or something lets say youre studying sky and nobody ever lets you look at sky youve never got sky to look at dont you see something like that you can study mind because you know that the mind has an invisibility and contains certain amount of masses and that sort of thing but you understand that and you do have minds around and its quite obvious that you have mind in front of you when youre auditing the pc dont you see but if you were studying this all off in some ivory tower in austria or in bellevue hospital or someplace else where they dont have any minds you would very soon find yourself experiencing these reactions see theyd be zuuuu and so forth the manifestation of blow stems from the third one of the misunderstood definition or the not comprehended definition the undefined word and so forth thats what produces blow person doesnt necessarily blow on these other two theyre not pronouncedly blow phenomena theyre simply physiological phenomena well you could therefore make child feel sick or well in the field of study now that gives you whole table of what you could do little johnny is having an awful time in school with his arithmetic well obviously lets get him some apples and give each one of them number and hes got number of apples in front of him and there are longer theoretical number of apples lets give him the mass of what he is studying see see we find out suddenly that he had problem that involved apples and by golly he never had any apples on his desk to count you understand you know well trace it back to an absence of mass see or we could supply the mass which isim trying to give you the positive remedywe could supply mass we could supply an object or reasonable substitute and wed find out that first one i gave you there would cure up the remedy for the second one is cutting back find out when he was not confused on the gradient what new action he undertook to do now thats athats doingness level that gradient or what action he understood well and lets find the missing point right in what he understood well just before he was all confused what did he understand well and then we find out that he didnt understand it well see its reallyits really at the tail end of what he understood well and after that he went over the gradient see all right but that is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness the individual is suddenly asked to learn handling his sensitivity control and he has been getting along just dandy watching the needle of the emeter swing to the left and right and now hes all confused about the sensitivity control well there is something wrong with the emeters needle swinging back and forth dont go over and try to explain the sensitivity control because he doesnt misunderstand the sensitivity control you have hit too steep gradient it was too much of jump because he didnt understand what he was doing and he jumped to something next and that was too steep and it went too fast and he will assign all of his difficulty to this new thing so thats true in this gradient see thats true of gradients now differentiate because gradients here sounds terribly like definitions but remember that they are quite distinctly different gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness but they still hang off in the field of understandingness but it is the action that we are interested in in gradients where we have plotted course of forward motion see weve got plotted course he should go through this he should go through that and then hes supposed to go through that and we find out that he was terribly confused on the second one he went through well we must assume that he never got out of the first one thats the gradient approach and that is one whole set of phenomena accompanies that and it looks awfully like this other one but this other one is so much more important than the gradient approachwhich you only run into the intimacies of actually training somebodythis other one is so much more important the last one than gradients that its the woof and warp and the makeup of human relations the mind subjects it establishes talent it establishes aptitude lack of aptitude its what the psychologists have been testing for years and its all of this balderdash and thats just the definitions of words the misunderstood word thats about all it goes back to the misunderstood word and that produces such vast panorama of mental effects that it itself is the prime factor involved with stupidity the prime factor involved with many other things if person werent this way his talent might or might not be present but his doingness would be present see he might not paint great picture but hed be painting pictures so his aptitude in being able to do it would have something to do with his sensitivity have something to do with little bit more you see you know werewe cant say that joe would paint as well as bill if both of them were unaberrated on the field of art see thats an unreasonable assumption but we can say that the inability of joe to paint compared to the ability of joe to make the motions of painting is dependent exclusively and only upon definitions ill go over that again exclusively only upon definitions there is some word in the world of art that the person who is inept didnt define or understand and that was followed by an inability to act in the field of arts thats very important because it tells you what happens to doingness and the restoration of doingness depends only upon the restoration of the misunderstood word the misunderstood definition this is very fast processing its very swift wide big result is obtainable in this it has technology which is very simple technology it enters in at the lower levels because it has to itll probably be discussed at level i and it will be memorized and done at level ii and it will be followed on up the line but because it is low grade does not mean it is unimportant it means it has to be at the entrance gates of scientology thats all it means but it is sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education and dont neglect it you can trace back the subject he is dumb in or any allied subject hes got mixed up with it and youll find out why the psychologist cannot understand scientology there is nothing wrong with scientology there was everything wrong with psychology he never understood word in psychology so he doesnt ever move over into scientology got the idea audience yes well that opens the gate to education so although ive given it last along that line that is the most important one okay audience yes thank you
