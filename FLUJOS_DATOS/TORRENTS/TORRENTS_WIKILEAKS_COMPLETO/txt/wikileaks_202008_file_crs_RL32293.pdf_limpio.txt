brackets to keep up with inflation as is the case with most economic indicators the two cpis are not without their flaws one of the difficulties in estimating changes in the cost of living is that consumer spending patterns change tinuously spending patterns change b ecause of changing tastes and also because of changes in relative prices over time as prices change consumers will tend to buy more of those goods and services whose prices are rising slower than average nd fewer of those goods and services whose prices are rising faster than average this substitution is believed to result in

chained consumer price index for all urban consumers ccpiu the ccpiu does not replace either of the current cpis and has not affected any current indexing provisions of federal government programs the

cpis are not revised makes them attractive for use in making automatic costofliving adjustments the ccpiu is subject to two revisions after its initial release if the ccpiu were to be used instead

of inflation published by the federal governme nt published by the bureau of labor statistics bls of the department of labor it is used to adjust social security benefit payments as well as personal income tax brackets to keep up with inflation1 nonetheless it has been subject to criticism for example in 1996 groupcommissioned by the senate finance committee issued report that examined the cpi and identified number of weakne sses and made speci fic recommendations 2 as part of its continuing efforts to c onstruct better measure of changes in the cost of living bls introduced the chai ned consumer price index for all urban consumers ccpiu in testimony before the house budget committee in 2004 then federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan suggested that congress might consider replacing the cpi with the ccpiu to make automatic costofliving adjustments to federal programs3 he pointed out that at that time if the ccpiu had been used instead of the cpi over th previous 10 years that the federal debt would have been about 200 billion less this report explains how the ccpiu is calculated and discusses how it differs from the existing cpi ideally price index would measure changes in the cost of living true cost ofliving index would measure the change in income that would be required for consumers to maintain constant level of satisfaction or utility but there are number of practical complications that ma ke constructing such an index difficult the concept of utility is pervasive in economic theory with given level of income which constrains their choices c onsumers decide how to spend their money based on the utility or satis faction yielded by the various available goods andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32293crs2 4 the cpi is strictly speaking modified fixe dweight price index in that the marketbasket is periodically updated until recently however those updates occurred only about once every 10 years with the release of cpi data for january 2002 the marketbasket was updated to reflect spending patterns in the 19992000 period and bls now plans to update the marketbasket every two years with the release of the january 2008 cpi the weights were updated to reflect spending patterns in the 20052006 period while the marketbasket may not be allowed to get too far out of date it is always somewhere between two and four years out of date 5 ana m aizcorb and patrick c jackman the commodity substitution effect in cpi data 198291 monthly labor review december 1993 pp 2533services they are assumed to spend that money in such way as to get the most satisfaction possible within the limitations of their budget but since there is unit of measure for utility any measure of change in the cost of living must be based on what consumers actually spend any numerical measure that attempts to approximate changes in the cost of gi ven standard of livin g depends on number of assumptions and has numerous practical limitations one of the difficulties in estimating changes in the cost of living is that consumer spending patterns change conti nuously spending patterns change because of changing tastes and also because of changes in relative prices over time as prices change consumers will tend to buy more of those goods and services whose prices are rising slower than average nd fewer of those goods and services whose prices are rising faster than average this substitution is believed to cause the cpi to overstate the effect of in flation on consumer wellbeing methodological differences because the cpi is fixedweight index it does not entirely reflect ongoing changes in buying habits4 as the overall level of prices rises relative prices change as well some prices rise faster than average and some prices rise more slowly than average when goods are reasonably clos substitutes consumers can change their spending patterns and buy relatively more of those goods whos prices are rising slowly and fewer of those goods whose prices are rising rapidly if these changes in consumer spendi ng patterns have effect on overall consumer satisfaction then price index ba sed on fixed marketbasket of goods and services will overstate the increase in cost of given standard of living because the cpi does not take into account consumers ability to insula themselves albeit to limited extent from inflation by changing their spending patterns it overestimates how much they would need to raise total spending to maintain constant standard of living this is referred to as substitution bias5 the current cpi is fixedweight index the current cpi is fixedweight or l aspeyres price index to see how fixedweight index is calculated consider the simple case of two time periods and two goods in the first period the value of

of the quantities in the first period and the prices in the two periods it is weighted sum the first step is to calculate for each good the ratio of the price in the second period to th price in the first period the ratios are then summed using expenditure shares in only the first period as weights to see how fixedweight price index is calculated see box 1 box 1 calculating fixedweight price index to illustrate consider the formula where i refers to the good t refers to the period and s1 refers to the expenditure share for each good in the first period and the followi ng hypothetical values for prices and quantities beer wine total cost period quantity price cost quantity price cost 1 10 4 40 6 10 60 100 2 12 2 24 4 19 76 100 the index for period 1 is 1000 and the index value for period 2 is index 0 42 40619 102l index 1 3402l using expenditure weights from the first period in the case of beer the expenditure weight is 40 100 040 and for wine it is 60 100 060 yields an index value in the second period of 1340 which indicates an overall increase in the price of this marketbasket of 340 in this case the measure of price change does not take into account the fact that the hypothetical consum er bought more beer and less wine because of the change in relative prices the chainweighted cpi as part of the continuing effort to improve measures of change in the cost of

consumer prices that is free of substitution bias the final release of the ccpiu will be calculated using törnqvist index formula7 this formula uses expenditure weig hts in both periods and thus it reflects both changes in prices and changes in the composition of the marketbasket to see how törnqvist price i ndex is calculated see box 2 box 2 calculating törnqvist price index the törnqvist index formula looks like this in this case for each good i the price in the second period in which case pt is simply p2 is divided by the price in the first period p1 and the exponent applied to that ratio is the average of the expenditure weights of that good in the two periods in this formula the j symbol indicates that each of the weig hted price ratios for the goods in the marketbasket are multiplied together tinuing with the same hypothetical numbers from the previous example and using the törnqvist formula gives using the törnqvist formula yields an index value for the second period of 1175 indicating an increase in the price of this hypothetical marketbasket of 175 because the törnqvist index requires da ta on expenditures in both time periods it cannot be published concu rrently with existing cpis expenditure data are not available in time however bls publishes an initial estimate of the ccpiu based on an alternative formula the release of this initial estimate will coincide with the release of other cpi data each m onth every february the estimates for all of the months in the previous calendar years ccpiu estimates are revised again using an alternative formula this first revision referred to as the interim release in the following february the final ccpiu estimates based on the törnqvist formula are released for ll of those same months8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32293crs5 8 continued to revision may make it less attractive for indexing purposes 9 geometric mean is the root of product of set of numbers the geometric mean of two numbers is the square root of their product the current cpi already makes use of geometric means in calculating some of the component i ndexes geometric means were adopted for the cpiu in january 1999 for use in aggregating some of the component indexes where goods in given category were relatively close substitutes at the time it was estimated that the change would result in 02 percentage point drop per year in measured consumer price inflation kenneth v dalton john s greenle and kenneth j stewart incorporating geometric mean formula into the cpi monthly labor review october 1998 pp 37 10 see matthew

11142gthe initial release and the first revisi on or interim release of the ccpiu will be based on the same expenditure weights used for the cpiu but these indexes will be based on geometric mean formula9 in contrast with the laspeyres index in which the quantities are held constant in both periods the geometric mean index formula holds expenditure shares price times quantity constant it assumes particular consumer response to the change in relative prices that means that if the price of good rises the quan tity consumed implicitly falls some research has suggested that the geometric mean ba sed price index may have negative substitution bias if consumers are assumed to respond to changes in relative prices more than they actually do to see how geometric mean index is calculated see box 3 10 box 3 calculating geometric mean price index the formula for geometric mean price index looks like this using the same prices and quantities as in the previous example with this formula gives using the geometric mean approach to calcu lating the price index for period 2 yields an increase of 114 between the two periods less than either of the other two measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32293crs6 in estimating the initial and interim rel eases of the ccp iu which will be calculated using the geometric mean formula an adjustment is made to the numbers based on the historical differences between the geometric mean index and the törnqvist index so that the initial and inter im release will be closer to the final index number although the ccpiu may be superior to the cpi in some respects final data are far from timely for example in the case of the release of ccpiu data for the month of january 2008 the initial release occurred in februa ry 2008 the interim release will occur in february 2009 and fina l data will not be re leased until february 2010 final data for all of the months in calendar 2008 will be released in february 2010 thus the wait for the final release of any january ccpiu is 25 months but because all of the months in given cale ndar year are revised at the same time the wait for the final release of any december ccpiu is only 14 months table 1 shows how many months after the reference month the month for which the data are reported that the various releases are published table1 number of months after reference month

cpiu bls examined the underlying data and found that increased variability in the component indexes may have led to the larger than usual difference the diffe rence between the two indexes is determined in part by the extent to wh ich component indexes ri at varying rates and the degree to which consumers shift thei r spending habits as result of changes in relative prices the short history of the ccpiu makes it difficult to say with any confidence how large future revisions are likely to be in 2002 the change between the interim and final release amounted to 03 percentage point

numbers for the cpiu and ll three versions of the ccpiu source department of labor bureau of labor statistics policy considerations the publication of the ccpiu is part of continuing effort by bls to produce more accurate measure of inflation12 if it is widely seen as superior to the cpi it will at least provide policymakers with better measure of inflation the cpi is important not only as an economic indicator but also because it has significant implications for the budget thr ough the indexing of the tax brackets and social security benefits if the cpi overs tates the effect of inflation on consumers then social security benefits are rising more rapidly than necessary to preserve the living standards of beneficiaries similarly the income tax brackets are rising faster than necessary to avoid bracket creep wh ereby with progressive tax rates income is taxed at higher rate even though it is simply keeping up with rising prices if the ccpiu is better measure of changes in the true cost of living and the goal of indexing is strictly to reflect changes in the cost of living then the ccpiu might be considered as measure on whic h to base those adjustments major figure 1 the cpiu and the ccpiuhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32293crs9 complication however is the re lease schedule final ccp iu data are not available for up to two years after the reference peri od the january 2008 social security cost ofliving adjustment was based on the th ird quarter 2007 cpi da ta final ccpiu data for the third quarter of 2007 will not be available until february 2009 such long time lag might make th final ccpiu number poor candidate as an index for automatic adjustments whether the initia l or interim estimates might be attractive alternatives may depend on whether they ar biased relative to the final number or if the revisions tend to be significant if there is tendency for the final index to rise faster than the initial or interim indexes that might make the preliminary indexes unpopular with those who would be affected the ccpiu is likely to continue rising more slowly than either the cpiu or the cpiw as they are now calculated that could generate opposition to changing current indexing provisions and basing fu ture costofliving adjustments on the c cpiu from some social security beneficiaries and taxpayers
