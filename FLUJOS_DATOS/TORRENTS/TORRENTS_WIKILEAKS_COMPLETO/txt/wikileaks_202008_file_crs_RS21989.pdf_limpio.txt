gbagbo bagbo however restating longheld position said he would reconsider the reforms only if the fn begins to disarm in late october political tensions rose mobs attacked the opposition pre ss volatile rhetoric nd street protests by antifn militants increased and the fn reca lled its ministerial delegation from côte divoires interim governme nt of national rec onciliation the recall followed the fns declaration of state of emergency in the north after it discovered arms caches smuggled into its stronghold the central city of bouaké the fn charged that the government was preparing for renewed war by sending the arms to rebel rivals of the fn and by massing troops on november 4 the govern ment launched air attacks on bouaké and in abidjan the commercial capital mobs attacked opposition party offices in the following days air strikes on northern targets continued nd the government began northward troop movements which united nations and french peacekeepers intercepted and halted on november 6 government planes bombed french military base in bouaké killing nine french peacekeepers and us civilian the french force immediately retaliated by destroying the ivoirian air force four fighter jets and five military helicopters and two ci vilian jets this action angere d many progbagbo supporters who massed in antifrench protests that turned into riots during which frenchowned andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21989crs2 other businesses and pr operties were looted and burned and french and other foreigners attacked in abidjan and elsewhere in res ponse france deployed two auxiliary battalions to côte divoire to bolster its military fo rce and provided milita ry protection and air assets for the voluntary departure from côte divoire of about 4000 french nationals as well as other foreigners french officials report that these actions caused total of 20 ivoirian civilian and military deaths sepa rately about 10000 ivoirians fled west to liberia france has denied progovernment s upporters charge that it seeks to topple the gbagbo government the african union au which has been involved in numerous on going efforts to end the crisis dispatched south african president thabo mbeki to mediate in the crisis he later hosted talks among the ivoirian parties in south africa the ivoirian government has offered clear rationale for its air attack on the french base which it has called accidental and regret ful but the strikes reportedly carried out by belorussian pilots employed by ukrainian firm appear to have been deliberate french official sources assert that the base was clearly marked and identifiable from the air as french military base and that the attacking jets made two lowaltitude observation overflights before attacking they are uncertain which ivoirian authorities ordered the strikes but postulate that gbagbo himsel f likely did not the united states condemned the street violence and the governments military attacks and called the french retaliation necessary to prevent further attacks and violence mirroring statement by the security council it later imposed ausupporte d arms sanctions on cô divoire which the government has since been accused of breaking background côte divoire former french colony that gained independence in 1960 was politically stable for most of its post colonial period it had among the strongest economies in subsaharan afri ca and was key regional busin ess hub it attracted foreign investment notably from france and was leading world producer of cocoa and coffee among other exports its economic success was built on agriculturefriendly policies generally favorable export prices expansions in production extensive french investment and the labor of immigrants from its north ern neighbors they worked cheaply in exchange for jobs and access to land and farming rights in the south there dynamic multiethnic society evolved contributing to strong economic ties be tween côte divoire and its neighbors these outco mes were largely the legacy of félix houphouëtboigny the ivoirian president from 1960 til his death in 1993 his patriarchal semiauthoritarian tenure was long marked by stability periodic internal strife and political dissent which grew during his final ears in office were suppressed or averted through the use of mix of state poli ce power and political cooptation houphouëts policies which employed the strategic use of political patronage emphasized the collective benefits of national intrare gional elite cooperati on broad socioeconomic inclusiveness and reinvestme nt of national wealth in the economy the military played almost role in national affa irs and did not threaten the ruling regime national defense was largely entrusted to france with which côte divoire has mutual defense pact social political divisions calls for increased democratization accompanied by episodic social unrest and political tens ions emerged in the mid1980s these were spurred by longterm cocoa price and produc tion declines the 1980s debt crisis and declining availability of new fa rm land leading to slow econo mic decline fiscal austerity measures and growing political and economic rivalries and segmen tation while resource scarcities largely underlay thes divisions they increasingly began to be expressed in terms of ethnicity regional ch auvinism and religious aff iliation the onset of multipartyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21989crs3 elections in 1990 fueled thes tendencies by generating political parties that mobilized support around these parochial sources of affi nity the large mostly muslim populations of immigrant workers their ivoirianborn offspring and northern ivoirians resident in the south faced increasing resistance by southerners and the state to their full incorporation into civic life and citizenship multiparty political competition intensified after houphouëtboignys death which led to rivalr ies over leadership succession rights his successor henri konanbédié adopted exclus ionary politics as means of building his political base he promoted xe nophobic nationalist ideology known as ivoirité it defined southerners as authen tic ivoirians in opposition to circumstantial ivoirians ie northerners and immigrants his politics created dissent within his party the democratic party of côte di voire pdci causing some pd ci elements to form new party the rally of the republican s rdr under alassane ouattara wáhtaarah former prime minister multilateral financial institution official and key politician of northern ethnic origins national politics has since remained prone to periodic volatility generated by combinations of electoral politics military student and labor unrest religious interregional and ethnic conf lict and sometimes viol ent mass protests gbagbo takes power president gbagbo won divisive violent election in late 2000 taking power with small electoral plur ality from the military dictator robert guéï who had ousted bédié in 1999 coup after guéï attempted to rig the vote count in his own favor gbagbos ivoirian popular front fpi party called its supporters into the streets and gained the support of key security force elements guéï who was later killed in the 2002 uprising then fled and gbagbo took power the election set the stage for growing divide between north and south electoral restrictions both in 2000 and previously had barred the elect oral candidacy of ouattara breeding northen resentments despite social and political tensions in 2001 and 2002 côte d ivoire made limited progress toward regenerating national reconciliation and political compromise in late 2001 for instance key representatives from ll major parties and national constituencies participated in governme nthosted multifaceted nationa l reconciliation forum but in july 2002 local elections were marked by some violence boycotts and irregularities september 2002 rebellion guarded optimism about cô divoires path was undercut in september 2002 when military rebe llion that initially appeared to concern military working conditions pay and retrench ment grew into an attempted coup detat against gbagbo by soldiers of mostly northern ethnic origin loyalist military and police units successfully guarded key state installations from rebel takeover but could not suppress the rebellion after cl ashes near abidjan and else where the rebels withdrew to bouaké and quickly gained control of th northern half of the country periodic sometimes fierce fighting ensued as the gove rnment unsuccessfully attempted to retake towns along the northsouth front line the c ountry has since remain ed divided and often tense though fighting had subsided until november 2004 the northern rebels formed political organization the patr iotic movement of côte divoire mpc i later called the new forces laid out their political demands and attempted to set up local governance structures they formed an alliance with tw small rebel groups in western côte divoire these nowmarginal groups which reportedl included many liberians and sierra leonean fighters announced their existence in november 2002 by izing several towns in the west since late 2002 the west has periodically experienced armed clashes over territory communal violence related to immigrants land and residency rights and violent criminality international peacekeepers have occasionally clashed with the western rebelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21989crs4 while civil and commercial life in the north resumed after disruptions caused by the rebellion economic activity and access to social services sharply declined under rebel administration and remain poor rivalries and armed clashes with in rebel ranks have repeatedly occurred and rebel elements nd some french peacekeepers have engaged in criminal activities in the north in th south many northerners opposition party supporters foreignborn workers and their i voirianborn offspring have periodically faced mob violence by progbagbo militant s arson attacks on their homes and harassment by security officials death squads have reportedl killed some opposition supporters such violence induced large exodus to the north and to nearby countries of targeted populations and caused decline in regional trade nd financial flows mediation and peace accord international conflict mediation efforts notably by the economic community of west afri can states ecowas were initiated soon after the 2002 rebellion began little progre ss was made however until frenchbrokered peace talks n ear paris led to the signing of peace accord the linasmarcoussis agreement available from the us institute of peace online peace ag reements archive in late january 2003 following rise in armed hostilities in the west the accord kept gbagbo in power but provided for the creation of government of national reconciliation gnr under consensusprime minister the accord gave the gnr mandate to prepare for national elections and reform the armed forces with external technical aid to ensure ethnic and regional balance in the military it required the regrouping and disarming of all forces th deportation of foreign mer cenaries and called for an international accord monitoring committee wh ich was formed an annex laid out gnr agenda for resolving key issues underlying th crisis it called for reform of electoral candidacy and citizenship eligibility rules the electoral system and land tenure and press laws provided for the creation of human righ ts abuse investigati on panel and called for nationwide freedom of m ovement and for postwar ec onomic recovery planning the accord was immediately opposed by ma ny military and government officials and by profpi activists who reacted vocally and at times violently in some cases protesters attacked frenchowned businesses and homes accord critics asserted that it ceded too much power and made too many c oncessions to the rebels key issue of contention was an informal verbal pledge by the government during the peace talks to give the mpci control of the defense and interior ministries which the military rejected as humiliating gbagbo under pressure to re pudiate the accord indi cated that he had accepted the accord under foreign pre ssure and with great reluctance accord implementation efforts despite such rhetorical misgivings in compliance with the accord gbagbo appointed seydou diarra consensus nominee as prime minister position that diarra had held in previous government the security council ndorsed the linasmarcoussis agreement in february 2003 by passing resolution 1464 it authorized two peacekeep ing force deployments french one operation licorne and one mounted by the econo mic community of west african states ecowas dubbed ecomici the missions were charged with helping to implement the accord and resolve the conflict and guaranteeing their own security and freedom of movement and the protection of civilians despite many setbacks including proce dural boycotts and objections and disputes over the defense and interior ministry nominations implementation of the accord progressed until august 2003 gnr cabinet was formed in march 2003 and on mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21989crs5 3 2003 after fighting in the west ceasefire was signed on may 13 the security council passed resolution 1479 it created ceasefire monitoring group the mission in côte divoire minuci and urge d implementation of the ceasefire and the underlying accord joint operation of fr ench fn ecomici and government troops was mounted to end ongoing violence in the west in late may diarra outlined parliamentary peacebuilding governance agenda disarmament demobilization and reintegration ddr committee and schedule were created northsouth military cooperation began an end to war was decl ared northsouth transport links reopened as did trade with neighboring countries the ceas efire line was extended to the unstable west and the government released some prisoners of war in early august the parliament passed law amnestying those who had unde rmined state security from september 2000 to september 2002 period that included gbagbos election and the fn rebellion despite such positive signs progress was often halting the sides often accused one another of obstructionist acts and sought to blame one nother for undermining progress toward peace agreements to withdraw forces from the cease fire line exchange prisoners and initiate disarmament were initiated and failed several times in midseptember 2003 gbagbo appointed candidate ministers of defens and interior over the objections of opposition parties and th fn which accused gbagbo of not ceding operational authority from its gnr ministers withdrew from the gnr several months of high tension followed activists on both sides mounted raucous protests despite government ban decree disbanding hardlin often jingoistic pr ogovernment youth groups produced limited results in abidjan policeman murdered french reporter covering opposition arrests and oppositi on press facilities were attacked key legal reforms notwithstanding such events in late october 2003 the government agreed to fasttrack key draf t laws called for under the peace accord at the urging of regional leaders seeking to promote the peace process these would reform constitutional presidential election candidate eligibility qualifications give citizenship rights to certain immigrants and their offspring and extend ownership rights to immigrant occupants of certain lands cultivated with local communities consent the process for passing these laws is key point of conten tion gbagbo favors passing all three laws by public referendum though that process is re quired only to pass th candidate eligibility law as it would amend article 35 of the c onstitution the other two could be passed by parliament process advocated by the fn and and many foreign observers the political process remained stalem ated and volatile until december 2003 when tensions eased and limited demilitarization along the ceasefire line took place the fn joined cabinet meeting in early janua ry 2004 french peacekeepers expanded their deployment in the north to bolster secur ity public service delivery and moves toward disarmament in spring of 2004 tensions again rose opposition parties boycotted the gnr for diverse reasons ke point of controversy was the shooting death by security forces of 37 opposition protesters and possibl many more which probe later examined in midapril 2004 another fr ench journalist known for reporting on corruption in the cocoa sector was reportedl murdered in midmay gbagbo dismissed opposition ministers boycotting the gnr for failure to carry out their duties in early june 2004 there were clashes along the ceasefire line role in february 2004 as proposed by secretary general kofi annan the security council

violate resolution 1572 th latter two sanctions were imposed for 12 months as of december 15 2004 certain ex ceptions pertain to each sanction measure us policy key facets of us policy on côte divoire include resolving and mitigating the politicalmilitary crisis there due to the threat it potentially poses to regional economic and humanitarian wellbeing stability and security as well as to us regional conflict resolution and democratizati on policy goals many nearby countries have close economic and social ties to côte divoi re and might become i nvolved in its conflict should the security situation in côte divoire threaten their citizens territory or national interests others are themselves undergoi ng postcivil war transitions and are the recipients of us and aid that could be imperiled by renewed regional instability in recognition of the negative humanitarian and regional effects of the conflict the united states has provided emergency aid to ma ny people displaced by it though some observers have speculated that antifrench actions by progbagbo supporters represent an attempt to appeal to alleged usfrench foreign policy differences us policy appears generally supportive of french actions in côte divoire us support also helped pass frenchbacked sanctions against côte d ivoire which is also subject to ban on most forms of us bilateral aid with some exceptions because it has not held legitimate democratic elections since the 1999 guéï coup in november 2004 secretary powell spoke to president gbagbo in conversation sa id by one columnist to have been lengthy and tough jim hoagland giving france hand washington post nov 25 2004 the united states also supported the cr eation of unoci though its backing was contingent on changes in the mission
