malpractice or neglect of duty id at 88 madison june 2 1787 with months reflection tw delegates pinkney and morris moved that the re moval language be stricken mr pinkney mr govr morris moved to stri ke out this part of the resolution mr p observed he ought not be impeachable whilst in office mr davie if he be not impeachable whils t in office he will spare efforts or means whatever to get himself reelected he considered this as an essential security for the good behavior of the executive mr wilson concurred in the necessity of making the executive impeachable whilst in office mr govr morris he can do criminal act without coadjutors who may be punished in case he should be reelected th at will be sufficient proof of his innocence besides who is to impeach is the impeachment to suspend his functions if it is not the mischief will go on if it is the impeachment w ill be nearly equivalent to displacement and will render the executive depende nt on those who are to impeach col mason point is of more importance than that the right of imp eachment should be continued shall any man be above justice above all shall that man be above it who can commit the most extensive injustice when great crimes were committed he was for punishing the principal as well as th coadjutors there had been much debate difficulty as to the mode of chusing the ex ecutive he approved of that which had been adopted at first namely of referring the appointment of the natl legislature one objection agst electors was the danger of thei r being corrupted by the candidates this furnished peculiar reason in favor of impeachments whilst in office shall the man who has practiced corruption by that means proc ured his appointment in the first instance be suffered to escape punishme nt by repeating his guilt docr franklin was for retaining the clause as favorable to the executive history furnishes one example only of first magistrate being formally brought to public justice every body cried out agst this as unconstitutiona l what was the practice before this in cases where the chief magistrate rendered himself obnoxious why recourse was had to assassination in which he was not only depr ived of his life but of the opportunity of vindicating his character it wd be the best way therefore to provide in the constitution for the regular punishment of the executive when his misconduct should deserve it and for his honorable acquittal when he should be unjustly accused mr govr morris admits corruption some few other offences to be such as ought to be impeachable but thought the cases ought to be enumerated defined mr madison thought it indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the community agst the incapac ity negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate the limitation of the period of his service was not sufficient security he might lose his capacity after his appointment he might pe rvert his administration into scheme of peculation or oppr ession he might betray his tr ust to foreign powers in the case of the executive magistracy which was to be administered by single man loss of capacity or corruption was more within th compass of probable events and either of them might be fatal to the republic httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98894crs3 mr king expressed his apprehensions th at an extreme caution in favor of liberty might enervate the government we were forming he wished the house to recur to the primitive axiom that the three great depar tments of govts should be separate independent that the executive judiciary shoul d be so as well as the legislative that the executive should be so equally with the j udiciary would this be the case if the executive should be impeachable it had b een said that the judiciary would be impeachable but it should have been remember ed at the same time that the judiciary hold their places not for limited time but during good behavior it is necessary therefore that forum should be established for trying misbehavior was the executive to hold his place during good beha vior the executive was to hold his place for limited term like the members of the legislature like th em particularly the senate whose members would continue in appointment the same term of 6 years he would periodically be tried for his behavior by his electors who would c ontinue or discontinue him in trust according to the manner in which he had di scharged it like them ther efore he ought to be subject to intermediate trial by impeachment he ought not to be impeachable unless he hold his office during good behavior tenure which would be most agreeable to him provided an independent and effectua l forum could be devised but under circumstances ought he to be impeachable by the legislature th is would be destructiv of his independence and of the principles of the constitution he relied on the vigor of the executive as great security for the public liberties mr randolph the propriety of impeachment s was favorite principle with him guilt wherever found ought to be punished the executive will have great opportunities of abusing his power particularly in time of war when the military force and in some respects the public money will be in hi s hands should regular punishment be provided it will be irregularly inflicted by mults insurrections he is aware of the necessity of proceeding with cautious hand and of excluding as much as possible the influence of the legislature from the business he suggested for consideration an idea which had fallen from col hamilt on of composing forum out of the judges belonging to the states and even of requiring some preliminary inquest whether just grounds of impeachment existed mrgovr morriss opinion had been ch anged by the arguments used in the discussion he was now sensib of the necessity of impeachments if the executive was to continue for any time in office our executive was not like magistrate having life interest much less like one having an hereditary interest in his office he may be bribed by greater interest to betray his trust and one would say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing the first ma gistrate in foreign pa without being able to guard agst it by displacing him one woul d think the king of england well secured agst bribery he has as it were fee simple in the whole kingdom yet charles ii was bribed by louis xiv the executive ought therefore to be impeachable for treachery corrupting his electors and incapacity were other cause s of impeachment for the latter he should be punished not as man but as an officer and punished only by degradation from his office this magistrate is not the king but the primeminister the people are the king when we make him amenable to justice how ever we should take care to provide some mode that will not make him dependent on the legislature ii f arrand 649 madison july 20 1787 the convention voted to make the executive removable on impeachment but moved on without addressing the particulars the dele gates assigned the committee on detail the task of working these and othe r matters individually agreed upon into ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98894crs4 cohesive draft the draft the committee presented on august 6 designated as the president that officer who had been variously referred to as the executive the first magistrate up until then it also declared that he shall be removed from his office on impeachment by the house of representatives and convicted in the supreme court of treason bribery or corruption i d at 18687 madison after extensive discussion of other i ssues the convention referred number of propositions to the committee on detail for ex amination including proposal for council of state to assist the president nd to consist of the chief justice of the supreme court as well as five designated partment heads secretary of domestic affairs secretary of commerce and finan ce etc appointed by the pres ident each of the officers above mentioned shall be liable to impeachment and re moval from office for neglect of duty malversation or corruption i d at 33538 madison august 20 1787 the committee reported proposal on august 22 that among other things called for council but made mention of impeachme nt of its members it did suggest that the judges of the supreme court shall be triable by the senate on impeachment by the house of representatives but was sile nt as to the grounds for impeachment i d at 367 journal the delegates subsequently voted to ssign impeachment and handful of other nettlesome questions to second committee the socalled committee of eleven the committees partial report packaged together number of recommendations concerning the president including one that he shall be removed from his office on impeachment by the house of representatives and convic tion by the senate for treason or bribery id at 499 madison september 4 1787 the convention debated the recommendati on four days later on the eighth of september the clause referring to the senate the trial of impeachments agst the president for treason bribery was taken up col mason why is the provision restra ined to treason bribery only treason as defined in the constitution will not reach ma ny great and dangerous offences hastings is not guilty of treason attempts to s ubvert the constitution may not be treason as above defined as bills of attainder wh ich have saved the british constitution are forbidden it is the more necessary to extend the power of impeachments he moved to add after bribery or maladminis tration mr gerry seconded him mr madison so vague term will be equivalent to tenure during pleasure of the senate mr govr morris it will not be put in force can do harm an election of every four years will prevent maladministration col mason withdrew maladministration substitutes other high crimes misdemeanorsagst the state on the question thus altere d the convention agreed in the amendment of col mason just agreed to the word state after the words misdemeanors against was struck out and the words united states inserted unanimously in order to remove ambiguity on the question to agree to clause as amended the convention agreed httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98894crs5 on motion the vicepresident and othe r civil officers and the us shall be removed from office on impeachment and convi ction as aforesaid was added to the clause on the subject of impeachments committee was then appointed by ballot to revise the stile of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house i d at 55053 madison the committee on style reported out the language now found in article ii section 4 i d at 600 state ratifying conventions et mr wilson the last observation respects th judges it is said that if they are to decide against the law one house will imp each them and the other will convict them i hope gentlemen will show how this can ppen for bare supposition ought not to be admitted as proof the judges are to be imp eached because they decide an act null and void that was made in defiance of the c onstitution what house of representatives would dare to impeach or senate to commit judges for the performance of their duty ii t he debates in the several state conventions on the adoption of the federal constitution elliot 478 pennsylvania december 4 1787 elliot ed 1888 mr iredell mr chairman i was going to observe that this clause vesting the power of impeachment in the house of repres entatives is one of the greatest securities for due execution of all public offices ev ery government require s it every man ought to be amenable for his conduct and there are persons so proper to complain of the public officers as the representatives of the pe ople at large the representatives of the people know the feelings of the people at large and will be ready enough to make complaints if this power were not provided the consequences might be fatal it will be not only the means of punishing misconduct but it will prevent misconduct man in public office who knows that there is tribuna l to punish him may be ready to deviate from his duty but if he knows there is tri bunal for that purpose although he may be man of principle the very terror of punishment will perhaps deter him iv lliot 32 north carolina july 24 1788 mr maclaine i recollect it was men tioned by one gentleman that petty officers might be impeached it appears to sir to be the most horrid ignorance to suppose that every officer however trifling his office is to be impeached for every petty offence and that every man who should be injured by such petty officers could get redress but by this mode of impeachment at the seat of government at the distance of several hundred miles whither he would be obliged to summon great number of witnesses i hope every gentleman in this committee must see plainl that impeachments cannot extend to inferior officers of the united states such constr uction cannot be supporte d without departure from the usual and wellknown practice both in england and america but this clause empowers the house of representatives which is the grand inquest of the union at large to bring great offenders to justice it will be kind of state trial for high crimes and misdemeanors iv lliot 34344 north carolina july 25 1788httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98894crs6 mr madison the danger then cons ists merely in thisthe president can displace from office man whose merits require that he shoul d be continued in it what will be the motives which the president can feel for such abuse of his power and the restraints that operate to prevent it in the first place he will be impeachable by this house before the senate for such an act of maladministration for i contend that the wanton removal of meritorious officer would subject him to impeachment and removal from his own high trust iv lliot 380 debate during the first congress june 16 1789 also in 1 nnals of congress 498
