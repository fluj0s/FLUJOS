at glance the us department of agriculture usda carries out its widely varie d responsibili ties through approximately 30 separate internal agencies staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of th agriculture budget function hence spending for usda is not synonymous wit h spending for farmers nor with the agriculture appropriations bill which include s funds for nonusda programs notably the food and drug administration fda usda outlays for the most recently complete d fiscal year fy1999 were 639 billion by far the largest outl ay within

benefits authorized by the law currently accounting for the vast majority of usda mandatory spending are the food stamp program which accounts for nearly onehalf of total usd mandatory spending child nutrition programs the farm commodity price and income support programs the federal crop insurance program and the conservation reserve program crp although they have mandatory status the food and nutrition programs ar funded by an annual appropriation base d on projected spending needs supplemental appropriations generally are made if and when these estimates fall short of required spending an annual ap propriation is also made to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for losses it incurs in financi ng the commodity support programs and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30201crs3 various other programs it finances historically the farm commodity suppor t programs were larger portion of the usda budget than they are currently spending levels among these programs were erratic and unpredictable making total usda spending highly variable some of this unpredictability was lessened by th enactment of the 1996 farm bill which fixes the level of spending on direct payments to program crop pro ducers and longer ties these payments to market conditions however emergency provisions in both the fy1 999 omnibus appropriations actpl 105277 and the fy2000 agriculture

commodity programs farm disaster payments and certain farm export and conservation programs are funded through usdas commodit credit corporation ccc the ccc is revolving financing mechanism withi n usda through which it supports more than dozen specified com modities including grains cotton milk sugar peanuts and tobacco the formulas that determin payments under these programs are determined by statutes with benefits provided to any qualifying producer 3 the ccc receives its annual funding from 30 billion line of credit with th us treasury therefore the ccc does not require an annual appropriation per to fund its financing activities however because ccc outst anding borrowing cannot exceed 30 billion the annual appropriations bill usually contains funding for reimbursement of ccc net realized losses so that the ccc can repay its debt to the treasury and not exhaust its borrowing authority this reimbursement is categorized as man datory expense and is not included toward the discretionary spendin g allocation given to the appropriations subcommittees as general rule the annual appropriation request for ccc is not reflection of how much ccc spending will be in the appropriation year but rather how much ccc losses were in the most recently completed fiscal year ie the fy200 0 appropriation would cover fy1998 losses however usda requested and pl 10678 provides 14368 billion to the ccc for fy2000 an amount that more thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30201crs9 covers previous losses of this amount usda estimates that 93 billion wil l reimburse the ccc for its actual fy1998 operating losses and 5 billion is required to partially cover anticipated fy1999 losses so that th ccc does not deplete its 30 billion line of credit with the treasury without an appropriation in fy2000 t compensate for some of the fy1999 ccc spending usda estimates that cc c borrowing authority would be exhausted before the end of fy2000 ccc spending in fy1999 was 184 billion the highest level in 12 years mainly because far m commodit prices have been depressed which prompted the authorization of nearly 6 billion in cccfunded emergency incomesupport and disas ter assistance payments in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act see crs report 98952 the emergency agricult ural provisions in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act for more details ccc spending in

the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas ris k management agency rma it offers basically free catastrophic insurance t producers who grow an insurable crop producers who opt for this coverage hav the opportunity to purch ase additional insurance coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insuranc companies that have their program losses reinsured by usda there are basically four sources of federal expenditures for the crop insurance program usda absorbs large percentage of the program losses compensates the reinsured companies for portion of their delivery expenses subsidizes th premium paid by participating producers and pays the salaries and expenses of it s administering agency within usda the program losses premium subsidy an d delivery expense reimbursement to the private co mpanies are mandatory expenditures funded through usdas federal crop insur ance fund which receives such sums as are necessary annually to fund the program the salaries and expenses of the rma are discretionary expense and are dependent on annual appropriations the administration estimates th at the program will

advance funds requested by the administration for the food stamp program fo r fy2001 in case appropriations are not enacted prior to the beginning of that year and 100 million contingency re serve fund for food stamps in pl 10678 instead of the 1 billion reserve fund requested by the administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30201crs22 these are commodities acquired for farm support or surplus removal reasons rather than6 explicitly for domestic food program use this provision originated in the senate and was intended to cover the cost of senat e7 proposed 24 million increase in spending for the wic program the bonus provision wa s included in the conference agreement but not the wic increasefor the food stamp nd related programs the administration budget proposed 273 billion the house and senatepassed bills recommended 216 billion pl 10678 provides 1 196 billion for food stamp expenses which is 500 millio n below the original request and refl ects reestimate of the needs of the program 2 100 million for the food stamp contingency reserve instead of the 1 billio n proposed by the administration 3 advance funding for fy2001 compared with 48 billion proposed by the administration and 4 127 billion the same as the adminis tration and the house and senate bills for nutrition assistance for puert rico pl 10678 allows 98 million to be spent on emergency food assistanc program mandatory commodities splitting the difference between the 97 million in the house bill and 99 million in the senate bill conferees deleted senate language that would have required the economic research service to conduct study within 6 months of enactment on the reasons for the decline in food stamp participation and to identify any obstacles that households with eligible children have experienced in obtaining food stamps major policy changes were proposed by the administration for child nutrition programs including the school lunch breakfast child and adult care summer and special milk programs pl 10678 provides 9554 billion for thes programs close to the administration request for 9565 billion over 90 of th appropriated funds are expected to be used to fund the school lunch program 548 billion the school breakfast program 142 billion and the child and adult car food program 176 billion the level in pl 10678 for child nutrition programs 956 billion is about 377 million more than projected fy1999 spending for these programs and is 6 million less tha n was recommended by the senate appropriations bill and 7 million more than the h ouse appropriation measure the difference is the result of the decision to provide 7 million for the school breakfast pilot project instead of nothing proposed by the house and 13 million proposed by the senate pl 10678 also continues language originally added in fy1999 appropriations requiring the usda to use socalled bonus commodities to help make up th e6 difference between the per meal commodity assistance rate mandated for schoo l lunches and the requirement that not less than 1 2 of federal school lunch assistance be in the form of commodities for several years the per lunch commodit reimbursement did not total to an amount equal to 12 of federal school lunch aid and the usda had to use child nutrition funds to buy commodities to make up the difference last year the congress added provision to fy1999 agricultur appropriations law requiring the secretary to use bonus commodities whe n necessa ry to meet the 12 requirement this resulted in savings for the usd projected at 40 million because they could use commodities already acquired for farm support or surplus removal reasons to meet this obligation house and senate7 negotiat ors trying to forge an acceptable budget package that merges the severa l remaining fy2000 appropriations bills reportedly h ave agreed to make permanent thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30201crs23 12 solution so they can use the 55 million in savings to offset some of the new spending in the consolidated budget package the administration proposed 4105 billion for the special supplementa l nutrition program for women infants and children wic in fy2000 pl 10678 funds wic at 4032 billion which is 108 million more than the amount provided in fy1999 and 735 million less than the administrati on request the senatepassed bill would have funded wic at 4038 billion or about 33 million more than th house bill responding to renewed pressure to permit natural sugar contained i n fruits to be exempted f rom the sugar limits established for cereals approved for wic program use the conference report to pl 10678 contains language directing that usda make exception to the current sugar limit neither the house nor senate bills approved the administration request to fund the farmers market nutritio n program fmnp from commodity assistance program ca p funds instead of wic funds and continue to require that 10 million of wic fundin g be used within 45 days of enactm ent for the fmnp the fmnp provides wic participants in some area s with vouchers to buy fresh foods at farmers markets the house and senate bill s assumed that there will be 125 million in unexpended or carryover funds fro m fy1999 available for the program in fy2000 and that this together with th appropriated funds will be sufficient to maintain monthly average wic caseload of 74 million participants the administration propose d to fund commodity assistance programs caps at total of 1552 million for fy2000 20 million of which was to go for th fmnp described above the remainder would have provided 902 million for the commodity supplemental food program csfp 42 million more than the fy1999 appropriation and 45 million f or state administrative grants for the emergency food
