divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972private crude oils stocks and the strategic petroleum reserve debate summary periodically since the inception of the strategic petroleum reserve spr in 1975 debate has occurred concerning its optimal size in the 108thcongress the house has passed energy legislation h r 6 which would require the spr to be filled to its current capacity of approximately 700 million barrels and would authorize funds to further expand the capacity of the reserve to 1 billion barrels analysis of the spr issue has been carried out in benefitcost framework in which benefits the avoided cost to the na tional economy of supply disruption are set against the real resource costs associated with investing in the spr the role of the privately held stock of crude oil has been largely static in these analyses the data show however that private stock behavior has been changing industry holds less crude oil and has less capacity to hold crude oil than decade ago these changes reflect decade long strategy of reducing operating costs to remain competitive however oil markets face gr eater exposure to supply disruption today because our dependence on imported crude oil has risen substantially since 1992 the effectiveness of the spr in providing security from crude oil supply disruptions may be primarily function of its size but may also be dependent on the underlying stocks of crude oil held by the private sector the international energy agency iea has studied the behavior of crude oil stocks in the us since 1989 it finds that our total stocks measured as days of net imports that can be replaced by stock drawdown have been declining this trend results from the interaction of increasing import dependency the essentially constant size of the spr over the period and the dec lining size of privately held stocks the iea concludes that with change in any of these factors the us will longer be able to replace ninety days of net imports from domestic stocks in 2006 because the iea focuses on total reserves its analysis may overstate the ability of us stocks to mitigate oil s upply disr uptions this is b ecause not all privately held oil stocks can be drawn upon without di srupting the functioning of the system itself once these lower operational inventor levels are considered the thinness of privately held stocks is apparent as result the ability of privately held stocks to provide buffer to supply disruptions is reduced this report will be update d as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972contents background 1 b n f i t s c s t so ft h p r

expanding the us strategic petroleum reserve ornltm2000179 november 30 2000 p 20 the report is available at the oak ridge national laboratory website httppzl1edornlgovprivate crude oil stocks and the strategic petroleum reserve debate background the energy policy and conservation act of 19751authorized the creation of the strategic petroleum reserve spr for the storage of up to 1 billion barrels of crude oil the federal government began fillin g the spr in 1977 mostly with imported oil by 1992 the spr held 575 million barrels of crude oil and in may 2003 over decade later holds approximately 600 million b arrels in reserve since the creation of the spr in 1975 debate has p eriodically focused on the optimal size of the spr specifically whether it should be expande d to 700 million or 1 billion barrels of oil in the 108thcongress legislation passed by the house hr 6 would require the spr to be filled to its current capacity of 700 million barrels of crude oil and provides funding of 15 billion to expand the capacity of the spr to 1 billion barrels2 worldwide concern over the unstable nature of the crude oil market has led other nations to establish emergency oi l stocks as part of international energy administration iea agreements to manage supply disruptions for example at the end of 1999 japan held 315 million barrels of crude oil oecd europe held 325 million barrels south korea held 43 million barrels and taiwan held 13 million barrels the us is the only country in this group where security stocks are totally government owned in japan south kor ea and oecd europe the total stock is divided between government and mandate d private stocks in taiwan the stock is completely mandated private3 although decisions on the size of the spr and private stocks are made through very different decision processes they ar linked by the fact that both may be useful in times of supply disruption when supply is disrupted prices rise quickly through active futures spot and product markets h igher prices give businesses an incentive to bring product to market which mitigat potential physical shortages giving policy makers time to consider an spr drawdown if businesses have reducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972crs2 4ibidavailable inventories to cut costs their ability to play this role is diminished for this reason the size and availability of private stocks of crude oil is relevant to debates over the optimal size of the spr as well as wh and under what circumstances to use the spr benefitscosts of the spr the case for the existence of the spr is usually framed in benefitcost framework4the benefits are typically defined s avoided costs which are then set against the real resource or opportunity cos ts of maintaining the reserve the same approach is followed for considering mar ginal adjustments to the reserve but with focus on the additional value of avoided c osts implied by reserve expansion set against the marginal resource cost of ex panding the reserve although debate on the size of the spr is normally framed in terms of millions of barrels of crude oil held another measure consistent with interna tional energy agency iea measurement is the number of days of net imports for which the reserve can substitute although the primary focus of spr usage is concerned with international oil market disruptions the spr could also be used in times of emergency stemming from domestic supply disruption the benefit of maintaining the spr lies in avoiding the effects of severe oil price spikes and shortages that might re sult from supply disruptions significant rapid spikes in the price of crude oil and act ual shortages can have damaging effects on the macroeconomic performance of the economy reduced economic output leading to increased unemployment and reduction in the rate of economic growth are possible consequences in terms of the b alance of payments higher oil prices will mean greater expense for oil imports causing the balance of trade to deteriorate the costs of the spr are much like those of other public investment projects the capital cost of the reserve andor expans ion of the reserve costs associated with providing for the draw of the reserve the operations and management cost and the cost of the oil stored in the reserve are all part of total cost the cost of the stored oil is real budget cost in the year of acquisition to be recouped later when and if the reserve is drawn down proponents of the spr see the existence as well as the use of the reserve contributing to stability in the oil market the existence of the reserve could deter some politicallyor economically motivated disruptions if the reserve is drawn upon it might allow affected economies time to make other adjustments to the new market conditions including diplomacy which might remedy or mitigate the underlying cause of the disruption the existence andor use of the reserve might calm uncertain oil markets and dampen the effect of underlying market imbalances leading to moderated price spike those opposed to market intervention see less benefit associated with the spr and its use they believe that the freely functioning market can mitigate mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972crs3 5care must be exercised in evaluating private stocks of crude oil the energy information administration in the june 13 2003 weekly pet roleum status report figure 2 page 7 reports that although the five year average monthly holdings of c rude oil in 2002 and 2003 in the private sector are between 280 and 350 million barrels it would be incorrect to assume that at any time there was that much oil available for drawdown the system has lower operational inventory level of 270 million barrels this value represents the oil that is being held or in transit to refineries and bulk terminals as well as oil in pipelines this oil cannot be accessed for emergency use it represents kind of fill in the system which must be present for the continuous operation of the production process from well head to consumption private stocks available for emergency drawdown should be considered to be the total stocks held netof the lower operational inventory levels reserves held in the spr are in principle fully available for extr action and use therefore stocks of crude oil held in the spr are not directly comparable to total stocks held in the private sector the correct comparison is between barrels of crude oil held in the spr and the netlevel of private stocks this observation substantially reduces the effective private reserve stock levels in the us in terms of their ability to replace net importsdisruptions and that government interven tion in market processes is unlikely to enhance resource allocation in this view friendly suppliers might expand short term output in case of disruption and higher prices will allocate available supplies to their most pressing needs minimizing the effect of the supply disruption the spr is not standalone policy for energy security in the longer term diversifying energysources and improving energy efficiency engaging in productive dialogue with oil producers and enhancing the price responsiveness of consumer demand are all important measures in the s horter term encouraging fuel switching capability and demand reduction can be useful energy security measures role of private stocks the implicit assumption underlying the spr debate appears to be that the stock of private oil reserves held by the us pet roleum industry is known unchanging and available to reach the market during suppl disruption to put the spr expansion issue in proper context the optimal size of the spr might be considered as part of the total stock of reserves the nation has to draw upon in times of emergency5 consider the following extreme hypothetical cases if the private sector were abletechnically and economically to run the il production system with zero inventories or reserve stocks every world oil market supply disruption would be quickly transmitted to the domestic consumer market leading to immediate shortages and price spikes in this case large reserv coupled with quick response usage rules might be required for market stability at t he other extreme if the oil industry found it either technologically or economically useful to hold years worth of supply in reserve which it was willing to draw down as needed there might be little need for any government reserve if in reality we are somewhere between these extremes so might be the requirement for the spr and as corollary if the capability of privately held stocks varies so must the capability of the spr if our overall ability to meet market challenges is to remain constanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972crs4 6stocks of refined petroleum products were also lower than the previous year by margins ranging from 2 percent to 30 percent up to date information on petroleum stocks is published in the weekly petroleum status reports available at wwweiadoegov 7iea data provided by william c ramsay deputy executive director iea fossil fuel future presentation at crs may 22 2003 8table 1 also shows that the us has increas ed its imports of petroleum products mostly gasoline depending on the nature of future mar ket disruptions the us could import more petroleum products in lieu of importing crude oil figure 1 us oil stocks 19892002in fact the behavior of private levels of c rude oil stocks have not been constant they have been declining crude oil stocks excluding the spr stood at 2851 million barrels on may 16 2003 one year ago the stock stood at 3256 million barrels which implies reduction of 124 pe rcent in stocks held by the nations oil industry6figure 1 computed by the iea shows the behavior of total us oil stocks measured as days of net imports7 figure 1 shows decade long decline in the ability of industry stocks along with the spr to replace imported oil several forces are at work in figure 1 f i r s t the increasing dependence of the us on imported oil makes stock of any size less capable of replacing imports even if the actual stocks shown in the figure were constant days of imports would decline if the quantity of oil we import rises table 1 shows that net imports of crude oil have increased from approximately 57 million barrels per day on average in 1989 to pproximately 90 million barrels per day on average in 20028this increased dependency has c ontributed to the downward trend offigure 1

administration monthly energy review march 2003 p 4 3 secondly as noted above in the short ter m stocks of privately held oil have declined figure 2 shows the behavior of us stocks measured in billions of barrels in the longer term from 1973 2002 the figure shows that nonspr crude oil stocks have experienced long term decline since their peak in the mid 1970s even though in the last two decades imports and consumption have risen figure 2 also suggests some increased volatility in the level of privately held stocks since the mid 1990s this behavior might be expected if firms were op timizing their inventory holdings additions to stoc k when prices of crude oil are low and draw downs from inventory when prices are h igh enhance profit opportunities9 trends similar to those observed in crude oil have also occurred in petroleum products the petroleum industry research f oundation inc calculates that finished gasoline stocks fell from 30 day stock in 1985 to an 1819 day stock in 2001 this translated into 41 million barrel decline in gasoline stocks over the period an additional complication is that gasoline i s not as fungible as it once was differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972crs6 10refining concentration and industry dynamics petroleumindustry research foundation inc april 2002 available at the web site wwwpirincorg 11storage at refineries is not the only location for stocks of crude oil additional stocks might be engaged in the transportation and distribution process at any of several levels figure 2 behavior of us stocks 19732002 measured in billions of barrelsblends of gasoline to satisfy differing air pollution standards in various parts of the country put further strain on system that is reducing stocks10 finally not only privately held stocks have declined but the privately held capacity to hold stocks has also declined in 1990 the capacity of refineries in the us to hold stocks of crude oil was 204 million barrels by 2002 this capacity had declined to 1833 million barrels reduction of over 10 percent11this decline in capacity coupled with the decline in held stocks suggests that the industry might be attempting to reduce the vel of inventory as way of managing cost much of us industry has adopted just in time invent ory techniques as way to lower costs and enhance efficiency it would be consistent with this trend for the petroleum sector to follow similar strategyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972crs7 12data included in the weekly petroleum status report for the week ending may 302003 available at the energy information administration website wwweiadoegov figure 3 break even relationshipimplications of current stock status figure 3 represents break even analysis of the relationship between total stocks of us crude oil and time assuming that the nation has security target of ninety days of import substitution consistent with iea targets the iea data are based on total stocks of crude oil which ignores the lower operational inventory constraint for industry and therefore ma overstate the ability of combined stocks to actually meet emergency needs analysis by the iea offers the tentative conclusion that us ability to maintain target of ninety days of import replacement with current trends continuing and change in current government policy will end in 2006 an increase in the spr would push this date further into the future while an acceleration of private sector stock draw down would bring the date closer to the present time additionally the figure also implies that if the spr fill were expanded to 700 million barrels or even 1 billion barrels the increase in security that we might receive from enhanced levels of import replacement could be only tempor ary the underlying decline of private sector stocks and increasing dependenc on imported oil will also influence our susceptibility to supply disruptions in the future although the iea analysis suggests veloping problem for the us in terms of replacing imported oil in times of emergency the real situation may be even more challenging than the iea analysis suggests energy information administration data shows that in the fall of 2002 and again in early 2003 private stocks of crude oil were reduced to the lower operational inventory levels discussed earlier at those times there were additional crude oil reserves i n the private sector in practical sense12 the more the private sector economizes on crude oil stock holdings the more likelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31972crs8 it is that the lower operational inventory c onstraint will become effective during market disruption limiting the ability of industry to meet consumer demand conclusion while private sector stocks exist primarily because of the economic and technological requirements of the oil i ndustry they have also served public purpose private stocks have at least partially played the role of public good they have provided benefits to the domestic oi l market as whole as well as to policy makers as they faced difficult decisions about when and if to draw on the spr private sector stocks are usually drawn down first with market forces guiding the decision decisions on the optimal size of the spr may need to take into account changes in industry practices which might ffect the ability of private stocks of crude oil to play this role in the future net stocks of privately held crude oil in many ways the first buffer between an international oil supply disruption and u s consumer markets were reduced to very low levels during the recent disruptions to the oil markets industry holds less stock in 2003 than it did decade ago even though us dependence on crude oil imports has risen the spr currently holds approximately 600 million barrels of crude oil which could be used in supply emergency t he effect of the rising dependence on imports and the reduced availability of private stocks implies that 600 million barrels of crude oil translates into fewer days of replaced reserves
