miss ile defense agency would perform missile tracking and target discrimination for missile defense objectives the sbirshigh program has breached nunnmccurdy cost growth limits severa l times resulting in several program restructur ings this is the final edition of this report satellite early warning systems the united states began developing early warning satellite systems in the 1950s to alert the national command authority to foreign missile launches the current series is called the defense support pr ogram dsp the first d sp satellite wa s launched in november 1970 22 have been launched to date most recen tly in february 2004 the final dsp was delivered to the air force in may 2005 for launch later in the year each dsp can operate for up to 10 years1 four satellites reportedly are needed for full operational capability six satellites reportedl were operating in january 20012 dsp satellites built by rthrop grumman space technology which was formerly trw space and electronics use infrared sensors to detect the heat of fuel exhausts associated with missile launches sensors on the satellites also can detect nuclear bursts associated with the detonation of nuclear weapons february 2001 general accountinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21148crs2 3 us general accounting office defense ac quisitions spacebased infrared systemlow at risk of missing initial deployment date

geostationary orbit geo exists 35800 kilome ters above the equator satellite in geo maintains fixed position relative to point on earth three or four properly spaced geo satellites can view the entire globe except for the polar regions heo orbits can provide coverage of the polar regions classic heo orbit called molniya orbit after the soviet communications satellite system that first utilized it has an apogee the highest point of the orbit of approximately 40000 kilometers and perigee the lowest point of about 500 kilometers giving the orbit an elliptical shape with an inclination of about 63 degrees the angle at which it intersects the equator such an orbit allows satellite to linger or dwell over the northern hemisphere for several hours per orbit viewing parts of the globe not observable from geo dod reportedly uses this type of orbit for classified satellitesoffice gao now the government accountability office report3 recounted dods attempts to build replacement for dsp over more than two decades none of the proposed replacement programs the advanced warning system in the early 1980s the boost surveillance and tracking system in the late 1980s the followon early warning system in the early 1990s and the alert cate and report missiles system in the mid 1990s reached fru ition due to immature technolog high cost and affordability issues according to gao instead enhancements were made to the dsp series for example dsp was designed to detect launche s of strategic long range missiles such as intercontinental ballistic missiles however the need to detect short range tactical missiles such as scud was highlighted dur ing the 19901991 persian gulf war in 1995 dod added the alert attack and launch earl reporting to theater system to dsp satellites to augment their theater missile warning capabilities dsptype satellites are intrinsically part of any effort to develop missile defense system because they provide the first warning that foreign missile has been launched during the missiles boost phase but dsp also serves other objectives since the 1980s there has been interest in developing system explicitly to support missile defense one that can track missiles as they progre ss along their flight pa th the midcourse phase detect and track warheads once they are deployed from the missile and cue weapon systems to attack the missiles or warh eads concept for constellation of many satellites in low earth orbit called brilliant eyes was veloped during the 1980s under the auspices of the strategic defense initiative office sdio following 1994 dod study on how best to meet the nations early warning needs brilliant eyes was transferred to the air force which was given respons ibility to build an integrated spacebased infrared system sbirs with satellites in several orbits brilliant eyes was renamed the space and missile tracking system and became the low earth orbit component of sbirs later it was renamed sbirslow the system to replace dsp was named sbirshigh consisting of satellites in geostationary orbit geo wh ere dsp satellites are placed and sensors on other dod sate llites in highly elliptical orbits heo4 in 2001 sbirslow was shifted back to the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo which was sdios successor and is now the missile defens agency that action was taken to stress that sbirslows main purpose is to suppor t ballistic missile fense the satellite program has since been renamed again and is now the space tracking and surveillance system stsshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21148crs3 sbirshigh purpose design and cost estimate sbirshigh was designed to perform four missions missile warning missile defense technical intelligence and battlespace characterization observing and reporting on military activities on battlefield the plan was for the system to consist of four operational geo satellites plus ground spare sensors on two classified dod satellites in heo groundba sed mission control station mcs and groundbased rela stations mcs achieved initial operational capability in january 2002 using the existing dsp satellites in 1996 aviation week space technology described the technical capabilities of sbirshigh november 18 1996 p 23 that were expected at that time reportedly it would have high speed scanning sensors and staring sensors after the scanning sensor detected launch it would cue the staring nsor to observe the event and provide more detailed data dsp satellites by contrast reportedly have only scanning sensors dsp takes 4050 seconds to detect missile launch and deter mine its course while sbirs high was being designed to make those terminations and rela warnings to ground forces in 1020 seconds the extent to which these technical design characteristics are still planned is unclear from the open literature lockheed martinnorthrop grumman t eam won 216 billion contract to build sbirshigh in 1996 in september 2002 dod increased the contract to 418 billion which does not include the cost of three of the five geo satellites dods selected acquisition report for the quarter ending september 2005 httpwwwacqosd milaraamsar2005sepsstpdf show s the original cost estimate for sbirshigh as 368 billion in fy1995 dollars 415 billion in current year dollars ie adjusted for inflation comp ared with new estimate of 901 b illion in fy 1995 dollars 1064 billion in current year dollars issues the sbirshigh program is controversial because of cost growth and schedule slippage caused by technical cha llenges that have been encountered in developing the sensors and satellites in the fy2002 dod appropriations act congress denied all procurement funding 94 million had been requested because it felt more research and development rd was re quired it added 40 million to the 395 million requested for rd the house appr opriations committees report on the fy2002 dod appropriations act hrept 107298 p 140 c ited findings by gao that the program was facing serious hardware and software design problems including sensor jitter inadequate infrared sensitivity and stray sunlight the gao report is classified space news reported on january 7 2002 p 14 that the programs cost estima had grown from 19 billion to 45 billion and the first launch slipped from 2002 to 2006 space news attributed the cost increase to technical problems including software development faulty cost estimates budget erosi on and schedule slippage in december 2001 dod made the first of several notifications to congress that sbirshigh breached one of the two nunnmccurdy cost growth limits 15 program acquisition unit cost pauc cost increase limit which requires notification to congress or 25 limit where dod mu st notify congress and certify that the program is essential to national security that alternatives will provide equal or greater military capability at less cost that new cost estimates are reasonable and that the program management structure is adequate the first breach violated the 25 limit andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21148crs4 dod issued the required certification on may 2 2002 the air force restructured the program dod decided to pay for the first two geo satellites then scheduled for launch in fy2006 and fy2007 using research deve lopment test and evaluation rdte funds the remaining three sa tellites would be purchased w ith procurement funds with twoyear gap between the first two and the last three may 2003 report of the defense science bo ard and air force scientific advisory board httpwwwacqos dmildsbreportssp acepdf cr iticized early program management of sbirshigh and took cau tious attitude concerning whether the restructured program would succeed an october 2003 gao report gao0448 concluded the program remained at substantial risk of cost and schedule increases the program experienced further setbacks deliv ery of the first sbirshigh sensor for launch on one of the heo sate llites slipped to august 2004 because of electromagnetic interference between the sensor and other sp acecraft equipment the second heo sensor was delivered in september 2005 launch of the first geo sa tellite slipped by two years that launch is now expect ed in 2008 dod tified congress of additional nunn mccurdy breaches in june 2004 of the 15 limit and march 2005 15 limit and in july 2005 informed congress than an independe nt program assessment concluded that the program exceeded the 25 limit inside the air force august 5 2005 dods selected acquisition report for the period ending ptember 2005 indicates that the program exceeded the 15 nunnmccurdy limit during that reporting period as noted above the current cost estimate for the program is 1064 billion in current year dollars according to media accounts eg aerospace daily december 16 2005 p 1 dod sent the required nunnmccurdy certif ication to congress on december 12 2005 while dod still plans to buy the first two geo satellites it will buy at most one more the funds that would have been spent for the fourth and fifth geo satellites reportedly will be used instead to design an alternative syst em using stateoft heart technologies fy2006 budget dod requested 756 million the fy2006 dod authorization bill pl 109163 provides full funding the fy2006 dod appropriations act pl 109 148 cut 50 million due to excessive program growth the senate had approved 100

space tracking and surveillance system stss previously sbirslow is designed to support missile defense management of the program was transferred from the air force back to the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo the successor to sdio see earlier discussion of brilliant eyes to emphasize that missile defense is its primary objective bmdo is now the missile defense agency mda fo r more on missile defense see crs report rl31111 missile defense the current debate by steven hildreth the missile defense system is envisioned as layered defense that can attack missiles or warheads in three different pha ses of flight boos t launch midcourse enroute to target when warheads are deployed from the missile and terminal after reentry the goal of an operational stss is to track missiles through all three phases discriminate between warheads and decoys tr ansmit data to other systems that will be used to cue radars and provide intercept ndovers and provide data for intercept hitkillhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21148crs5 5 the first launch was scheduled for 2006 but c ongress directed dod to accelerate the schedule to 2002 the defense science board conclude d that 2002 was technically feasible but 2004 would represent more efficient approach aerospace daily oct 3 1996 p 18 space news sept 1622 1996 p 10 the date then slipped ba ck to 2006 primarily due to funding issues 6 authorizers blast dod for smts management aerospace daily aug 8 1996 p 207 7 ferster warren sbirs demonstration projects terminated space news feb 15 1999 p 1assessments tracking missiles during the midcourse phase is more difficult than during boost because the missile is longer firing its engines and hence does not have strong infrared heat signature making it necessary to track cold object against the cold background of space similarly tracking warh eads after they have been deployed and discriminating between warheads and decoys is technically challenging task cost estimates are problematic because ther is final system architecture and the schedule is in flux in its february 2001 report gao reported that dod had estimated the lifecycle cost for stss then sbirslow through fy2022 at 118 billion the house appropriations committee reported in late 2001 hrep t 107298 p 250 that the programs life cycle cost had grown from 10 billion to over 23 billion in march 2005 gao reported gao05243 that dods estima for the program between 2002 and 2011 is approximately 45 billion life cycle cost was not provided two industry teams were chosen in 1999 fo r program definition and risk reduction pdrr spectrum astro northrop gru mman and trw raytheon dod was expected to select one of the teams for the next pha in mid2002 and the satellites were to have been launched between 2006 and 20105 in the april 2002 restructuring see below dod merged the teams northrop gru mman space technology formerly trw space electronics is the prime contractor and spectrum astro later acquired by general dynamics is major subcontractor for building the satellites issues this program has gone through seve ral name changes making it difficult to track congress began ex pressing concern about it in 1996 when it was known as the space and missile tracking system particularly in terms of program management6 indications of technical and funding problems publicly emerged in 1999 when dod cancelled contracts with trw and boeing to build and launch three prototype demonstration satellite s because of significant cost growth7 in the early 2000s when its name was sbirslow questions arose as to whether it was vital to missile defense system views vary some assert that ssile defense cannot be achieved without such system while others argue that there ar alternatives such as groundbased radars to some extent the answer may depend on the nature of the threat the missile defense system is expected to defeat eg number of incoming warheads or sophistication of countermeasur radars have been used for early warning of missile launches for decades and already are envisioned as part of the missile defense system to provide effective coverage the radars might have to be based not only in the united states but in other countries radars in england and greenland are part of the early warning system on which the united states re lies today the question is whether ground based or seabased radars can substitute for spacebased syst em especially now that the united states is longer bound by numer ical and geographic limitations imposed on radars that are part of an antiballistic missile abm system by the 1972 abm treaty httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21148crs6 in its november 2001 report on the fy2002 dod appropriations bill hr 3338 hrept 107298 p 250 the house appropriations co mmittee cited an internal dod study that indicated groundbased radars are viable lower cost and lower risk alternative technical challenges continued in its february 2001 repor t cited earlier gao found that five of six critical satellite technologie s were too immature to ensure they would be ready when needed the hous appropriations committee in its november 2001 report cited above expressed concern that the prog rams life cycle cost had grown from 10 billion to over 23 billion conseque ntly the committee zeroed funding 385 million was requested and instead created satellite sensor tec hnology program 250 million and ground sensor technology pr ogram 75 million as an alternative conferees approved the 250 milli on for satellite sensor tec hnology but allowed the secretary of defense to spend it either on sbirslow or new technology it was spent on sbirslow restructuring plan was submitted to congress on april 15 2002 system consisting of 2030 sa tellites had been envi sioned with the first launch in 2006 the restructuring plan called for completing two legacy demonstration satellites that had been partially built as part of the 1999 pl an and launching them in 2006 and 2007 new technologies would be introduced in futu re satellites and tw new demonstration satellites would be unched beginning in 2010 in august 2002 dod awarded northrop grumman space technologies an 869 million co ntract to complete the two legacy satellites develop ground syst em and conduct preliminary engi neering analysis of the new demonstration satellites with options for building eight operational satellites the programs name was changed to space trackin g and surveillance system stss mda modified the plan in late 2002 after it reduced stss funding gao criticized many of those changes in may 2003 report gao03597 stss is proceeding in series of bienni blocks according to mdas fy2006 budget documents stss block 2006 is the unch of the two lega cy satellites block 2008 is an improvement of the ground syst em and in block 2012 operational satellites would be integrated into the program block 2010 which ppeared in fy2005 budget documents without descriptiv detail is shown at zero in mdas fy2006 documents march 2005 gao report gao05243 states th at the program content of block 2010 and beyond is classified and thus funding for block 2010 could be in the classified budget gao reported that its review of stss activities in 2004 did not find any indication that the two legacy satellites would not be able to launch on schedule fy2006 budget according to dods fy2006
