visit to london january 2729 classified by ambassador louis susman for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf summary we are delighted to welcome you back to london for the conferences on afghanistan and yemen this week pm brown is our strong ally on both issues despite some early difficulties in coordinating conference details with us especially in regard to yemen he assured that they were mistakes made in good faith and that his team is now sensitized to the need for close consultation brown genuinely wants the afghanistan conference to result in substantial movement on our agenda with kabul and the international community but he also likely hopes to burnish his image as world leader with the british voting public uk general elections must take place by june most believe they will be held on may 6 with his labour party trailing in the polls by some 10 to 13 points brown faces an uphill battle but it will be battle largely on domestic issues afghanistan is not the lightening rod for labour that iraq was in the uks 2005 polls though public support is tepid the opposition conservatives support uk military involvement and will continue to do so 2 cnf your visit is an opportunity to underscore the importance of progress in afghanistan to international security and demonstrate the continuing value of the usuk special relationship your personal involvement in northern ireland issues is wellknown shaun woodward is looking forward to discussing the latest developments with you my staff very much appreciates that you have set aside valuable time to meet them the embassy team is really looking forward to it i also suggest you tape segmant for the widelyviewed andrew marr sunday morning show end summary uk gearing up for elections 3 cnf our contacts are confident pm brown will call for uk general elections on may 6 the same day as local elections are already scheduled pm brown easily survived an early january challenge to his labour leadership by few disgruntled mps but it highlighted party divisions and weakened his standing in the polls those divisions remain and have on occasion caused disconnect between the foreign office and the prime ministers office however while the election will largely be fought on domestic issues brown is touting his leadership in preventing an economic meltdown and restoring growth the preelection atmosphere affects the approach of both major parties to global challenges and their relationship with us 4 cnf since labour and the conservatives largely agree on the importance of continued uk engagement in afghanistan electoral differences over foreign policy will appear on two fronts history and resources public hearings in the ongoing inquiry into the uks highly unpopular involvement in iraq have bitten labour hard as members of the brown government defend their decisions under former pm blair blair is expected to appear before the public inquiry january 29 pm brown has volunteered to appear himself prior to elections to defend his own decisions on resources and his advice to blair while chancellor of the exchequer under blair resources for foreign affairs and defense will be an electoral theme as conservatives promise unspecified budget cuts to reduce the deficit both parties are committed to increasing official development assistance to 07 of gdp in line with the millenium development goals pakistan and afghanistan will remain major focus of assistance under conservative government that could even increase but since both parties accept the need for deficit reduction funds will likely be scarcer for all projects defense or civilian in coming years both labour and conservative leaders agree on the need for strategic defense review shortly after the election to analyze defense priorities and to match resources to these priorities foreign police priorities as elections approach 5 cnf afghanistan and pakistan are key priorities for pm brown despite tepid public support brown pledged additional troops ahead of the presidents december announcement which brown strongly welcomed brown is open about the fact that he would like other nato allies and the london 00000159 002 of 002 afghans to assume greater share of combat operations stressing that the us uk and handful of others have borne the brunt of the fighting brown and his close advisors view the january 28 london conference as venue for karzai to confirm the pledges he made in his inaugural address and to provide momentum to international efforts to support afghan stability brown also proved flexible on his original candidate for natos senior civilian administrator making our preferred candidate available 6 cnf in our recent conversation pm brown acknowledged early missteps over the yemen conference but since then we have coordinated closely on our goals and objectives there is formal agenda for the twohour meeting on january 27 pm brown plans to give opening remarks followed by the yemeni pm foreign secretary miliband will then take over discussion will be based on three themes shared analysis of the challenges political and economic reform and improved donor coordination fm miliband is hosting lunch for gcc members prior to the meeting he hopes gcc members will deliver the difficult messages on reform that he fears they will not want to deliver in front of the larger group 7 cnf on other foreign policy issues our close cooperation continues the uk agrees with our approach on iran sanctions shares our commitment to robust counterterrorism agenda and supports our nonproliferation objectives us tauscher will hold consultations with the pakistanis in london on february 1 the governments commitment to the middle east peace process is behind its efforts to ensure that universal jurisdiction concerns are addressed so that israeli officials can travel to the uk the uk government has made stabilizing somalia priority and recently increased its programming to gbp 35 million usd 56 million in addition the uk works closely with us on nigeria the democratic republic of congo and zimbabwe 8 cnf pm brown may take the opportunity to discuss northern ireland with you during your visit he appreciates your personal involvement at the moment the situation is in flux we expect clearer view within 48 hours brown has pressed hard for renewed progress on devolution of policing and justice you will also have an opportunity to review progress with browns northern ireland minister shaun woodward during your stay as we write the situation is fluid with the two sides meeting on monday in belfast and pm brown meeting pm cowan in london public diplomacy 9 cnf on the public diplomacy side i hope you can take some time out to tape an interview with leading british journalist
