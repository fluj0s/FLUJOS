introduction overview 11 competition between contending groups using all th eir means of power has always characterized the international environment in the modern era since the treaty of westpha lia 1648 this competition has generally been conceived as occurring between nationstates such c ompetition involved all instruments of state power diplomatic informati onal military and economic dime expanded in some recent policy documents to diplomatic informational military economic financ ial intelligence and law enforcement dimefil the overwhelming majority of these comp etitions were peaceful most often nationstates used the military instrument of power peacefully for static defense as forceinbeing that enabled diplomatic posturing or credible deterrent or for essentially nonmilitary purpos such as engineering projects or disaster relief only when other instruments of national powe r were exhausted or proved inadequate was the military instrument of power wielded to settl international differences claus von clausewitz famously characterized ch use of state military power as an act of violence to compel the enemy to do our will this assertion has been profound ly influential however it is too constrained of vision for applying national power in todays world the ancient sun tzu is mo re relevant today although battles should be won winning 100 victories in 100 battles i s not the acme of skill defeating the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill there is more than one way to compel an enemy 12 following the conventions of the time the united states establ ished standing continental army of uniformed regulars who in combination with guerrilla raiders and rebellious population won american independence in the 19th century the united states further developed its military power sufficient to expand and defend young continental nation in the 20th century the unit ed states used its unparalleled military power to successfully concl ude two world wars and provide the credibility required to win third albeit cold war the late 20th century understood the fullest manifest ation of actual or potential war thus defined as the largescale mobilization and total commitment of mas sive organizations wielding immense destructive power 13 the international environment in the 21st century however present s new challenges the united states possesses overwhelming conventional military s uperiority and other nationstates recognize that direct military threat to the united states is sing proposition therefore largescale and direct conventional war against the united states is increasingly likely competition in the international environment using all instruments of power however remains timeless and continuous competitors now concentrate on the nonmilitary instruments of power in the natural intercourse between nations most such intercourse remains peaceful and rou tine enemy competitors however use the instruments of power as weapons moreover not all modern enemy competitors are synonymous with nationstates 14 international actors in the curren t era have awakened to the potential of such unconventional methods for compelling an enemy to do ones will avoi ding the advantages of u s military power these international actors seek to erode the ability of the united state s to employ that comparative advantage using the other instruments of powerespecially the informationalt hey seek to employ what is variably referred to as irregular asymmetri c or unrestricted warfare even when violence is joined direct methods are generally avoided for th classic techniques of guerrilla warfare terrorism sabotage subversion and insurgency 15 such indirect methods are not unprecedented since ancient times kingdoms and empires have employed psychological warfare to terrorize demora lize and subvert their opponents guerrillas have attacked and sabotaged where possible to weaken perior contending power combined with political purpose such guerrillas and political warriors have sought to resist the occupier or subvert and overthrow the oppressor the postcolonial modern era especially saw the widespre ad expansion of such unconventional methods chapter 1 12 fm 305130 30 september 2008 16 the united states is not unpracticed in using many of these methods it is accustomed to wielding all instruments of national power it has effectively done so in the past at the dawn of the 21st century the united states still enjoys the largest economy in the world and continues to wield enormous economic and financial influence the tangible and cultural products produced by the unite d states are spread across the planet in addition to its military power the combin ed weight and multifaceted appeal of this national output enhances the influence of the diplomatic and informational message of the uni ted states us military power guarantees and signif icantly enhances the rule of law in the international system the reach of all these instruments is paralleled by intelligence and lawe nforcement instruments that provide constant feedback of information and respect for international codes of behavior 17 failing peaceful resolution of international competition the u nited states has tested military capability to use uw although such special operati ons so are inherently joint missions of the ussocom the capability has traditiona lly and primarily resided in arsof the spiritual forbearers of american uw can be traced to the colonial period arsof has direct military lineage of conducting uw which dates back more than 50 years to the world war ii wwii office of strategic services oss the united states has conducted uw in support of resistance movements in surgencies and ongoing or pending conventional military operations it has operated by with or through irregular forc against variety of state and nonstate opponents such sensitive opera tions are highvalue component and specific application of the military instrument of national power arsof uwp roperly employed within the context of all such power effec tively integratedis more relevant than ever in the 21st century international environment unconventional warfare 18 the definition of uw has evolved over time the initial doctrina l concept for the united states to conduct uw originated with the cr eation of the oss during wwii in that classic context uw was generally defined in terms of guerrilla and covert ope rations in enemyheld or influenced territory the first official army definition that touched upon aspects of uw appeared in 1950 as partisan warfare in 1951 the armys uw assets were consolidated und er the office of psychological warfare and the army published the first two field manuals for the conduct of so with an emphasi s on uw by 1955 the first historical manual that specifically linked army sf to uw fm 3120 special forces group declared uw consists of the three interrelated fields of guer rilla warfare gw escape and evasion and subversion against hostile states 19 in the subsequent cold war decad the definition expanded and co ntracted verbiage changed and missions conceived as part of this unconventional enterprise were added or subt racted the common conceptual core has nevertheless remained as working by with or th rough irregular surrogates in clandestine andor covert manner against opposing actors it is common for definit ions to evolve and arsof have distilled the definition below to highlight th essentials of uw and eliminate the nonessential in this era of definitional and conceptual change arsofand its joi nt interagency and multinational partnersmust be unified with clear and concise understanding of the uw core m ission 110 the current definition of uw is as follows operations conducted by with or through irregular forces in support of re sistance movement an insurgency or conventional military operations fm 305201 snf special forces unconventional warfare u 28 september 2007 this definition reflects two essential criteria uw must be conducted by with or through surrogates and such surrogates must be irregular forces moreover this definition is consistent with the historical reasons that the united states has conducted uw uw has been conducted in suppo rt of both an insurgency such as the contras in 1980s nicaragua and resistance move ments to defeat an occupying power such as the mujahideen in 1980s afghanistan uw has also been conducted in s upport of pending or ongoing conventional military operations for example ossjedburgh activit ies in france and ossdetachment 101 activities in the pacific in wwii and more recen tly sf operations in op eration enduring freedom oefafghanistan in 2001 and operation iraqi freedom oifiraq in 2003 finally and in keeping with the clandestine andor covert nature of hist orical uw operations it has involved the conduct of introduction 30 september 2008 fm 305130 13 classified surrogate operations details of classified operations are in fm 30520 c special forces operations u and fm 305201 111 the definition establishes litmus test for clearly differentia ting uw from other activities and clearly establishes the purpose for conducting uw including the idea of by with or through surrogates eliminates any confusion with unilateral direct action da special reconnaissance sr or counterterrorism ct missions identifying the historically demonstrated use of irregular forces as surrogates in the definition eliminates any confusion with foreign intern defense fid or coalition activities using regular forces the clearly stated pur pose of uw to support insurgencies resistance movements and conventional military operations not only eliminat the possibility of incorrectly characterizing uw as solely an iw activity but also articulates uws relevance to the army and joint forc by specifying support to other operations personnel should not confuse uw with ot her operations that involve indigenous personnel such as fid the united states characterizes fid s an overt direct method of assistance to free and protec t host nation hn government from insurgency or lawlessness forces conduct fid with recognized hn regular forces these forces are armed individuals or groups of individuals w ho are members of the regular armed force police force or other in ternal security force of that nation there may be instances in which the united stat or the hn overtly employs civilian personnel to enhance operational effect iveness however those personnel are openly recognized as an augmentation to the regular forces of the hn army and joint doctrine currently do not define regulars or regular forces for use in this manual these forces are defined as being opposite of irregular forces regulars are armed individuals or groups of individuals who are member s of regular armed force police or other internal security fo rce once nation charters or sponsors force to provide internal security that force is considered to be regular force regardless of its appearance or naming c onvention if the force operates under governmental control it is regular force irregulars or irregular forces are individuals or groups of individuals who are not members of regular armed force police or other internal security force they are usually nonstatesponsored and unconstrained by sovereign nation legalities and boundaries these forces may include but are not limited to specific paramilitary forces contractors individuals businesses foreign political organizations resistance or insurgent organizations expatriates transnational terrorism adversaries disillusioned transnational terrorism members black marketers and other social or political undesirables 112 however the definition of uw is not simply list of essential criteri and rationales connected endtoend it is the most concise definition possible that allo ws for the essential uw criteria and rationales and explicitly or implicitly answers the who what when where and why questions of military definition for example working by with or through is havin g one act on the behalf of another so the commonly used concept of surrogate is implied moreover the one on whos behalf action is taken implies the who and is likewise unnecessary the w hat and why questions are explicitly answered by uws purpose as stated above an d the when and where are implicit in the times and spaces the purpose is being pursued 113 given the ongoing utility of uw in the wot era and in the context of the merging iw effort it is equally important to highlight what uw is not it is not simply catchall phrase fo r anything that is not conventional regular or traditional it is synonym ous neither with the emerging term irregular warfare nor with the currently influential but nondoctrinal terms asymmetric warfare unrestricted warfare or fourthgeneration warfare although there are conceptual similarities moreover and despite widespread confusion outside of arsof uw is not synonymous with either special operations or guerrilla warfare all uw operations are special operations but not all sp ecial operations are uw although gw is chapter 1 14 fm 305130 30 september 2008 classic inherent component of uw and is featured in many historical defi nitions uw is an operation whereas gw is technique conventional warfare 114 the traditional meaning of uw and how it differs from conventional warfare has been clear to arsof for more than halfcentury commentators outside the arsof com munity however have often misused the term one reason for this conceptual confusion is that convent ional warfare is not defined in either joint publication jp 102 department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms or fm 102 operational terms and graphics 115 the irregular warfare joint operating concept iw joc version 10 date d 11 september 2007 describes conventional or traditional warfare as form of warfare between states that employs direct military c onfrontation to defeat an adversarys armed forces destroy an adversarys warmaking capacity or seize or retain territory in order to force change in an adversarys government or policies the focus of conventional military operations is norma lly an adversarys armed forces with the objective of influencing the adversarys government it generally assumes th at the indigenous populations within the operational area are nbelligerents and will accept whatever political outcome the be lligerent governments impose arbitrate or negotiate fundamental military objective in conventional military operat ions is to minimize civilian interference in those operations 116 uw is specific military operation and is not merely the inverse of conventiona l war as defined above uw can be employed against either state or nstate actors the directness or indirectness of uw varies according to the situation th level of warfare and over time lthough it usually seeks to destroy or weaken an opponents warmaking capability this effort may or may not i nvolve direct military confrontation when uw does involve such confronta tion forces take special care to attempt engagement only during circumstances advantageous to the resist ance or insurgent force seizure and retention of terrain is rarely achieved directly and only achieved decisivel as result of overall victory in the larger strategic campaign the focus of uw is the leveraging of others who may or may not t hen focus on the adversarys armed forces uw generally assumes that some port ion of the indigenous populations sometimes majority of that populationare either bellig erents or in support of the uw operation uw is specifically focused on leveraging the unwillingness of some portion of the indige nous population to accept the status quo or whatever political outcome the bellig erent governments impose ar bitrate or negotiate fundamental military objective in uw is the deliberate involveme nt and leveraging of civilian interference in the unconventional warfare operational area uwoa irregular warfare 117 for some the emerging concept of iw risks adding further confusion to what is unconventional in warfare along with many other operations uw is now considered component part of iw it is first necessary to understand how iw differs from conventional warfare followed by clarification of how iw relates to uw just as uw is special operation but not all special operations are uw uw is an iw activity but not all iw activities are uw 118 the 911 terrorist attack on the united states hi ghlighted the increased danger of warfare conducted by otherthanstate enemies recognizing that such irregular threats by nonstate actors would be likely and even dominant pattern throughout the 21st century national policy m akers dictated that planners must analyze and prepare for such irregul ar threats it was clear that pr evious assumptions about the terms conventional traditional or reg ular warfare and reliance solely on regular or conventional warfare doctrine were inadequate iw was significant theme in the 2006 quadrennial defense review report in april 2006 the pentagon drafted the exec ution roadmap for iw as means of combating this growing threat from actions beyond conventional statetostate litary conflict 119 jp 102 defines iw as violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations iw favors indirect and asymmetric approaches though it may introduction 30 september 2008 fm 305130 15 employ the full range of military and other capacities in order to erod an adversarys power influence and will iw is inherently protracted conflict that will test the resolve of the united states and its partn ers adversaries will pursue iw strategies employing hybrid of irregular disruptive traditional and catastrophic capabilities to undermine and erode the infl uence and will of the united states and its strategic partners meeting these challenges and combating this approach wil l require the concerted efforts of all instruments of us national power 120 iw is about people not platforms iw does not depend on military prowess alone it also relies on the understanding of such social dynamics as tribal politics social networks religious influences and cultural mores although iw is violent struggle not all participating irre gulars or irregular forces are necessarily armed people more so than weaponry pl atforms and advanced technology will be the key to success in iw successful iw relies on building relationshi ps and partnerships at the local level it takes patient persistent and culturally savvy people within the jo int force to execute iw 121 waging protracted iw depends on building global capability and capacity iw will not be won by the united states alone but rather through combined effo rts with multinational partners combined iw will require the joint force to establish longterm sust ained presence in numerous countries to build partner capability and capacity this capability and capacity ex

what is new is their application within the iw conceptual construct the list of ac tivities considered together is also useful in characterizing how iw is distinct from conventional warfare and its emphasis on major combat operat ions mco particularly noteworthy is that uw including support for insu rgencies ct fid psyop and cmocao are arsof core tasks thus arsof are wellsuited to be major practitioners of iw 123 the working definition for conventional warfare provides an appropriate start ing point from which to contrast iw the terms conventional regular and traditional warf are are essentially synonymous conventional warfare is focused on the direct milita ry confrontation between nationstates in which the desired effect is to influence an adversarys govern ment through the defeat of the adversarys military moreover conventional warfare attempts to isolate the population from c onflict and to minimize civilian interference figure 11 page 16 the definition agrees with the jp1 doctrine for the armed forces of the united states discussion of traditional warfare as confrontation between nationstate s or coalitionsalliances of nationstates the contrasting finitions also

operations and also as part of protracte d regional or global iw campaign that may not include significant conventional military operations 126 the sstr joc focuses on the full range of mili tary support across the continuum from peace to crisis and conflict to assist state or region that is under severe stress iw occurs primarily during crisis or conflict in both iw and sstr operations primary focus is on gaining the sup port of the population in both concepts the joint force normally plays an enabling role to t he efforts of other government agencies ogas rather than lead role sstr operations ar vital component of most iw operations and campaigns but sstr operations also occur outside the scope of iw in some operat ions iw may contrast with sstr operations such as supporting an insurgency or conducting uw where th goal is not to support the host government but rather to undermine stability and security to erode an adve rsarys control over its territory or population as with iw many sstr ta sks are best performed by indigenous institutions intergovernmental organizations igos nongovernmental organizations ng and ogas nonetheless both concepts envision the requirement for joint for ces to perform all tasks necessary to establish or maintain civil order when civilian agencies cannot do so 127 much of what the iw concept ffers however aligns with traditi onal arsof doctrine practice and conceptualization what makes iw different from c onventional warfare is the focus of its operationsa relevant populationand its strategic purpose to gain or mainta in control or influence over the population and to support that population through political psychological and economic m ethods arsof practitioners of uw have long understood the importance of focusin g on the population and that campaigns logical lines of operation could include not only combat operation s but also information intelligence and developing capability jp1 states th at iw is marked by struggle among state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and in fluence over the relevant populati on that it primarily involves an indirect approach to erode power influence and will and that it is determined by the characteristics of the adversary and is not as such new or independent type of warfare these are ll familiar uw insights for arsof 128 uw is component and method of prosecuting iw but uw and iw are each distinct both iw and uw focus on influencing relevant populations however whereas iw does t necessarily require operations with irregular forces uw is always conduct ed by with or through irregular forces uw may be central effort in holistic iw campaign in which conventional military operat ions are not used or it may chapter 1 18 fm 305130 30 september 2008 be conducted as an iw element in support of what is predominantly conventional military operation the emerging iw concept borrows heavily from traditional arsof concepts but they are not synonymous doctrinal terms and definitions conventional or traditional warfare form of warfare between states that employs direct military confrontati on to defeat an adversarys armed forces destroy an adversarys warmaking capacity or seize or retain territory in order to force change in an adversary s government or policies the focus of convent ional military operations is normally an adver sarys armed forces with the objective

na tional power and unconventional warfare 26 the united states avoids resorting to military force preferring to wield l other instruments of power in the pursuit of national objectives and in the context of i nternational competition and conflict therefore diplomacy routinely blocks the need for the application of the military instrument of power however when the president decides to employ the spec ific military application of uw the department of state dos plays crucial role regardless of whethe r the united states conducts the uw operation in support of resistance insurgency or conventional military operations close coordination between arsof and dos elements is re quired for example z all uw missions involve diplomatic facilitation with foreign audiences both external and indigenous to the uwoa dos channels may pr ove valuable for thirdnation or surrogate support and dos liaison abilities may be the adhesive that allo ws diverse coalitions to persevere in longterm effort z the sensitivity of missions involving covert and clandestine activities requires dos elements to effect coordination of foreign support from friendly governments and the dipl omatic compliance or misdirection of adversary governments z the united states may conduct some arsof uw ope rations in states that are not belligerents the us ambassador and his country team may in fact have complete or significant control over arsof inside the ambassadors host coun try of responsibility in such cases the relationship between arsof conducting uw and the country team requires the be st possible coordination to be effective and appropriate z even when uw is conducted in thirdparty stat much of the mission preparation and support may be conducted in or transit other states most states have us diplomatic repres entation and coordination with dos personnel will be key task for effective execution of uw operations z like arsof dos personnel spend majority of their careers in foreign count ries many dos personnel have expert knowledge cultural and nguage abilities current situational awareness and network of hn contacts at their disp osal it is imperative that arsof access these valuable resources when appropri ate in the conduct of uw informational instrument of national power 27 the informational instrument of national power has diffuse and compl ex set of components

that shape international and domestic environments is to understand the operationa l environment in its complex entirety and identify the sources of informational influence that contribute to th at complexity this is difficult undertaking because cultural worldviews and assumptions underlay the reception and interpre tation of ideas substitute does not exist for persistent detailed and accurate understanding of the uw human terrai n in which arsof must operate most of this larger information environment will remain beyond usg control or influence therefore the best that practitione rs of uw

possible arsof uw is only partly science it is fundamentally an art of human interaction 212 by contrast usgcontrolled specific instruments of informational power wh ile narrower in scope can achieve specific and measurable results useful to prosecuting uw arsof can work with dos counterparts to identify and engage select tas that are able to influence behavior within uwoa such tas may be inside

to realize national goals and obje ctives while providing military leadership with the information needed to accomplish missions and implement the national security stra tegy nss planners use intelligence to identify the adversarys capabilities an d centers of gravity project probable courses of action coas and assist in planning friendly force employment intelligence also provides assessments that help the joint force commander jfc decide which forces to deploy when how and where to ploy them and how to employ them in manner that accomplishes the mission at the lowest human and political cost 216 the traditional dime construct of national power incorporated intelligence into the informational instrument this was appropriate because all intelligence is form of in formation in the post911 world however the dimefil construct sepa rates the two into related but distinct instruments informational chapter 2 24 fm 305130 30 september 2008 power conveys themes to selected tas whether or not the usg deliberately focuses or even controls those themes intelligence as national instrument of powe r is more specific tool with deliberate focus controlled by the usg whereas in formational power projects informa tion to shape an environment intelligence seeks to gather information to understand the environ ment and inform usg decision making the usg usually crafts intelligence to answer specific questi ons interagency intelligence process 217 intelligence supports joint operations by provid ing critical information and finished intelligence products to the

operations interact to meet the commanders intelligence needs the intelligence process pro vides useful model that albeit simplistic nevertheless facilitates understanding the wi variety of intelligence operations and their interrelationships there are firm boundaries outlining where each operation within the modern intelligence process begins or ends intelligence oper ations are not sequential rather they are nearly simultaneous in addition not all ope rations necessarily continue through out the entire intelligence process 219 the increased tempo of military operations requir an unimpeded flow of automatically processed and exploited data that is both timely and relevant to the commanders needs this unanalyzed combat information must be simultaneously available to both the commander for tim ecritical decision making and to the intelligence analyst for the production of current intelligence assessments 220 examples of uses for such unanalyzed combat information include

dissemination of intelligence products must do so in time to support the commanders decisionmaking needs 221 joint intelligence operations begin with the identifi cation of need for intelligence regarding all relevant aspects of the operational environment esp ecially the adversary the commander and all joint force staff elements identify these intelligence needs and the j2 formalizes these needs as intelligence requirements early in the planning process the commander identifies those critical pieces of intelligence that he must know by particular time to plan and execute successful mission as his priority intelligence requirements pirs commanders identify pirs at ev ery level and base them on guidance obtained from the mission statement the commanders in tent and the endstate objectives 222 intelligence requirements are the basis for current and future intelligence operations and are prioritized based on consumer inputs during the pla nning and direction portion of the intelligence process the j2 provides the focus and direction for collecti on requirements to support the cocom or subordinate joint force 223 the collection portion of the intelligence process in volves tasking appropriate collection assets and resources to acquire the data and information required to satisfy collection objectives collection includes the identification coordination and positioning of ssets and resources to satisfy collection objectives 224 once the data that might satisfy the requireme nt is collected it undergoes processing and exploitation processing and exploitation transforms the collected raw data into information that intelligence analysts can use to produce and dissemina multidiscipline intelligence products relevant critical information should also be disseminated to the command er and joint force staff to facilitate timesensitive decision making processing and exploitation varies depending on the characteristics of specific collection assets for example some intelligence surv eillance and reconnaissance isr systems accomplish processing and exploitation automatically and nearly simultaneously with collection while other collection assets such as human intelligence hum int teams may require substantially more time personnel prioritize and synchronize processing and exploitation require ments with the commanders pirs 225 the analysis and production portion of the inte lligence process involves integrating evaluating analyzing and interpreting information from single or multiple source s into finished intelligence product the demands of the modern operational environment require intelli gence products that anticipate the needs of the commander and are timely accurate usable complete relevant objective and available 226 personnel disseminate intelligence products to the re quester who integrates the intelligence into the decisionmaking and planning processes in the case of threat warning alerts essential to the preservation of life or vital resources such information must be immediately communicated directly to those forces platforms or personnel identified at risk so the appropriate responsive action c an be taken once such notification has been acknowledged 227 evaluation of intelligence operations activities and products is continuous based on these evaluations and the resulting feedback remedial

intelligence pr eparation before deployment and continuously updated accurate and timely intelligence during employ ment are critical 231 the purpose of uw is to support resistance insurgency or conventional mil itary operations political control and legitimacy of regimes are the issues therefore uw has s trategic utility that can alter the balance of power between sovereign states such high

organization and civilizing force that provides means and incentive for human beings to relate to one another economically by ex changing goods and services for mutual benefit the capacity to convert

or ineffectiveness of us or allied law enforcement or the inherent cultural values carried by nonusgcontrolled popular cult ure have the ability to shape the attitudes and behaviors of human groups in the uwoa 268 the application of economic or financial incentives is among the most powerful ideas in the us arsenal of power although some us adversaries ar irreconcilable to accommodation with us interests and must be engaged in other ways many declared or potential adversaries can be persua ded or dissuaded by economic or financial means to become declared or potential allies or at least neutralized ca units are specifically designed in part to create desired effects from the manipulation f material inputs in their assigned area of operations ao like the information environment varied economic in tercourse is universal and mostly unmanaged human activity however the abil ity of the usg to affect the economic environment is enormous and it has economic weapons at its disposal arsof uw pl anners must carefully coordinate the introduction and withholdi ng of economic and financial assets into the uwoa with their interagency partners for example direct application of usaid gra nts to specific human groups can alter negative behaviors or cement positive aff iliations the direct activitie s of the docs us and foreign commercial service to promote export expansion for us and other mu ltinational corporations mncs can have similar albeit indirect effects at the highest leve ls of diplomatic and financial interaction the usgs ability to influence internati onal financial institutionswith corresponding effects to exchange rates interest rates credit ava ilability and money suppliescan cement multinational coalitions for uw campaigns or dissuade adversar nationstate governments from supporting specific actors in the uwoa 269 the ability of the united states to achieve its national strate gic objectives depends in large measure on the effectiveness of the usg in employing the instruments of national power in coordinated manner all competition and conflict between states and other states or nonstate actors reflect mix of the dimefil instruments uw as one sp ecific military operation conducted by few specially dedicated primarily arsof units within the military instrument is not exempt from this truth uw is fundamentally about influencing human groups within specific area usually beyond the reach of unilateral us military power every means of influencing human behavior pplies to uw 270 it is the responsibility of the president and the s ecdef to establish the rules for and integration of military power with the other instruments of national power to acc omplish this integration the armed forces interact with the other responsible agencies to ensure mutual understanding of the capabilities limitations and consequences of military and civilian actions nd to identify the ways in which military and nonmilitary capabilities can best complement each othe r arsof understand that the most effective uw effort will coordinate all instruments of us nationa l power into an integrated and circumspect whole 30 september 2008 fm 305130 31 chapter 3 policy and doctrine national policy 31 the president and his nsc ultimately determin authoritative us uw policy further the departments and institutions of the usg executive branch velop uw policy into doctrine and implement it the legislative and judicial branches of the usg bot h support and constrain us policy in addition the us democratic system provides for an orderly transfer of power between indivi duals and parties on routine basis one strength of this system is that it allows for changes of policy direction that reflect changing us understanding of the international environment h owever since the conduct of uw typically requires longterm effort relatively shortterm changes of administration nd changes in the makeup of legislative and judicial bodies can result in policy chan ges that frustrate consistent and persistent effort moreover changes in the international environment and internationa l law can affect such policy nationallevel strategies applicable to uw ar therefore necessarily snapshot in time national security strategy of the united states 2006 32 it is the policy of the united states to seek nd support democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of endi ng tyranny in the world the fundamental character of regimes is as important as the distribution of power among them the goal of u s statecraft is to help create world of democratic wellgoverned states that can meet citizens needs an d act responsibly in the international system this is the best way to provide enduring sec urity for the american people 33 achieving this goal is the work of generations the united states is in the early years of long struggle similar to what the country faced in the early years of the cold war in the 20th century freedom triumphed over the threats of fascism and communism yet new totalitarian ideology now threatensan ideology grounded not in secular philosophy but in the perversion of relig ion its content may be different from the ideologies of the last century but its means are similar intolerance mu rder terror enslavement and repression as in the past today the united states must lay the

for the future the national military strategy nms provides focus for military activities by defi ning set of interrelated military objectives from which the service chiefs and comb atant commanders ccdrs identify desired capabilities and against which the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs assesses risk military objectives 37 the nms establishes three military objectives that support the nd s these are to z protect the united states against external attacks and aggression z prevent conflict and surprise attack z prevail against adversaries policy and doctrine 30 september 2008 fm 305130 33 joint vision for future warfighting 38 sustaining and increasing the qualitative military advantages the united states enjoys today will require transformationa transformation achieved by combining technological intellectual and cultural changes across the joint community the goal is fullspectrum domina ncethe ability to control any situation or defeat any adversary across the range of military operations 39 the united states faces number of dangerous nd pervasive threats traditional irregular catastrophic and disruptive challenges will require the armed forces to adjust quickly and decisively to change and anticipate emerging threats z states employing recognized military capabilitie s and forces in wellunderstood forms of military competition and conflict pose traditional challenges z states employing unconventiona l methods to counter the trad itional advantages of stronger opponents pose irregular challenges z adversaries acquiring possessing and using wmd or methods producing wmdl ike effects pose catastrophic challenges z adversaries developing and using breakthrough technologies to negate c urrent us advantages in key operational domains pose disruptive challenges 310 three key aspects of the security environment have unique implication s for executing this military strategy these aspects will drive the development of concepts and capabilities that ensure success in future operations z wider range of adversaries z more complex and distributed operational environment z an increase in technolo gy diffusion and access wider range of adversaries 311 the range of adversaries capable of threatening the united states its allies and its interests include states nonstate organizations and individuals some states with tradi tional military forces and advanced systems including cruise and ballistic missiles could seek to control key regions of the world few of these states are rogues that violate treaties secr etly pursue and proliferate wmd reject peaceful resolution of disputes and display callous disregard for their citizens some of these states sponsor terrorists providing them financial pport sanctuary and access to dange rous capabilities some nonstate actors such as terrorist networks international cr iminal organizations and illegal arme d groups menace stability and security even some individuals may have the mea ns and will to disrupt international order some of these adversaries are not politically constrai ned this makes these adversaries particularly nonstate actors less susceptible to traditional means of deterrence adversaries are increasingly seeking asymmetric capabilities and are using them in innovative ways the avoid us strengths such as precision strikes and seek to counter us power projection capabilities by creating antiaccess environments such adversaries will target civilian populations econ omic centers and symbolic locations as way to attack us political will and resolve 312 this volatile mix of challenges requires new thods of deterrence and operational approaches to defeat these threats should deterrence fail intellig ence systems must allow commanders to understand enemy intent predict threat actions and detect adversary movements this derstanding provides them the time necessary to take preventive measures long before conflicts occur these intelligence systems must provide more thorough understanding of adversaries motivations goals and organizations to determine effective deterrent coas however there may be adversaries that re main undeterred should they acquire wmd or dangerous asymmetric capabilities or demonstrate the intent to mount surprise attack the united states must be prep ared to prevent them from striking more complex and distributed operational environment 313 adversaries threaten the united states throughout complex operational environment extending from critical regions overseas to the homeland and span ning the global commons of international airspace waters space and cyberspace an arc of instability exists stretchi ng from the western hemisphere chapter 3 34 fm 305130 30 september 2008 through africa and the middle east and extending to asia there are areas in this arc that serve as breeding grounds for threats to us interests within these areas rogue states provide sanctuary to terrorists protecting them from surveillance and attack other adversaries take advantage of ungoverned space and undergoverned territories from which they prepare plans train forces and launch attacks these ungoverned areas often coincide with locations of illicit acti vities such coincidence creates opportunities for hostile coalitions of criminal elements and ideological ex tremists 314 the united states will conduct operations in wi dely diverse locationsfrom densely populated urban areas located in shore regions to remote inhos pitable and austere locations military operations in this complex environment may be dramatically different from the high intensity combat missions for which us forces routinely train while us armed forces will continue to emphasize precision speed lethality and distributed operations commanders must expect and plan for the p ossibility that their operations will produce unintended second and thirdorder effects fo r example us forces can precisely locate track and destroy discrete targets to reduce collateral damage and conclude operations as quickly as possible operations that rely on precision may result in large elements of an adversarys military remaining intact and segments of the population unaf fected commanders must prepare to operate in regions where pockets of resistance remain and the potential exists for co ntinued combat operations amid large number of noncombatants 315 this operational environment places unique dema nds on military organizations and interagency partners and requires more detailed coordination and synchronization of activities both overseas and at home us experiences in afghanistan and iraq highlight the need for com prehensive strategy to achieve longerterm national goals and objectiv the united states must adopt an active defenseindepth that merges joint force interagency international ngos and multinational capabilities in synergistic manner this defense does not solely rely on passive measur the united states must enhance security at home while actively patrolling strategic approaches an d extending defensive capabilities well beyond us borders an effective defenseindepth must also include the capabil ity to strike swiftly at any target around the globe using forces at home as well as forwardbased forwarddeploye d and rotational forces an increase in technology diffusion and access 316 global proliferation of wide range of technology and weaponry will affect the character of future conflict dualuse civilian technologies especially information tec hnologies highresolution imagery and global positioning systems are widely available these relatively wcost commercially available technologies will improve the disruptive and destructive capabi lities of wide range of state and nonstate actors advances in automation and information processing wil l allow some adversaries to locate and attack targets both overseas and in the united states software tools for netwo rk attack intrusion and disruption are globally available over the in ternet providing almost any intere sted adversary basic computer network exploitation or ttack capability access to advanced we apons systems and innovative delivery systems could fundamentally change warfighting an d dramatically increase an adversarys ability to threaten the united states 317 technology diffusion and access to advanced weapons and delivery systems ve significant implications for military capabilities the united states mus t have the ability to deny adversaries such disruptive technologies and weapons however the armed forces cannot s olely focus on these threats and cannot assume there are other challenges on the ho rizon ensuring current readiness while continuing to transform and maintain unchallenged military superior ity will require investment these are not mutually exclusive goals the armed forces must remain ready to fight even as th ey transform and transform even as they fight applicability of national policy to army sp ecial operations forces conventional warfare 318 the key components of these national policy documents have direct implicati ons for the conduct of arsof uw the nss states that us policy is to seek and support democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture and identifies that this bold and noble policy is the work of generations this deliberately stated american support for democracy is consistent with the sf motto to free the oppressed the seeking out and supporting of democratic movementse ven within nondemocratic state

of and strengths for the conduct of uw arso f are military asset whose role in uw contributes to dissuading deterring and defeating adversaries especially extr emists securing strategic access to key regions strengthening alliances and partnerships and working with others i n the usg to achieve these goals 320 finally although the military objectives related in the nmsprotect the united states prevent conflict and prevail against adversariesare essentially timeless imperatives for all us armed forces not just arsof the key aspects of the security envi ronment reflect the specific utility of arsof uw arsof are adept at operating against wider range of dversaries in part because of regional orientation and expertise in remote global areas the more comp lex and distributed battlespace includes many of these same remote unusual and hostile areas moreover one implication of technology diffusion and access means that adversarial conflict is longer the prerog ative of nationstate standing armed forces modern adversaries empowered by 21st century technologies are now more likely to be prevalent in the same remote and unusual operational environments in which arsof thrive and rsof uw is often conducted 321 the following paragraphs highlight special attributes and strengths that arsof bring to the conduct of uw as stated earlier arsof predominantly co nduct uw however the usa does not train assess and equip all arsof to conduct uw sf psyop and ca elements primaril conduct arsof uw while other arsof units such as rangers engage in other so fm 305 army special operations forces provides general coverage of all arsof so military concepts and doctrine 322 since uw is defined as operations conducted by with or through irregu lar forces to support insurgency resistance and conventional military opera tions not all uw is component of the wot nevertheless the wot is national priority that can involve s ignificant use of arsof to conduct uw against adversarial states supporters of terrorists and wide varie ty of nonstate actors 323 arsof are the executors of and functional proponent for uw under the authority of c ommander ussocom currently there is authoritative inte ragency or joint doctrine specifically for uw although sufficient joint doctrine exists for general campaign design and execution of joint and army operations this manual is the overarching doctrinal refere nce that specifically addresses uw as conducted by arsof fm 305201 contains detailed ttp for uw the spectrum of likely ope rations describes need for arsof in joint combined and

and emerging challenges in this new more uncertain era traditional irregular catastrophic and disruptive often hard boundaries distin guish one challenge from another indeed the most dangerous circumstances are those where arsof face or will face multiple challenges simultaneously 327 arsof are key enabler in the wot by conducting so including uw that obtain actionable intelligence such intelligence assists commanders in dete rmining the appropriate force package and in preparing the force to destroy terrorist networks in uw arsof combine with irregular forces acting alone or in combination with joint conventional fo rce operations arsof conducting uw can operate in hostile denied or sensitive environments to collect monito r or verify information of strategic or operational significance often requiring lowvisibility techniques arsof can feed the results of these activities directly to commander or country team or input them into th intelligence process for processing analyzing and disseminating to military and ogas range of military operations 328 the united states employs arsof capabilities at home and abroad in support of us national security goals in variety of operations arsof conduct uw in suppor t of major operations and campaigns when necessary however arsof conduct the majority of uw belo w the threshold of armed conflict between nationstates such relatively discrete and indirect activities allow the united states to engage partners and adversaries in manner that helps shape the global opera tional environment and keep the daytoday tensions between nations or groups be low the threshold of armed conflict while maintaining us global influence such uw operations provide wide range of suppor t to irregular forces conducive to furthering us interests although sf are designed to support such irregular forces in combat role if necessary majority of arsof uw involves sf ps yop and ca activities that do not involve combat global nature of operations 329 arsof have global reach and are capable of engaging threats and influencin g potential adversaries with variety of capabilities including uw the conduct of uw by arsof provides national decision makers tool for engaging adversarial states controlling hostile or d enied territory which may otherwise be beyond the reach of us influence however global reach and influence are not just the purview of nationstates globalization and emer ging technologies allow small gro ups to use asymmetric approaches to include criminal activity terrorism or armed aggressi on on transnational scal with relative ease and with little cost the conduct of uw by arsof allo ws discrete and effective engagement of these adversarial nonstate actors as well 330 adversaries understand that direct challenges to us power are likely to be losing proposition therefore adversaries often place greater emphasis on veloping capabilities to th reaten the united states indirectly increased interdependence of national economies and rapid movement of information around the world create significant challenges in the defense of us interests identifying potential threats both state and nonstate actors operating independently or in loose coalitions determining their intent and determining the best coa to counter their actions are interagency and mul tinational challenges for the united states in conjunction with the other instruments of power the m ilitary use of arsof in uw provides means of addressing such indirect threats 331 the elusive nature of adversaries and the everi ncreasing speed of global communications and the media demand greater adaptability and networking from arsof particularly communications and intelligence resources consequently arsof conduct oper ations on global scale as part of the nss arsof conducts uw operations in depth focusing on the threat source across geographical regions arsof soldiers routine employment in forward regions developed expertise in deal ing with foreign policy and doctrine 30 september 2008 fm 305130 37 irregular forces and peoples discretion and versatility make the conduct of uw an effective tool for seeking out such elusive opponents military engagement security cooperation and deterrence 332 these ongoing and specialized activities establish shape mai ntain and refine relations with other nations and

addition to arsof participation in these missions arsof may so conduct uw that supports the wot within the context of military engagement s ecurity coordination and deterrence uw capabilities developed within an hn may give capable irregular forces the abilit to defeat terrorist threats within their sovereign borders limited contingency operations 333 the united states often uses arsof to respond to crisis that does not require largescale combat operations to resolve limited contingency opera tion can be single smallscale limitedduration operation or significant part of major operation of extended duration involving com bat the associated general strategic and operational objectives are to prot ect us interests and to prevent surprise attack or further conflict the levels of complexity duration and resources depend on the c ircumstances included are operations to ensure the safety of american citizens and us interes ts while maintaining and improving us ability to operate with multinational partners in deterring th hostile ambitions of potential aggressors many of these operations involve combination of conventional and unconventional forces and capabilities in close cooperation with ogas and ngos arsof co nduct of uw in these cas is likely to be supporting effort to other so or conventional operations major operations and campaigns 334 when required to achieve national strategic objectives or to protect national inte rests the us national leadership may decide to conduct major operation or campaign involvi ng largescale combat placing the united states in wartime state in such cases the general goal is to prevail against the enemy as quickly as possible to conclude hostilities and to establish conditions favorable to the hn the united states and its multinational partners arsof conduct uw in support of such major combat operations either directly or indirectly types of military operations 335 army doctrine addresses the range of fullspectrum operations across the spectrum of conflict as described in fm 1 the army army commanders at all echelons may combine different ty pes of operations simultaneously and sequentially to accomplish missions for each mission the j fc and army component commander determine the emphasis army for ces place on each type of operation army fullspectrum operations 336 missions in any environment require arsof to be prepared to conduct any co mbination of offensive defensive stability and civilsupport opera tions described below however the conduct of uw by arsof has particular strengths and wea knesses within the context of each operation z offensive operations destroy or defeat an enemy their purpose is to impose us will on the enemy and to achieve decisive victory arsof elements conducting uw are typically small and therefore of limited direct offensive value to jfc however arsof soldiers particular excellence in serving as force multiplier of irregular combat forces in uw makes arsof potentially valuable indirect element of offensive power moreover since arsof conduct of uw frequently occurs in an adversarys rear area the coordinated application of arsofled chapter 3 38 fm 305130 30 september 2008 irregular forces to the jfcs operational plan can provide offensive advantages in surprise maneuver and economy of force z defensive operations defeat an enemy attack buy time economi ze forces or develop conditions favorable for offensive operations defensive operations alone normally cannot achieve decision as with offensive operations arsof conducting uw are of l imited direct defensive value because of their small element size and ty pically isolated and unsupported positioning however when arsof use uw to leverage irregula r forces into larger combat formations they can play significant indirect defensive role moreover whereas the jfc may be conducting defensive mission at the strategic operational or tactical levels arsof soldiers typical positioning in the adversarys rear area and in support of irregular forces place arsof uw elements in position to conduct offensive missions with strategic operational and tactical significance to the jfcs conduct of the defense z stability operations promote and protect us national interests by influencing the threat political and information dimensions of the operational envir onment through combination of peacetime developmental cooperative activitie s and coercive actions in response to crises the united states can employ arsof to assist civil authorities fore ign or domestic in responding to crises and in relieving suffering as part of larger usg interagency strategy arsof uw activities can be useful in supporting the conduct of stability operations more information on these often classified activities can be found in fm 305201 z civil support operations address the consequences of manmade or natural ac cidents and incidents beyond the capabilities of civilian authorities army forces do not conduct stability operations within the united statesunder us law the federal and state governments are responsible for those tasks instead army fo rces conduct civilsup port operations when requested providing army expertise and capab ilities to lead agency authorities arsof does not conduct uw within the united states 337 when commanders conduct fullspectrum operations as part of an overseas joint campaign they combine and sequence offensive defensive and stability opera tions to accomplish the mission the jfc and the so component commander for particular mission determine the emphasis arsof place on each type of operation including uw throughout the cam paign offensive defensive and stability operations occur simultaneously as missions change from promoting peace to terring war and from resolving conflict to war itself the combinations of and tr ansitions between these op erations require skillful assessment planning preparation and execution moreover arsof may sometimes conduct continuous uw effort throughout the entire duration of an ov erseas joint campaign regardless of any changing emphasis of the conventional force mission and regardless of joint fo rces location within the spectrum of conflict 338 arsof can conduct uw in support of the jfc at all levels z strategic the strategic level concerns the broadest aspects of national and theater pol icy decisions at this level reflect national and multinational goa ls integrate all the instruments of national power provide forces and determine c onstraints on their use the president or the secdef and the gccs determine the strategicna tional and strategictheater objectives and the manner of use of military means to achieve them the president or the secdef and the gccs may directly or indirectly through subordinate commanders employ arsof in pursuit of these objectives arsof conduct of uw provides na tionallevel ability to affect strategic us interests and the most effective use of arsof uw requires deliberate and comprehensive use of all instruments of national power in fact lthough arsof are the military weapon of choice to conduct uw the other nonmilitary instruments of us national power at the strategic level may make up majority of successful uw campaign force z operational the operational level focuses on theater campaigns and major operations jf cs determine operational

uw can be an policy and doctrine 30 september 2008 fm 305130 39 integral part of theater campaigns and major operations the feasibility of uw should be considered in any campaign z tactical the tactical level focuses on battles and engagements decisions at this level apply combat power to create advantages while in co ntact with or close to the enemy arsof may support tactical actions offense defense and stability actions des igned to have significant effect in attaining operational objectives tactical actions m ay directly attain tactical operational and strategic objectives simultaneously which is espe cially true in the conduct of arsof so including uw th typical sensitivity of arsof uw activities can magnify the positive or negative consequences of tactical success or failure principles of war 339 arsof missions may require unorthodox approaches but these approaches do not negate the nine traditional principles of war ra ther they place different emphasis on their combination or relative importance in some so missions surprise achieve d through speed stealth au dacity deception and new tactics or techniques can be far more effective and efficient than traditional conventional tactics based on massed firepower and tactical maneuvers the following discussion of the principles of war highlights their application to arsof when conducting uw z objective direct every military operation toward clearly defined decisive and attainable objective arsof objectives are as much politi cal economic and informational as they are military in nature this fact is highlighted in uw because the fundamenta l objective of uw is to accomplish activities by with or th rough irregular forces as us surrogates the objective of uw is always inherently political jfcs and arsof uw planners mu st avoid mistaking secondary objectives such as employing lethal force against an adversary for the primary objective of persuading the irregular surrogate to take action in concert with us objectives z offensive seize retain and exploit the initiative arsof are inherently offensive in nature because they seek to strike or engage the enem to compel deter or counter enemy actions in uw such initiative is conducted by with or th rough an irregular surrogate in arsof uw offensive is not necessarily synonymous with the application of lethal fo rce it is imperative that sf psyop and ca forces conducting uw exploit the initiative by proactively persuading advising and gaining the support of irregular for ces and the civilians in the uwoa as part of comprehensive uw campaign plan z mass concentrate the effects of combat power at the decisive place and time commanders mass the effects of overwhelming combat power at the decisive time and place to overwhelm the enemy or to gain control of the situation ar sof concentrate the effect s of combat power at critical times and discriminate selected targets to produce decisive results that accomplish the commanders objectives the truth of this principle is unchang eable but what constitutes overwhelming power is relative referring to gue rrilla warfare mao tsetung famously said the strategy is one to ten the tactics are ten to one the correlation of forces that an arsof element may represent to an adversary in uw ma be distinct numerical us disadvantage however small force may achieve success if massed at the right time and place and in the context of wellconceived plan moreover combat power must not be misun derstood to mean only lethal force chapter 2 of this manual and fm 324 for example observe that some of th best weapons do not shoot massing the effects of properly executed psyop or ca plan can have decisive results for arsof uw z economy of force llocate minimum essential combat powe r to secondary efforts and employ all combat power available in the most effec tive way possible arsof provide an essential economy of force when military objectives are subordinate to polit ical economic and informational objectives this is particularly true when arsof conduct uw by definition small arsof cadres are often able to leverage huge efforts by indigenous pop ulations irregular forces and other surrogates through carefully craf ted psychological appeals political interaction and other trustbuilding activities in the context of wellorchestra ted uw campaign plan the effect of such activities can prove decisive z maneuver place the enemy in disadvantageous position through the flexible pplication of combat power as military units conducting so arsof elements do conduct maneuver in the chapter 3 310 fm 305130 30 september 2008 traditional sense in strategic operational and tactical environments nd possess tremendous capability to gain positions of advantage for the gcc when conducting uw arsof soldiers ability to leverage segments of the population resi dent in the uwoa can be particularly useful to the campaign plan when arsofsupported irre gular forces can apply combat power in the adversarys secure operating environment on ce again combat power in arsof uw does not automatically denote lethal force the properly timed and positioned interdiction of lines of communication popular uprisings or sabotaged adversary infrastructure for xample can be flexible applications of comb at power that place the enemy in disadvantageous position z unity of command ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander for every objectiv theater special operations command tsoc commanders under the cocom of the gcc can either tailor the c2 architecture for arsof operations under the direct control of the tsoc or recommend subordinate jfc relationships to ensure unity of effort of sof th erefore integration synchronization and unity of effort for these forces are incumbent upon commanders and staffs at every level to the extent sf psyop and ca work t ogether in an arsof uw campaign it is imperative that these forces integrate and coordinate their efforts throughout the duration of the mission z security prohibit the enemy from acquiring an unexpected advantage arsof can prov ide security to the jfc by denying the enemy the ability to use his ex pected advantages arsof provide security through vari ous intelligencecollection methods force protection fp and force applications the irregular forces and populations indigenous to uwoa an d engaged by arsof can multiply friendly intelligence an d greatly enhance friendly security z surprise strike the enemy at time and place or in manner for which he is unprepared arsof can deceive the enemy inhibit the enem ys decision making or restrict the enemys capability to react to the commanders operations or campaign as irregular forces and target populations engaged by arsof multiply friendly intelligence and enh ance security in uw that same enhanced situational awareness multiplies opportunities to identify adversary weaknesses moreover the discrete building of uw organization itself in an adversarys rritoryand judicious revelation of that organizations abilitieshas the greate st potential for surprise the calculated use of such surprise can have vital ps ychological effects in an arsof uw campaign z simplicity prepare clear uncomplicated plans and concise orders to ensure thorough understanding arsof use unorthodox and sophisticated methods and equipment the plans and procedures the force employs must be simp and direct to facilitate understanding to withstand the stress of operational environments and to allow for rapid adaptation to changing situations this principle is as valid in uw as it is to other rsof so however the fundamental activity of arsof uw is political activity of smallscale human interaction persuading and leading irregular forces to act in concert with us objectives as clausewitz famously noted in war everything is simple but the simplest thing is difficult us political interaction with irregular surrogates is inherently difficult and only properly selected and trained arsof personnel should conduct uw other principles 340 uw is inherently joint activity and jp 30 joint operations identifies three additional principles arsof must consider restraint perseverance and gitimacy the following graphs address each of these principles restraint 341 the purpose of restraint is to limit collateral dama ge and to prevent the unnecessary or unlawful use of force single act could cause significant military and political consequences therefore judicious use of force is necessary restraint requires the careful and disciplined balancing of the need for security the conduct of military operations and the national strategic end state f or example the exposure of intelligencegathering activities could have significant po litical and military repercussions because of this soldiers should exercise sound judgment when conducting intellige nce gathering excessive force antagonizes other parties involved thereby damaging the legitimacy of th organization using excessive force and potentially enhancing the legitimacy of the opposing party policy and doctrine 30 september 2008 fm 305130 311 342 arsof commanders at all levels must take proactiv steps to ensure their personnel are properly trained in the rules of engagement roe and are quickly informed of any changes in multinational operations use of force may be dictated by coalition or allied force roe failure to understand and comply with established roe can result in fratricid mission failure or national embarrassment 343 the use of arsof in uw has several special considerations regarding re straint at national strategic level the use of discrete arsof uw operations can itself be mea sure of us restraint small highly trained arsof elements working by with or through irregular surrogat in uw can sometimes eliminate the need for largescale us military operations this indi rect use of military power through arsof uw can provide significant strategic results supporting us object ives while providing perception of usg restraint however the very nsitivity of some arsof uw operations can magnify usg embarrassment if exposed therefore use of arsof uw in highly sensitive situations requires careful consideration of risk 344 an additional restraint complexity in arsof uw involves the inherent nature of working by with or through irregular surrogates although successful arsof uw opera tion may not require us forces to apply any lethal force wh atsoever persuading and leading irregular surrogates to act in concert with us objectives is human political interaction that is inherent ly difficult to control arsof personnel conducting uw must impart notion of restraint to th eir irregular counterparts unrestrained actions by irregular forces working with arsof may reflect badly on the united s tates may provoke adversary force retaliation or international political condemnation and may result in coun terproductive popu lar resistance within the uwoa all of which may jeopardize the mission 345 the foreign often hostile and sometimes remote locations that rsof typically executes uw in make the maintenance of restraint more difficult jtf commanders and arsof elements must thoroughly understand the cultural and legal customs of the uwoa traditional regard for life nd rule of law or lack thereof may differ greatly from conventional battlefiel ds and international sta ndards of behavior arsof must understand and anticipate such differences be fore infiltrating the uwoa since arsof personnel conducting uw will typically be part of small us ements within large foreign environment and often beyond rapid us support the selection preparation and judgment of th arsof personnel are crucial considerations if us irregular surrogates continuously behave in manner that jeopa rdizes us interests the maintenance of us restraint may require ending the uw mission perseverance 346 the purpose of perseverance is to ensure the co mmitment necessary to attain the national strategic end state some joint operations may require years to reach the term ination criteria and arsof must anticipate operations that are both measured and protracted the underlying causes of the crisis may be elusive making the achievement of decisive resolution difficult the pat ient resolute and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives is often requirement for success this effort frequently involves measures from all instruments of us national power to supplement military efforts 347 perseverance in pursuit of us objectives is fundamental to the conduct of arsof uw if the seeking out and support of democratic elements in ev ery nation and culture as outlined in the nss is the work of generations and arsof uw is central t ool to achieve this policy arsof uw requires persistence of usg effort far beyond most other enterprises of g overnment one appeal of most so such as direct action to policy makers and commanders is that so are of relativel short duration and often promise dramatic and easily quantifiable results most arsof uw by st may take years or decades to develop properly and clear results may not be dramatic easily meas ured or readily gratified perhaps more than any other military operation arsof uw requires patient effort legitimacy 348 the purpose of legitimacy is to develop and main tain the will necessary to attain the national strategic end state the basis for legitimacy is the legality mora lity and rightness of the actions undertaken as well as the will of the us public to support the acti ons legitimacy is frequently decisive element the perception of legitimacy by the us public is strengthened if obviou s national or humanitarian interests are at stake and american lives are not being needlessly or carelessly placed at risk chapter 3 312 fm 305130 30 september 2008 other interested audiences may include foreign nations civil populations in the uwoa and participating forces 349 arsof committed to uw operation must sustain th legitimacy of the operation and of irregular surrogates with which they work where applicable the usg must ba lance legitimacy concerns with actions by ussponsored irregular forces the usg must consider all actions in the light of potentially competing strategic and tactical requirements and must exhibit fairness in dealing with competing factions where appropriate in some cases of arsof uw the use of force is both appropriate and necessary however judicious restraint in the use of force by us and ussponsored irregular forces will likely reinforce legitimacy 350 legitimacy may depend on adherence to objectiv agreed to by the international community ensuring the action is appropriate to the situation and fairness in dealing with various factions howeve r since arsof uw is particularly useful in sensitive vironments us legitimacy may depend on the uw operation itself not being exposed by contrast exposure of or creating the percepti on of an adversarys illegitimacy is common psyop theme in arsof uw conventional warfare and ma jor combat operations 351 although conventional forces sof and the interagenc force can all play some role in any type of warfare each of these forces play s either leading or supporting ro conventional warfare which has historically been typified by mco is characterized by the predominan t role of conventional forces with sof and the interagency force in support conventional forces 352 the capstone concept for joint operations and mco describes how the future joint force intends to conduct combat operations in support of national military objectives futu re major combat operations will z provide the combat contribution to the larger pr ojection of all instruments of available national

distributed and decisive application of jo int combat power 353 personnel must consider mco iw and military support to sstr operations holistically as complementary concepts working together during crises with an end view of restoration of the rule of law and sustainable peace under civil po licing commanders and their interagency and multinational partners should assess the potential integration requirements and oppo rtunities of these operations 354 the us military will fight an uncertain and unpredictable enemy r even more demanding multiple enemy forces simultaneously in widely di spersed joint operations areas joas the future environment will be characterized by z globalization z complex terrain z dynamic coalitions alliances and partnerships policy and doctrine 30 september 2008 fm 305130 313 355 the joint force will face range of adaptive thinking adversaries with access to militarily useful capabilities these adversaries will sometimes pose co mplex combinations of traditional irregular catastrophic and disruptive challenges the military problem 356 adversaries with capable militaries including acces s denial io advanced conventional wmd and iw capabilities may creatively use them in new ways to coerce or attack us fr iends or allies threaten regional stability or take other actions that pose an unacceptab threat to the united states the us military must be capable of defeating such adversaries while minimiz ing the prospects for unintended escalation and considering the burdens of postwar transition and reconstruction 357 the military problem describes the enemy and its behavior using systems ap proach disintegration of the enemy system through integrated destruction and dislocation w ill be the defeat mechanism used to compel the enemy to accede to us will the military solution 358 the joint force supported by other instrument s of national power will conduct synergistic hightempo actions in multiple domains to shatter the coherence of the adversarys plans and dispositions and render him unable or unwilling to militarily oppose the achiev ement of us strategic objectives 359 should the failure of peaceful preventive measures dictate the use of force the united states preferably with multinational partners but unilatera lly if required will conduct mco to overmatch and overwhelm the enemy and deny the use of and contain enemyheld wmd 360 combat operations are those inherently military actions taken directl or indirectly to defeat an adversarys military under the longstanding principle of selfdefense commande rs may be required to conduct offensive operations against undeterred adversarie s that pose an unmistakab threat of grave harm to national security interests in any case once the co mmander decides to respond with the use of force the us military rapidly conducts joint offensive and defensive combat operations to defeat the enemy moreover the jfc must anticipate setting the conditions fo r stability in the crisis area to do this the joint force aims to see first understand first decide first and act first in cyclic process and ultimately finish decisively special operations forces 361 five basic criteria facilitate the employment of arsof in support of t he joint force campaign or operation plan oplan these criteria provide guid elines for conventional and arsof commanders and planners to use when considering the employment of arsof z is the mission appropriate commander use arsof to achieve ffects that require their unique skills and capabilities if the effects do not re quire those skills and capabilities commanders should not assign arsof to the operation commander should not use arsof as substitute for other forces z does the mission support the campaign plan if the mission does not support the jfcs campaign or major oplan the jfc should consider arsof for more appropriate missions available z is the mission operationally feasible arsof are not structured fo r attrition or forceonforce warfare as such commanders should not assi gn them to missions beyond their capabilities arsof commanders and their staffs must consider the vulnerability of arsof units to larger more heavily armed or mobile forces in hostile territory z are required resources available for the mission some arsof missions require support from other forces for success suppor t involves aiding protecting complementing and sustaining employed arsof support can include airlif t intelligence communications io medical logistics space weather and numerous other types of support although target may be chapter 3 314 fm 305130 30 september 2008 vulnerable to arsof deficiencies in supportability may affect the likelihood for success or may entirely invalidate the feasibility of employing arsof z will the outcome of the mission justify the risk arsof have high value and limited resources commanders must make sure the benefits of ccessful mission execution are measurable and in balance with the risks inherent in the mission assessment some operations that arsof can execute make only marginal contribution to the jfcs campaign plan and presen t great risk to personnel and materiel commanders should recognize the high value and lim ited resources of arsof risk management considers not only the potential loss of arsof its and equipment but also the risk of adverse effects on us diplomatic and politic interests if the mission fails army special operations forces capabilities 362 the unique capabilities of arsof including those pertinent to uw are function of the quality of arsof soldiers the training and education of those soldiers and the mission profiles the soldiers must execute the competitive arsof selection process co upled with technological training and education produces an arsof soldier who is adaptable matu re innovative culturally aware selfassured and selfreliant thus policy decision makers use arsof as force to expand the range of available options 363 arsof are specially organized trained and equi pped military forces they conduct so including uw to achieve military political economic or info rmational objectives by generally unconventional means in hostile denied or politically sensitive areas decision makers may choose the arsof option because arsof provide the broadest range of capabilities that have direct applicab ility in an increasing number of environments politicalmilitary requiremen ts frequently cast arsof into clandestine or lowvisibility environments that require oversight at the national level arsof operations differ from conventional force operations by their degree of acceptable physical and political risk their modes of employment and their operational techniques arsof allow the unified commande r or jfc to perform critical smallunit missions that directly or indirec tly support the objective of his operational mission 364 early use of arsof in an operation may prevent or limit conflict and conserve na tional resources when conflict is imminent the usg may use arsof in variety of preho stility missions to signal determination to demonstrate support to allies and to begin the co mplicated processes of positioning forces for combat and shaping the ao 365 during conflict arsof may be most effective in conducting strategic or operational economyofforce operations including uw that generate military and diploma tic advantages disproportionate to the resources they represent arsofor the irre gular forces they support when conducting uwcan locate seize or destroy strategic or operatio nal targets and obtain critical intelligence they can analyze an enemys defenses and diminish enemy morale arsof can disorganize disrupt and demoralize enemy troops they can also divert the enemys important resources 366 arsof expand the options of the president the secdef and gccs partic ularly in crises and contingencies that fall between wholly diplomatic initia tives and the overt use of large conventional forces the small size rapid reaction and selfsufficient nature of arsof elements provide military options that do not involve the risk of escalation normally associated with larger mo re visible conventional forces the use of arsof enables decision makers to prevent conflict or to limit i ts scope therefore decision makers can better control committed us forces and resources when conducting uw in support of conventional operations arsof can support irregular surrogates acting in concert with us objectives further limiting the scope of involvement by us forces 367 arsof are adept at using lethal force however arsof conducting uw need not always use let hal force in mission language skills crosscultural training regional orient ation and understanding of the political context of operational areas make arsof unpa ralleled when operating in complex environments arsof skills enable them to work as effectively with civilian populat ions as with other military forces to favorably influence situations toward us national inte rests this ability to apply discreet leverage is very important arsof contribution to the nms policy and doctrine 30 september 2008 fm 305130 315 characteristics 368 to ensure uw missions in support of conventional operations sel ected for arsof are compatible with their capabilities commanders must be fa miliar with the following so characteristics z arsof personnel undergo careful selection processes or missionspecifi c training beyond basic military skills to achieve entrylevel so skills being proficient in these skills makes rapid replacement or generation of personnel or capabilities highly unlikely z mature experienced personnel make up arsof ma ny maintain high level of competency in more than one military specialty z most arsof are regionally oriented for employment crosscultural communi cation skills are routine part of their training and represent fundamental characteristic of their utility in uw z arsof conduct specific tactical operations by small units with unique talents that directly strike or engage strategic and operational aims or objectives more importantly for uw arsof are able to persuade and provide support for irregular forces to make such engagements t hese direct tactical engagements often represent indirect operational and strategic appr oaches for the jfc z planning for so may begin at the unified joint or interagency level for exec ution that requires extensive rigorous rehearsal protracted uw campaigns usually requir early interagency coordination z so are frequently clandestine or lowvisibility operations or they may b combined with overt operations so can be covert but require declar ation of war or specific finding approved by the president or the secdef arsof can deploy at relatively low cost with low profile less intrusive than that of larger conventional forces z selected arsof units often conduct so at great distances from operational bases t hese units employ sophisticated communications systems and means of insertion suppo rt and extraction to penetrate and return from hostile denied or politically sensit ive areas z so occur throughout the range of military operations z so influence the will of foreign leadership to cr eate conditions favorable to us strategic aims and objectives z so are often highrisk operations that have limited windows of execution and re quire firsttime success however although uw will often be highrisk special operatio n it typically involves longer time frame of activities and longter m usg commitment also the results of uw operations may take years or decades to materialize arsof sf psyop and ca units are ideally suited to perform so with through or by indigenous personnel z so require theater and frequently nationallevel intelligence support z selected so especially uw require detailed knowledge of the cult ural nuances and languages of country or region where employed z so are inherently joint and sometimes multinational requiring intera gency and international coordination the contribution of arsof to national security is greatest when the jfc fully integrates arsof into his plan at the earliest stages of planning z arsof can be taskorganized quickly and deployed rapidly to provide tai lored responses to many different situations however while soldie rs can conduct uw in quick reaction to events such as oefafghanistan this quic kreaction use of uw is atypical z selected arsof can gain access to hostile and denied areas z arsof can provide limited security and medical support for themselves z selected arsof can live in austere harsh environments without extensive support for longduration operations arsof require support from the army service component command ascc z selected arsof can survey and assess local situ ations and rapidly report these assessments z selected arsof can work closely with regional military and civilian au thorities and populations chapter 3 316 fm 305130 30 september 2008 369 arsof are not substitute for conventional forces they are however n ecessary adjunct to the capabilities of existing conventional forces arsof characteristics and ability to conduct uw can contribute significantly to conventional forces and mco interagency activities 370 multinational and interagency partners have special capabiliti that contribute to achieving dominant effects in support of unified action as well as achievin g military and political objectives and end states the united states routinely integrates and ex ecutes multinational and interagency actions rapidly and coherently in support of the jfc as the jfc integrates interagency capabilities into his plan he similarly integrates arsof sf psyop and ca elem ents conducting uw in support of the conventional plan with the interagency 371 the jfc integrates multinational capabilities and co llaborates with interagency and international partner leaders during planning and throughout the campaign to achieve syner gies further isolate and deny sanctuary to the enemy the us military uses day today interactions frequent preconflict engagement venues periodic joint c2 training exercises an extensive and vigorous li aison program and an expanded collaborative information environment to build favorable and practi ced relationships with these partners the us military fosters the development of interoperable and welltrai ned alliance and coalition capabilities that can readily plug into plans and operations the u s military uses forward basing and security cooperation to build strong mutually supporting relationsh ips with these partners conceivably more permanent usled multinational force mnf hq will emerge at t he operational level in the future when mutually beneficial to the us and other supportive governments the jfc combines and exploits joint warfighting doctrine organizations training technology and leade rship with special contributions from other partners to achieve desired operationallevel objectives 372 the jfc will also use automated synchronization and coordination too ls to align and coordinate military activities with diplomatic informational economic and oth er activities within the context of coalition planning and execution vironments autonomous synchronization tools will provide traceability of allocated resources and shared responsibilities to ffects generated this synchronization record will allow national governments inte rnational organizations and cert ain ngo partners to trace their contributions to achieving common strategic objectiv as well as specific organizational objectives 373 the interagency has vital role in gaining and maintaining domina nce in the information environment strategiclevel information and influence strategies are critical to addressing traditional irregular disruptive and catastrophic challenges and extend beyond the purview of the military commander alone therefore the jfc information and influence plans must contribute to and be consistent with the higherlevel strategy accordingly wellconceived wellcoordinated nd wellexecuted operationallevel information and influence plans are critical prerequisites when dealin g with future operational challenges to decisively influence an adversary it is critical th at the united states unders tands their decisionmaking process and their perceptions onesizefitsall information campaigns or influence strategies cannot overcome the unique problems each adversary presents especially when fanaticism is primary motivator for an irregular adversary with concise strate giclevel guidance and interagency and multinational participation comprehensive information and infl uence campaign embraces strategiclevel intent and supports achievement of both military and political objectives 374 in the early stages of conflict the adversary is likely to possess the initiative in the information environment to wrest the initiative from the adversary comprehens ive set of offensive and defensive actions must occur the innovative combination of electronic weapons platforms networking systems and strategic and operationallevel psyop enabled by the netcentric operational nvironment creates significant opportunities to seize the initiative and dominate an nemy the solution set varies depending on for example whether the adversary employs traditional or irregular and asymmetri c methods and whether the center of gravity is military entity or noncombatant pop ulation essentially each operation and campaign requires customized approach within the strategic info rmation strategy to gain and maintain the initiative in the information environment 375 communication of the threat to use lethal force may be sufficient to infl uence and pressure an adversary or an equivocating actor to yield if not the actual measured us of lethal force is obviously policy and doctrine 30 september 2008 fm 305130 317 viable method to force an actor to give in to us will in either case the jfc attacks the adversarys information networks and messages to limit the advers arys ability to counter the jfcs io and influence activities the jfc understands that his options are situ ationdependent and matter of his operational art 376 how and what the media report can affect the political and public support necessary for the achievement of military objectives commanders must understand and work co ntinuously with the media to gain and maintain an information environment advantag here civilianmilitary media operations center is the jfcs focal point comprehensive and coherent media plan is necessa ry to influence populations and senior decision makers while countering adversary propaganda efforts in this regard the jfc may be wise to implement plan designed to expose affected populations to multinational force values customs beliefs and intentions this plan is critical for managing expectations allaying fear s and suspicions explaining legitimacy and generating support for the operation thus minimizi ng public unrest and possible interference to unhinge the adversarys information strategy the jfc promot counter ideology as part of his influence and io strategies that is feasible practical and be lievable by the affected civilian populations implementing such strategies may involve the early provision of mergency local communications that demonstrate coalition support to the reest ablishment of essential services 377 the jfc continuously assesses the effectiveness of ongoing io and influence activities to ensure that these operations support the overall campaign plan trusted feedback m echanism must exist to measure the degree of success otherwise the jfc may subseque ntly make critical decision s that are exactly wrong here the intelligence system culturally adept global scouts us interagency staff members trusted foreign governments and transnational corporations may provide valuable feedback and recommendations potentially the adversarytraditional or irregularor other tas may be unresponsive to ongoing jfc io and influence activities simultaneously an intelligen t and shrewd adversary may attempt to exploit the information environment to his advantage here the adversary attempt s to nullify or at least degrade us efforts in the information environment the commander must understand how his wn as well as his adversarys io and influence activities are actually proceedingsensing and understanding ground truth in timely manner are invaluable irregular warfare 378 the purpose of iw like any other form of warfare is to winto achieve the st rategic purpose of the war winning wars and campaigns involves the control of forces populat ions and territory conventional or traditional warfare is form of warfare between states that empl oys direct military confrontation to defeat an adversarys armed forces destroy an adversarys warmaking capacity or seize or retain territory to force change in an adversarys government or policies the focus of conventi onal military operations is normally an adversarys armed forces with the objective of influencing the advers arys government it generally assumes that the indigenous populations w ithin the operational area are nonbelligerents and will accept whatever political outcome th belligerent governments impose arbitrate or negotiate fundamental military objective in conventional military operations is to minimize civilian interference in those operations 379 in contrast iw focuses on the control or influence of populations not on the control of an adversarys forces or territory ultimately iw is political struggle with violent and nonviolent components the struggle is for control or influence over and the support of rel evant population the foundation for iw is the centrality of the relevant popula tions to the nature of the conflict the parties to an iw conflict whether states or armed groups seek to undermine their ad versaries legitimacy and credibility they seek to physically and psychologically isolate t heir adversaries from the relevant populations and their external supporters at the same time they also s eek to bolster their own legitimacy and credibility to exercise author ity over that same population 380 iw operations also employ subversion coercion attrition and exhaustion to undermine and erode an adversarys power influence and w ill to exercise political authority over relevant population wh at makes iw irregular is the focus of its operations relevant population its strategic purpose to gain or maintain control or influence over and the support of that relevant populat ion through political psychological and economic methods creating and maintaining an enduring functi oning state requires the government to be legitimate in the eyes of the population on the other extreme although brutal dictatorship may control population an irregular adversary can exploit t he frustration and dissatisfaction chapter 3 318 fm 305130 30 september 2008 that this type of government creat warfare that has the population as its focus of operations requires different mindset and different capabilities than warfare that focuses on defeating an adversary militarily interagency responsibilities 381 the military cannot conduct iw operations indefinitely without eventual ly needing responsive support from the interagency this interagency suppor t can come from variety of sources for example united states coalition or multinational interagency support provi ded not only must have the right skill sets and capabilities but also must meet capacity requirement s of the conflict once interagency support becomes available the military must be prepared to transition from supported role to supporting role starting with the initial design of an iw campaign planne rs must consider the relationship between military forces conducting iw and the responsibilities and roles of t he interagency in iw examples of these considerations include z what interagency support is required for successful iw operations z what interagency activities can enhance military iw operations z what military planning could be done better by an interagency partner z what are the implications related to the military performing securit diplomatic information economic nationbuilding rule of law and g overnance functions in the absence of robust interagency involvement z how long should the military be prepared to accomplish these functions before the interagency arrives in force z what conditions need to be set to allow the military to transiti on these nontraditional military support roles to the interagency special operations forces 382 iw includes wide variety of indirect operations and activities tha t occur in isolation or within traditional interstate combat operations half of the 14 componen t activities of iw are current core tasks for arsof therefore arsof usually play central and leading role in iw moreover uw is one of the iw activities and three otherssupport for insurg encies psyop and cmo as conducted by arsof through caoare the central components of the arsof uw mission 383 some iw activities such as terrorism and transnati onal crime violate international law us law and national policy prohibit us military forces or gas from engaging in or supporting such

rpose of insurgency is to overthrow and replace an established government or societal structure rrorism and ct are activities conducted as part of iw and are frequently subactivities of insurgency and coin however terrorism may also stand alone when its purpose is to coerce or intimidate governments or societies without overthrowin g them fid refers to the participation of the agencies of one government in the programs of anot her government to free and protect its society from subversion lawlessness and insurgency fid is thus the ext ernal support component of coin 385 uw most frequently refers to the military and paramilitary aspects of an i nsurgency designed to resist overthrow or gain political autonomy from an established government or used to resist or expel foreign occupying po wer however uw can also refer to milita ry and paramilitary support to an irregular armed group seeking increased power and influence rela tive to its political rivals without overthrowing the central government and in the absen ce of foreign occupying power sstr operations are an essential component of coin campaigns but sstr operations such as foreign disaster relie f or foreign humanitarian assistance fha can also occur ou tside the context of iw or armed conflict 386 psyop cmo io and intelligence and law enforcem ent activities can occur in mco iw or sstr operations they are listed above because their role in iw is often propor tionally greater than is the case in mco they all directly affect the operational focus of iwthe relevant populationsin ways that combat operations do not 387 in practice most wars and campaigns are hybrids of conventional and iw operations the balance or primary focus of operations gives war campai gn or major operation its predominant character conventional forces 388 campaign planning for support of iw operations in long war is differe nt than planning for shorter conventional operations against an adversary during mco the adversary faced during iw operations usually operates without space and time limits he may be state or nonsta actor and he often employs asymmetric tactics in complex environment the popu lation is important as is thorough understanding of religious cultural and economic influences in this regard the jf c and his staff must be able to effectively accomplish responsive operational planning using techniques t hat effectively respond to the iw threat operational command techniques that will work best for th conduct of iw campaigns and operations during the long war are still evolving conventional force s are likely to play supporting role in most iw efforts unconventional warfare within irregular warfare 389 while conventional forces most often play the leading role in convent ional warfare and the interagency can be expected to take the leading role in iw with or without supporting uw effort uw is most often led by sof sofled uw campaign will usually require some interagency support and may occasionally involve suppor t by conventional forces special operations forces 390 the application of uw envisioned by joint iw planne rs differs from the more traditional uses of uw and requires further analysis the characteristics of how arsof conduct u w are unchanged regardless of declared adversary arsof operations including u w and arsof units are flexible however joint iw planners properly identify that uw conducted within iw during the 21st century wot has nontraditional threat characteristics z first nonstate actors do not have the same centers of gravity or the traditi onal infrastructure that have been the critical nodes for planning traditional uw operations z second unlike more typical uw campaigns agains t hostile states or occupying powers future campaigns will be conducted against nonstate actors operating eit her within or behind the laws of nonbelligerent states with which the united stat is not at war whereas this is normally the purview of ogas analysis of potential support that the joint forc may be required to provide to chapter 3 320 fm 305130 30 september 2008 support those agencies in that operational area must be done to accurately determine true picture of the scope of global iw support requirements z finally uw campaigns also will be conducted against nonstate acto rs existing outside of the normal institutions of state such as ungoverne d or undergoverned area s or within hostile state that harbors either w ittingly or unwittingly these nonst ate actors within its borders interagency responsibilities 391 just as the global environment of the 21st centu ry and the challenges of the wot have caused military operations to become more innovative and flexible so too m ust the interagency adopt new approaches to wielding us national power in combating adversarie s political authorities must find innovative ways to manipulate all instruments of us national power agai nst elusive opponents and their supporters the interagency can apply economic and fi nancial incentives and disincentives to interdict adversary financing support partners and allies and dissuade adversary supporters us law enforcement entities must cooperate with each othe r international partners and th dod to maximize intelligence and legitimacy and to constrain adversary freedom of move ment the legitimacy of iw efforts must be central and persistent theme of any holistic and coordinated information operation any uw effort within an iw campaign should integrate the interagency conventional forces 392 the jfc and his staff must be able to effectivel accomplish responsive operational planning using techniques that effectively respond to the iw threat in some cases ch as oefafghanistan or oif the jfc will conduct mco and iw with uw operations simultaneously in other c ases such as oefphilippines or oefcolombia iw possibly with uw operations will be the main effort with conventional forces playing mu ch smaller and supporting role 30 september 2008 fm 305130 41 chapter 4 planning considerations unconventional wa rfare planning 41 uw planning begins at the theater and national levels typically using classifi ed channels in most cases arsof personnel expand the planning effort to provide subjectmatter expertise and additional planning manpower the plan incorporates interagency participation and the contributions of other dod elements 42 the actual planning of uw effortwhether it is deliberate or crisisaction planningutilizes the standard joint operation planning process or military decisionmak ing process described in jp 50 joint operation planning fm 50 army planning and orders production and fm 305 as any uw effort will include more than just the military instrument of na tional power an effectsbased approach to planning may be especially useful 43 the following paragraphs discuss the arsof imperatives and their pplicability to uw although the imperatives may not equally apply to all specific uw situations arsof commanders must consider each during mission pla nning and execution understand the operational environment 44 the most important arsof planning consideration is to understand the environme nt where the unit will operate this consideration may be divided into two factorsin ternal and external internal factors 45 the civilian population is the critical internal factor arsof planners must understand the demography culture taboos beliefs customs history goals ethnic composition nd expectations of the civilian population most importantly planners must recognize the dynamics of the many correlations among the various aspects of society planners must be aware of who the agents of influence are who they target and how that influence may be achieved and exercised they must also be aware

this they must have clear understanding of the charter and goals of the total us effort although it is impossible to predict every situation an d write specific roe or co as to address them an executing element that understands the commanders inte nt can respond with rapid flexibility to unforeseen and unplanned circumstances recognize political implications 48 uw has political end state every act from advising military activ ities to an informal conversation carries with it the potential for political impact arsof planners should not anticipate conventional environment that is dominated by traditional military concerns that are separate from political context whether conducting uw as an independent arsof operation or in conj unction with conventional forces arsof planners must consider both the short and ngterm political implications of proposed action facilitate interagency activities 49 uw both by definition and actual implementation is an interagency effort in which military operations represent only one partand not always the most important partof th overall us program arsof must be aware of all agencies comprising the uw effort arsof may also act as the liaison between the irregular organizations us agencies and other dod components to ensu re the achievement of synergy when participating in an interagency and often joint effort arsof must strive for unity of effort and recognize the difficulty in achieving it arsof must also antic ipate ambiguous missions conflicting interests and goals and disunity of effort engage the threat discriminately 410 the arsof commander must know when where and how to employ assets base d upon short and longterm objectives during uw efforts this imperative contains thre key components for the arsof planner selection and distribution of resources traini ng advice and assistance an d tactical considerations selection and distribution of resources 411 the first component of engaging threats discriminately involves the sele ction and distribution of resources for both personnel and materiel appropriateness not mass is the standard arsof commanders must ensure that units selected for the mission are capable qualified trained and nece ssary for the effort the desired outcome is to minimize the us presence while maximizing the us impact in realizing objectives training advice and assistance 412 the second component of engaging threats discriminately is selecting what tr aining advice and assistance to provide because resources are normal ly limited in uw envi ronment arsof must use them wisely for best effect based upon arsof understanding of the ope rational environment and its complex internal dynamics arsof must carefully select which particular training to provide and advice to offer commanders must consider the impact that trai ning and advice will have against the threat as well as the political implications of the type of assistance provided to fo reign nationals tactical considerations 413 the third component of engaging threats discrimina tely deals with tactical considerations arsof must carefully target tactical operations in uw to ensure success and avoid alienating the civilian population planning considerations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 43 consider the longterm effects 414 uw efforts are typically longterm affairs however such operations can so result in dramatic regime change in relatively short period planners must analyze cond itions in the uwoa and the irregular forces involved and they must understand higher hqs intent and the overall operational scheme this analysis enables planners to effectively dete rmine the anticipated duration of operations and to adequately plan for linkup operations and the transition of irregular lements arsof units must recognize that the operational scheme may be nonmilitary in nature 415 planners should consider each problem in its broa der political military and psychological context arsof units often must allow for legal and political constraints to void strategic failure while achieving tactical success they must not jeopardize the success of longterm th eater goals with the desire for immediate shortterm success policies plans and operations must be consis tent with us national and theater priorities and the objectives that they support ensure legitimacy and credibility of special operations 416 significant moral and legal considerations often exist in uw effort legitimacy is the most crucial factor in developing and maintaining international and interna l support without this support the united states cannot sustain assistance to an irregular fo rce without recognized legitimacy and credibility military operations do not receive the support of the indigenous population t he us population or the international community anticipate and control psychological effects 417 all operations and activities in uw environment have significant psychological effects combat operations and civic action programs are two examples of the type of operations or activities with obvious psychological effects arsof may conduct some opera tions and activities specifically to produce desired psychological effect negative ps ychological impact may overshadow or negate tactical victory recognizing that perceptions may be more important than reality in the uw arena arsof must strive to ensure that all audiences understand operations losing control of perceptions may result in distortion of facts and may even diminish or destroy the gains of even superbly planned and xecuted missions apply capabilities indirectly 418 the role of arsof in uw is to advise train an d aid irregular forces the area commander typically assumes primary authority and responsibility for the ccess or failure of this co mbined effort successful usadvised operations reinforce and enhance the legitimacy and credibility of the area command and irregular forces uw is fundamentally political activity to persuade surrogates to act in concert with us objectives which is an indirect application of us power develop multiple options 419 arsof elements engaged in uw operation must recognize and prepare for possibl contingencies and followon missions arsof personnel must plan to use their range of expertise eve n if not specifically tasked to do so change of operational environment may dictate change of mission or roe arsof maintains operational flexibility by visualizing and developing broad range of options and concept plans thereby enabling personnel to shift from one option to another before and duri ng mission execution ensure longterm sustainment 420 arsof involved in uw effort must avoid advising or training the irregular forces in techniques and procedures that extend beyond the forces sustainment capabili ties for example planners may modify us ttp including tactical communications demolitions we apons systems and logistics to negate the threat and allow for training programs and equipment that are durable consis tent and sustainable by the irregular forces chapter 4 44 fm 305130 30 september 2008 provide sufficient intelligence 421 intelligence forms the basis for all uw activities nd programs uw operations depend upon detailed and comprehensive intelligence on all aspects of the operational environment and its internal dynamics commanders establish the priority of effort when th ey identify intelligence requirements arsof in uw environment often use classified techniques to acquire intelligence that identifies the enemys locations and intentions for future operations however not all threats may come from an identifiable enemy arsof should consider the nonmilitary thr eats posed by the civil sector such as criminal ac tivities hazardous materials civil unrest and disease the knowledge gained through intelligence collection activities enables arsof to effectively advise train and employ the irregular force effective operations security opsec requires an alert organization that can assess the hos tile threat warn the unit and take timely action to penetrate and neutralize the hostile effort balance security and synchronization 422 arsof elements performing uw mission can often provide significant help to ot her sof and conventional forces in accomplishing their missions in order to address s ecurity concerns so often operate in compartmentalized manner however compartmentaliza tion must allow for key personnel to participate in the planning process although insuff icient security may certai nly compromise mission excessive security will usually cause the mission to fail primarily because of inadequate facetoface coordination leaders must constantly strive to achieve an effective bala nce of security and missionplanning synchronization maintain force protection 423 fp during uw is similar to that during any other operation or deployment fp is mission enhancernot mission the arsof commanders fp plan normally includes ll actionsranging from standard antiterrorism items to medical and sanitation issues t tactics used in the fieldthat ensure the forces ability to achieve mission success arsof lead ers however usually face unique challenge in maintaining fp because of the operational environm ent and the typically sm all size of the element conducting uw ussocom directive 5254 antiterrorism fouo and united states army special operations command usasoc directive 52513 plans and operationsforce protection fouo provide an outline of fp requirements the size of the arsof element mission requirements and guidance

provides detailed explanation of these ttp seven phases of unco nventional warfare 424 each application of uw is unique particularly when applied against nonstate actors however ussponsored uw efforts generally pass through the following seven dis tinct phases z preparation z initial contact z infiltration z organization z buildup z employment z transition 425 some of the phases may occur simultaneously orin certain situationsnot at all for example large and effective resistance movement may require only logistical support th ereby bypassing the organization phase the phases may also occur out of sequence with each recei ving varying degrees of emphasis one example of this is when members of an irregular force are xfiltrated to partner nation pn to be trained and organized before infiltratin g back into the uwoa either with or without the arsof unit in this case the typical order of the phases would change planning considerations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 45 phase i preparation 426 usg activities that deliberately alter or shape the potential perational environment enhance the gccs war plans oplans and contingency plans every uw situation is unique but all instruments of us national power can potentially play role in influencing and shaping t he uwoa as part of uw campaign much of the arsof role in such shaping activities is cl assified fm 305201 contains further information on this subject integrated usg uw preparation of the environment pe activities can create or affect local regional and global conditions that are beneficial to future uw operations pe happens globally and continuously outside of and be fore uwoa is officially designated once the usg designates an area as uwoa pe may expand 427 the preparation phase for uw is part of threestep process that consists of intelligence preparation of the operational environment ipoe war planning and shaping activities first ipoe attempts to graphically represent the current reality and predict probable enem coas in the uwoa second war planning describes future military operations third shaping activiti work to modify the uwoa to make it more conducive to all types of future operations 428 the preparation phase must begin with complete ipoe this phase includes thorough analysis of the local populace and if applicable the irregular forces strengths weaknesses logistic concerns levels of training and experience political or military agendas factional relationships and external political ties arsof units must consider the roles of dimefil elementsthe instruments of us national power when planning the employment of uw developing systems perspective of the ao t hrough systems analysis can facilitate understanding of complex enviro nments in which uw occu rs in addition to this data analysts should complete thorough area study of the ao this area st udy should include but is not limited to issues regarding politics religion economic s weather living standards medicine education government services and so on once planners initially assess the uwoa participating arsof elements ensure that the joint force commander jfc is awar of arsof capabilities to shape the uwoa and they recommend interagency participation in the effort as appropriate phase ii initial contact 429 ideally pilot team should make initial contact with an estab lished or potential irregular element however there may be occasions wh the infiltrating arsof unit make s initial contact pilot team is typically preplanned ad hoc interagency element composed of indiv iduals possessing specialized skills during contact pilot team personnel begin the assessment of the po tential to conduct uw in the uwoa and the compatibility of us and local interests and objectives with the uwoa this procedure not only allows for an accurate assessment of uw capability in the uwoa but also arra nges for the reception and initial assistance of additional arsof elements typically an sf unit if deemed necessary the theater special operations command tsoc may arrange to exfiltrate an asset from the uwoa to brief the arsof elements during planning once the theater command or tsoc d etermines the feasibility of developing the area the president or secdef may dir ect the infiltration of additional arsof elements the pilot team may then remain with thes followon units or may exfiltrate phase iii infiltration 430 during this phase the arsof units infiltrate the uwoa infiltration may be as overt as using chartered civilian flight or as discreet as cl andestine insertion missi on requirementsalong with mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support availabletime available and civil considerations metttcdetermine the most desira ble method of infiltration after infiltration the arsof unit links up with the pilot team or irregular force because the infiltration phase is not complete until the initial entry report is sent to the units higher hq the arsof unit must submit this rep ort as soon as possible upon infiltrationeven if they fail to contact the irregula r force immediately upon infiltration the arsof unit continues the area assessment initiated by the pilot team to confirm or refute the previously received information the arsof unit must continue to report all relevant operational information to higher hq chapter 4 46 fm 305130 30 september 2008 phase iv organization 431 during the organization phase the arsof unit begins to develop the capability of the irregular force depending on the size and scope of the arso f effort the size of this force can range from one individual to resistance element of potentially an size planners traditionally conceive uw with an emphasis on guerrilla warfare such efforts may enta il the organization of large guerrilla units to conduct combat operations and sf are specially designed to organize such elements however re sistance or insurgency is not solely guerrilla warfare effort th organization of resistance or insurgent elements may involve other arsof personnel with psyop ca or other skill sets although each irregular force or organization in uw is unique the traditional arsof practice of conceiving uw as us support to an insurgency or resistance movement provides unifying general concept for irregul ar force organizational structure although support for classic insurgency or resistance against state opponents may be less common in the 21st century arsof retain this capab ility and use this traditional unifying concept as reference template against which arsof soldiers are assessed trained and employed in uw the components of an insurgency 432 arsof units subdivide an insurg ency into three componentsguer rillas underground and the auxiliary these elements are designed to be z selfsufficient and selfcontained z capable of centralized command but decentralized execution z redundant in the event th at the enemy destroys portion of the element 433 the insurgency support mechanisms need to remain hidden in order to survive for this reason they remain partially compartmentalized dispersed and fluid the organization mu st constantly adapt to the changing security environment and avoid establishing predictable patterns elements are organizednot according to any templatebased upon the needs of the region 434 the overall insurgent organization or resistance group is not referred to as military unit rather the element is titled an area command this label indicates the focus of organizational upon an area or region andunlike traditional military unitsis not based upon specifi c number of personnel for this reason the overall indigenous commander is doctrinally refe rred to as the area commande r subordinate commands within an area command are known as sector co mmands these subordinate commands encompass all elements within their resp ective areas this decentralization allows the sector commands to control all of the functions required to operate independently while maintaining t he ability rather than the necessity to centralize or coordinate operations with the area command 435 the area command is not separate physical node like the three standard compon ents of the insurgency figure 41 page 47 the area command is instead integrat ed throughout these components at all levels of the irregular organization the area co mmand is made up from the leadership cells of the underground auxiliary and guerrillas as well as mbers of arsof most typically sf when present in the uwoa many of these leaders ma function as deliberate or fact leaders of shadow government within the uwoa or as government in exile if it exists key movement leaders who provide strategic political direction may also be identifiable in the shadow govern ment or government in exile 436 the three components of the insurgency do not nece ssarily represent three distinct groups or units they more accurately describe three types of individuals within the or ganization all three components provide different functions that support the overall goals of the organizati on the size of the components will vary according to the unique conditions present in each uwoa for example in urban environments the ratio of underground and auxiliary personnel to guerrillas may be much high er than is true in rural environments the guerrillas 437 guerrillas represent the most commonly recognized portion of the in surgency they are group of irregular predominantly indigenous personnel organized along military line s to conduct paramilitary operations in enemyheld hostile or denied territory guerrillas carry out mos t of the armed conflict that openly challenges the regional authority planning considerations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 47 figure 41 classic components of an insurgency in an unconventional warfare operational area the underground 438 the underground is cellular organization within the irregular movement that is responsible for subversion sabotage intelligence collection and ot her compartmentalized activities most underground operations are required to take place in and around po pulation centers as such the underground must have the ability to conduct op erations in areas that are usually inaccessibl to the guerrillas such as areas under government military control underground members ofte n fill leadership positions overseeing specific functions that auxiliary workers carry out the u nderground and auxiliaryalthough technically separate unitsare in reality loosely connected elements th at provide coordinated capabilities for the irregular movement the key distinction between them is that the underground is the ement of the irregular organization that operates in areas denied to the guerrilla force s pecific functions of the underground and auxiliary include the following z control of intelligence and ci networks z control of clandestine movement networks z direction and coordination of psyop and io against the government the pop ulation and the international community z direction and coordination of urban cells used to conduct acts of sabotage z operation of the command structure or shadow government if present z control of cells used to neutralize informants and collaborators the underground and auxiliary typically conduct this activity to meet the tactical necessi ty as well as to serve as deterrent to other members of the population that may be co nsidering collaboration with the enemy such activities are normally coordinated with the ci and psyop cells 439 underground members are sometimes considered the professional revolutionaries of an irregular movement they may be indigenous or professionals from another country the unde rground members sometimes operate using false identity and are less likely to be ac tive members of the community whereas auxiliary members most often tend to live double lives b providing parttime support and still acting as actual members of the community governme nt suspicion often forces auxiliary workers to abandon their normal lives within the community these individuals are typically well suited to become part of the guerrilla force or to serve as undergroun d members in charge of other auxiliary workers who can still function within the community 440 undergrounds are more likely in urban environments where the proximity nd concentration of adversary forces make overt irregu lar operations more dangerous the underground performs its functions in urban environments by operating in small co mpartmentalized cells and by utilizing safe houses chapter 4 48 fm 305130 30 september 2008 apparently innocent houses or premises established by an organizatio n for the purposes of conducting clandestine or covert activity in relative security members condu ct activities with minimum of contact between personnel and in such manner as to not draw attention to unusual activity the core underground cadre members survive by maintainin g secrecy compartmentalizing information and having their auxiliary workers assume the majority of the risk the auxiliary 441 the auxiliary is the primary support element of the irregular organization whose organization and operations are clandestine in nature and whose members do not openly indicat their sympathy or involvement with the irregular movement this support enables the guerrilla forceand often the undergroundto survive and function this support can take the form of logistics labor or intelligence although many functions of the auxiliary and underground overlap auxiliaries are more likely in rural environments where the relative distance and dispersion of adversary force s permit operations by guerrilla or other armed irregular forces members of the au xiliary are sometimes characterized as parttime members of the irregular organization continuing to participate in the life of th eir communityto all appearances concerned only with their normal occupa tionsand at the same time engaging in irregular operations to varying degrees local cell or element l eaders organize and coordinate all efforts which the area or sector command directs these various elements may serve as support cells within compartmentalized support networks specific functions of the auxili ary include z managing logistics z providing security and early warning rural and urban z conducting ci z conducting intelligence gathering z recruiting personnel z conducting psyop to include subversion z running safe houses or portions of networks the mass base 442 finally although not traditionally considered component of usspon sored insurgent or resistance movement the larger indigenous population from which the irregular forces are drawn must be an organizational consideration uw is an elemen tal iw activity as such influence over relevant population is critical communist insurgents of the 20th century refe rred to the general population in uwoa as the mass base insurgent leaders tasked elements of the underground with infiltrating civil institutions and manipulating popular grievances and overt ind igenous political activities to support insurgent objectives many of these activities such as strikes labo r unrest food riots and so on may be effective methods of combating and weakening the adversary government without being di rectly associated with the insurgent effort the participants in such masspopular activities may be unaware that of their manipulation by and for the insurgent moveme nt therefore practitioners of uw cannot consider these participants direct part of the insurgent organization however practitioners should take the insurgencys use of these participants in uss ponsored uw effort into account as an adjunct organizational factor therefore uw leaders must continuously emphasize t he maintenance of influence over this group other organizational considerations 443 arsof personnel establish rapport with the local leadership by demonstr ating an understanding of confidence in and concern for the group and its cause if necessary arsof units explain their capabilities and limitations and begin the development of th organization during subsequent operations the arsof unit may have to prove its value in actual operations buil ding rapport is difficult and complicated process that is based largely on mutual trust confidence and understanding it is rarely accomplished overnight 444 during the organization phase larger irregular orga nizations require more detailed work than smaller groups before larger irregular or ganization can successfully engage in operations the leadership must planning considerations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 49 organize an infrastructure that can sustain itself and withstand t he anticipated hostile reaction by opposing forces during this phase the leadership may identify cadre that will serve as the organizational nucleus during the buildup phase the arsof units assist the leadership in conducting the cadre training program to prepare for the eventual buildup of the organization 445 when working with an irregular element the local leader nd arsof unit commander must agree upon c2 arrangements arsof personnel normally advise and assist counterpart irregular leaders in some situations arsof members may actually direct some activities 446 the specifics of the irregular organization depend upon local conditions nd usg requirements uw requires centralized direc tion and decentralized execution under conditions th at place great demands on the organization and its leadership two irregular orga nizations will require the same degree or level of organization the arsof unit commander should consider the followi ng factors when advising any irregular leadership regarding organization z effectiveness of the existing organization z extent of cooperation between the or ganization and the local populace z hostile activity and security measures z political boundaries natural terrain features potential targets popul ation density and other characteristics of the uwoa z religious ethnic political and ideological diff erences among elements of the population and competing organizations z proposed type and scope of uw operations z degree of us influence with the irregular organization 447 although the classic and unifyin g conceptual template of ar sof uw remains support to insurgency resistance or conventional military operations not all instanc of uw operations fit neatly into this concept in the 21st century uw conducted by with or through irregu lar forces such as the northern alliance in afghanistan or the united kurdish fo rces in northern iraq still fits the classic concept well other uw operations however such as those conducted in support of fid coin or other iw activities as mentioned in chapter 1 or those conducte d in nonbelligerent states or ungoverned territories are more organizationally counterintu itive just because arsof have the capability to train advise and assist sizeable irregular forces and organizations in hostile or denied areas does not mean that arsof uw must be conducted only in such areas and only with large elements espec ially in the context of combating global terrorism uwoa may be large and not entirely inside hostile or denied t erritory and uw organizations can be very small or diffuse 448 circumstances may dictate that certain members of the irregular force b exfiltrated from the immediate uwoa to designated safe haven or pn once there they may organize train and coordinate with other elements before reinsertion this traine d cadre may more effectively form the core for the established infrastructure phase v buildup 449 the buildup phase involves the expanding of the irregular elements and th eir capabilities to meet mission objectives arsof unit tasks include infiltra tion or procurement of equipment and supplies to support this expansion and subsequent operations during the buildup phase the ar sof unit assists the cadre in expanding into an effective organization that is capable of condu cting operations because successful missions lead to increas in recruitment leaders should initially select confidence targets those with high probability of success and low risk to the irregular force ir regular force missions and tactics normally dictate simple mobile and flexible organiza tion that is capable of rapid dispersion and reconsolidation in response to the tactical situati on each unit is normally selfcontained with its own intelligence communications and logistics systems 450 uw planners need to consider th appropriate level of capability an d then balance the intended size of irregular forces against the requirement for re duced signature this focus should be on the capability required for the mission not on the size of the force as an organization gr ows it creates larger signature thereby degrading the ability to conduct clandestine operations if the irregular force begins noticeable chapter 4 410 fm 305130 30 september 2008 operations too early opposition forces may concentrate efforts on the irregula r force and diminish their chances of mission success 451 in some instances such as with the northern alliance in afghanist an in 2001 this phase may be relatively short in such cases th buildup phase mainly consists of coordinating with the preexisting resistance organization developing combined standing operating proce dures sops and fire control measures and then moving directly to the sixth phaseemployment phase vi employment 452 during the employment phase indigenous or other irregular forces increasingly operate in combat or hostile environment these operations build in scope and size to support the objectives of the area command if applicable and the theater commander the arsof unit ens ures that effects of the activities continue to support the goals of the theater commander these operations range from interdiction wit h guerrilla forces designed to drain the hostile power s morale and resources through combat to active intelligence collection with an indigenous informant network re gardless of the type of operation the overall purpose is to achieve strategic politicalmilitary objectives even when the uw operation involves combat actions such combat employment does not necessarily require arsof units to be physically engaged in combat it involves the c onduct of operations in combat or hostile environment in addition planners may use irregular forces to achieve objectives without direct us participation 453 when uw operations are in support of mco of conventional forces arsof must give careful attention to the capabilities of irregular forces and to coordination and deconfliction of such uw operations with theater objectives uw forces can indirectly support conventi onal operations through interdictions and diversions throughout their uwoa or more directly support conventional movem ent by providing security of routes drop zones dzs beach landing sites and so on planners must carefully coordinate any subsequent linkup between irregula r and conventional forces following successful linkup uw forces may potentially continue to support conventional mco thr ough such activities as reconnaissance rear area security or support to cmo phase vii transition 454 transition is the final most difficult and most sensitive phase of uw operations the planning for transition begins when the usg decides to sponsor an irregular or ganization and ends in the uwoa upon cessation of hostilities or operations transition does not nece ssarily mean demobilization or the commencement of fid operations however it usually re quires some form of stability operations some sf units may focus continuing uw efforts on providing curity with their irregular counterparts to begin conducting fid operations other arsof units may also continue to conduct uw activities in support of larger fid mission ca will usually play leading role in transition by facilitating assistance from nonmilitary organizations preplanned psyop themes will explain hn and directly or indirectly us goals and enhance compliance by population groups in the uwoa 455 civilian usg agencies along with international organizations and agencies such as the normally assist in the transition of any organized military groups rsof units may help these agencies conduct transition using their knowledge of both the terrain and the forces w ithin the uwoa the manner in which transition occurs affects the postwar attitudes of the pe ople and the government toward the united states the greatest transition danger is the possib ility that former resistance members may resort to subversion of the new government factional disputes or banditry the ne w government brings arms and ammunition under its control to ensure public security and to return to functional civil structure based on the rule of law the government helps former resi stance forces integrate into the newly reconstituted national army police forces or other security forces or assists their ret urn to previous occupations the new government must make every effort to reorient fo rmer resistance members to peaceful society and to gain their trust unconventional warf are termination of operations 456 the nature of the termination will shape the futures of the conte sting nations or groups it is essential to understand that termination of operations is an ssential link between national security strategy national planning considerations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 411 defense strategy national military strategy and the national strate gic end state furthermore other military operations and usg activities will normally continue after the conclu sion of any uw combat operations an extended us presence is required to conduct stab ility operations to enable legitimate civil authority and to attain the national strategic end state planners must ddress the consideration of stability operations at the initiation of uw planning and must continually update the uw plan during execution historically stability operations have required extended us presence and assistan ce planners should consider this contingency during the initial coa development and execution recomme ndation termination approaches 457 there are three approaches for achieving national strate gic objectives by military force the first is to force an imposed settlement by the threat to occupy or the actual occupation ofan enemys territory and domination of his land resources and people the threat or actual occupati on of the territory can be supported by destruction of critical functions and assets such as c2 or infrast ructure which makes the adversary unable to resist the imposition of us will 458 the second approach seeks negotiated settlement through coordinated p olitical diplomatic military and economic actions that convince an adversary that yieldi ng will be less painful than continuing to resist negotiating power in armed conflict springs fr om three sources national resolve military success and military potential history has demonstrated that us national resolve is the most important source of negotiating power when impressing upon an adversary the need to neg otiate conclusion to conflict military success provides military geographic political psychological or economi c advantage and sets the stage for negotiations military potential may compel the opposi ng nation or group to consider negotiated conclusion negotiating an advantageous conclusion to operations requir time power and the demonstrated will to use both in addition to imposed and negotiated termination there may be an armistice or truce which is negotiated intermission in opera tions not peace in effect it is device to buy time pending negotiation of permanent settlement or resumption of operations 459 the third approach for ach ieving national security objectives in relation to the irregular challenges posed by nonstate actors is an indirect approach th at erodes an adversarys pow er influence and will undermines the credibility and legitimacy of its po litical authority and undermines the adversarys influence with control over and support by the indigenous population 460 even when pursuing an imposed termination the usg requires some means of communication with the adversary declarations of intentions requirements and minor concessions ma speed conflict termination as the adversary considers the advantages of early termination versus extended resistance 461 an adversarys will and freedom of action affect s termination once the adversarys strategic objective shifts from maintaining or extending gains to reducing sses the possibilities for negotiating an advantageous termination improve the usg needs to coordinate the effort s of all the instruments of national power toward causing and exploiting such shift the usg must conside r termination of operations from the outset of planning termination should be coordinat ed interagency igo ngo and multinational effort that is refined as opera tions move toward advantageous termination the national strategic end state 462 the first political task regarding termination is termining an achievable national strategic end state based on clear national strategic objectives for situations that require t he employment of military capabilities particularly for anticipated major operations the pre sident and secdef will establish set of national strategic objectives achieving these objectives i s necessary to attain the national strategic end statethe broadly expressed dime conditions that should exist after th campaign or operation the supported ccdr must work closely with the civilian leadership to ensure c learly defined national strategic end state is determined thinking of this end st ate as an integrated set of aims is useful because national strategic objectives usually are closely relate d rather than independent the supported ccdr often has role in achieving more than one national strategic objective some national strategic objectives will be the primary responsibility of the supported ccdr while others will require more balanced use of all instruments of national power with the ccdr in support of other agencies ther efore considering all of the objectives necessary to reach the national strategic end state w ill help the supported ccdr formulate chapter 4 412 fm 305130 30 september 2008 proposed termination criteriathe specified standards ap proved by the president or secdef that must be met before joint operation can be concluded comm anders and their staffs must understand that many factors can affect national strategic objectives possibly causing the national strategic end state to change even as military operations unfold military considerations 463 in its strategic context the measure of military ccess is in the attainment of military objectives supporting the national strategic end state and associated termination criteria termination criteria for negotiated settlement will differ significantly from thos of an imposed settlement planners should review military strategic advice to civilian leadership regarding terminat ion criteria for military feasibility adequacy and acceptability as well as estimates of the costs and military forces required to reach the criteria implementing military commanders should reques t clarification of the national strategic end state and termination criteria from higher authority when nece ssary an essential consideration is ensuring that the longerterm stabilization and enabling of civil authority need ed to achieve national strategic objectives continues upon the conclusion of sustained operations stabilit operations that support sstr efforts primarily support ogas igos and ngos to restore civil authority rebuild the infrastructure and reestablish commerce education nd public utilities leaders should initiate planning for these operations when the joint operation planning process begins

engaged in insurgency resistance or otherwise supporting us conven tional operations arsof need to participate in this strategiclevel joint analysis by all other relevant members of the interagency to ensure an integrated response dynamics that drive and mitigate conflict are complex and interrelated diplomatic development or military action alone cannot address these dynamics independe nt analyses

integrated usg uw preparation activities can create or affect local regional and global conditions that are beneficial to future uw operations phase ii initial contact 56 ideally pilot team makes initial contact with an establish ed or potential irregular element the intent of pilot teams is to make initial liaison with irregular elements within the uwoa to coordinate and establish plans and procedures for subsequent friendly infiltration and the conduct of future uw activities since most uwoas are in denied and hostile territory the presence and ac tivities of the pilot team usually chapter 5 52 fm 305130 30 september 2008 represent hazardous and often politically sensitive mission sta ndard sfoda can function as pilot team when directed however since each uw missi on will have unique characteristics specific to the situation sf groups commonly establish temporary ad hoc pilot teams from group perso nnel this arrangement is often desirable because it allows the sf group to us the broad range of skills experience and language and theater expertise resident in the regionally oriente d sf group sf soldiers typically lead such teams however the team may include psyop ca intelligence or other soldiers with relevant expertise teams can also expect to have particip ants from ogas moreover given the interagency nature of arsof uw it is equally common for sf soldiers to augment pilot team s led by and primarily constituted of oga personnel 57 the pilot team assesses the potential of the uwoa and gains rapport with the irregular force the time needed to accomplish these tasks depends on the operational environment th maturity and numbers of irregular forces and the tactical situation once approved by the tsoc for further development the pilot team plans and coordinates for the reception staging onward movement and integrat ion of all followon detachments infiltrating the uwoa phase iii infiltration 58 the success of an sfodas inf iltration of designated uwoa depends primarily on detailed planning and preparation procedures and techniques for employing any one of the fo ur general methods of infiltration will be dependent on certain factors being pr esent that will enhance the success of the mission depending upon the situation the sfoda may need to use number of these methods concurrently air infiltration 59 air delivery by parachute is one of the principle m eans available for the infiltration of sfodas in most instances standard troop carrier aircraft are well equipped and satisfy airdrop requirements some situations may dictate requirement for aircraft capable of parachute delivery of pe rsonnel and equipment from high altitudes using freefall parachute techniques or staticline stabilization chute descent to low altitude in addition assaulttype aircraft as well as amphibious and utility types used by several services may be available in varying numbers some situations may require that these aircraft be able to use relatively short unprepared airstrip s and to conduct airlanding operations during infiltration under certain circumstances longerrange tactical aircraft may be used water infiltration 510 arsof may frequently employ water infiltration by either unde rsea craft or surf ace craft in uwoas with exposed coastlines coastal river junctions and harbors water infi ltration using seaplane landings on large bodies of water rivers or coastal waters may be possible in such case s planning by the commander considers the shiptoshore movement and subsequent landmovement charact eristics of normal waterinfiltration operation land infiltration 511 arsof may conduct land infiltration similar to that of longrange tactical patrol into enemy territory generally units utilize guides during land inf iltration if guides are not available the unit must have detailed intelligence of the routeparticularly if borders are to be crossed the unit selects routes that take maximum advantage of cover an d concealment and avoid enemy outpo sts patrols and installations units may also conduct infiltration through an intricat irregular support mechanism planners will provide the unit with the location and means of contacting selected indi viduals who will furnish assistance these individuals may be used as local guides and provide information food transport ation and shelter commanders may restrict equipment and supplies to individual arms and communi cation equipment however the situation may allow the use of additional transportation opti ons from indigenous pack animals and lowvisibility vehicles to various tactical vehicles in the sf inventory their utilization will allow the infiltration of additional oper ational equipment with the detachment special forces operations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 53 staybehind infiltration 512 staybehind infiltration is the easiest method to accomplish and one of the most valuable when the adversary has the potential of occu pying the area with armed forces st aybehind infiltration involves the positioning of sfodas within the proposed uwoa before the initiation of enemy advances through or occupation of the general area this technique enables the sf elements to organize nucleus of resistance forces or to preposition themselves for employment in unilateral ro planners should consider staybehind operations when the attitude of the civil populace indi cates it will support staybehind operations phase iv organization 513 although each irregular force or organization in uw is unique the tra ditional sf practice of conceiving uw as us support to an insurgency or resistance movement provi des unifying general concept for irregular force organizational structure sf traditionally conc eive uw with an emphasis on the conduct of guerrilla warfare such efforts may entail the organization of large guerrilla units to conduct combat operations and the us military designed sf units to organize such eleme nts however resistance or insurgency is not solely guerrilla warfare effort the organization of resistance or insurgent elements may involve other arsof personnel with psyop ca or other skill sets fm 305201 contains detailed information on sf uw 514 the sfodas initial requirement is the establishment of good work ing relationship between sf and the irregular elements in the uwoa sound working and command relationship helps to develop high degree of cooperation and some degree of control over the irregular force s f abilities to build trust and to carefully persuade the irregulars to act in c oncert with us objectives strengthen relative control over the irregular force sf soldiers further build trust and relative control by providing organizational leadership skills and assets that help the irregular organization to meet its objectives in manner that supports the overall plan special forces organization of the area complex 515 developing the command structure and the physical organization of the uwoa are priority tasks of sf units in some situations the organization of the uwoa may be well established in others organization and c2 may be incomplete or absent in all cases some improvement in physical area organization will probably be necessary sf units are ad ept at being flexible and creative in developing such irregular organizations number of requirements dictate the organization of t he uwoa but the organization depends more on local conditions and us politicalmi litary objectives than on any fixed set of rules major factors to be considered include z the effectiveness of the area command z the degree of irregular organization overall effectiveness z the degree of guerrilla or armed irregular force organization and effectiveness z the extent of cooperation between the irregula r organization and the larger civilian populace z the activities and effectiveness of the enemy or adversary z the degree of development desired and achievable in the context of us objec tives z the limitations and opportunities present in the human and physical environments 516 all of these factors in combination will influence in varying degrees the shape size and ultimate organization of the uwoa regardless of the size of the area or exte nt of us efforts sf units conducting uw assist the area command in organizing its operati onal elements to achieve dispersion control and flexibility 517 sf organization of the area complex consists of both the physical and human components of the irregular organization physical co mponents of the area complex typically include guerrilla operational base safe areas security and intelligence systems communi cation systems mission support sites msss supply installations training areas dzs landing zones reception sites and evasion and escape mechanisms as required the area complex is not prim arily continuous pattern of tangible installations but series of intangible lines of communication connected to all ot her irregular elements in clandestine manner chapter 5 54 fm 305130 30 september 2008 518 sf units also have capabilities to support the organization of th area complexs human components especially in conjunction with arsof psyop and ca units arsof may direct considerable activity during this period toward creating political and psychological climate that encourages irregular participants or potential participan ts to accept personal risks in suppo rt of the irregular forces cause with discriminating sf support of proper area command leadership the real or potential elements of the irregular organization will grow rger become better trained and eq uipped and will cooperate more effectively in achieving the organi zations objectives organizational growth occurs when natural leaders such as former military pers onnel clergy local office holder s educators and neighborhood representativesemerge providing th area command with potential cad re resource on which to plan the growth and expansion of the irregular organization armed forces and opera tional environment 519 regardless of how developed or underdeveloped the irregular organization is initially primary consideration should be given to ensuring that certain basic functions and operations exist if they do arsof should improve upon and organize them as need ed if they do not exist arsof should put them into effect immediately these functions are not established separatel but may be established concurrently and developed as required the organization establishe d to perform them directly affects the following functions z performing unit or element organization z providing security and intelligence systems z operating communications systems z operating administrative systems z operating logistical support systems z providing training programs z planning and executing combat operations violent activities z planning and executing political activities z expanding the irregular organization and its constituent elements special forces organization and the components of an insurgency 520 as discussed in chapter 4 the classic template for conducting uw as support for resistance movements or insurgencieswhether for their own ob jectives or in support of conventional military operationsremains pertinent and unifying concept for how sf can begin to organize any irregular organization the area command 521 working through the irregular forces area command and subordinate sector co mmands as detailed in chapter 4 sf soldiers organize and develop the various components of an insurgency or similar irregular organization sf soldiers special attributes training experi ence and preparation make them particularly well suited for the persuasive human inte raction required for this task the larger the uwoa and the more expansive the uw effort the more likely that higher echelon s of sf will participate in developing and advising the area command potentially involving sf comp anies battalions or groups the guerrillas 522 guerrillas or similar armed forces represent the most commonly recognized portion of an insurgency and the portion most commonly associated with the warri or skills of participating sf soldiers they are group of irregular predominantly indigenous personnel that organize along military lines to conduct paramilitary operations in enemyheld hostile or denied territ ory guerrillas carry out most of the armed conflict that openly challenges the regional authority 523 in classic guerrilla scenarios armed units could be formed into squad platoon company battalion and even regiment size once again the more expans ive the uw effort the more likely that more sfodas will be employed and that sf companies battalions or even groups will participate in advising and leading larger irregular armed forces sf soldiers have traditiona lly been able to impart military training to these elements appropriate to the situation the unique structure and cap abilities of the sfoda provide special

the operations or activities in which they are utilized phase v buildup 528 the buildup of forces is counterproductive if the irregular force does not obtain enough resources to support and sustain the buildup these resources include weapons munitions medical supplies and services internal and external support for rations as well as an expanded intelligence apparatus to ensure force protection and targeting abilities the buildup phase involve s sf units assisting the irregular organization to expand the capabilities of its component elements as re quired for mission objectives sf unit tasks include infiltration or procurement of eq uipment and supplies to support this expansion and subsequent operations during the buildup phase the sf unit assists the irreg ular force cadre in expanding into an effective organization that is capable of c onducting operations because successful missions lead to increases in recruitment leaders should initially select confidence targetsthose with high probability of success and low risk to the irregular force irregula r force missions and tactics normally dictate simple mobile and flexible organization that is capable of rapid dispersion and reconsol idation in response to the tactical situation each unit is normally selfcon tained with its own intelligence communications and logistics systems 529 uw planners need to consider the appropriate level of capability nd balance the intended size of irregular forces against the requirement for reduced signature this focus shou ld be on the capability required for the mission not on the size of the force as an organization gr ows it creates larger signature thereby degrading the ability to conduct clandestine operations if the irregular force begins noticeable operations too early opposition forces may concentrate efforts on the irregula r force and diminish their chances of mission success chapter 5 56 fm 305130 30 september 2008 530 the traditional sf standard for building an insurgent organization is that one sfoda can raise train equip and advise one guerrilla battalion the redundancy provided b an sfodas manning structure can allow small elements to conduct splitteam or smaller subeleme nt sf placement with widely dispersed irregular forces however when the uwoa is large or larger irregular forces are present or needed and appropriate or when complex operations such as modern urban underground ope rations are involved sf manpower requirements may increase sf companies ba ttalions and groups are all deployable and capable of providing training advice and assistance to large irregular organizations as nee ded the u s military may infiltrate additional sf units during the buildup phase and may attempt to further force multiply by selecting and training additional indigenous cadres capable of supporting gr owing irregular force sustainable buildup of an irregular organization may take long time to achie ve when conducted under effective pressure from adversary forces or may be relatively short if the irregular organization and its forces are already well developed phase vi employment 531 during the employment phase sf units support indigenous or other irregular f orces conducting operations against the common adversaries of irregular organizations and the unit ed states such operations may involve any or all components of the irregular organization the class ic conception of uw employment is sf soldiers advising and assisting guerrilla forces to raid ambush sabotage and otherwise interdict the adversary in ways designed to drain that hostile powers mo rale and resources through military activities up to and including combat 532 not all sf employment of irregular elements necessarily involves direct combat how ever sf soldiers are adept at leveraging active intelligence co llection with an indigenous informant network the intelligence thus collected can support sfs conduct of the uw effort itse lf and it can sometimes be of strategic value to holistic usg effort against state or nonst ate adversaries sf units usually in conjunction with irregular elements can also establish safe areas sites and procedures as part of an unconventional assistedrecovery mechanism useful to the evasion and recovery of s of or conventional personnel such as downed pilots sf can also employ classified ttp by with and through the clandestine and covert capabilities of the underground and auxiliary to conduct holistic warfare against wide range of hostile state and nonstate actors 533 regardless of the type of operation employed the overall purpose is to achieve st rategic politicalmilitary objectives the us army specially sel ects trains equips and pr epares sf soldiers to persuade irregular forces to act in concert with such us strategic polit icalmilitary objectives even when the uw operation involves combat actions such combat employment does not necessarily require the sf units to be physically engaged in combat it invol ves the conduct of operations in combat or hostile environment in addition the usg may use irregular forces achieve objectives without direct us participation 534 when forces conduct uw operations in support of mco of conventional forces sf groups battalions companies and sfodas ensure that uw for ces properly integrate into the conventional jfcs campaign plan since sf units understand both the capa bilities of us forces and irregular forces within the specific conditions of unique uwoa these sf echelons are uniquely positioned to coordinate and deconflict irregular force operations with theater objec tives sf units conduct uw operations by with or through irregular forces to indirectly support conventional operations through interdictions and diversions of adversaries throughout the uwoa sf units train advi and assist irregular forces to directly support conventional movement by providing security of routes dzs beach landing sites and similar missions when appropriate sf companies can establish special operations c2 element attached to conventional division or corps hq to further assist in coordinating and deconflicting uw operations with those of conventional forces 535 linkup operations are pa rticularly hazardous even among ements of the same army linkup between foreign irregular forces and conventional forces are even more difficult sf units familiarity with the uwoa and expertise with irregular forces atte mpting linkup greatly mitigate the risks of any such subsequent linkup between irregula r and conventional forces following successful linkup uw forces may potentially continue to support conventional mco thr ough such activities as reconnaissance rear area security or support to cmo sf units continuing suppo rt of such irregular force conduct of these activities special forces operations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 57 provides enhanced crosscultural communication intelligencegathering opportunities effective coordination of assets and reduces the risk of fratricide phase vii transition 536 transition does not necessarily mean the end of hostilities or sf operations in the uwoa some sf units may focus continuing uw efforts by providing s ecurity with their irregular counterparts to support stabilization efforts and the beginning of fid operati ons sf units will also likely assist civilian usg agencies international organizations and agencies an d any new government with integrating the remaining irregular forces into the newly reconstituted national army police forces or other security forces or assisting with their return to previous occupations depending on the quality of rapport built with irregular forces in earlier phases this relationship uniquely situates sf units to assist oga and hn civil authorities in transitioning these irregular forces this page intentionally left blank 30 september 2008 fm 305130 61 chapter 6 psychological operations introduction 61 psyop support of uw should begi n as early as possible typically the psychological battle will begin before commitment of us military psyop forces before commitment of us psyop support to the uw operation elements of the guerrilla forces or the underground may have begu n an embryonic psyop program or at least begun to examine the psyc hological effects they wish to generate in some cases such irregular forces may have more developed psyop program than t hey have combat capacity in other cases the situation facing arsof psyop personnel may be one of guerrilla forces or the underground having psyop program whatsoever in addition they may have alrea dy made mistakes in attempts at conducting psyop or they may even have conducted military or ot her operations that have alienated potential supporters all arsof personne l must begin uw operations mindful of the arsof imperative that anticipating and controlling the psychological ffects are going to be either key enabler or critical shortfall note some of the following phases may occur simultaneously orin certain situationsnot at all phase i preparation 62 it is important that planners identify request and integrate requirements for psyop f orces during the planning phase of an operation psyop forces and the supported it must embrace the concept that matter what type of operation psyop support th psyop process does not change what changes from operation to operation is the security classification of support the overtness or covertness of the psyop and potentially and the types of media used psyop forces most important role d uring the preparation phase of the operation is aiding in the analysis of the environment from psyc hological perspective and conducting detailed analysis of potential tas to in clude potential allies as well as enemy forces taa can aid in the identification of potentia l leaders of the insurgent force and identify psyop arguments that will help bolster support for the insurgency among sympathizers and the uncommitted populace taa als identifies psyop arguments that will aid in creating desired behavior change among enemy forces and enemy sympathizers taa will identify the vulnerabilities of key aders and communicators and groups and their accessibility to future psyop series 63 it is during this phase that psychological operatio ns objectives pos are developed to support the commanders objectives product approval processes are designed and approved supp orting psyop documents are developed estimates annexes and tabs and psyop programs are approve d by the president or secdef pos may be oriented around the following genera l topics z creating popular support for the insurgency movement z developing support of the populace to allow the in surgents to avoid detection and move freely z promoting the recruitment of othe rs into the resistance movement z discrediting the existing government and its programs z introducing or delineating shadow government or government in exile z maintaining support of the indigenous populace for us support and presence z dividing and inducing defection among enemy forces z winning the support of the uncommitted z preserving and strengthening friendly civilian support chapter 6 62 fm 305130 30 september 2008 z developing unity among the uw force z maintaining motivation in the uw force 64 once psyop are authorized psyop forces will ex ecute and monitor planned programs and series supporting pe in uw environment psychological operations actions psyacts can have greater impact than at other times simply by harnessing and building upon preex isting feelings of overall frustration of the populace with regard to the exis ting government psyacts in corporated into psyop series must undergo detailed deliberate planning to war game potential outco mes of the activity for example planned demonstration can easily turn into riot when emotions run high whether this occurs deliberately or spontaneously can affect the potential outcome war gam ing allows forces to plan for different outcomes protect the appropriate parties and achiev the desired objective from the goal formal launch 65 typically the movement sponsored by the united states in uw effort is lready in existence however the movement may be highly generaliz ed and perhaps conducted by several different organizations if the effort to oppose an adversary during uw has some sort of benc hmark date or event such as the anniversary of general strike or an excess crackdown by the governme nt this date may be of psychological value in formally launching an insurgency 66 in addition if two or more groups join in common cause and form united front the date of this event may be exploitable formation of united front may include the formal declara tion of government in exile or some form of early shadow government organization these organizations may or m ay not have been in existence before formal launch and therefor may have preexisting conditions or may be blank slate the former may present cons iderable challenges to overcoming perceptions of inertia or even incompetence the latter may present cha llenges of establishing the government in exile that is viable an d credible psyop forces may disseminate series in support of this government in exile as early as phase i or may merely conduct research for later use typically fo rces would do this in phase iv as the uw effort becomes increasingly viable militarily 67 the declaration of movement or escalation of resistance particular ly if the government has not yet faced armed resistance by key communicator can provide psychological ince ntive to the uw effort planners must base any formal launch of new movement or reinvented movement on careful analysis of the key tas formal launch of the uw effort with psyop series can be counterproductive if they will generate unrealistic expectations in tas therefore arsof forces may need to caution irregular forces against such coa example of forming united front the example of the patriotic union of ku rdistan puk and the kurdistan democratic party kdp in iraq points out both the benef its and pitfalls of formal launch of new united front of former ly combative groups before oif the puk and kdp had long history of conflict in may 1994 support ers of the puk clashed with supporters of the kdp leaving 300 people dead rela tions among the groups further soured in march 1995 when the kdp backed out of an attack on saddams fro nt lines led by the iraqi national congress over the ne xt year the puk and kdp fought several more times eventually devolving into state of civil war at the start of oif both the kdp and puk worked alongside arsof units in northern iraq aga inst what had always been common enemy in saddam hussein psyop and public diplomacy supported the unification of the former rivals in 2004 the kdp and puk along with several smaller kurdish nd one ethnic turkoman party united to form joint polit ical coalition the democratic patriotic alliance of kurdistan dpak this alliance clearly constituted formal launch of the latter stages of uw effort initially this formal launch bore political fruit with the winning of 75 seats in the iraqi council of representat ives in addition the kdp and psychological operations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 63 puk were able to secure the selection of jalal talabani the puk leader as president of iraq while massoud barzani t he kdp leader became president of iraqi kurdistan in may 2006 the kdp formed an alliance with the puk to run irbil as unified party however relations have since soured again with northern iraq effectively divided into kdpcontrolled territory and pukcontrolled territory centered on suleymaniya in 2006 reconstituted dpak that still contai ned both the puk and kdp tempered this deterioration this particular case highlights the inher ent challenge in uw of persuading human actors to operate in concert with us ob jectives the breakdown of union that was earlier launched an d championed through psyop and public diplomacy was useful despite later complications the union contri buted to the overall success of the uw effort in northern iraq moreover as arso f efforts transition more to fid operations this breakdown can be couched in psyop and public diplomacy term s as the normal functioning of democratic process in which parties do not alw ays agree constant course 68 in uw the forces battling an adversary frequently emerge from debates and issues that have degenerated into armed conflict in most cases ce rtain themes and symbols will already resonate with current and potential sympathi zers supporters or recruits if so rath er than any change in themes or any new formal launch of resistance movement the most effective approach may be to stay on message and continue to use the themes and symbols that have resonated before the escalation to uw effort in addition careful psyop assessment may reveal gaps in knowledge of the vul nerabilities or accessibility of tas that require further study of the type of psyop programs or inadvertent psy op that any antigovernment organizations or key communicators have put out if the impact of p rior psyop is immeasurable during initial taa the initial coa for us or insurgent psyop efforts may be silence during the preparation phase or may be limited to facetoface psyop during initial contact military deception scenarios 69 in preparing for uw operations the potential to conduct military deception mildec operations exists for example commanders may consider psyop support to mildec operations that obscure and misdirect government efforts to discer n the intent and strength of prepar ations and then to accurately assess later phases such as initial contact and infiltration of irregular and us fo rces commanders may use mildec operations in later phases as well the same caveats and cautions that apply to use of mildec in other operations apply in uw as well arsof personnel may have to di ssuade insurgent forces from improperly using psyop series intent on perpetrating deception of part icular concern is irregular forces inflating their capability thereby damaging their credibility the ir credibility with supporters and with government forces another concern is any proposed deception of suppor ters or sympathizers educating insurgent psyop cadre on the pitfa lls of unrealistic and potentially damaging support to mildec should take place as the phases of uw evolve in addition careful planning of us psyop support to mildec operations is necessary phase ii initial contact 610 during the initial contact phase of an operation psyop support co ntinues by executing psyop series products and psyacts that support the preparation of the envi ronment this phase includes preparing the civilian population to receive allied forces and actively assist in the uw mission to follow psyop forces should identify requirements for information that the pilo t team can gather during its assessments this information can range from media availability and transmission technical data to validating psychological assessments of key individuals and communicators to id entifying personnel and equipment requirements for establishing irregular psyo p forces the burden is on psyop forces to stay chapter 6 64 fm 305130 30 september 2008 abreast of all activities during each phase of the operation and meet suspenses for turning in information requirements expatriates 611 during the initial contact phase and possibly extending back into t he preparation phase expatriates from the nations in the uwoa may be valuable asset arsof must assess expatriates on an individual basis because both their motivations and willingness to accept risk may vary greatly expatriates who support resistance can vary from mildly supportive and only ideologica lly sympathetic to willing to support initial contact and even take part in armed re sistance some expatriates may be former members of tas these expatriates can help with both taa and product pretesting some key communicators can come from the expatriate community symbolic or ac tive leaders of uw operations may emerge from the expatriate community indigenous population 612 rankandfile members of the population at remote locations such as vill ages away from major population centers typically make initial contact in uw when eval uating these individuals for potential training as dedicated psyop cadre or even for ba sic awareness of the psychological impact of uw operations arsof may encounter wide range of education and comprehensio n levels in addition during initial contact necessity may dictate expending psyop resources on tas that eventually will not be the focus of effort initial contact in terms of psyop may be with tas that in the early stages of resistance may be critical to uw operations such as rural villagers as uw operation matures the focus of resources may shift to other tas key communicators 613 reaching and recruiting key communicators may be th focus of initial contact efforts like many uw efforts the initial key communicators may be much more locali zed in the early stages of uw operation the village elder who is key communicator in initia l contact may eventually become simply member of wider ta such as village elders in given province or other subnational area conversely major political dissidents or other key communicators typicall have relevancy over the entire course of uw operation phase iii infiltration 614 psyop forces may infiltrate with sf units complete or in part or may fol low on at later time many factors contribute to this including the tactical situation nectivity to development production and dissemination assets and location of the irregular for ce psyop series may transition to another phase or program at this time depending on the plan that was developed during phas i when this occurs psyop series products designed to elicit support and assistance for the uw orga nization and us forces must be carefully monitored evaluation criteria not only provide f eedback for the evaluation of series of products andor psyop program but may provide indicators that aid in fp measures and psec as well rankandfile psychological operations awareness 615 developing awareness of the psychological impact of their activities begins when arsof infiltrate to begin assisting irregular forces arsof should make the ranka ndfile armed members undergrounds and auxiliaries aware of psyop program objectives and any themes t hey should stress or avoid in addition arsof personnel need to begin communi cating ideas and actual planned facetoface psyop products that conform to the us psyop progra m if the infiltration plan includes transporting preapproved psyop products for dissemination by irregula r forces in an overt manner that will bring them in contact with the intended ta they should have sufficient understand ing of the product to at minimum not detract from or contradict the product ideally such disseminat ion plans should include supporting facetoface psyop products as part of the series joint interagency intergovernmental and multinational jiim partners should also be sufficien tly cognizant of the psyop program to do harm to psychological operations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 65 the overall effort adequate intelligence sharing must take place so that arsof soldiers are aware of any psyop executed by jiim partners dedicated cadre 616 during the infiltration phase the segregation of dedicated psyop cadre in any arm of the irregular movement may be impractical or represent an unacceptable drain on limited personnel in the ea rly phases of uw in addition resources in terms of media as well as lack of comprehe nsive knowledge of psyop may prohibit irregulars production of psyop series however during infiltration arsof can identify personnel within the resistance who can become the nucleus of dedicated p syop force as they develop the underground and auxiliaries may be the first source of pra ctical dedicated psyop arm phase iv organization 617 during organization the focus of the arsof its is developing the capability of the required irregular force psyop forces may need to develop an organic psyop capability within the force psyop forces should carefully consider the organization ro and techniques the irregular force will use the insurgent force can use psyop forces as neutral s ounding board in this capacity psyop soldiers can form relationships with irregulars through informal contact du ring and after training from these conversations psyop soldiers can help sf personnel gauge the moral of the insurgents and help ensure that the training provided the irre gulars is accomplished using the mo st culturally relevant techniques available figure 61 for example some irregulars may initially feel hom esick or miss family members and support groups from their local village while in training this si tuation was common occurrence while training afghan personnel ce afghan culture and society are trib ally based members of different tribes who trained together often felt more of sense of belonging to their own tribe or village instead of to the group they were training with if arsof leave this situation unchecked high potential exists for desertion psyop soldiers help identify factors that might cause desertion fr om training and create communication techniques and messages that reinforce the greater good of sacrif icing for the irregular effort themes of patriotism and nationalism are of particular use when pr operly employed in this situation figure 61 psychological operations and special force s soldiers building rapport with an unconventional warfare force in afghanistan chapter 6 66 fm 305130 30 september 2008 supporting unity and cohesion in developing uw orga nization in afghanistan psyop soldiers developed recruiting and retention video that highlighted the pain one new afghan soldier felt when separated from his family and village support system while training with other afghans he regarded as strangers the video acknowledged the new recruits pain but then so portrayed him speaking the words he was writing to his fatherte lling of his hardships in training and the loneliness he felt at times while also fe eling the tremendous pride of serving in the new afghan national army with his compatriots the video portrayed the soldier writing in the letter to hi s father that despite his discomfort with his surroundings and traini ng he remained committed to the security and safety of his family and tribe that the new army would afford them in the coming months he ended the letter stating that for the sake of t he honor of his family and their longterm safety he remained commi tted to the new army and his training 618 it is natural to want to design the force similar to us organization however this may not be the most appropriate organization to accomplish the immediate task s facing the irregular force likewise techniques taught must follow the legal guidelines that psyop forces follow to avoid potential legal fallout for the usg when training an irregular force in addition psyop forces ca n educate irregular force personnel on psychological aspects of the enemy force if they are not familiar w ith them during phase iv psyop forces should support the development of the uw organization by capital izing on us rapportbuilding activities and multiplying their effect s psyop forces should take advantage of the situation during the organization phase to capture im ages whether still or video and interview the uw force to capture information for use in future products grassroots psychological operations 619 whether members of the irregular force are dedicated specifically to psyop mission or are doing so as an additional duty lack of equipment or suppor t in this stage may limit them to basic psyop media they may conduct what might best be termed grassroots psyop that ut ilize whatever media they can use independently figure 62 pa ge 67 the inability to receive either i ndirect or direct pport from us or other allied forces may necessitate grassroots psyop if executed using sound methodology and sufficient research multiple lowcost highreward avenues exis t to reach select tas wh tactically feasible facetoface psyop and other inperson products such as guerrilla theater ca n resonate with tas members of the underground or auxiliaries can pursue limitedrisk cove rt media this media can range from graffiti to simple alternative newsletters an d handbills recent experience has shown that some electronic media have passed into the realm of gras sroots psyop various elect ronic formats such as digital video discs dvds can provide degree of security for irregular per sonnel located in adversarycontrolled areas these formats have had significant impact us personnel supporting and advising such activities must keep an open mind on what mig ht be an unusual form of media however us personnel must also analyze proposed products that may be counterpr oductive offensive or may violate any of the basic tenets and historical truths of successful psyo p dedicated forces 620 in the organization phase it may prove useful and practical to encourage th formation of dedicated psyop cadre and to train them for later stages the goal is to build skeletal structure that forces can flesh out during buildup as recr uitment grows however it can unacceptably drain limited combat power by overbuilding an indigenous psyop force in addition such force in the underground or auxiliaries could expose it to level of adversary scrutin that is unacceptable therefore in phase iv just as in phase iii it may be necessary to limit the number of specifically tasked psyop personnel and continue to build databases of potential personnel with skill sets that might warrant transfer of function at later date psychological operations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 67 figure 62 afghan village elder addressing population on psychological operations loudspeaker relationship with other organizations 621 it is likely that relationships between ad hoc or dedicated psyop cadre will become an important consideration at this time organizations paralleling us milit ary and oga structures will increasingly form in phase iv even if it is in embryonic form organizations among the guerrillas paralleling us organizations that typically would work or deconflict with dod psyop personnel should begin to work with dedicated military psyop cadre at this stage military psyop cadre and governmentinexile or shadowgovernment civilian psyop cadre may be the same organization it is foreseeable that this task organization may continue even th rough the success of the insurgency psyop cadr should attempt to establish bonds boundaries and communications with thei r relevant counterparts within the armed wing of the insurgency as well as any relevant civilian governmentine xile organizations transregional and global reach 622 with the advent of multiple avenues of instant or nearrealtime t ransfers of information and data uw operator can assume that the uw operation has pr imarily local or us domestic audience us psyop forces are always aware of the potential for any action to quickly have an impact across the region in which the uw operation is being conducted and quite often across the globe irregular forces may or may not appreciate this fact and may require training and advising from rsof personnel conversely they may from early stages plan for and use asymmetric capacity to reach wider udiences although such chapter 6 68 fm 305130 30 september 2008 efforts may only begin in later phases only small group of trained individu als is necessary for an irregular force to utilize the internet and global media outlets to promote psyo p programs when the underground or auxiliary must emphasize concealing their involv ement the global media can sometimes provide additional anonymity b ecause of the difficulty of tracing through multiple servers and routers overt supporters of either ussponsored irregular organization or its opp onents can use the reach of global media quite openly and overtly arsof soldiers must be aware of all such fforts by the ussponsored irregular allied competitor or antagonistic groups in most instances control of these types of asymmetric approaches used by an adversary may be impossible the focus then must switch to counterpropaganda efforts phase v buildup 623 during phases iv and v psyop forces may focu s on recruiting and building external support for the force depending on the duration of phase v arsof may focus on increa the number of or maintain the previous level of capitulation programs during this phase psyo p forces may or may not begin more emphasis on preparing the populace for introd uction of the uw force in general arsof must ensure that party compromises the covert nature of the operation all operators at every level must safeguard the force although it is generally easy for forces support ing or conducting tacticallevel support to keep this foremost in their minds forces conducting strategic or ope rationallevel psyop may forget or be unaware of the potential co mpromising effects of products on the forcewhether they come unintentionally while disseminating talking points or unconsciously i n newspaper article recruitment 624 typically during buildup some active psyop programs to produce series on recr uitment can be pursued although recruitment of members of the derground or auxiliary remains either covert or clandestine motivating tas susceptible to joining these organiza tions can be pursued by highlighting the successes of the organization in addition recruitment series for the armed force may have an effect on recruitment in other areas as well psyop support to recruitmen t should make unrealistic or unfulfillable promises arsof soldiers must caution irregular fighters and organizations from making these promises as well although po tential recruits may be accustomed to strongarm tactics or coercion from the government arsof soldiers should discourage this avenue in facetoface encounters and avoid it as psyop approach domestic support 625 although not necessarily the primary effort in psyop programs some psy op series typically target supporters of the irregular effort the behavior desired in such groups is oft to increase efforts donations and recruitment in the buildup phase this may entail attempting to move s upporters from nominal agreement to active participation during buildup some supporters have unrealistically short time spans for success common themes during uw are often persever ance and the tactical necessity of long war themes may need to discourage abortive disorganized efforts as well in many uw efforts uniting several dissimilar organizations into single front is useful during buildup rsof advisors may frequently need to advise against coas that might alienate supporters 626 in any insurgency even those initiated with support from larg portion of the population sizeable portions of the population will be uncommitted to eith er the adversary or the fo rces backed in the uw effort in uw operation where the government maintains large blocks of tac it support through coercion violence or bribery that support may disappear when the government loses power in addition to supporting desired behaviors in committed supporters usdirected psyop supp ort and irregular force psyop programs will typically target the uncommitted in uw efforts an irony of uw is that every person remaining uncommitted rather than supporting the advers ary is partial success typically this behavior is not actively encouraged however arsof should not ignore the realit that antiadversary psyop may produce this effect in the longt erm psyop plan this may be nece ssary stage before garnering active support for the uw effort however the focus of programs should usually be on moving fencesitters into passive or active support of the irregular organizations efforts psychological operations 30 september 2008 fm 305130 69 627 supporters of an adversary government can vary greatly in their degree of c ommitment early taa will reveal the likelihood that government supporters will be ceptible to abandoning the government moving against it or metaphorically or literally d ying in place for it hardc ore government supporters may be unreachable matter how impossible their tactical situation becomes history has shown however that authoritarian regimes the typical target in uw do t enjoy deep ideological commitment beyond the upper levels of the regime and those completely dependent upon it ven powerful backers such as major corporations may well be swayed if they perceive th reat from the irregular organization during buildup susceptible tas within the ranks of government s upporters may be lucrative target in addition inevitability and capitulation themes and sy mbols may be useful during buildup however if buildup is progressing well and opsec allows release of some figures governm ent supporters may not believe the actual level of support for the uw effort and such series ma be counterproductive external support 628 although not as critical to success in uw as is in ternal support external support for an irregular effort is for the most part beneficial an exception is always external support that may be viewed in negative way by domestic tas for instance the assistance of region nations or organizations can be seen as interventionist or selfserving arsof may need to downplay us support fo r this reason as well typically the opposite is trueexternal support for the insurgency legitim izes it and increases the psychological effects of the irregul ars cause us psyop support may attempt to build greater external support for an irregular effort or leave this function to irregular psyop organiza tions surrogate psyop forces and the irregular force should be cautione d not to inflate claims of external support increasing media operations 629 during buildup the security situation in limited areas may shift sufficiently to allow for committal of more us psyop assets as well as the operation of new types of media by the underground or the auxiliary the projection of new media types from external sites may bec ome practical as the irregular organization grows in addition more sophisticated ty pes of media may have been deliberately held back until sufficient levels were reached during buildup this situation can be particular ly true if tas would not find usproduced media credible phase vi employment 630 combat operations may not directly involve us forces but this does not preclude ps yop forces from supporting the uw force during the employment phase widely varying mixtures of unilateral us combined and unilateral irregular force psyop are possi ble in all cases however psyop forces primary role is not that of shooter in direct action roles psy op forces should be careful not to misuse their skills psyop forces support sfodas by communicating messages designed to icit desired behaviors from local people that support the activities of the sf units and the irregu lar organization psyop programs can capitalize on the actions of the uw force to support ca pitulation of individuals groups and units psyop forces continue their role as force multiplier by liciting support for the operation in and around combat operation areas sympathizers may be much more ceptible to recruitment psyop arguments once action has started in addition rewards for information programs can provide informati on that may prove invaluable to the operation 631 another means of bolstering the fighting spirit and mo rale of insurgent forces is to mitigate or minimize any tactical setback s doing so may entail mitigating the mistakes of individual irregu lar force or shadow government leaders and stress ing the competence of leadership in general highlighting tactica l or operational successes also mitigates any failures by the irregular fo rce regardless of the type of support they are providing however psyop forces must not get caught up in the excitement of longawaited action psyop forces should z continue to update taa z capture and analyze feedback from ongoing an d previously executed programs and series z analyze government and other adversary propaganda z update plans for supporting the next phase of the operation chapter 6 610 fm 305130 30 september 2008 psyop support to the uw force in afghanistan during combat operations in afghanistan arsof provided support to the northern alliance the northern alliance was having offensive success and had driven the enemy forces to the town of kunduz anticoalition militias movi ng into the town forced the people of kunduz to support them this fact was known t the commanding officer of the northern alliance and he requested that psyop forces assist in reducing collateral damage and unwanted civilian casualties during the capture of the town the objective was to reduce the number of civilian casu alties and win the support of the towns people for the nort hern alliance psyop forc broadcast radio messages from the ec130 commando solo and dropped leaflets that let the people know if they opened their gates to the northern alliance there would be retribution taken against them and the nort hern alliance would safeguard them the people of kunduz took this message as credible and opened the towns gates to the northern alliance the northern alliance t ook the town and gained the support of the local populace 632 during the employment phase psyop forces typically direct products towa rd eliciting behaviors that degrade the support for the adversary forces and their standing governm ent generally during the employment phase some degree or even high degree of vilific ation of the government and standing military forces is useful psyop

point typically share the uwoa with pa messages and dos products communicating the usg position on the standing governm ent psyop series may inform select tas of usg positions as well but this is secondary to elic iting specific behaviors such as defections to the irregular force arsof personnel during this time may also have to caution i rregular forces from inflating claims of success or making unachievable promises phase vii transition 633 the transition phase marks the end of hostilities and the start of s tability operations depending on the situation rewards for information programs may continue generally howe ver transition phase marks the introduction of legitimacy and professionalism progr ams regardless of whether or not us military forces begin fid operations psyop forces can work with ogas and embassy teams to support dos and national objectives if psyop forces transition from supporting dod operations t dos missions they must ensure that programs do not lapse and that psyop execution remains seamless legitimization 634 legitimization of any new government military and other instit utions formed by or radically reorganized by successful uw effo rt is often central to transition psyop us psyop forces may not accomplish this legitimization instea d former irregular force psyop personnel may condu ct postconflict programs part of the legitimization of new government may entail advising the new government and military against reprisals of any kind psyop programs supporting amne sties new freedoms or enforcement of longdenied civil rights domestic di sarmament programs and humanitarian measures not only provide practical benefits but also legitimize or create better climate in which the new government can be legitimized major focus of dod psyop an

successful irregular move ments new government at this stage however arsof personnel may need to discourage the same sort f behaviors the outgoing military and government conducted including voting

typically emer ge in transition operations regardless of the level of resistance the new government faces even if the old adversary govern ments supporters do begin an insurgency the new government established by the uw effort should foc us on promoting its agenda rather than reacting to an insurgency domestic psyop programs may instead focus on economic and governance issues and thereby minimize an insurgency in addition psyop in the transition phase may focus some resources on regional or international issues such as reassuri ng bordering nations or traditional trade partners in the early days of transition this an d other issues not typically the purview of us psyop may of necessity be done by members of the former irregular force until the new government can form civilian international information program and diplomatic corps standing down forces 637 after successful uw operation the new military may expand any existing military psyop force they had during earlier phases or release personnel from other duties to join or start such force typically new government will also ask for more us psyop pport in transition rather than less however the sociopolitical realities in the country may make domes tic psyop impossible especially if the former government had propaganda units associated with excesses or civil rights viola tions although needed political realities may force the immediate redeployme nt of most or all arsof psyop personnel in society expecting smaller military or less military participation in the life of the nation one of the last endeavors for domestic or us psyop personnel may be to focus attention and pport from select tas for standdown of forces extended army special operations forces psychological operations presence 638 regardless of whether largescale fid operations become necessary ps yop personnel may have an extended presence in what can now be termed an hn whether the new government creates expands or stands

the past century most internal resistance movements have failed st anding governments crushed most internal resistance movements before they developed critical mass of skill and support or were simply incapable of attaining such critical mass successful movements possessed sufficient fp and ci capabilities to prevent the government whether an indigenous regim or outside partner from pushing the conflict to decision in the military realm until the po wer balance shifted in favor of the irregular force they did this either by making the political and psyc hological realms decisive since it was much easier for them to attain parity with the government in this sphere or by postpo ning decisive military encounters until they weakened the controlling force through guerrilla political ca and psychological operations 72 for the irregular efforts to succeed they must attain the pivotal concept of legitimacy this concept assumes the people of country will decide whether the government or t he insurgents can offer them the best alternative in terms of goods and services and then will support t hat organization following this line of thought the basis of arsof uw activity is the irre

supporting to supported unit however psyo p communications requirements are inherently joint and interagency in nature and as an echelonabovecorps unit psyop units will require connectivity from the deployed cation back to the staining base this requirement may place extraordinary communications demands upon an undeveloped theater in tim of crisis therefore commanders should adhere to the following principles when planning psyop in theater there are three distinct functions that must be supported by communications for psyop forces to be successful z c2 z intelligence z distribution 814 when elements from the 4th poga are empl oyed these forces possess their own organic equipment and communications personnel however psyop forces may require dditional augmentation chapter 8 84 fm

command z secret internet protocol router network and nonsecure internet protocol route r network of the defense information systems network 816 psyop forces have the capability to integrate thei r tactical communications devices into future and legacy army communications networks psyop forces will always bring their own video distribution network to the joa or aor some networks used and planned for use by psyop forces incl ude the following z singlechannel tacsat z international maritime satellite z global broadcast systemjoint intratheater injection system z product distribution system pds z c x and kuband satellite communications satcom 817 psyop forces may depend upon the communica tions capabilities of other service component commands to support the psyop mission for example if usn transportable amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio broadcas t system dissemination capabilities are used the naval component command must provide organic compa tible communications to receive udio products fo r dissemination however should sof aviation units such as the 193d special operati ons wing sow ec130ej commando solo deploy to an undeveloped intermediate staging base psyop forces will provide required distribution communications for the 193d sow to receive and disse minate audio and video psyop products 818 psyop forces coordinate bandwidth requirements with the j6 of the sup ported gcc not the supported jtf this early coordination ensures support throughout the aor and deconflicts psyop communications requirements early during contingency planning 819 psyop communicators must coordinate and manage the frequency spectrum under the di rection of the j6 of the supported gcc and jtf psyop co mmunicators participate in the jointrestricted frequencylist coordination process with the supported commands j6 l ike any other functional or service component command this process assigns c2 frequencies however the coordina tion between the electronic warfare

diseases of the area 843 sometimes broad range of medical support may already be availabl in the uwoa although initial treatment may be limited to rudimentary medi cal procedures some irregular forces may have developed highly organized and effective medical support units and installat ions their organizations typically parallel those of conventional forces includin g the establishment of field hospitals in inaccessible areas medical requirements 844 medical elements that support irregular forces must be mobile responsive and effective to prevent disease and restore the sick and wounded to duty in many instances there is safe rear area where guerrilla forces can bring casualties for treatment wounded and sick personnel in such environments become tactical rather than logis tical problems medical support must be major tactical consideration when planning all operations the civilian infrastructure of the irregular organization contributes to medical support by setting up and operating medical facilities medical personnel help during guerrilla combat operations by establishing casualty collection points thereby p ermitting the remaining members of the guerrilla force to continue fighting casualties at these collection points are evacuated to guerrilla base or civilian care facility when possible 845 in uw scenarios the attitudes of the sick and wounded are extremely

informational cultural philosophical religious mythical and so on and economic competition and spectrum of conflic t ranging from individual duels to societal wars of annihilation this was an essentiall anarchic environment and force was the final judge between competition and conflict through nat ural development and for mutual protection groups formed around kinship ethnicity and shared mythology and developed into historically identifiable bands clans tribes and nations peoples to compete and conflict mo re effectively starting in early modern europe many people recognized these groups as distinct sove reign states increasingly aligned over time with perceived distinct national identity international system of states a2 state is set of institutions that possess the authority to make t he rules that govern the people in one or more societies having internal sovereignty ov er definite territory the state includes institutions such as the armed forces civil serv ice or state bureaucracy courts and police by max webers influential definition state has monopoly on the legitimate use of physica l force within given territory by modern practice and the law of international relations states sovere ignty is not conditional upon the diplomatic recognition of the states claim to independence by other states however the capacity of state to enter into various international relations and trea ties is conditional upon such recognition degrees of recognition and sovereignty may vary however any degree of recognition even the majority recognition is not binding on thirdparty states a3 within sovereign states the ruling government uses all of the instru ments of national state power on its own people the government is the political authority it blishes and enforces the law manages and develops the economy and allocates state fina nces disseminates statesupporting information and gathers internal intelligence and relies on the military as the final guarantor of internal state power a4 although the term often refers broadly to all in stitutions of government or ruleancient and modernthe modern state system bears number of characteristics that first consolidated in western europe beginning in earnest in the 17th century since the late 19th century ll of the worlds inhabitable land has been parceled up into states earlier quite large land areas had be either unclaimed or uninhabited or inhabited by nomadic peoples who were not organized as sta tes a5 governments now used the same instruments of power that they had previ ously used internally against other states in interstate competition and conflict in an otherwise anarchic international environment state gov ernments could em ploy each of these instruments as weapon in pursuit of their own interests despite the increased power of stat the international environment was still largely anarchic with each sovereign state in terpreting international conduct by its own calculation using mix of power instruments groups of states formed evershif ting blocks of alliance in the pursuit of advantage a6 after the world wars of the 20th century participating nations formed the u n an increasing body of international law sought to reduce the anarchy in th international environment todays international environment is characterized by stat esconstrained by international lawusing all of their instrumen ts of national power for competition and conflict a7 in the late 20th century the globalization of the world economy the mobi lity of people and capital and the rise of many international institutions all combined to re strict the freedom of action of states however the state remains the basic political unit of the world and therefore the state is the most central concept in the study of politics currently more than 200 states mak up the international community with the vast majority represented in the appendix a2 fm 305130 30 september 2008 a8 in casual usage the terms country nation and state are often used synonymously but in more strict usage they are distinguished as follows z country is the geographical area z nation designates people however national

private international law or conflict of laws z law of supranational organizations public international law a18 public international law concerns the structure and conduct of sta tes and international organizations the founded under the charter and the universal declaration of human rights is the most important international organization other international agreements like the geneva conventions on the conduct of war and international bodies such as the il the wto or the imf also form growing part of public international law to lesser degree interna tional law also affects multinational

responsibility of states in their conduct with eac h other international law is similarly concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries thus there is compre hensive regime dealing with group rights treatment of aliens rights of refugees international crimes nationality problems and human rights in general this regime further includes the important functio ns of the maintenance of international peace and security arms control the peaceable settlement of disputes and the regula tion of the use of force in international relations even when the law is not able to stop the outbreak of war it has developed principles to govern the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of prisoners a20 international law also governs issues relating to th global environment the global commons such as international waters outer space global communications and world trade whereas municipal law is appendix a4 fm 305130 30 september 2008 hierarchical or vertical in its stru cture meaning that legislature enact s binding legislation international law is horizontal in nature meaning that all states are sovereign and theo retically equal as result of the notion of sovereignty the value and authority of international law is dependent upon the voluntary participation of states in its formulation observan ce and enforcement althou gh there may be exceptions most states enter into legal commitments with other states out of enlightened selfinterest rather than adherence to body of law that is higher than their own a21 breaches of international law raise difficult questions for lawyers and statesmen since international law has established compulsory judicial system for the settlement of disputes or coercive penal system managing breaches of international law is not as straightforward as managi ng breaches within domestic legal system however there are ways that parties bring breaches to the attention of the international community and there are ways to resolve conflict fo r example there are judi cial or quasijudicial tribunals in international law for certain areas such as trade and human rights the founders of the for example created the organization as means for th world community to enforce international law upon members that violate its charte r through the security council a22 traditionally states and the vatican were the sole subjects of i nternational law with the proliferation of international organizations over the st century some organizations have been recognized as relevant parties as well recent interpretations of international human ri ghts law international humanitarian law and international trade law have been inclusive of corporat ions and even of certain individuals sources of international law a23 public international law has three primary sources international treaties customary and general principles of law international treaty law includes obligatio ns states expressly and voluntarily accept between themselves in treaties customary international law derives from the consistent practice of states accompanied by legal opinion that legal obligation re quires the consistent practice those practicing international law traditionally look to judgments of in ternational tribunals as well as scholarly works as persuasive sources for custom in addition to direct evidence of state behavior attempts to codify customary international law gained momentum afte r wwii with the formation of the international law commission ilc under the guidance of the the binding interpre tation of the underlying custom by agreement through treaty codifies cust omary law for states not party to such treaties the work of the ilc may still be accepted as custom applying to those states general principles of law are those commonly recognized by the major legal systems of the world certain norms of inte rnational law achieve binding force to include all states with permissible deviations when there are disputes about the exact meaning and application of national laws it is the responsibility of the courts to decide what the law means in international law there are courts with the authority to do this it is generally the responsibility of states to interpret the law for themselves unsurprisingly this means that the re is rarely agreement in cases of dispute a24 since international law exists in legal environment without n overarching sovereign enforcement of international law is very different from enforcement in th domestic context in many cases enforcement takes on charac teristics where the norm is selfenforci ng in other cases defection from the norm can pose real risk particularly if the international environment i s changing when this happens and enough states or enough powerful states continually ignore particular as pect of international law the norm may actually change according to concepts of customary internati onal law a25 apart from states natural inclination to uphold certain norms th force of international law has always come from the pressure that states put upon one another to behave consis tently and to honor their obligations as with any system of law many violatio ns of international law obligations are overlooked if addressed it is usually done purely through diplomacy and the consequences of wanted behavior upon an offending states reputation though violations may be common in fact states try to avoid the appearance of having disregarded international obligations states may so unilaterally adopt sanctions against one another such as the severance of economic or diplomatic ties or through reciprocal action in some cases domestic courts may render judgment agains t foreign state the real m of private international law for an injury though this is complicated area of law where intern ational law intersects with domestic law states have the right to employ force in selfdefense against an ffending state that has used force to the diplomatic instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 a5 attack its territory or political independence states may also use force in collective selfdefense against another state a26 the primary branches of public international law today include z international criminal law z useofforce law z international human rights law z international humanitarian law z maritime law z diplomatic law z consular law z state responsibility law z international environmental law z international trade law z international space law z international aviation law private international law a27 private international law or conflict of laws is th at branch of international law and interstate law that regulates all lawsuits involving foreign w element where difference in result will occur depending on which laws are applied first it is concerned with determini ng whether the proposed forum has jurisdiction to adjudicate and is the appropriate venue for dealing with the dispute second it is concerned with determining which of the competing st ates laws the determining body will use to resolve the dispute it also deals with the enforcement of foreign judgments the object is the resolution of conflicts between competing law systems rather th an resolution of the conflict itself supranational law a28 the european union eu is the only example of supranational legal framework where sovereign nations have pooled their authority through system of courts and poli tical institutions it constitutes new legal order in international law intended for the mutual social nd economic benefit of the member states eu law operates alongside the laws of the member states that have chosen by consent to limit some of their sovereign rights within certain limited fields international organizations a29 an international organization or more formally igo is an organization s uch as the european community or the wto with sovereign states or other igos as members such organizations function according to the principles of inte rgovernmentalism which means that unanimity is required ngos are private organizations that can also be international in scope generally nd correctly used however the term international organization is reserved for intergovernmental organiz ations only legal nature a30 legally speaking treaty must establish an international organi zation which provides it with legal recognition international organizations so established are subjects of internationa l law capable of entering into agreements among themselves or with states thus international rganizations in legal sense are distinguished from mere groupings of states such as the g8 and the g77 neither of which have been founded by treaty though in nonlegal contexts these are sometimes referred to as international organizations as well international organizations must also be distinguished from treaties although all international organizations are founded on treaty many treaties for example the north american free trade agreement nafta do not establish an international organization and rely purely on the member parties for their administration appendix a6 fm 305130 30 september 2008 membership and function a31 international organizations differ in function membership and membershi p criteria membership of some organizations global organizations is open to all the n ations of the world this category includes the and its specialized agencies and the wto othe r organizations are only open to members from particular region or continent of the world like the eu african union association of southeast asian nations asean and so on finally some organizations base their membership on other criteria such as z cultural or historical links for example the commonwealth of nations francophonie the community of portuguese language countries and the latin union z level of economic development or type of economy for example oecd and organiza tion of petroleumexporting countries opec z religion for example organization of the islamic conference were it to come about the ultimate international organization would be federal

nonoverlapping memberships figure a3 several nonoverlapping large alliances nongovernmental organizations a34 the term nongovernmental organization is used in variety of ways all ove r the world and depending on the context in which it is used can refer to many different types of or ganizations in its broadest sense an ngo is one that is not directly part of the structur of government depending on how an ngo is defined they number in the 10000s to several million worldw ide history of nongovernmental organizations a35 though voluntary associations of citizens have existed throughout history n gos along the lines seen today especially on the international level have developed in the pa st two centuries one of the first such organizations the irc was founded in 1863 the irc and red crescent movement are the worlds largest group of humanitarian ngos the phrase nongovernmental organiza tion came into use with the establishment of the organization in 1945 with provisions i n article 71 of chapter 10 of the charter for consultative role for organizations that are neither governme nts nor member states resolution 288x of the ecosoc on 27 february 1950 first gives the definition of inte rnational nongovernmental organization the resolution defines an international nongovernmental orga nization as any international organization that is not founded by an international treaty note lighter colors indicate observer associate or candidate countries appendix a8 fm 305130 30 september 2008 types of nongovernmental organizations a36 ngos are also known by alterna tive terms such as independent sector volunteer sector civic society grassroots organizations transnational social movement or ganizations private voluntary organizations selfhelp organizations and nonstate actors ngos are dis similar group some focus on smallscale relief or development others do the same on much larger scales and still others are primarily political organizations the usaid refers to ngos as private voluntary organizations however many scholars have argued that this definition is highly problematic as many ng are in fact state and corporate funded and projects are managed with professional staffs a37 there are also numerous classifi cations of ngos the typology the wb uses divides them into operational and advocacy z the primary purpose of an operational ngo is the design and implementation of developmentrelated projects one categorization that is frequently used is the division into relieforiented or developmentor iented organizations they can also be classified according to whether they stress service delivery or participati on whether they are religious or secular and whether they are more public or private oper ational ngos can be communitybased national or international z the primary purpose of an advocacy ngo is to defend or promote specific cause as opposed to operational project management these orga nizations typically try to raise awareness acceptance and knowledge by lobbyin g working with the press and conducting activist events an example of this type of ngo is amnesty international the largest human rights organization in the world it forms global community of human rights defenders with more than 18 m illion members supporters and subscribers in over 150 countries and territories purposes and methods a38 ngos exist for variety of purposes usually to further the political or s ocial goals of their members or funders examples include improving the state of the natural environment ncouraging the observance of human rights improving the welfare of the disadvantaged or representing corpor ate agenda however there is huge number of such organizations and their goals cover br oad range of political and philosophical positions these goals can also easily be applied to private schools and athletic organizations ngos also vary in their methods some primarily act as lobbyists while othe rs primarily conduct programs and activities public relations a39 ngos need healthy relationships with the public to meet thei r goals foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments interest groups may be of political importance be cause of their ability to influence social and political outcomes some ngos seek to mobilize public support consulting a40 many international ngos have consultative status with gencies relevant to their area of work as an example the third world network has consu ltative status with the conference on trade and development and the ecosoc in 1946 only 41 ngos had consultative status with t he ecosoc by 2003 this number had risen to 2350 project management a41 management techniques are crucial to project ccess in ngos generally private ngos private have community or environmental focus they addre ss variety of issues such as religion emergency aid and humanitarian affairs they mobilize public support and voluntary contri butions for aid they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries and they often w ork in areas where governmenttogovernment aid is not possible states accept ngos as part of th international relations landscape while they influence national and multilateral policym aking their direct involvement in local action is increasing the diplomatic instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 a9 funding a42 large ngos may have annual budgets in the millions of dollars for in stance the budget of the american association of retired persons was over 540 million dollars in 1999 human rights watch spent and received 217 million us dollars in 2003 funding such large budge ts demands significant fundraising efforts on the part of most ngos major sources of ngo funding include membership dues the sale of goods and services grants from interna tional institutions or national governments and private donations several eu grants pr ovide funds accessible to ngos a43 even though the term ngo implies independence of governments some ngos depend heavily on governments for their funding the eu and the british government donated quarter of the us 162 million income in 1998 of the faminerelief organization oxfam the chris tian relief and development organization world vision collected 55 million us worth of goods in 1998 fr om the american government médecins sans frontières known in english as doctors withou t borders gets 46 percent of its income from government sources legal status criticism and the monitoring and control of n ongovernmental organizations a44 ngos are not legal entities under international law an exception is the international c ommittee of the red cross which states consider legal entity under international law because the organizations basis it the geneva convention in general states view ngos as beneficia l and complementary source filling gaps in society not provided by the public or forprofit sectors ngos have als played crucial role in upholding international law especially treaties however critics argue that although ngos have good intentions they undermine outcomes a45 conservative critics have maintained that ngos too often conflict with states activities going so far as to subvert government actions violate the law and make common cause with criminals and terrorists progressive critics have suggested that imperialism and ngos s hare fine line one of the first modern ngos for example was the american colonization society that founded liberia other famous examples include various christian missionaries throughout the americas as ia and africa during colonial times a46 although most complain t literature is against multilateral or bilateral agencies there are occasional criticisms of ngo operational strategies and inadvertent adverse impacts for example it is often argued that in poorer countries northernfunded and mana ged ngos tend to act as substitutes for popular movements in forums like the world social forum with negative consequences f or the development of local civil society in many developing countries with dysfunctional economies entry into the aid industry is the most profitable professional car eer path for young college graduates as ngos provide services in the community for free or at subsidized rates such as training the private sector is unable to evolve and compete effectively at sustainable levels if an ngo begins offering products or services for fee handicrafts evaluations digging wells counseling and so on it eventua lly becomes competitor with privatesector providers of these sa services however with its do nationfunding support or access to voluntary labor the ngo has significant competitive advantage a47 additional areas of concern include cooption by political or other forces missiondrift changing core services based on an everchanging funding landscape transparency accountability moving beyond charismatic founding leader and dono rdriven rather than lfdefined strategies new ngos occasionally receive dogooder complaints of engaging in action to help withou t understanding the full complexity and interplay of issues which results in more harm than good united states political po wer in the international environment a48 the international

sum of the public mass distributors of news and entertainment cross mediums such as newspapers tv radio broadcasting and text publishers the expansion of internet dia has complicated the concept of mass media because now individuals have means of potential exposure on scale comparable to what was previously restricted to select group of mass media producers traditional mass media has correspondingly lessened monopoly on information these internet medi can include personal web pages podcasts and blogs b10 during the 20th century technology that allowed the massive duplicati on of material drove the growth of mass media physical duplication technologies such as printing re cord pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books newspapers and movies at low pri ces to huge audiences radio and tv allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time b11 mankinds ability to use informational power remained slow smallsca and expensive for millennia and then exploded expon entially in speed scale afford ability and accessibility throughout the 20th century at the beginning of the 21st century prac tically anyone with the freedom and means to do

following z disproportion of power occu rs disproportionate informati onal power accrues to those who control centralized mass media arguably it is inherently undemocra tic z an inability to transmit tacit knowledge the context of content presented must either be explicitly explained or is assumed to be understood by the receiver z an inclination to focus on the unusual and sensatio nal to capture the receivers attention leading to distortion and trivialization of reality z the deliberate promotion of emotions such as anxiety fear or greed can be used to ll particular agenda z an inability to deal with comp lex issues because of time and economic constraints leads to simplification further distorting and trivializing reality b14 this view of central media can be contrasted w ith lateral media such as email networks where messages are all slightly different and spread by pro cess of lateral diffusion democratic and independent use of media theoretically serves to educate the public or electorate about issues regarding government and society undemocratic use of media can lead to indoctrination propaganda an d exploitation publishing b15 publishing is the industry concerned with the

conglomerates refuse to publicize or deem newsworth information that would be harmful to their other interests and of contributing to the merging of entertai nment and news at the expense of tough coverage of serious issues critics also accuse these rger conglomerates of being leading force for the standardization of culture globalization or socalled americanization they are also frequent target of criticism by partisan political groups that often perceive the news productions as biased toward their foes broadcasting companies and their supp orters claim that they maintain strict

such as email online chat file transfer and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the world wide web contrary to common usage the internet and the world wide web are not synonymo us the internet is collection of interconnected computer networks linked by copper wires fiberoptic cables wireless connections and so on the web is collection of interconnected documents linked by

any individual could have means of exposure on s cale comparable to that of mass media for the first time anyone with web site can address global audience although serving t high levels of web traffic is still relatively expensive it is possible that the rise of peertopeer technologies will drive the cost of bandwidth down although vast amount of information imagery and commentary cont ent is

affect distribution of content to the us domestic audience b47 little mass media regulation existed in the united states before the creation of the federal radio commission in 1927 the telecommunications act of 1934 was fundam ental decision on how broadcast mass media would function from then on at the time radio technology was widespre ad among the public and the electromagnetic spectrum was public propert the act reappropriat ed the spectrum to the government and claimed the right to assign spectrum ranges to private part ies as long as they broadcast in the public interest this act creat ed the federal communications commi ssion fcc to replace the federal radio commission b48 lobbyists from the largest radio broadcasters of the time abc and nbc successfully petitioned to attach cost to broadcast licenses this enabled them to price out many amateur broadcasters such was the precedent for much of th following regulatory deci sions which have mostly focused on the percentage of market deemed allowable to single company b49 the telecommunications act of 1996 set the modern tone of deregulati on relaxing of percentage restrictions that solidified the previous history of privatizing the utility and commodifying the spectrum the legislation touted as step th at would foster competition actually resulted in the subsequent mergers of several large companies trend that continues the fcc forum of february 2003 appro ved new media ownership laws that removed many of the restrictions previously imposed to limit ownership of media within local area few of th

newspaper and tv station ownership in the same market were re moved z all tv channels magazines newspapers cable and internet services are now counted and weighted based on peoples average tendency to find news on that medium at the sa time whether channel actually contains news is longer considered in counting the percentage of medium owned by one owner for example it is now possible for two companies to own all of citys two newspapers three local tv stations two national tv networks and eight local radio stations up to 45 percent of the media each as long as there are other companies owning the shopping channel or the discovery channe l and at least 10 percent of other nonnews outlets z previous requirements for periodic review of licenses have been changed licenses are longer reviewed for publicinterest considerations appendix b b10 fm 305130 30 september 2008 b50 depending on ones perspective and political views such media consolidatio n is capable of dominating the informational power to deliberately craft manipulate and disse minate information for conveyance of an intended message or theme to domestic ta b51 in opposition to this trend some us citizens promote production and distribution model of media democracy that theoretically info rms and empowers all members of society and enhances democratic values the term also refers to modern social movement evident in ma ny other countries that attempts to make mainstream media more accountable to the publics they serve and to create democratic alternatives citizens base this concept and social movement on th assertion that increased corporate domination of mass media leads to perceived shrinking of the mark etplace of ideas its propon ents advocate monitoring and reforming the mass media strengthening public service broadcasting and developing and participating in alternative media and citizen journalism b52 media democracy is difficult term to define because in addition to being concept it is also an advocacy movement number of academic and grassr oots organizations each with its own methods and goals are advancing moreover since suspicion of and hostility to corporate inte rests is key tenet of the left end of the us domestic political spectrum much of the media democracy effort runs parallel with anticapitalist even antiamerican agitation ironically one of the central issues routinely assailed by the right end of the us domestic political spectrum is perceived monoli thic and consolidated domestic media dominated by leftist agen da in delivery of content b53 despite the difficulties in defining the term the concept broad ly encompasses the following notions z the health of the democratic political system depends on the efficien t accurate and complete transmission of social political and cultural information in societ z the media are the conduits of th is information as such they should act in the public interest z the mass media have increasingly been unable and uninterested in fulfilling this role because of increased concentration of ownership and commercial pressures z the concept and practice of democracy are under mined if voters and citizens are unable to knowledgeably participate in public policy debates b54 without an informed and engaged citizenry policy issues become defined by political and corporate elites related element of this concept asserts that co rporate media interests lack diversity of voices and viewpoints particularly of traditionally marginalized sectors of the population the following paragraphs discuss alternatives to traditional mass media public broadcasting b55 public broadcasting serves as one potential counte rweight to commercial media as such it is notable element of the socalled media democracy the government and individual donations usually fund public tv and radio broadcasts therefore they are not subject to the same commercial pressures as private broadcasters and theoretically provide distinct source of more diverse indepth media content however public broadcasters are subject to funding instability which jeopardizes their ability to operate consistently moreover public broadcastings editorial objectivity is susceptible to the editorial preferences of those who approve and provide grants which jeopardizes its autonomy alternative and citizen media b56 as response to the asserted shortcomings of the mainstream media proponents of media democracy often advocate supporting and engaging in independent and alternative pr int and electronic media through citizen journalism and citizen media individuals can produce and disseminate information and opinions that the mainstream media marginali zes practically anyone can now easily and cheaply publish audio video and written content to the web home computing has empowered veryone to be publisher of written documents every shade of opini on is now represented and there is published viewpoint for every microconstituency however objec tivity and credibility are endlessly disputed in the absence of consensus over objectivity and credibility such alternative media is unlikely to replace the mass

media democracy b57 similar claim for media democracy is asserted for the online dictionary wikipedia anyone regardless of educational background experience or indepth knowledgecan edit expand or remove content individuals do not have to get the approval of an editorial boa rd to post content although there are administrators on wikipedia they have roughly the same powers as ordinary users wikipedia also lacks corporate control it operates as not forprofit entity and accep ts advertising or corporate investment which can influence or theoretically silence particular ideas typically small individual donations pay its operating costs creators of related site called wikinews intend to provide an alternative news source using the same open collaborative philosophy b58 as with other forms of alternative media such as weblogs the appeal of wikipedia is that anyone can access and contribute to the site this site provides wide range of information in free format and can be handy quick reference similar to traditional cyclopedia however its accessibility diminishes its authority although individuals can dispute inserted content the shaping of mu ch content has objective peer review this allows individuals to easily craf t content to convey slanted editorial position role of united states domestic media b59 us domestic media includes stationary visuals such as billboards

1960s and 1970s national news was only available at set times of the evening after the concl usion of standard workday requiring the newsviewing public to arrange their personal schedules around the limited availability of broadcast national news b62 moreover many news anchor personalities remained in their position s so long that they took on familiar and authoritative iconic status for example walter cronkite cbs news anchor 1963 to 1981 was alternately known as uncle walter or the most trusted man in america critics have claimed that cronkites opinion after the vietnamese tet offensive

on the other hand have to find more innovative ways to package news stories as fresh to the vi ewers such immediate worldwide coverage of news events has speeded th pace of causeandeffect and reaction times in international statecraft formats b72 over the years tv news in the united states has evolved into variety of formats local news and network news once similar in having slow paces and low story count s are now quite different in style z traditional in the early days of tv the public viewed local newscasts as public service the style was straightforward stations and networks divided newscasts into th ree blocks news sports and weather they further divided the news block into national internatio nal and local stories these newscasts usually had white male anchor with w hite males announcing sports and weather as well this form at is longer prevalent z eyewitness news this style developed in the late 1960s networks and stations hired reporters to leave the newsroom and become eyewitnesses of news stories recording t hem on film later they asked reporters to join the anchors in the studio to talk about the st ories most tv news operations are working under some variation of the eyewitness format z action news tv executives devised this style to co mpete against the eyewitness news format the action news format features short stories high story counts in newscasts and strong focus on spot news the action refers to the fast pacing of the newscast z franchise news this style is variation of eyewitness news some stations decide to brand the ir news with slogans such as news you can use or 8 on your side the newscasts at these stations tend to focus more on franchisesstories that cover topic important to l ocal viewers the most successful franchises are health and consumer news but other examples inc lude parenting pets environment and crime fighting almost every news op eration uses some franchises and few stations build their news identities around these topical stories entirely z interview news shows many cable news channels run these shows which incorporate lots of talk and often heated debates between anchors and guests interview news program s typically promote discernable editorial positions on the topics covered z tabloid news this style blurs the line between news and entertainment wit h sensational writing and energetic reporters tabloid news programs generally confine stories to popular culture items alleged social dangers b73 paralleling tvs entrenched informational primacy in current us family life and society vocal chorus of legislators scientists parents and politi cal commentators raise objections to an uncritical acceptance of the medium continuous disputes over the effect tv view ing may have on children whether it influences individuals to misbehave and leads to erosion of social more s or health and how aired content is controlled to further particular political agendas are now commo n complaints judgments on such issues are beyond the scope of this manual however given the assumed fundamental mission of us domestic news to deliver truthand the example of cronkite declaring the vie tnam war unwinnable after tet referenced above and the effect that declarati on may have had on public opinionit is reasonable to assume that news programs do exert influence on domestic support for u s foreign policy b74 the extent of such media influence and the forces and agendas behind it are s ubjects of continuous debate neutral understanding of the term mains tream media msm suggests outlets that are in appendix b b14 fm 305130 30 september 2008 harmony with the prevailing direction of influence in the culture at large in the united states usage of this term often depends on the connotations the

it becomes defense concern the united states may engage in io psyop ew physical stri ke and so on against that adversarial percentage military operations and the information environment b88 information is strategic resource vital to national security dominan ce of the information environment is reality that extends to the armed forces of the united states at all levels military operations in particular are dependent upon many simultaneous and integrated activities that in turn depend upon information and information systems which the united state s must protect b89 in modern military operations commanders face variety of information challenges technical challenges include establishing and maintaining conn ectivity particularly in austere and distributed locations operational challenges include the complex ities of modern combat against adversaries with growing information capabilities for example regardless of size adversaries including terrorist groups can counter us efforts through propaganda campaigns or develop purchas or download from the internet tools and techniques enabli ng them to attack us information and information systems which may result in tangible impacts on us diplomatic econo mic or military efforts the global information environment and its associated technologies are poten tially available to everyone and as result us military commanders face another challenge advers aries now have the capability to pass information coordinate exchange ideas and synchr onize their actions instantaneously b90 the commander visualizes plans and directs operationsio are part of those op erations the commanders intent should specify visualization of the desired effects of io nd other operations for the staff to develop io objectives the commander must not only be able to vis ualize the desired effects of io but also to understand the adversarys capabilities to lim it the impact of us operations while the adversary strives to acquire information superiority from the united states these effec ts can vary based on the objectives of the mission ranging from disrupting an enemy commander in comb at to assuring friendly nations through combin ed or multinational military training or ex ercises during peacetime the nature of the conflict determines the role of the military and the desired end stat or effect if conducting humanitarian assistance mission then generating goodwill for th services rendered and departing with favorable impression of us activities becomes prim ary objective the commanders intent must include the concept of how these effects will help achieve force objectives b91 military forces operate in an information enviro nment of constantly changing content and tempo this evolution adds another layer of complexity to the challenge of planning and xecuting military operations at specific time and in specific location continuum of long medi um and shortterm the informational instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 b17 factors each of which must be considered together when planning and ex ecuting military operations shapes the information environment commanders and io cell chiefs must be pr epared to adapt or modify io plans to meet their desired io effects longterm factors that ma shape the information environment include the various ways by which humans z organize nationstates tribes families z govern z interact as groups culture sociology religion z experience regional influence stability alliances economic relation ships z advance technologically mediumterm factors may include z the rise and fall of leaders z the competition between groups over resources or goals z the incorporation of specific technologi into information infrastructure z the employment of resources by organizations to take advantage of it and infrastructure shortterm factors may include z the weather z the availability of finite resources to support or employ specific in formation technology it z the ability to extend or maintain sensors and portable information i nfrastructure to the specific location of distant military operations b92 the pervasiveness of the information environment in human activity combined with the speed and processing power of modern it enhance and complicate military efforts to organize tra in equip plan and operate today technology has opened the way to an everincreasing span of control b93 us forces perform their missions in an increas ingly complex information environment to succeed it is necessary for us forces to gain and maintain information superiorit dod policy describes information superiority as the operational advantage gained by the bility to collect process and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information wh ile exploiting or denying an adversarys ability to do the same the forces possessing better information and using that i nformation to more effectively gain understanding have major advantage over their adversaries commander who gai ns this advantage can use it to accomplish missions by affecting perceptions attitu des decisions and actions however information superiority is not static during operations all sides c ontinually attempt to secure their own advantages and deny useful information to adversaries the operational advantages of inform ation superiority can take several forms ranging from the ability to create comm on operational picture to the ability to delay an adversarys decision to commit reinforcements b94 recognizing information superiority can be difficult to attain over cert ain adversaries but its advantages are significant when it exists the info rmation available to commanders allows them to accurately visualize the situation anticipate events and make appr opriate timely decisions more effectively than adversary decision makers b95 in essence information superiority enhances commanders freedom of action and all ows them to execute decisions and maintain the initiative while remain ing inside the adversarys decision cycle however commanders recognize that without continuous io designed to achieve and maintain information superiority adversaries may counter those advantages and possibly attain infor mation superiority themselves commanders can achieve information superiority by mai ntaining accurate situational understanding while controlling or affecting the adve rsaries or tas percep tions the more commander can shape this disparity the gr eater the friendly advantage b96 potential information adversaries come in many shapes however they traditionally are hostile countries who wish to gain information on us military capabilities and intentions malicious hackers who wish to steal from or harm the usg terrorists and economic competitors ju st to name few potential adversarial information attack techniques are nume rous some particularly electronic means can be prevented by the consistent application of encryption firewalls and other netw ork security techniques others are considerably more difficult to counter possible threat information chniques include but are not appendix b b18 fm 305130 30 september 2008 limited to deception electronic attack ea computer network attack cna propaganda and ps yop and signals intelligence sigint operations b97 with the free flow of information present in all th eaters such as tv phone and internet conflicting messages can quickly emerge to defeat the intended ef fects as result continuous synchronization and coordination between io pa pd and us allies is impe rative it also helps to ensure that information themes employed during operations involving neut ral or friendly populations remain consistent b98 io may involve complex legal and policy issues and require careful review beyo nd strict compliance with legalities us military activities in the inform ation environment as in the physical domains are conducted as matter of policy and societ values on basis of respect for fundamental human rights us forces whether operating physically from bases or locations overse as or from within the boundaries of the united states or elsewhere are required by law and policy to act in accordance with iaw us law and the law of armed conflict principles of information operations b99 success in military operations depends on collecting and integrating ssential information while denying it to the adversary and other tas io encompass planning coordinating and s ynchronizing the employment of current capabilities to deliberately affect or defe nd the information environment to achieve the commanders objectives io are integrated into join t operations as follows z core capabilities ew computer network oper ations cno psyop mildec and opsec are integrated into the planning and execution of operations in the information environment z supporting io capabilities ia physical security physical attack ci an d combat camera comcam have military purposes other than io but they either operate in or affect the information environment z related io capabilities pa cmo and dspd may be constrained by us polic or legal considerations although these capabilities have common interfaces with io their purposes and rules make them separate and distinct as result it is essential that commanders and their staffs coordinate their efforts when ex ercising their functions within the information environment b100 io are primarily concerned with affecting decisions and decisionmaking processes while defending friendly decisionmaking processes primary mechanisms used to affe ct the information environment include influence disruption corruption or usurpation table b 1 page b19 describes how joint operations integrate io b101 the ability of io to affect and defend decision ma king is based on five fundamental assumptions although each of these assumptions is an important enabling factor for io they will not all necessarily be true for every operation for any sp ecific operation where one or more of these assumptio ns are not met the risk assessment provided to the commander woul d be adjusted accordingly the five fundamental assumptions are as follows z it is generally accepted that the quality of inform ation that is considered valuable to human and automated decision makers is universal however the relativ importance of each quality criterion of information may vary based on the influences of geography language culture religion organization experience or personality z it is known that decisions are made base d on the information available at the time z it is possible with finite resources to understand the relevant aspec ts of the information environment to include the processes deci sion makers use to make decisions z it is possible to affect the information envir onment in which specific decision makers act through psychological electr onic or physical means z it is possible to measure the eff ectiveness of io actions in relation to an operational objective b102 since human activity takes place in the information environment it is potentially subject to io however io should only target missionrelated critical psychological electronic and physical points in the information environment b103 io capabilities can produce effects and achieve objec tives at all levels of war and across the range of military operations the nature of the modern information environment complicates the identification of the informational instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 b19 the boundaries between these levels therefore at all levels informa tion activities including io must be consistent with broader national security policy and strategic objectives sometimes only small ta is an adversary within an otherwise nonadversarial state at the other end of the spec trum of conflict when conflict between states is elevated to potential or actual employment of armed forces the entire population of an adversarial state may be the ta of io table b1 information operations integration into joint operations b104 io are conducted across the range of military oper ations io can make significant contributions before major operations begin because of these factors the io environment should be prepared and assessed through variety of engagement and intelligence activi ties in

is to deter potential or act ual adversary or other ta from taking actions that threaten us national interests in addition io actions executed through civiliancontrolled portions of the global information envi ronment must account for us policy and legal issues as well as potentially disruptive infrastructure issues t hrough civilmilitary coordination at all levels io actions that may cause unintended reactio ns from us or foreign populaces also require civilmilitary coordination b106 io may target human decision making or automated decision support systems with s pecific actions technology allows for increasingly precise targeting of autom ated decision making and affords more sophisticated ways to protect it however targe ting automated decision making is only effective if the adversary is relying on it b107 the focus of io is on the deci sion maker and the information environment to affect decision making and thinking processes knowledge and understanding of the situati on io can affect data information and knowledge in three basic ways z by taking specific psychological electronic or physical actions that add modify or remove information from the environment of various individuals or groups of decision makers z by taking actions to affect the infrastructure th at collects communicates processes and stores information in support of targeted decision makers z by influencing the way people receive process interpret and use da ta information and knowledge b108 commanders use io capabilities in both offensive and defensive perations simultaneously to accomplish the mission increase their force effectiveness and protect their organizations and systems fully integrating io capabilities requires planners to treat io as single function commanders can use io capabilities to accomplis h the following z destroy destruction is damaging system or entity so badly that it cannot pe rform any function without being replaced or entirely rebuilt z disrupt disruption is breaking or interrupting the flow of information z degrade degradation is reducing the effectiven ess or efficiency of adversary c2 or communications systems and information collection efforts or means io can also degrade the morale of unit the targets value or the quality of adversary decisions and actions z deny denial is preventing the adversary from accessi ng and using critical

exploit exploitation is gaining access to adversary c2 systems to collect information or to plant false or misleading information z influence influence is causing others to behave in manner favorable

supporting automated infrastructures adversari are increasingly exploring and testing io actions as an asymmetric threat that can be used to thwart us mil itary objectives that are heavily reliant on information systems this threat requires the us military to employ defensive technologies and utilize leadingedge tactics and pr ocedures to protect us forces and systems from attacks core supporting and related information operations capabilities b112 of the five core io capabilities psyop opsec and mildec have played major part in military operations for many centuries in this modern age they have been j oined first by ew and most recently by cno together these five capabilities used in co njunction with supporting and related capabilities provide the jfc with the principal means of in fluencing an adversary and other tas by enabling the joint forces freedom of operation in the information environ ment psychological operations b113 psyop are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions motives objective reasoning and ultim ately the behavior of their governments organizations groups and individuals the purpose of psyop is t induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behaviors favorable to the originators objectives ps yop are vital part of the broad range of us activities to influence foreign

psyop assets appendix b b22 fm 305130 30 september 2008 may be of particular value to the jfc in precombat and postcombat operati ons when other means of influence are restrained or not authorized military deception b116 mildec are deliberately sleading actions executed for adversar decision makers as to friendly military capabilities intentions and operations thereb causing the adversary to take specific actions or inactions that contribute to the accomplishment of the friendly forces m ission mildec and opsec are complementary activitiesmildec seeks to encourage in correct analysis causing the adversary to arrive at specific false deductions while opsec seeks to deny real information to an adversary and prevent correct deduction of friendly plans to be effective mildec operati on must be susceptible to adversary collection systems and seen as credible to the enemy commander and staff plausible approach to mildec planning is to employ friendly coa that friendly forces can execute and that adversary intelligence can verify however mildec planners must not fall into the trap of ascribing to the adversary particular attitudes values and reactions that mirro r image likely friendly action in the same situation for example assuming that the adversary will respond or act in particular manner based on how us forces would respond b117 core supporting and related io capabilities ways represent competing priorities for the resources required for deception and the resources requ ired for the real operation for this reason the deception plan should be developed concurrently with the real plan starting with the commanders and staffs initial estimate to ensure proper resourcing of both to encourage incorrect analysis by the adversary it is usually more efficient and effective to provide false purpose for r eal activity than to create false activity opsec of the deception plan is at leas t as important as opsec of the real plan since compromise of the deception may expose the real plan this requirement for cl osehold planning while ensuring detailed coordination is the greatest challe nge to mildec planners on joint staffs mildec planning and oversight responsibility is normally organized as sta ff deception element in the operations directorate of joint staff j3 b118 mildec is fundamental to succe ssful uw it exploits the adve rsarys information systems processes and capabilities successf ul mildec rely on an understanding of how the adversary commander and his staff think and plan and how both use information managem ent to support their efforts effective mildec requires high degree of coordinatio n with all elements of friendly forces activities in the information environment as well as with physical activities ea ch of the core supporting and related capabilities has part to play in the development of successful m ildec and in maintaining its credibility over time while pa should not be involved in the provision of false information i t must be aware of the intent and purpose of mildec in order not to inadvertently compromise i t operations security b119 opsec is process of identifying critical information and subsequentl analyzing friendly actions and other activities to z identify what friendly information is necessary for the adversary to have sufficiently accurate knowledge of friendly forces and intentions z deny adversary decision makers critical information about friendly force s and intentions z cause adversary decision makers to misjud ge the relevance of known critical friendly

across int ernational boundaries or territories in most countries it represents significant share of the gross domes tic product gdp while international trade has been present throughout much of history its economic social and political importance has been on the rise in recent centurie s industrialization ad vanced transportation globalization multinational corporations and outsourcing ll have major impact on what is politically and militarily possible increasing international tradean economic and fi nancial functionis the primary meaning of globalization regulation of international trade d2 traditionally bilateral treaties between states regulated trades for centuries most states maintained high tariffs and many other restrictions on international trade through belief in mercantilist trade theory in the 19th century especi ally in britain belief in free trade became paramount si nce that time this view has dominated the thinking among we stern nations in the years sinc wwii multilateral treaties and organizations such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade and th wto have attempted to create globally regulated trade structure enforced thro ugh diplomatic pressure and international law d3 usually the most economically powerful nations support free trade alt hough they often engage in selective protectionism of some domestic industries that are politically important the protective tariffs applied to agriculture and textiles by the united stat europe and japan for example the netherlands and great britain were both strong advocates of free tr ade when they were econom ically dominant today the united states the uk australia and japan are fr ee trades greatest proponents however many other countries such as india china and russia are increasingly advocatin g free trade as their economic power increases as tariff levels fall there is also an in creasing willingness to negotiate nontariff measures including foreign direct investment alternative procurement and trade facilitation d4 at the global level the wto regulates international trade several other re gional arrangements such as mercosur in south america nafta between th united states canada and mexico and the eu between 27 independent states regulate internationa l trade as well the 2005 buenos aires talks on the planned establishment of the free tr ade area of the americas failed largely because of opposition from the populations of latin american nations similar agreements such s the multilateral agreement on investment have also failed in recent years d5 some nations support the regulation of international trade because of risks inherent in the free trade ideal free trade makes economic sense because the elim ination of artificial costs and barriers lowers the cost of goods and services however comparative advantage would automatical ly flow to those producers with natural advantages such as favorable climates for agriculture or natural resources or artificial advantages based on preexisting conditions such as cheapor even slavela bor or welldeveloped industrial base while free trade theory may be economically sound it can be disruptive to markets industries and entire societies throughout history resolved trade disputes perceptions of interstate exploitation seizure of assets or denial of access to markets or reso urces have caused wars given the political consequences inherent in such international trad it is unsurprising that states attempt to use state power to seek advantage for their economic enterprises through various conomic weapons some of the economic weapons employed by nations throughout history include z market penetration z protectionism or trade sanctions z trade wars appendix d d2 fm 305130 30 september 2008 d6 market penetration is the offen sive deliberate attempt to enter another nations economy to secure market for ones goods and rvices because this penetration co mpetes with indigenous suppliers it may be unwelcome for economic political cultural or other reasons as businesses compete for market dominance some market penetration may involve the us of aggressive techniques to subdue and even eliminate market competitors typical tools of market penetration used throughout history include z military and political conquest an invader can impose controls on supply and market access this extreme action can be pretext for broadbased general war z market creation this comprises fostering demand for goods and services that tradition ally is unprecedented developing widespread demand fo r opium in china or taste for asian tea in britain by british companies are examples z monopoly if an external power can control the only supply of good or service that i s in demand it can not only dominate the indigenous market but also demand higher pri ces z subsidized industry and dumping if government provides subsidies to its industry such that the industry does not compete for inputs similar to its international comp etitors that industry will have an artificial advantage in producing goods and services competitors can then sell those goods and services at lower price than indigenous products left unchallenged s uch dumping can force the indigenous suppliers to go out of business leading in theory to supply monopoly and market domination by the foreign provider d7 protectionism is the economic policy of restrainin g trade between nations through methods such as high tariffs on imported goods restrictive quotas variety of restrictive government regulations designed to discourage imports and antidumping laws in an attempt to protect domes tic industries in particular nation from foreign takeover or competition this po licy contrasts with theoretical free trade free trade institutes artificial barriers to entry protectionism is mostly u nderstood as policies that protect businesses and stable labor forces by restricting or regulating trade betw een foreign nations protectionist weapons of the economic in strument of power include z intervention any use of state power to bolster an economic entity such artificial acti ons are outside of the normal economic laws of supply and demand in free market economic interventions have political dimensions that may or may not b obvious to all all of the following specific weapons are examples of intervention z subsidies these are targeted government allocations of money to protect existing busi nesses from risk associated with change such as the costs of labor materials and so on z protective tariffs tariffs are form of tax designed to increase the price of foreign competitors goods by artificially increasing the cost of imports on par or higherthandomestic prices z quotas by restricting the amount of imports quotas prevent th introduction of competitive goods and services sometimes st ates impose quotas to prevent the dumping of cheaper foreign goods that would overwhelm the market and drive indigenous suppliers out of business z tax cuts tax cuts can function as reverse or shadow subsidy if the indig enous government makes targeted tax relief that alleviates the norm burdens of social and business costs these cuts can provide an artificial advantage to the indigenous busines s relative to foreign competitors z trade restrictions trade restrictions include all mean s to frustrate the free import and competition of foreign goods typical restricti ons include bureaucratic requirements red tape for licensing quality controls safety inspections quarantine cult uralsensitivity protestations and so on d8 protectionism has frequently been associated with economic theories such as mercantilism the belief that it is beneficial to maintain positive trade balance and i mport substitution protectionist actions may be standard policy or may be reaction to the aggressive sometimes unfa ir actions of foreign competitors such defensive retaliatory actions are trade sanctions they tend to arise in the context of an unresolved trade or policy dispute such as disagreement about the fairness of policy affecting internationa l trade imports or exports for example in 2002 the united states placed import tariffs on steel to protect the us steel industry from more efficient foreign produc ers such as china and russia the wto ruled that the economic instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 d3 these tariffs were illegal the eu threatened retaliatory tariffs sanctions on range of us goods forcing the usg to remove the steel tariffs in early 2004 d9 trade sanctions are only one specific type of ec onomic power trade sanctions are regarded as political interventions in an otherwise free flow of economic goods and serv ices recently the united states and multilateral partners threatened sanctions against iran and north korea in response to those regimes threat to develop nuclear arsenals this is not primarily trade s anction because the normal volume of trade between these nations and the united stat is already limited st ates can manipulate other economic variables such as grants of aid credit currency value manipulation and acc ess to financing to put direct or indirect pressure on other governments to modify politi cal behavior d10 being frequently retaliatory in nature trade and economic sanctions can rat chet out of control and lead to trade wars trade war refers to two or more nations increasing or creating tariffs or other trade barriers in retaliation for other trade barriers it is th opposite of free trade economists believe trade wars are nonproductive they also believe that trade wars decrease th economic welfare and total social surplus of all nations involved politically however the threat of trade war is helpfu l in winning concessions this is another example of the complex relationship between more than one instr ument of powerthe diplomatic political and the economic the wto is the world governing body for trade disputes d11 economic and financial flows are natural charact eristic of the international environment and fundamental activity of human society when economic relations between two countries exist most act ivity is conducted by economic sectors of society in general the degree of s tate government direction or intervention in the economy will vary with the nature of each ruling reg ime when state governments take action in international trade or economic disputes they attempt to solve the dispute through bilateral diplomacy multilateral diplomacy and recourse to intern ational trade and legal bodies to seek honoring of agreements and international law enforcement failing diplomatic solution or successful international arbitration state governments can also intervene domestically by restric ting or blocking natural economic and financial flows corporations d12 just as the state remains the central structural concept of internation political relations the company or corporation is the central structural concept of international economics corporation is legal entity collectively owned by number of natural person s or other legal entities however corporation can exist completely separate from those entities this separation gives the corporation unique powers that other legal entities lack the laws of place of in corporation determine the extent and scope of corporations status and capacity d13 investors and entrepreneurs often form joint stoc k companies and incorporate them to facilitate business as this form of business is now extremely prev alent the term corporation is often used to refer specifically to such business corp orations corporations may also be formed for local government municipal corporation political religious and charit able purposes notforprofit corporation or government programs governmentowned corporation legal status d14 the law typically views corporation as fictional person legal person r moral person as opposed to natural person under such doctrine corporation enjoys ma ny of the rights and obligations of individual persons such as the ability to own property sign bindin g contracts pay taxes exercise certain constitutional rights and otherwise par ticipate in society on the other hand corporations often have rights not granted to individuals such as treaty rights d15 the most salient features of incorporation include z limited liability unlike in partnership or sole proprietorship members of corporation have limited liability for the corporations debts and obligations li mited liability allows anonymous trading in the shares of the corpora tion greatly increases its ability to raise more funds for enterprises and reduces investor risk this in turn greatly increases both the number of willing investors and the amount they are likely to invest thus adding liquidity and volume to the stock market appendix d d4 fm 305130 30 september 2008 z perpetual lifetime the assets and structure of the corporation exist beyond the lifetime of any of its members or agents perpetual lifetime allows for stability and accumula tion of capital which becomes available for investment in projects of larger size and ov er longer term than if the corporate assets remained subject to dissolution and distribution the perpetual lifetime feature is an indication of the unbounded potential duration of the corporations existence as well as its accumulation of wealth and thus power in theory corporation can have its charter revoked at any time putting an end to its existence as legal entity howeve r in practice dissolution only occurs for corporations that request it or fail to meet annual filing requirem ents z ownership and control humans and other legal entities composed of humans such as trust s and other corporations can have the right to vote or share in the profit of corporations in the case of forprofit corporations these voters hold shares of stock as proof of ownership of the corporation this is why they are called shareholders or stockholders w hen stockholders exist corporation may exist as nonstock corp oration in this situation the corporation has members who have the right to vote on the corpora tions operation instead of stockholders if the nonstock corporation is not operated for profit it is called notforprofit corporation in either category the corporation includes collection of individuals with distinct legal status and with special privileges not provided to ordinary unincorporated businesses vol untary associations or groups of individuals d16 typically board of directors governs corporatio n on the behalf of the members the corporate members elect the directors and the board has fiduciary duty to look after the interests of the corporation the board chooses the corporate officers such as the chief executive officer president treasurer and other titled officers to manage the affairs of the corporation d17 creditors such as banks can also control in part corporations in return for lendi ng money to the corporation creditors can demand controlling interest similar to that of shareholder including one or more seats on the board of directors creditors do not own the corporation as shareholders do but can outweigh the shareholders in practice especially if th corporation is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot survive without credit d18 members of corporation have residual interest should the corporation end its existence the members are the last to receive its assets following cr editors and others with interests in the corporation this can make investment in corporation risky however the corporations l imited liability which ensures that the members will only be liable for the amount they contribut ed outweighs the risk this only applies in the case of forprofit cor porations nonprofits are not allowed to have residual benefits available to the members formation d19 historically special charter of governments created corporations today corporations are usually registered with the state province or federal government and are regula ted by the laws enacted by that government as part of this registration corporations are often required to design ate the principal address and registered agent of the corporation d20 generally corporation files articles of incorporation with the government ying out the general nature of the corporation the amount of stock it is to issue and the names and addresse s of directors once the government approves the articles the corporations directors meet to creat bylaws that govern the internal functions of the corporation such as meeting procedures and offi cer positions d21 the law of the jurisdiction in which corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities as well as its finances if corporatio n operates outside its home state it is often required to register with other governments as foreign corporation and is usually subject to laws of its hos t state pertaining to employment crimes contracts and civil actions the nature of the corporation cont inues to evolve through existing corporations pushing new ideas and structures

early commercial corporations were formed under frameworks set up by governments of states to undertake tasks that appeared too risky or too expensive for individuals or governments many european

large corporations purcha sed smaller corporations to expand their industrial base japanese firms developed horizontal conglomeration model the keiretsu which other countries later duplicated while corporate effici ency and profitability skyrocketed small shareholder control diminished and directors of corporations assumed greater control over business cont ributing in part to the hostile takeover movement of the 1980s and the accounting scan dals that brought down enron and worldcom following the turn of the century d24 more recent corporate developments include downsizing contractingout or outs ourcing offshoring and narrowing activities to core business as information technol ogy global trade regimes and cheap fossil fuels enable corporations to reduce and externalize labor costs transpor tation costs and transaction costs and thereby maximize profits types of corporations d25 most corporations register with the local jurisdiction as either stock corporation or nonstock corporation stock corporations represent ownership of the corporation by shares of stock stock corporation is generally forprofit corporation n onstock corporation does not have owners however it may have members who have voting rights in the corporation some jurisdictions for example washington dc separate corporations into forprofit and nonpro fit instead of stock and nonstock d26 the institution most often referenced by the word corporation is public or publicly traded corporation the shares of which ar traded on public market for ex ample the new york stock exchange or nasdaq specifically designed for the buying and selling of shares of stock f corporations by and to the general public most of the largest businesses in the world are pu blicly traded corporations however the majority of corporations are cl osely held privately held or close corporations meaning that ready market exists for the trading of ownership interests small group of business people or companies own and manage many such corporations although the size these corporations can be s vast as the largest public corporations d27 the affairs of publicly traded an d closely held corporations are similar in many respects the main difference in most countries is that publicly traded corporations have the b urden of complying with additional securities laws and stricter corporate governance stand ards though the laws governing organizations may differ the courts often interpret provisions of the law that apply to profitmaking enterprises in similar manner when applying principles to nonprofit orga nizationsas the underlying structures of these two types of entities often resemble each other multinational corporations d28 following on the success of the corporate model at national level m any corporations have become mncs or transnational corporations tncs growin g beyond national boundaries to attain sometimes remarkable positions of power and influence in the process of globalizing d29 the typical tnc or mnc may fit into web of overlapping ownerships and directors hips with multiple branches and lines in different regions and many such subgroupings compri sing

economic influence in politicians representative districts as well as their extens ive financial resources available for public relations and political lobbying mncs play an important role in globa

tax revenue employment and economic activity within their borders to compete countries and regional political districts offer incentives to mncs such as tax breaks pledges of governmental assistance or improved infrastructure or lax environmental and labor standards d31 mncs try to affect government policy through lobby ing and donating to politicians that management feels will be supportive of corporate goals on topics ranging from tariff structures through labor laws to environmental regulations however there is unified multinati onal perspective on any of these issues because mncs have different competitive goals between and within industries d32 by contrast there are many more actions taken by governments to affect corpora behavior from nationalization forcing company to sell local

social and psychological powers that may be exercised either by the expenditure of money or by its mere possession these include the power to enhance popularity status and prestige th capacity to enhance the sense of selfworth and the power to attain or influence political power e2 number of commodity money systems were among the earliest forms of money to em erge examples include iron bars cowry shells salt ingots of copper silver and gold ru m and cash crops such as tobacco rice indigo or maize in recent experience struggling ag ainst alqaeda and global terrorist networks it was discovered that the hawala system of clandestine terr orist financing was organized around trade in honey under commodity money system the objects used as money ve intrinsic value that is they have value beyond their use as money for example gold co ins retain value because of golds useful physical properties besi des its value because of monetary usage whereas paper notes are only worth as much as the monetary value assigned to them groups usually adopt com modity money to simplify transactions in barter economy and so it functions first as medi um of exchange e3 some forms of commodity money are too bulky and difficult to transport lea ding to the invention of more practical symbolic substitute s goldsmiths receipts became an accepted substitu for gold in 17th century england the goldsmiths were the precursors of banks and th receipts they issued were the precursors of the banknote through most of the 19th century commercial ba nks in europe and north america issued their own banknotes based on the same principle of partial backing from there it was only one further step to create true fiat money currency with negligible inherent value and backing of commodity central authority government creates new money by issuing paper c urrency or creating new bank deposits the central authority mandating the moneys acceptance as legal tender under penalty of law and demanding this money in payment of taxes or tribute most frequentl enhances fiat moneys widespread acceptance by the early 1970s almost all countries had bandoned the gold standard and converted their national currencies to pure fiat money social evolution of money e4 money is an invention of the human mind the creation of money is possible because hum an beings have the capacity to accord value to symbols money is symbol th at represents the value of goods and services the acceptance of any object as moneybe it wampum gold coin paper currency note or digital bank account balanceinvolves the consent of both the individu user and the community thus all money has psychological and social as well as an economic dimension characteristics e5 money is generally considered to have the followi ng three characteristics an d associated features z it is medium of exchange medium of exchange is an intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of pure barter system it should have liquidity and be easily tradable easily transportable and durable z it is unit of account unit of account is standard nu merical unit of measurement of the market value of goods services and other transactions unit of account is prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt it should be divisible into sm all units without destroying its value fung ible one unit or piece must be exactly equivalent to another and it must be specific weight measure or size to be verifiably countable appendix e2 fm 305130 30 september 2008 z it is store of value to act as store of value commodity form of money or financial capital it must be able to be reliably saved stored and retrievedand be predictabl useful when retrieved therefore it should be durable of stable value and difficult to counterfeit and the genuine must be easily recognizable money also is typically that whi ch has the least declining marginal utility meaning that as more units accumu late each unit is worth about the same as the prior units and not substantially less e6 moreover libertarians and most laissezfaire economi sts would argue that an additional characteristic is that money is anonymous this view requires that money is not subject to governme nt tracking or does not require any equipment tools or electricity to use and is useable for purchase s in black market modern forms e7 people commonly use banknotes also known as paper money and coins the mos t liquid forms of tangible money for small persontoperson transactions today people com monly use gold as store of value but not often as medium of exchange or unit of account although central bank s do use gold as unit of account less tangible forms of money exist that nevertheless serve the same functions as money checks debit cards and wire transfers are an easy means to transfer larger amounts of money between bank accounts electronic money is an entirely nonphysical currency that pe ople use and trade over the internet credit e8 people often loosely refer to credit as money people use money to buy goods and ser vices whereas people use credit to buy goods and services on the promis to pay with money in the future this distinction between money and credit causes much confusion in discussions of monetary theory in lay terms people frequently use the terms credit and money interchangeably for example bank depo sits are generally included in summations of the national broad money supply however any detaile d study of monetary theory recognizes the proper dis tinction between money and credit creation of money e9 although people easily identify and distinguish types of money the act ual nature of money and the manner in which it is created is less easily understood th fact that commodities ch as gold silver furs or tobacco leaves have value does not make any of them money commoditie s only become money when people widely accept them as symbol representing cer tain value of goods and services and in exchange for other goods and services of commensurate perceived value trust in the commoditys authenticity and universal acceptance and confidence in the availability of goods and services for redemption are essential criteria e10 later banks became the principle source of new money banks take in dep osits and issue loans to borrowers either by paying out some of the currency receipted on deposit or simply by c reating new deposit in the borrowers account without receiving currency to back it up by this means banks create many times more money than the amount they receive or hold on deposit in turn central banks further multiply the amount of currency and demand deposits by printing additional currency and using it to purchase government bonds or by lending it to commercial banks by creating fresh depo sits at the central bank for the bank just as the bank does for its own borrowers economic value of money e11 the value of money depends on what it can purchase not what it is made of fiat m oney has value because people can use it to purcha goods and services even though it has intrinsic value or utility other than as medium of exchange the intrinsic value of gold and s ilver remains unaltered by the quantity available however their value as medium of exchang is directly dependent on the availability of goods and services for sale when explorers discovered huge quantities of gold and even larger amounts of silver in the new world and brought the gold and silver back to europe for version into coin the purchasing power of those coins fell by 60 to 80 perc ent prices of commodities rose because the supply of goods for sale did not keep pace with the increased supply of money in addition the relative value of silver the financial instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 e3 to gold shifted dramatically downward the government s that issue todays nationa l currencies back them not gold or silver the governments are backed by the productive capacity of the societies they represent problems with paper as money e12 because of the ease of production paper money may lose value through infl ation and in todays electronic era vast quantities of money can be created with few key strokes perhaps the biggest criticism of paper money is that its stability is generally subject to the wh im of government regulation rather than the disciplines of mark et phenomena money and economy e13 money is one of the most central topics studied in economics and th value of money is the central concept in finance monetarism is an economic theory that predominantly deals wi th the supply and demand for money monetary policy aims to manage money supply inflation and int erest to affect output and employment inflation is the decrease in the value of specific currency over time dramatic increases in the money supply can cause such decrease of value the interest rate the cost of borrowing money is an important tool used to control inflation and economic growth in monetary econ omics governments often make central banks responsible for monitoring and controlling the money supply interest rates and banking e14 monetary crisis can have very significant economi c effects particularly if it leads to monetary failure and the adoption of much less efficient barter economy this happene d in russia for example after the fall of the soviet union there have been many historical arguments regar ding the combination of moneys functions some arguing that they need more sepa ration and that single unit is insufficient to deal with them all financial capital is more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments whether or not they are uniform ly recognized tender money supply e15 the money supply is the amount of money available within specific economy vailable for purchasing goods or services the money supply in th united states exists in four escalating categories m0 m1 m2 and m3 the categories grow in size with m3 representing all f orms of money including credit and m0 representing only base money coins bills and central bank deposits m0 is also money that can satisfy private banks reserve requirements in the united states the federal reserve is responsible for controlling the money supply while in the euro area the respective institution is the european central bank other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the bank of japan peoples bank of china and the bank of england social and psychological value of money e16 money is so universally valued that people consider its value selfevi dent money today is valued for the products and services for which it can be exchanged the security it provides ag ainst unexpected needs the economic power it generates the political influence it exerts the social status it offers to those who possess it and the selfconfidence and sense of accomplishment it fost ers in those who earn it linkages between money and other social institutions e17 the evolution of money illustrates how each new social institution creates linkages with other existing social institutions as it develops and how those linkag gradually expand into complex networks of relationships until they become inseparable elements of si ngle social web the evolution of money began as medium of exchange and measure of value money thus served as stimulant f or the exchange of goods and services as medium for storage of value it gave rise to banking by cre ating and lending money banks became catalysts for the further developmen t of trade and industry in the form of taxation money supported the development of government these linkages are direct expressions f the primary powers of money to facilitate transactions appendix e4 fm 305130 30 september 2008 e18 in addition money exercises secondary influences on the society pol itically the right to collect taxes helped monarchies centralize power and influence into national government s at later stage the everincreasing need of that government for more funds made it increasingly depen dent and subject to those sections of society that possessed or controlled large sums of money the glish parliament eventually wrested power from the king by first acquiring the sole right t raise taxes paving the way for democracy later the wealthy merchant class acquired increasing infl uence over the political establishment socially money has helped breakdown the rigid class structure th at allocated privileges according to ones birth in mone economy access to goods and services is based on the capacity to pay rather than ones social origins thus it helps elimin ate social discrimination based on caste and class private currencies e19 in many countries laws have severely restricted th issue of private paper currencies in the socalled free banking era 1837 to 1866 some 8000 private banks in the united states issued priv ate money in scotland and northern ireland the government licensed private sector ba nks to print their own paper money today privately issued electronic money is in circulation histori c forms of money such as gold as in the case of digital gold currency back some of these private currenci transactions in these currencies represent an annual turnover value in billions of us do llars e20 any material can back privately i ssued money the material used to back money changes with the timesand sometimes to avoid legal scrutiny this make s things such as energy transport capacity food honey illegal drugs and so on more useful for backing money it is impor tant for soldiers to understand that money is above all an agreem ent to use something as medium of exchange it is up to community or to the entity that holds the power within communitystate governme nt mnc nonstate actor to decide whether money should be backed by certain material or should be to tally virtual future of money e21 in recent years the european monetary union introduced the euro to many eu ropean nations now almost all use one currency the uk and sweden ar notable exceptions west africa is proposing the 2009 introduction of the eco new currency for 5 or 6 nations some speculate that north american currency such as the amero might come next some are proposing an asian currency unit as well in the middle east many nations use the dinar an islamic gold dinar is also propo sed in mexico there is movement to return to using silver as money one difficulty with currency bloc ks unifying paper currencies is that it may eliminate the ability to exchange trillions of do llars on currency markets if this kind of trading were to move into the gold and silver market s the prices for gold and silver could soar today people can trade gold and paper mone electronically via online systems practice and organizations of international finance e22 international finance is the branch of economics that studies the dynami cs of exchange rates and foreign investment as well as their affects on interna tional trade international financial organizations study and influence the effects of these phenomena exchange rates e23 the exchange rate also known as the foreign exchange rate betw een two currencies specifies how much one currency is worth in terms of the other for example an exchange rate of 120 japa nese yen jpy to the united states dollar usd means that 120 jpy is worth the same as 1 usd the foreign exchange market is one of the largest markets in the world experts estimate that approximately 2 trillion usd worth of currency changes hands on the market every day th spot exchange rate refers to the current exchange rate the forward exchange rate is an exchange rate that members of the financial arena quote and trade today for delivery and payment at specified later date e24 in the international arena currency exchange rates matter to states economy for inverse reasons relatively strong or appreciating currency provides the home country w ith more purchasing power abroad moreover foreigners will want to hold strong curren cies in their financial holdings us debt for example in this case such foreignheld debt can be used by the usg to finance major expenditures like the financial instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 e5 the wot or massive infrastructure projects however domestic goods for export will be more expensive for foreigners to purchase which reduces export sale s and affects the balance of international trade conversely relatively w eak or depreciating home currency reduces purchasing power abroad but increases the affordability to foreigners of domestic go ods for export thus increasing sales in addition depreciating currencies will become increasingly unattractive to foreign currency investors decreasing the amount of debt they are willing to hold in the case of the usg such foreign unwillingness to hold us debt constrains the ability to finance massive expenditures free or pegged e25 if currency is freefloating its exchange rate va ries against that of other currencies and market forces determine supply and demand exchange rates for such currencies are likely to change almost constantly as quoted on financial markets mainly banks around the world by contrast movable or adjustable peg system is system of artificially fixed exchange rates determined by one or more state governments for example between 1994 and 2005 the chinese yuan cny was pe gged to the usd at 82768 cny to 1 usd many countries have pegged their currencies to the usd at vari ous times as japan and western europe did from world war ii until the 19 70s fixed exchange rates can have benefits for both the us and foreign states for example exportdriven economies such s japan can benefit by stability and predictability resulting in cheap imports fo r the united states and increased export growth for japanese industry pegged exchange rates facilitated postwar reconstruc tion of us allies during the cold war and the united states and its allies therefore bene fited politically militarily and economically relative to the communist threat however artificial manipula tion of currency exchange represents an artificial manipulation of free trade which can threaten the survival of dome stic industry nominal and real exchange rates e26 international finance also distinguishes between nominal and real exchan ge rates the nominal exchange rate is the rate at which an organization can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another the real exchange rate is an economic theory that attempts to reflect th complexity of currencies and price levels real value in practical usage ther are many foreign currencies and price level values to take into consideration for example if the price of product increases 10 percent in the uk and the japanese currency simultaneously appr eciates 10 percent against the uk currency the price of the product remains constant for someone in japan the people in the uk howeve r would still have to deal with the 10 percent increase in domestic prices e27 governmentenacted tariffs or legal restrictions can affect the actual rate of exchange for protectionist economic or other political reasons for ex ample if the thai baht is more valuable than the bangladeshi rupiah but bangladesh makes direct tradin g in baht illegal the transaction costs of converting each currency into dollars or yen first make s the real exchange rate more costly e28 finally considerations of nominal and real curr ency values must accoun t for purchasing power parity if states currency is relatively weaker than an other states currency but the cost of living in the former state is also lower the nomin exchange rate does not necessarily reflect real value for example the cny may be weaker than the usd if used to buy rice in tokyo but ss yuan is needed to buy that same amount of rice within china fluctuations in exchange rates e29 marketbased exchange rate will change whenever the values f either of the two component currencies change currency will tend to become mo re valuable whenever demand for it is greater than the available supply it will become less valuable when ever demand is less than available supply this does not mean people longer want money it just means th ey prefer holding their w ealth in some other form possibly another currency increased demand for curre ncy is due to either an increased transaction demand for money or an increased speculative demand for money e30 the transaction demand for money is highly correla ted to the countrys level of business activity gdp and employment levels the greater the unemployment the less the public as whole will spend on goods and services central banks routinely adjust the available mone supply to accommodate changes in appendix e6 fm 305130 30 september 2008 the demand for money because of business transactions the speculative dema nd for money is much harder for central bank to accommodate but they tr to do this by adjusting interest rates e31 in choosing what type of asset to hold people are also concerned that the asset will retain its value in the future most people will not be interested in currency if they think it w ill devalue currency will tend to lose value relative to other currencies if the countrys level of infl ation is relatively higher if the countrys level of output is expected to decline or if country is troubled by political uncertainty for example when russian president putin dismissed his government on 24 febr uary 2004 the price of the ruble dropped foreign exchange markets e32 because the worlds main intern ational banks provide market aroundtheclock the foreign exchange markets are highly liquid the biggest foreign exchange trading center is london followed by new york and tokyo foreign investment e33 foreign direct investment fdi is longterm investment by foreign direct invest or in an enterprise residing in an economy not his own the fdi relationship consis ts of parent enterprise and foreign affiliate that together form tnc to qualif as an fdi the investment must afford the parent enterprise control over its foreign affiliate the fines control in this case as owning 10 percent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated firm or its eq uivalent for an unincorporated firm there are several recognized types of fdi z greenfield investments are direct investment in new facil ities or the expansion of existing facilities greenfield investments are the primary targ et of an hns promo tional efforts because they create new production capacity and jobs transfer technology and knowhow and lead to linkages to the global marketplace however greenfield investments often accomplish thi s by crowding out local indu stry mncs are able to produce goods more cheaply because of advanced technology and efficient processes in addition they compete for local resources labor intermediate goods and so on another downside of greenfiel d investments is that profits from production feed back into the mncs home economy instead of th local economy this is in contrast to local industries whose profits flow back into the dome stic economy to promote growth z mergers and acquisitions transfer existing assets from local firms to foreign firms these are the most common types of fdis crossborder mergers occur when the assets and peration of firms from different countries combine to establish new legal entity crossborder acquisitions occur when the control of assets and operations transf er from local to fore ign company with the local company becoming an affiliate of the foreign company e34 unlike greenfield investments acquisitions provide longterm benefits to the local economy in such deals the acquiring entity typically pays owners of the local firm in stock m eaning that the money from the sale never reaches the local economy ne vertheless mergers and acquisitions are significant form of fdi and until the late 1990s accounted for nearly 90 percent of t he fdi flow into the united states e35 fdi can be characterized by structure z horizontal fdi represents investments in the same industry abroad as firm operates in at home z vertical fdi takes two forms when an industry abroad provides inputs for firms domestic production process it is backward vertical fdi when an industry abroad sells the outputs of firms domestic productio n it is forward vertical fdi e36 the motives of the investing fi rm can also characterize fdi z resourceseeking investments attempt to acquire mo re efficient production factors than those in the firms home economy in some cases these resources may not exist in the home economy the financial instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 e7 for example cheap labor or scarce natural resources this typifies fdi into devel oping countries z marketseeking investments attempt to either penetrate new marke ts or maintain existing ones z efficiencyseeking investments attempt to exploit the bene fits of economies of scale and scope and also those of common ownership international financial organizations e37 the following paragraphs discuss various interna tional financial organizations these paragraphs will cover the world bank the international monetary fund the organiza tion for economic coordination and development the bank for international settlements and addition types of international banks and financial institutions world bank e38 the wb is group of five international organizations responsible for provid ing finance and advice to countries for the purposes of economic development and poverty elimination the bank came into formal existence in 1945 following international ratification of the bretton woods agreemen ts it approved its first loan on 9 may 1947 250 million to france for postwar reconstruction which in real terms is the largest loan ever issued by the bank its five agencies are the z international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd z international finance corporation ifc z international development association ida z multilateral investment guarantee agency miga z international centre for settlement of investment disputes e39 the wb focuses its activities in developing countries on fields such as human development for example education or health agri culture and rural development for exam ple irrigation or rural services environmental protection for example pollution reduction or establishing and forcing regulations infrastructure for example roads urban regeneration or electricity and governance for example anticorruption or legal institutions development e40 the ibrd and ida provide loans at preferential rates to member countr ies as well as grants to the poorest countries th granting agency often links loans or gran ts for specific projects to wider policy changes in the sector or the economy for example the entity grant ing the loan may link loan to improve coastal environmental management to the development of new env ironmental institutions at national and local levels and to the implementation of new regulations to limit p ollution the activities of the ifc and miga include investment in the private s ector and providing insurance respectively e41 the wb is an international organization owned by member governments the headqua rters of the wb is in washington dc although it makes profits th wb uses profits to support continued efforts in poverty reduction the wb technically is part of the system but its governance s tructure is different each institution in the wb group is owned by its memb er governments which subscribe to its basic share capital with votes proportional to shareholding member ship gives certain voting rights that are the same for all countries but there are also additional votes that depend on fina ncial contributions to the organization e42 as result developed countries primarily control the wb most of the wbs clie nts are developing countries some critics argue that different governance structure would ta ke greater account of developing countries needs as of 2006 the united states held 164 percent of total votes japan 79 percent germany 45 percent and the uk and france each held 43 percent as major decisions require an 85 percent super majority the united states can block any major changes international monetary fund e43 the imf is an international organization that oversees the global financial sys tem by observing exchange rates and balance of payments as well as offering financial and technical assistance when appendix e8 fm 305130 30 september 2008 requested the imfs headquarters is in washington dc however the im f describes itself as an organization of 185 countries working to foster global monetary cooperati on secure financial stability facilitate international trade promote high employment and sust ainable economic growth and reduce poverty e44 the primary mission of the imf is to provide financ ial assistance to countries that experience serious financial difficulties member states with balanceofpayment probl ems may request loans or organizational management of their national economies in retu rn the countries are usually required to launch certain reforms critics have often derisively dubbed the reforms as the washington consensus the imf generally requires these reforms because count ries with fixed exchange rate policies can engage in fiscal monetary and political practices that may l ead to the crisis for example states with severe budget deficits rampant inflation strict price controls or significantly ove rvalued or undervalued currencies run the risk of facing balanceofpayment crises in the future thus the imfs structural adjustment programs ostensibly attempt to ensure that the imf is actually helping to prevent financial crises rather than merely funding financial recklessness organization for economic cooperation and development e45 the oecd is an international organization of veloped countries that accept the principles of representative democracy and free market economy it originat ed in 1948 to help administer the marshall plan for the reconstruction of europe after wwii ter however the oecd extended its membership to noneuropean states e46 the oecd secretariat in paris provides setting for governments to compare policy experiences seek answers to common problems and identify good practice and coordinate do mestic and international policies it is forum where peer pressure can act as powerful incentive to improve policy and implement soft lawnonbinding instruments that can occasiona lly lead to binding treaties the secretariat collects data monitors trends and analyses and forecasts econom ic developments it also researches social changes or evolving patterns in trade environment agriculture technology taxation and other ar eas the oecd is also premium statistical agency because it publishes highly comp arable statistics on wide number of subjects e47 over the past decade the oecd has tackled range of economic social an d environmental issues while deepening its engagement with businesses trade unions and other repre sentatives of civil society activities have included negotiating taxation and transf er pricing coordinating international action on corruption and bribery and reporting on the effects of internet spam problems in developing countries twentyfour nonmembers currently participate as regular observers or full participants in oecd committees and the oecd conducts policy dialogues and capacity bui lding activities with nonmembers country programs regional approaches and global forums to share bes t policy practices bank for international settlements e48 the bis is an international organization of central banks that exists to foste r cooperation among central banks and other agencies in pursuit of monetary and financial stability it carries out its work through subcommittees the secretariats it hosts and through its annual general meeting of all members the bis also provides banking services but only to central banks or to ther international financial organizations the headquarters of the bis is in basel switzerland e49 as an organization of central banks the bis seek s to increase predictability and transparency in monetary policy among its 55 member central banks while monetary policy is determ ined by each sovereign state policy is subject to central and private banking scru tiny and potentially to speculation that affects foreign exchange rates and the fate of export economies failures to ke ep monetary policy in line with reality and to make timely monetary refo rmspreferably as simultaneous policy among all 55 member banks and the imfhave historically led to fi nancial losses in the billions of dollars as banks try to maintain policy using open market methods that have proven to be unrealistic e50 central banks do not unilaterally set exchange rates they set go als and intervene using their massive financial resources and regulatory powers to ach ieve monetary targets that they set one reason to coordinate policy closely at the bis and elsewhere is to ensure that this does not become too expensive and the financial instrument of national power 30 september 2008 fm 305130 e9 that opportunities for private arbitrage exploiting shifts in policy or difference in policy are rare and quickly removed the bis therefore has two specific goals to regulate capital adequacy and to make reserve requirements transparent additional bank and financial institution types e51 multilateral development bank mdb is an institution created by group of states that provides financing and professional advice for development mdbs have large membershi ps including both developed donor countries and developing borrower countries mdbs finance proj ects in the form of longterm loans at

developed donor nations the banks borrow from nd lend to its developing members examples include the caribbean development bank and the west frican development bank e53 there are also several

for police z operational police support services secure global police communications services f2 the ability of police to exchange crucial data quic kly and securely is cornerstone of effective international law enforcement this is why interpol developed the i247 global police communications system the system connects the interpol general secretariat in lyon france with the national central bureaus ncbs in member countries and regional offices creati ng global network for the exchange of police information and providing law enforcement authorit ies in member countries with instant access to the organizations databases and other services f3 member countries can also choose to grant consultative access to authorized law enforcement entities outside of ncbs such as border control units or customs officials interpol continues to develop new services and training programs to ensu re that users are able to make full use of the i247 system as of the end of 2006 183 countries and 25 additional sites including interpol subregional bureaus were connected for coun tries unable to connect because of technical or financial limitations sophisticated costefficient satellite system is in place to enable ll member countries to be active participants of the international law enforcement community operational data services and databases for police f4 to fight international crime po lice need access to information that can assist investigations or prevent crime interpol manages several databases accessible to the interpol bureaus in all member countries through its i247 communications system which contain criti cal information on criminals and criminality these include z mindfind z suspected terrorists z nominal data on criminals names photos z fingerprints z deoxyribonucleic acid

while these actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns or amphibious warfar their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature using the mobility of the usn to

sometimes known as state militias which are sponso red by individual state governments and serve as an auxiliary to the arng except in mes of extreme national emergency such as mainland invasion of the united states state militias operate in dependently of the usa these militias are seen as state government agencies rather than component of the military g75 although the presentday usa exists as an all volunteer force augmented by usar and arng forces measures exist for emergency expansion in the event of catastrophic occurrence such as largescale attack against the united states or the

not mean the profession of historythe study f the pastso much as the concept of worldview history is related and is per ceived as narrative story it is this narrative that allows for the widest range of interpretation from many perspectives historia ns as scholars strive to achieve an objective view of cause andeffect in the past based on conclusive or reasonable evidence by academic criteria nonhistorians interp ret their individual and cultural hist ory by their own criteria that is the historical narrative by which each individual interprets the world as matter of perception individual perceptions are matter of subjective individual and cu ltural interpretation they are not necessarily valid nevertheless such interpretations remain powerful h2 it is beyond the scope of this manual to judge the relative merits f objective and subjective truth it is pertinent however to identify the many ways in which peopl perceive individuals organized in various groups and how they prescribe to given set of beliefs over time fam iliarization with how such historical and cultural issues are fined analyzed and disputed provides useful insights into the context within which the informational instrument of power is effective and the manner in which forces conduct uw as primer for considering many of the facets of the human terrain this appendix will survey the concepts of culture society civilization state na tion race ethnic group tribe clan band tradition mythology folklore and religion the importance of these concepts will vary by uwoa and specific target audience which warrants further study of how each of these applies t various situations culture h3 anthropologists use the term culture to refer to the universal human ca pacity to symbolically classify codify and communicate thei r experiences as scientific concept it refers to patterns of huma n activity and the symbolic structures that give such ac tivity significance in the most general sense the term culture denotes the whole product of an individual group or society i t includes technology art science and the moral systems and characteristic behaviors and habits of the population unde r examination individuals dispute the idea of culture which reflects different theoretical base s for understanding or criteria for evaluating human activity h4 some classify culture as the way of life for an entire so ciety as such it includes codes of manners dress language religion rituals norms of behavior such as law and mora lity and systems of belief edward burnett taylor writing from the perspective of social anthropology in the uk in 1871 described culture in the following way culture or civilization taken i n its wide ethnographic sense is that complex whole which includes knowledge belief art morals law custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as member of society in 2002 th united nations educational scientific and cultural organization described culture as follows culture should be regarde d as the set of distinctive spiritual material intellectual and emotional features of society or social group and that it encompasses in addition to art and literature lifestyles ways of liv ing together value systems traditions and beliefs key components of culture h5 common way of understanding culture is that it c onsists of four elements that are passed on from generation to generation the four elements are z values values include ideas about what is important in life they guide the rest of the culture z norms norms are expectations of how people will behave in various situat ions appendix h h2 fm 305130 30 september 2008 z institutions institutions are the structures of so ciety that transmit values and norms z artifacts artifacts are things or aspect s of material culture that derive from cultures values and norms culture as civilization h6 the culture that developed in europe during the 18th and early 19th cen turies reflected inequalities within european societies and between european powers and their colonies according to this perspective people can classify some countries as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others h7 from the 19th century onward marxists and other social critics have recognized this contrast between high and low culture but claimed that the refinement and sophi stication of high culture were corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort peoples essential nature for example in this view folk music as produced by workingclass people honestly express natural way of life and classical music seems superficial and decadent represen tation of particular social class this view often romanticizes indigenous peoples as noble savages living authentic blemished lives uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified capitalist syst ems of the west this view rejects the opposition of culture to nature those that subscribe to this view assert that nonelites are as cultured as elites and nonwesterners just as civilized as western ers simply regarding them as just culturedor civilizedin different way this pe rspective underlies an egalitarian multicultural worldview in reaction to more ethnocentric and nationalistic worldvie ws emphasized in the 19th and 20th centuries culture as shared symbols h8 culture holds symbols to be both the practices of social actors and the context tha t gives such practices meaning symbols provide the limits of cultured thought culture as stabilizing mechanism for survival h9 the view of culture as stabilizing mechanism considers the pos sibility that culture itself is product of stabilization tendencies for example indivi duals identify with those cu ltural artifacts symbols and practices that foster feelings of survival secur ity and eventually selfactualization allegiance to culture for these reasons nds to perpetuate it culture as unbounded activity h10 some scholars particularly sociologists and marxists focus on the study of arti facts to understand culture the patterns involving value and transfer of consumption goods suc h as fashion art and literature have been common means of analyzing cultural patterns with modern reactions to the 18th and 19thcentury distinction between high and low culture such scholars tend to emphasize massproduced and massmarketed consumption goods of popular culture h11 however other contemporary scholars particularly anthropologists reject the i dentification of culture with consumption goods and deemphasize the defining role of any artifacts this view rejects the notion of culture as bounded by set class of defini ng attributes such scholars consequently reject the notion of mainstream culture or subculture altogeth er instead they see culture as complex web of shifting patterns at any given time that link people in different locales in to social formations of different scales according to this view any group can construct its own cultural i dentity cultural change h12 each culture however defined is predisposed to either embrace or resist change based on its particular cultural traits two kinds of influence cause ch ange or resistance to it forces at work within or the role of history and culture 30 september 2008 fm 305130 h3 between cultures and changes in the natural environment some of the t erms associated with cultural change include the following z diffusion the form of something moves directly from one culture to another for example culture adopts fashion or music styles unchanged from another culture z stimulus diffusion exposure of one culture to another that leads to new and different activity or products for example exposure to american blues music in the early 20th c entury led to newly developed styles of rock and roll in mid20thcentury britain z acculturation in this context it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another for example certain indigenous peoples across the globe ado pted the culture of the entering power during the process of colonization z assimilation this term reflects more complete leve l of acculturation wherein those assimilated effectively become part of the mainstream culture for example the descendents of 19thcentury european immigrants to america have largely assimilated into american culture h13 cultural change or resistance to change can be difficult to measureesp ecially the diffusion acceptance and rejection of ideas in the context of 21st century globalization and with view of culture as unbounded culture can be complex and subjective matter of definiti on interpretation and selfidentification cultures within society h14 the idea of culture is inexact large societies often have subcultu res or groups of people with distinct sets of behavior and beliefs subculture may be distinctive because of many factors age race ethnicity class gender behavior patterns and so on cultures by region h15 in practical terms world region can identify current broad cultural influences through out history contact with others through conquest colonization trade migrati on mass media and religion has influenced all predominant regional cultures examples of this influence foll ow z africa european colonialism and arabic and islamic culture z america colonialism immigration and christianity z asia chinese language and culture buddhism taoism hinduism and islam z oceania aboriginal culture the indigenous maori people and christianity z europe ancient greece and rome christianity eu ropean culture and languages such as english spanish and french z middle east and north africa persian culture and arabic language society h16 closely related to the term culture is the notion of society society is grouping of individuals characterized by common interest and sometimes distinctive culture and institutions in society members can be from different ethn ic group society may refer to pa rticular people such as the nuer to nationstate such as switzer land or to broader cultural group such as western society characteristics of society h17 the three components common to all definitions of society are z social networks z criteria for membership z characteristic patterns of organization appendix h h4 fm 305130 30 september 2008 social networks h18 social networks are relationships between people ex amples of social networks are relatives friends and colleagues criteria for membership h19 the most common entrance to membership of any gi ven society is to be born into it where the individual generally accepts and reflects its norms in this sense society and culture are sometimes indistinguishable continued selfidentification with and support of t he original society is the most common method of sustaining membership h20 society is not necessarily synonymous with state or nation sometimes peoples of many nations united by common political and cultural traditions shar ed beliefs or values or common goals form society such as judeochristian eastern and western when used in this context the term is means of contrasting two or more large societies whose mbers represent alternativ conflicting and competing worldviews other examples include some small academic learned and scholarly associations that describe themselves as societies or as used in some countries to denote partnership between commercial investors characteristic patterns of organization h21 experts classify societies in various ways for example z hunters and gatherers z simple agricultural z advanced agricultural z industrial h22 societies may also organize according to their politi cal structure or by the st atus of individuals complexity and the role of the state z huntergatherer bands z tribal societies z kingdoms and early modern european nationstates z civilizations with complex social hierarchies concept of society h23 some societies disappear while others have progressed toward ever more co mplex forms some dispute the concept of society some sociologists and anthropologist s question whether society as an entity exists some marxist theorists argue that society is nothing m ore than an effect of the ruling ideology of certain class system they contend th at people should not use society as sociological notion marx held that society was merely the sum total of social relations among members of community many muslims identify more readily with islamic society than they do with any particular state or nation regardless of ideology the way people define so ciety explains much about them civilization h24 the term civilization has variety of meanings related to human so ciety most often civilization refers to complex societiesthose that have an intensive practice of agri culture have significant division of labor and have population densities sufficient to form cities people ma use civilization more broadly to refer to the sum or current ex tent of human accomplishment and diff usion human civilization or global civilization h25 the term civilization in common speech has both normative and des criptive dimension in the past to be civilized was linked to the act of being civila term for politeness and propriety to be uncivilized in this usage means to be rude barbaric or savage in this sense civilization implies sophistication and refinement the problem with this concept i s that some people who lived outside of the role of history and culture 30 september 2008 fm 305130 h5 given recognized civilization could nonetheless be quite civilized in their beha vior many world cultures throughout history have used the normative definition of civiliza tion to justify imperialism h26 in reaction to this disparaging meaning of civilization academia has broadened the term so that civilization can often refer to any di stinct society whether complex and city dwelling or simple and tri bal for example australian aboriginal civilization people often perceive this sense of the term as less exclusionary and ethnocentric because it does not make distinctions between civi lized or barbaric however this lessethnocentric approach to the term weakens its descriptive powe r such usage is both less useful and meaningful than the first in this sense civilization becomes nearly synonymous with culture h27 in contrast civilization can also legitimately describe the cult ure of complex society not just simple societies or society itself every society has specific set of ideas customs items and arts that make it unique however civilizations have even more intricate cultures including literature professional art architecture organized religion and complex customs it is matte r of degree the description of culture as civilization therefore is another contentious and vagu ely defined concept characteristics of civilization h28 civilizations are complex systems or networks of cities that emerge from preurban cultures and are defined by the economic political military diplomatic and cultura l interactions between them therefore as descriptive and literal term civilization is complex soc iety as distinguished from simpler society historically civilizations have shared some or all of the foll owing traits z agricultural techniques z division of labor z permanent settlements z social organization z institutional food control z complex social institutions z complex economic exchange z material possessions z advanced technology z advanced arts z long existence h29 by these characteristics some so cieties like greece are clearly ci vilizations whereas others like the bushmen or the early nomadic native americans clearly are not howeve r the distinction is not always clear and is often in dispute civilization as human society asawhole h30 some argue that the entire world is already integrated into single world system by process known as globalization different civilizations and societies all ov er the globe are economically politically and even culturally interdependent in many ways there is debate over when this integration began and what sort of integrationcultural technological economic politica l or militarydiplomaticis the key indicator in determining the extent of civilization h31 in this broader sense civilization can refer to human society as wholethe global civilization what globalization means and how to characterize are also in dispute critics of globalization reject such coupling of the terms saying that what is called globalization is in fact form of global corporatization and that other forms of globalization are possible such as communist world government or worldwide islamic caliphate others argue that globalization and ongoin g future integration inherently erode the distinct sovereignty of states still others believe that states will continue to be politically meaningful despite the technological and economi c integration of continued globalization despite ideology people widely accept that the world ci vilization is increas ingly integrating appendix h h6 fm 305130 30 september 2008 state h32 as noted above state is set of institutions that possess the uthority to make the rules that govern the people in one or more societies with internal sovereignty over definite territory it is casually and most commonly confused with country which refers to geographic area and nation wh ich designates people nation h33 nation is group of humans that people assume share common identity and common language religion ideology culture or history people often assume that individual s in groups have common origin in the sense of ancest ry parentage or descent h34 the national identity refers both to the distinguishin g features of the group and to the individuals sense of belonging to it people use very wide range of criteria with very different applications to determine national identity small differences in pronunciation m ay be enough to categorize someone as member of another nation however two people may be separated by differe nce in personalities belief systems geographical locations time and even spoken language yet regard themselves and others may regard them as well as members of the same nation members of nation are considered to share certain traits values and norms of behavior certain duties toward other m embers and certain responsibilities for the actions of the members of the same nation h35 nations extend across generations and include the dead as full members more vaguely people include future generations as members people frame past events in t his context for example referring to our soldiers in conflicts that took place hundreds of years ago h36 people often use the term nation as synonym for ethnic group however though ethnicity is now one of the most important aspects of cultural or social identity for th members of most nations people with the same ethnic origin may live in different na tionstates and people may treat them as members of separate nations for that reason people often disput national identity down to the level of the individual h37 almost all nations are associated with specifi c territory the national homeland some live in historical communities outside of their original national ho meland state that explicitly identifies as the homeland of particular nation is nationstate and most modern states fall into this category although there may be violent disputes about their legitimacy when nations dispute t erritory the nations may base their claims on which nation lived there first esp ecially in areas of european colonial settlement 15001950 the term first nations is used by some groups that share an ab original culture and seek official recognition or autonomy ambiguity in usage h38 in the strict sense terms such as nation ethn and people for example the danish people name group of human beings the concepts of nation and nationality h ave much in common with ethnic group and ethnicity but have more political connotation since th ey imply the possibility of nationstate country names geographical territory whereas st ate expresses legitimi zed administrative and decisionmaking institution confusingly some use the terms natio nal and international as technical terms applying to states international law for instan ce applies to relations between states and occasionally between states on the one side and individuals or legal persons on the othe r likewise the represents states while nations are not admitted to the body unl ess respective nationstate exists which can become member h39 usage also varies from country to country for example the uk is an internationall recognized sovereign state which is also country whose inhabitants have britis h nationality it is however traditionally divided into four home nationsengland scotland wales and ireland three of these are not sovereign states ireland however is now divided into the sovereign r epublic of ireland and northern ireland which remains part of the uk h40 usage of the term nation not only is ambiguous but also is the subject of political disputes which may be extremely violent when the term nation has any implications of claims to independence from an the role of history and culture 30 september 2008 fm 305130 h7 existing state its use is controversial finally the term nation is widely used by extension or metaphor to describe any group promoting some common interest or common identity s uch as red sox nation rhythm nation or religious nation nationalism h41 in europe especially since the late 18th century the idea of nation as sumed fundamental political significance with the rise of the ideology and philosophy of national ism nationalists saw nation not simply as descriptive term for group of people bu t as an entity entitled to sovereignty if necessary by the absorption or destruction of nonnational states h42 there is consensus among the theorists of nationalism on whether nations were s ignificant political factor before that time some historians see england and portugal as early examples of nationstates with developed sense of national id entity others see the nationstate as 19th century creation either as the result of the political campaigns of nationa lists or as topdown and indoctrinated creation by preexisting states some marxists and world civilizati onoriented theorists are hostile to the idea of centuriesold nations that nationalists claimed to represent rguing that nations are often imagined communities constructed through variety of techniques using state power the generally accepted but eroding idea that populations divide europe into nations has existed since at least the 19th century h43 in the course of the 20th century partly through decolonization world of nati onstates came into existence at least nominally that does not mean that there is any agreement on the number of nations on whether they correspond with natio nstate or on whether any partic ular existing state is necessarily legitimate very few nationstates territory and borders are 100 percen t undisputed political actors make claims on behalf of stateless nations such as the kurds assyrians palestin ians or roma people gypsies secessionist movements may oppose the very existence of the nati onstate as in belgium some nationalist movements request greater autonomy within the framework of the broader sta for example the basque in spain quebecois in canada or native americans in the western h emisphere claimed national territory may be partitioned or divided as in the republic of ireland and nort hern ireland there are also examples of national identity without corresponding state or cl aim to state although it is common to attribute political and territorial aspirations to nation itself political movements speaking on behalf of that nation make these aspirations h44 people sometimes use the term statenation for nations in which th common identity derives from shared citizenship of stat this term implies that the state formed first followed by sense of na tional identity or that it developed in tandem examples of statenations are italy and france however both countries also have strong ethnic and cultural identity if the people defined the nation only by citizenship then the people would acce pt naturalized citizens as equal memb ers of the nation and that is not always the case citizenship may itself be conditional on citizen ship test which usually includes language and cultural knowledge tests defining nation h45 nations are defined by limited number of character istics that apply to both the individual members and the nation the first requirement for the definition is that the characteristics should be shareda group of people with nothing in common cannot be nation because they are shared the nationa l population also has some degree of uniformity and homogeneity finally at least some of the chara cteristics must be exclusiveto distinguish the nation from neighboring nations all of the charac teristics can be disputed and opposition to seces sionist nationalism often includes the nial that separate nation exists common descent h46 almost all nationalist movements make some claim to shared origins and descent and it is component of the national identity in most nations th fact that members of the nation share ancestry unites them and sets them apart from other nations that do not share that ancestry the question is descent appendix h h8 fm 305130 30 september 2008 from whom often the answer is simply from previous generations of the same nation more specifically z the nation may be defined as the descendants of the past inhabitants of th national homeland z the nation may be defined as the descendants of past speakers of the nationa l language or past groups that shared the national culture h47 usually people assume these factors coincide icel and provides an example people assume the welldefined icelandic nation consists of the descendants of the isla nd of iceland in for example 1850 those people also spoke the icelandic language they were known as icel anders at that time they had recognized culture of their own ho wever the present population of iceland cannot coincide exactly with their descendants that would mean that icelander since 1850 ever had children by nonicelander most european nations experienced border changes and migration over the last few centuries and members intermarried with other national groups statistically their current national population cannot coincide exactly with the descendants of the nation in 1850 or 1500 even if it w as then known by the same name the shared ancestry is more of national myth than genetic realit ybut still sufficient for national identity common language h48 people often view shared language as defining feature of nation in some cases the language is exclusive to the nation this language may be central to the nat ional identity the basque language is unique language isolate and prominent in the selfdefinition of the basque pe ople and in basque nationalism although not all basques speak it in other cases other nations also speak the national language shared among the nation but not exclusive to the nation som peoples such as the swiss identify themselves as multilingual conversely papua new guinea prom otes papuan national identity despite having around 800 distinct languages people do not define any nation solely by languagethat would effectively create an open membersh ip for anyone who learned the language common culture h49 people define most nations partly by shared culture unlike langu age national culture is usually unique to the nation although it may include many elements shared with other nations in addition people assume that previous generations shared the national culture and that they shar cultural heritage from these generations as if it were an inheritance as with the common ancestry th is identification of past culture with present culture may be largely symbolic the archaeological site of stonehenge is owned and managed by english heritage although english people or state existed when it was constructed 4000 to 5000 years ago other nations have similarly appr opriated ancient archaeological sites literature art and even entire civilizations as national heritage common religion h50 people sometimes use religion to define nation although some nat ionalist movements deemphasize it as divisive factor again it is the sh aring of the religion that makes it national it may not be exclusive several nations define themselves partly as cathol ic although the religion itself is universalist irish nationalism traditionally sees ca tholicism as an irish national characteristic in opposition to the largely protestant british colonial power although the iris h republic usually recognizes the protestant minority in ireland as irish some religions are largely speci fic to one ethnic group notably judaism nevertheless the zionist movement generally avoided religious finition of the jewish people preferring an ethnic and cultural definition since judaism is re ligion people can become jew by religious conversion which in turn can facilitate their obtaining israeli citizenship jews in israel who convert to other religions do not lose israeli citizenship although th eir national identity might then be questioned by others the role of history and culture 30 september 2008 fm 305130 h9 voluntary definitions h51 some ideas of nation emphasize not shared charact eristics but rather on the shared choice for membership in practice this always applies to group of people who are so nation by other definitions the most famous voluntarist definition is that of ernest renan in lecture i n 1882 he rhetorically asked what is nation and answered that it is daily plebiscite re nan meant that the members of the nation by their daily participation in the life of the nation show their consent t its existence and to their own continued membership renan saw the nation as group having done great thin gs together and wishing to do more stalin s definition h52 many definitions of nation combine several of these factors one influent ial example of these combined definitions is that of joseph stalin given in 1913 nation is historically constituted stable community of people formed on the basis of common language territory economic life and psychological makeup manifested in common culture race h53 the term race serves to distinguis h between populations or groups of people based on different sets of characteristics that can be determined either through scientific co nventions or more commonly through social conventions visual traits are the most widely used human racial categories especially skin co lor facial features and hair texture genes and selfi dentification conceptions of race and specific racial groupings vary by culture and over time they are often controversial fo r scientific reasons and because of their impact on social identity and identity politics many conte mporary biological and social scientists regard the concept of race primarily as social cons truct while some maintain it has genetic basis ethnic group h54 an ethnic group or ethnicity is population of humans whose members identify with each other usually on presumed common genealogy or ancestry recognition by others as separate ethnic group and specific name for the group also contribute to defining it certain common cultural behavioral linguistic and ritualistic or religious traits also usually unite ethnic groups in this sense an ethnic group is also cultural community h55 because of closely related definitions an ethnic gr oup can overlap or even coincide with nation especially when terms of common origin primarily define national id entity members of nations also identify with each other they often presume common ancestry in addition othe rs recognize them as distinct group with specific name nations also have common id entity always cultural usually linguistic and sometimes religious an ethnic group that is also nation can be t he named head of nationstate however ethnic groups as such are not state and possess territorial sovereignty members of an ethnic group generally claim strong cultural continuity over tim h56 while ethnicity and race are related concepts the conc ept of ethnicity is rooted in the idea of social groups and is marked especially by shared nationality tribal affiliat ion genealogy religious faith language or cultural and traditional origins whereas r ace is traditionally rooted in the idea of biological classification tribe h57 tribe viewed historically or developmentally consists of s ocial group existing before the development of or outside of states although some modern theorists hold that contemporary tribes can only be understood in terms of their relationship to states people often use the term loosely to refer to any nonwestern or indigenous society many anthropologists use the term to re fer to societies organized largely based on kinship especially descent groups in the common modern derstanding the word tribe is social division within traditional society consisti ng of group of interlinked families or communities sharing common culture and dialect in the contempor ary western mind the modern tribe is typically appendix h h10 fm 305130 30 september 2008 associated with seat of traditional authority tribal l eader with whom the representatives of external for example state or occupying powers interact h58 considerable debate takes place over how best to ch aracterize tribes some of this debate stems from perceived differences between prestate tribes and contemporary tribes some of this debate reflects controversy over cultural evolution and colonialism in the popular imagin ation tribes reflect way of life that predates and is more natural than that in modern states tribes also grant primary social ties contain clear boundaries demonstrate uniform culture manife st narrow outlook and establish stability thus many believed that tribes organize links between families including clans and lineages and provide them with social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some w ay more limited than that of an ethnic group or of nation h59 anthropological and ethnohistorical research challenges all of these n otions in his 1972 study the notion of the tribe morton fried provided numerous examples of tribes in which members spoke different languages and practiced different rituals or shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes similarly he provided examples of tribes in whic h people followed different political leaders or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes he concluded that generally f luid boundaries and dissimilarity characterized tribes in general he determined that tribes have open outlooks and are dynamic clan h60 clan is group of people united by kinship and descent which is defined by perceived scent from common ancestor even if actual lineage patte rns are unknown clan memb ers nonetheless recognize founding member or original ancestor as kinshipbased bonds can be merely sym bolical some clans share stipulated common ancestor which is symbol of the clans unity sometimes this ancestor is not human generally kinship differs from biological relation as it also involve s adoption marriage and fictional genealogical ties clans can be most easily scribed as subgroups of tribes and usually constitute groups of 7000 to 10000 people h61 some clans are patrilineal meaning its members are related through t he male line others are matrilineal its members are related through the female lin still other clans are bilateral consisting of all the descendants of the original ancestor through bo th the male and female lines whether clan is patrilineal matrilineal or bilateral depends on the kinship rul and norms of their society h62 in different cultures and situations clan may mean the same thing as other ki nbased groups such as tribes and bands often the distinguishing factor is th at clan is smaller part of larger society such as tribe chiefdom or state examples include iris h scottish chinese and japanese clans which exist as kin groups within their respective nations however tribes and bands can also be components of larger societies arab tribes are small gr oups within arab society and ojibwa bands are smaller parts of the ojibwa tribe h63 apart from these different traditions of kinship further confusion arises from com mon use of the term in postsoviet countries for example it is quite common for the term to refer to informal networks within the economic and political sphere this usage re flects the assumption that their members act toward each other in particularly close and mutually supportive way approximating the solidarity among kinsmen h64 people sometimes better refer to cl ans as house or line in some cases house or line consists of collection of families bearing the same coat of arms as opposed to ac tually claiming common descent most clans are exogamous meaning that its members cannot m arry one another some clans have an official leader such as chie ftain matriarch or patriarch bands h65 band society is the simplest form of human society band generally consists of small kin group larger than an extended family or clan bands ve very informal leadership there are written laws in bands in addition the coercion normally present in more complex so cieties does not exist in bands younger members of the band look to older members for guidance and advice band members usually transmit customs orally formal social institutions ar few or nonexistent generally family tradition the role of history and culture 30 september 2008 fm 305130 h11 individual experience or shamanic counsel is the basis of the bands relig ion all known band societies hunt and gather to obtain their food h66 fried defined bands as small mobile and fluid social formations with wea k leadership that do not generate surpluses pay taxes and support standi ng army bands are distinguished from tribes in that tribes are generally larger and consist of many families social roles exist in tribes such as chief or elders tribes are also more permanent than bands band can cease to exist if only small group walks out many tribes are in fact subdivided into bands in th united states some tribes are made up of official bands that live in specific locations with the spread of the modern nationstate to all corners of the globe there are very few true band societies left some historic examples include th inuit of northern north america the shoshone of the great basin the bushmen of southern africa an d some groups of indigenous australians tradition h67 tradition is story or custom that person memorizes and passes down f rom generation to generation traditions are usually thought of as z meme which is unit of cultural information passed down orally z set of customs or practices z broad religious movement made up of religious denominations or church bodi that have common history customs cultu re and body of teachings h68 on more basic theoretical level traditions are info rmation brought into the present from the past in particular societal context this is even more fu ndamental than particular acts or practices even if repeated over long sequence of time for such acts or practices once performed disappear unless they are transformed into some manner of communicable information h69 although people usually presume that traditions are ancient unalterable and deeply important this is not necessarily true people or groups sometimes deliberately invent some t raditions for one reason or another often to highlight or enhance the importance of certain institution people also change traditions to suit the needs of the day and the changes quickly become accepted as part of the ancient tradition some examples include the invention of tradition in afric and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces requiring legitimacy the colonial power would sometimes invent tradition that they could use to legitimize their own position for example force ght recognize certain succession to chiefdom by colonial power as traditional to favor their favorite candidate for the job often the force based these inventions on some form of tradition however these were grossly exaggerated di storted or biased toward particular interpretation mythology h70 mythology is narrative oral tradition or popular belief or assu mption based on the heroes of culture mythology sometimes involves supernatural events or characters to explain the nature of the universe and humanity the term myth is often used interchangeably with gend or allegory characteristics h71 myths are narratives about divine or heroic beings arranged in coherent syste m myths often explain the universal and local beginnings natural pheno mena inexplicable cultural conventions or rituals and anything else for which simple explanation exists h72 individual myths may be classified in various categories z ritual myths z origin myths z creation myths z cult myths z prestige myths z eschatological myths appendix h h12 fm 305130 30 september 2008 z social myths z trickster myths formation of myths h73 myths authorize the cultural institutions of trib city or nation by connecting them with universal truths all cultures have developed their own myths consisting of nar ratives of their history their religions and their heroes folklore h74 folklore is the body of expressive culture including tales music dance legends oral history proverbs jokes popular beliefs customs and material culture common to particular po pulation comprising the traditions of that cu lture the definition most widely accep ted by current scholars of the field is artistic communication in small groups the rm and the associated field of study now includes nonverbal art forms an d customary practices h75 contemporary narratives common in the western world include the urban gend there are many forms of folklore that are so common however that mo st people do not realize th ey are folklore such as riddles childrens rhymes ghost stories rumors gossip ethnic stere otypes holiday custom and lifecycle rituals religion h76 religion is set of beliefs and practices held by community that involves dherence to codified beliefs and rituals and the study of ancestral or cultural traditions and my thology as well as personal faith and mystic experience h77 the encyclopedia of religion describes religion in the following way in summary it may be said that almost every known cu lture involves the religious in the sense of depth dimension i n cultural experiences at all levelsa push whether illdefined or conscious t oward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life w hen more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in culture this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form religion is the organization of life arou nd the depth dimensions of experiencevaried in form completeness and clarity iaw the vironing culture religion as social construction h78 those who assert that religionhowever definedis an overall positive are as numerous as the number of religious adherents inherently each individuals religious adherence tangles with the ways he identifies with all of the other characteristics of huma n organization therefore most individuals religious adherence interweaves with tradition and ideas of cultu re society mythology and so on conversely all philosophies and orthodoxiesincluding religious philo sophies and orthodoxieshave their disputants in the 21st century western world most marxists and some scientists are the most strident critics of religion religions as progressively true h79 within these models religions reflect an essential truth that is revealed as society develops models that view religion as progressively true include the following z the bahai model of prophetic revelation this model holds that god has sent series of prophets to earth each brining t eachings appropriate for his cultu re and context but originating from the same god and therefore teaching the same essential message while religious truth is seen as being relative because of its varied cultural and developm ental expression this model accepts that the underlying essential truth being ex pressed is absolutely tr ue if incompletely and progressively presented z the study of history model this model holds that prophets are given to extraordinary spiritual insight during periods of social decay and act as surveyors of th course of secular civilization the role of history and culture 30 september 2008 fm 305130 h13 who report breaks in the road and breakdowns in the traffic and plot ne w spiritual course that will avoid those pitfalls z the great awakening model this model states that religion proceeds along hegelian dialectic of thesis antithesis synthesis in cycles of appr oximately 80 years as result of the interaction between four archetypal generations by which old religious beliefs the thesis face new challenges for which they are unprepared the antithesis and adapt to create new and more sophisticated beliefs the synthesis religions as absolutely true h80 some models see religion as absolutely and unchangi ngly true models that view particular religion as absolutely true include the jewish christian and islamic models exclusiv ist models hold that one particular set of religious doctrines is the one true re ligion and all others are false to the extent that they conflict with the true one in this model all other religio ns are seen as either distor tions of the original truth or original fabrications resulting from either ignorance or imagination or more vious influence such as false prophets religious belief h81 religious belief usually relates to the existence nature and worshi p of deity or deities and divine involvement in the universe and human life it may also relate to val ues and practices transmitted by spiritual leader religious beliefs are found in vi rtually every society throughout human history all religions generally seek to provide answers to metaphysical and cosmolo gical questions about the nature of being of the universe humanity and the divine h82 many early scientists held strong religious beliefs and many theories exist as to why religions sometimes seem to conflict with scientific knowledge in the case of christianity relevant factor may be that it was among christians that science in the modern sense was developed u nlike other religious groups as early as the 17th century the christian churches had to deal d irectly with this new way to investigate nature and seek truth the practice of literally int erpreting the bible partially explains the perceived conflict between science and christianity th is way to read the sacred texts became especially prevalent after the rise of the protestant reform ation with its emphasis on the bible as the only authoritative source concerning ultimate reality in st this view is often shunned by both religious leaders who prefer metaphorical interpretation and many scienti sts who regard it as an impossibility the proper relationship of religion to science remains an unsettled matt er of widely varied opinion h83 some christians disagree with scientists on astronomy the theory of evolut ion and the nature of creation and origin of life others find contradic tion in metaphorical interpretation of their faith with scientific inquiry islam sees ll endeavor as gods will so scie ntific endeavor is theoretically unobjectionable however particular muslim observa nce and tolerance for scientific consensus varies widely in muslim societies ranging from theocratic iran through democ ratic malaysia to muslim minorities in the united states other faiths such as bahaism and hinduism maintain there is disharmony between true science and true religion because they are aspects of the same truth this page intentionally left blank 30 september 2008 fm 305130 i1 appendix i historical survey of unconventional

success it sta nds as premier example of what military planners today call operational preparation of the environment the philippine resis tance movement made up of number of groups spread throughout the archipelago but most numerous on the main island of luzon collected and transmitted intelligence on adversary or der of battle conducted hitandrun raids against japanese forces and provided facto government services in number of villages the resistance movement benefited from environmental factors that contributed to the overall success of the campaign these factors included the size of the archipelago almost 115000 square meters spread out over 7100 islands and the imposing jungle and mountain terrain on the largest islands both fa ctors as well as the requirement to maintain lines of communications an d supply between garrisons severely stretched the occupying japanese forces although the japanese in itially offered positive or neutral incentives not to resist such as amnesty to

conducted during the korean war the evidence seems contradictory lthough partisan forces contributed to allied interdiction efforts in the operational rear areas of north korea the movement nevertheless failed to achieve more widespread strategic success most if not all of the preconditions for uw success existed on the korean peninsula but number of factors inhibited the success of partisa n forces first the responsibility for partisan oper ations shifted between different command instruments none of which had developed comprehensive plan or phasing for uw in the theater seco nd the command used partisan forces primarily for seaborne raids not unlike british commando raids in wwiinot for organization of an indigenous organization the purpose of these raids wa s to interdict main supply routes inflict casualties and boost the morale of anticommunist instrume nts in north korea the command applied little effort to establishing sanctuaries and base areas on the peninsula itself or cultivating the population to support an insurgency from 19 52 onward the north koreans placed greater emphasis on rear area counterpartisan operations that limited the mobility and ccess of partisan forces to the north korean population finally and most significantly u s advisors to partisan forces neither spoke korean nor understood the culture this lack of preparation seriously influ

afghan gr oups maintained training bases and safe areas within pakistan although financial support was important to sustaining the muj ahideen one of the key turning points in the war occurred when the united states and the british introduced sh oulderfired surfacetoair missiles such as stinger and blowpipe into the conflict the mujahideen we re effective at ambushing the largely roadbound motorized and mech anized soviet forces soviet airpower especi ally in the form of helicopter transports and gunships inflicted serious losses on mujahidee n forces the introduction of manportable surfacetoair missiles severely constr ained the soviet use of their airpower continued historical survey of unconventional warfare 30 september 2008 fm 305130 i3 numbers of casualties on the ground as well as mounting domestic opposition to th war convinced soviet leaders to withdraw from afghanistan the united st ates was able to achieve its goals by waging uw through thirdparty actors without directly confronting the soviet union united states unconve ntional warfare in afghanistan 20012002 i7 experience in afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 demonstrates that waging uw need not be prolonged costly undertakings waging uw can quickly and effi ciently achieve policy goals if the conditions for success are right in this specific case standing indigenous force was ready in existence the forces of the northern alliance although somewhat demoralized from previous l osses were armed and many were combat veterans including some who had fought against the soviets the intro duction of american military and paramilitary advisors and resources wa s critical in defeating and scattering taliban and alqaeda forces in less than four months conventional force options would have take n too long to implement and according to at least one accou nt cia director george tenet suggested more unconventional uses of force including uw supported by army and air force so assets usa sf teams conducted two primary missions in the subsequent uw campaign the fi rst was political in nature and involved close liaison with northern alliance factio n commanders to prevent jealousy and rivalries from adversely affecting the campaign key to the success of the sf ams was their cultural sensitivity and willingness to engage the afghan and uzbek leaders on their terms creating considerable trust between us and northern alliance forces the second mission was military in nat ure and involved combat advice and leadership c2 and precise fires against taliban strong points and key force concentrations the flexibility and adaptability of joint so teams connect ed to aweinspiring leve ls of firepower greatly boosted northern alliance confidence and in one particular case led to the first horsemounted cha rge against armored forces in over sixty years alt hough the character of the campaign changed from overthrowing the taliban regime to stabilizing the country and chasing the taliban and alqaeda remnants the success of the us uw campaign is undeniable it also underscores the necessity of achieving close working relationship with indigenous forces based on trust and mutual co mpetence united states unconventio nal warfare in iraq 2003 i8 experience in the early stages of oif in 2003 demonstrates that waging uw continues to have utility in the present global environment and in the context of ongoing major comba t operations elements of the 10th sfga were infiltrated by so f aircraft from the 353d sow ac ross denied airspace after turkey refused us passage over its border in the opening st ages of the conflict once the 10th sfga soldiers successfully infiltrat ed kurdistan in northern iraq and linked up with kurdish peshmerga units the anticipated second operational front was achieved using initially unanti cipated methods the sf soldiers presence acted as force multiplier by providing evidence of the poli tical support desired by the kurds thus emboldened kurdish forces with sf support tie d down husseins entire northern army in addition the sf soldiers provided and reinforced the legitimacy of us support to kurdish aspirations and provided additional legitimacy to kurdish forces participation in the larger coalition effort moreover seeing that the second front established despite its objections turkey eventually rele nted and allowed subsequent border crossings to reinforce the effort this example illustrates that the ability to conduct uw not only can support the larger conventional operation but also can use national strategy to achieve second and thirdorder effects that are sign ificant practical and timely this page intentionally left blank 30 september 2008 fm 305130 j1 appendix j an outline history of the unconventional warfare definition current definition j1 it is common for definitions to evolve and arso f have recently refined the definition below to highlight the essentials of uw and eliminate everything that is nonessential words matter in this era of definitional and conceptual change arsof must be unified with clear and co ncise understanding of the uw core task the uw definition is operations conducted by with or through irregular forces in support of resistance movement an insurgency or conventional milita ry operations previous definitions fo r unconventional warfare j2 the initial doctrinal concept for the united states to conduct uw lies with the creation of the oss doctrine generally defined uw in terms of guerrilla and covert operat ions in enemyheld or influenced territory in august 1950 the dictionary of united states army terms defined partisan warfare as an activity carried on against an enemy by people who are devoted adherents to cause but who are not members of organized and recognized military forces it includes gue rrilla action passive resistance by underground groups espionage sabotage and propaganda special regulation 35051 j3 in 1951 the army consolidated its uw assets under the office of psychologica l warfare it was then that the army published the first two manuals for the conduct of so they were fm 3121 organization and conduct of guerrilla warfare and fm 3120 operations against guerrilla forces j4 fm 3121 october 1951 defined guerrilla warfare as operations carried out b small independent forces generally in the rear of the enem with the objective of harassing delaying and disrupting military operations of the enemy the term is sometimes l imited to the military operations and tactics of small forces whose objective is to inflict casualties and damage upon the enemy rather than to seize or defend terrain the extensive use of surprise and an emphasis n the avoidance of casualties characterize these operations the term includes orga nized and directed passive resistance espionage assassination sabotage and propaganda and in so cases ordinary combat guerrilla warfare is ordinarily carried on by irregular or partisan forces however regular forces t hat have been cut off behind enemy lines or have infiltrated into the emy rear areas may use guerrilla tactics j5 fm 3121 october 1951 also noted guerrilla warfareis capable of gain ing political and economic decisions j6 in march 1955 fm 3121 guerrilla warfare stated the broad aims of guerrilla strategy are to lessen the enemys combat effectiveness delay and di srupt operations of the enem forces and weaken the morale and will to resist of hostile military force j7 in august 1955 fm 3120 special forces group which superseded fm 3120 february 1951 stated uw consists of the

march 1955 and fm 3120 august 1955 st ated guerrilla warfare comprises that part of uw which is conducted by relatively small groups employing offensive tactics to re duce enemy combat effectiveness industrial capacity and morale guerrilla operations are normally conducted in enemycontrolled territory by units organized on military basis it m ust be emphasized that uw is an activity which in addition to guerrilla warfare includ evasion and escape and subversion against hostile states appendix j j2 fm 305130 30 september 2008 j9 in may 1961 fm 3115 operations against irregular forces stated the term irregular used in combinations such as irregular forces irregular activ ities and counterirregular operations is used in the broad sense to refer to all types of nonconventional forces and operat ions it includes guerrilla partisan insurgent subversive resistance terrorist revolutionary and simila r personnel organizations and methods irregular activities include acts of milita ry political psychological and economic nature conducted predominately by inhabitants of nation for the purpose of eliminatin g or weakening the authority of the local government or occupying power and using primarily irregular an d informal groupings and measures j10 in september 1961 fm 3121 guerrilla warfare and special forces operations which superseded fm 3121 may 1958 stated uw consists of the in terrelated fields of guerrilla warfare evasion and escape and subversion against hostile states resistance uw operations are conducted in enemycontrolled territory by predominately indigenous personnel usually suppo rted and directed in varying degrees by an external source j11 in june 1965 fm 3121 special forces operations which superseded fm 3121 september 1961 stated uw includes the three interre lated fields of guerrilla warfare evasion and escape and subversion uw operations are conducted within enemy or enemycontrolled territory by predominately indigenous personnel usually directed and supported in varying degrees by an exter nal force j12 the broadest classic conceptions of uw doctrine did not apply to coi n situations however select uw tactics and techniquessuch as establishing in telligence nets and methods to gain support of the population and combat techniques such as raids and ambusheshad obvious applic ation to coina growing concern during the vietnam conflict j13 in december 1965 fm 3120 special forces operational techniques which superseded fm 3120 october 1961 omitted direct definition of uw from the manual however by the early 1960s definitions began to take more of an insurgent nature whereby uw expanded to include for ces that may have political aspirations inimical to our own the february 1969 issue of fm 3121 special forces operations which superseded fm 3121 june 1965 changed this idea fm 3121 fe bruary 1969 included the following definitions and amplifications z uw includes the three related fields of guerrilla warfare evasion and esc ape and subversion conducted within hostile areas by predominatel indigenous personnel usually supported and directed in varying degrees by an external source uw consists of mil itary political psychological or economic actions of covert clandestine or overt nature w ithin areas under the actual or potential control or influence of forc or state whose interests and objectives are inimical to those of the united states these actions are conducte d unilaterally by us resources or in conjunction with indigenous assets and avoid formal military confr ontation z the uw concept uw is conducted to exploit military political econo mic or psychological vulnerabilities of an enemy it is implemented by providing support and direction to indigenous resistance forces where appropriate or by unilateral operations of us u w forces its conduct involves the application of guerrilla warfare and lected aspects of subversion political warfare economic warfare and psychological operati ons in support of national objectives z uw operations uw operations may be covert clandestine or overt in nature c overt operations are conducted in such manner as to conceal the identity of the sponsor while clandestine operations place emphasi s on concealment of the operati on rather than the identity of the sponsor ov ert operations do t try to conceal either the ope ration or the identity of the sponsor in an established theater of operations in which significant gr ound operations by conventional us military force will be undertake n uw is conducted primarily to complement support or extend conventional operations within geographical are as under enemy control or influence to which conventional us forces w ill not be deployed uw may be conducted as an economyofforce measure and to reduc or dissipate the enemy potential j14 in february 1971 fm 3120 special forces operational techniques which superseded fm 3120 december 1965 continued to omit direct definition of uw from the manual j15 in december 1974 fm 3121 special forces operations stated uw is defined as broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations conducted in enemy enemyheld enemycontrolled or an outline history of the unconventional warfare definitio n 30 september 2008 fm 305130 j3 politically sensitive territory uw includes but is not li mited to the interrelated fields of guerrilla warfare evasion and escape subversion sabotage direct ac tion missions and other operations of lowvisibility covert or clandestine nature these interrelated aspect s of uw may be prosecuted singly or collectively by predominantly indigenous personnel usually supported and directed in varying degrees by an external sources during all conditions of war or peace j16 also in december 1974 fm 3121a special forces operations expanded on the above definition by stating that uw operations may be conducted against the external sponsor of an insurgent movement in host country or against insurgent movement in host country or ag ainst insurgent activities in third country which either willingly or unwillingly accepts the use of its territory by the insurgents for bases movement or actuary their purpose is to support or complement id ad in the host country j17 in april 1990 fm 3120 doctrine for special forces operations defined uw as broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations norm ally of long duration predominantly conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces who are organized trained equipped support ed and directed in varying degrees by an external source it includes guerrilla wa rfare and other direct offensive lowvisibility covert or clandestine operations as well as the indirect ac tivities of subversion sabotage intelligence collection and evasion and escape j18 in april 1998 jp 305 doctrine for joint special operations essentially copied the above definition uw is broad spectrum of military nd paramilitary operations rmally of long duration predominantly conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces who are organized tra ined equipped supported and directed in varying degrees by an ex ternal source it includes guerrilla warfare and other direct offensive lowvisibility covert or clandestin operations as well as the indirect activities of subversion sabotage intelligence activities and evasion and esca pe j19 in december 1998 fm 3120 initial draft doctrine for special forces operations added to the two definitions above stating z uw is broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations predom inantly conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces organized trained equipped supported an d directed in varying degrees by an external source it includes guerrilla warfare and the indire ct activities of subversion sabotage intelligence activities and unconventional assisted recovery uar uw is the military and paramilitary aspect of an insurgency or ot her armed resistance movement uw is thus protracted politicalmilitary activity z contemporary uw is significant for several reasons historically sf has focused n uw as an adjunct to major theater of war the new strate gic environment however requires sf to focus on uw during military operations other than war especially as it relates t uar moreover global urbanization dictates shift in sf emphasi s from rural guerrilla warfare to all aspects of clandestine uw nondoctrinal terms j20 other currently influential but nondoctrinal terms further complicate the go of maintaining an uptodate authoritative nd clearly articulated arsof uw doctrine incorrect usage of doctrinal terms sows confusion and aggravates mission accomplishmen t incorrect usage of unapproved terms does so exponentially individuals throughout the government academia and the press so widely and often incorrectly use these terms that they demand brief summary j21 one such imprecise term often confused for uw is asymmetric warfare despite the frequent usage of the term jp 102 has approved definition for it symmetric warfare assumes the legacy concept of two roughly equal nationstates who fight each other directly using standing uniformed armies navies and air forces wwii countries and combats are clas sic example asymmetric warfare is generally understood to be conflict in which the strengths and sizes of the opponents do not mirror each other the side with the conventional disadvantage is probably incapable of winni ng through direct conventional warfare it must seek victory through other methods that exploit weakness in the superior conventional powers capacity to prevail examples include the maoist peoples war against the imperial japanese army the vietnamese dau trahn strategy in the first and second indochina wars and alqaedas tactics in appendix j j4 fm 305130 30 september 2008 the wot in these cases political organization pros elytizing and psyop were fundamental to their effectiveness j22 although symmetric warfare is the loose conceptual equivalent of conventional warfare it is not an approved doctrinal definition the discussion of as ymmetry however is obviously useful to the characterization of iw uw and co in iw does include the concept of seeking asymmetric advantages iw also uses terms such as asymmetric applica tions of ttp and drawing attention to asymmetric activities arsofand its joint interagency and multinational partnersmust therefore understand and use the unapproved term asymmetric warfare with care it is not sy nonymous with uw j23 second term often used in discussions of uw iw and coin is socalled fou rthgeneration warfare or 4gw 4gw proponents maintain that the world is in new era or generation of warfare the first generation was characterized by massed manpower the second by firepowe r and the third by maneuver 4gw proponents claim that the new generation is characterized by the use of all instruments of powernot just the militaryto defeat the will of enemy decision makers 4gw has its detractors 4gw borrows heavily from concepts previously developed by mao the vietnamese and others it is not accepted dod doctrine or terminology and is not synonym for uw j24 third term that is sometimes mistakenly confused with uw is restricted warfare this term refers to the title of monograph written by two army co lonels from the peoples republic of china they advocate multitude of means both military and particularly nonm ilitary to strike at the united states during times of conflict hacking into web sites targeting financial institutions conducting terrorism using the media and conducting urban warfare are among the methods propo sed the first rule of unrestricted warfare is that there are rules stro ng countries would not use the same approach against weak countries because strong countries make the rules while rising ones break them and exploit loopholes j25 the similarity of these ideas to those in the previous terms is unmist akable whether or not the authors break any new ground or establish new theory is debatable their monograph has generated interest in the west primarily for what it may signify in peoples rep ublic of china strategic thinking such ideas could not be published without some official sanction in the often inscru table chinese government arsof soldiersand their joint intera gency and multinational partnersshould be aware of unrestricted warfare but they must understand that the term is not synonymous w ith the aforementioned terms is not approved doctrine and has very specific international context and usage 30 september 2008 fm 305130 glossary1 glossary section i
