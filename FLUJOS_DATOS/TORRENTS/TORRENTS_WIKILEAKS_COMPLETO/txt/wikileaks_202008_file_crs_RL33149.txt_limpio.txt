depending upon market conditions in order to secure qualified workforce davisbacon however represents wage floor under davisbacon the president is allowed to suspend the act during time of national emergency though national emergency is not defined in the act on four occasions presidents have suspended the statute most recently in the wake of hurricane katrina during the last week of august 2005 hurricane katrina gathered strength in the atlantic and moved against the gulf states on september 8 2005 amid the chaos left in katrinas wake president george w bush suspended davisbacon focusing upon the massive effort that would be required for reconstruction in the wake of hurricane katrina the legislative response has been diverse hr 3684 flake proposed to render suspension mandatory during any major disaster proclaimed by the president under the stafford act companion bill was introduced in the senate s 1817 demint other measures introduced after the president had acted would

world war i various efforts were made to enhance the level of professionalism within the construction industry where federal contracts were concerned with their lowbidder specifications some contractors would bid above their level of expertise and having won particular contract then attempt to hire workforce some were successful in this enterprise others were not some bidders engaged in bidbrokering ie systematic acquisition of contracts followed by leasingout of the work or its transfer to another contractor whose workforce was paid at an extremely low rate with the government as consumer indirectly supporting such abusive practices there was some suggested persistent lowering of standards and construction quality with little concern for the workers actually engaged in construction nor with the ultimate consumer of the work1 in the process some firms may have been lessthancompetent to such firms the opprobrious title flybynight operators was given as the nation moved into the great depression of the 1930s when government was investing substantial amounts in public construction such itinerant jobbers and firms basing their operations on low wages were seen as subverting the recovery process the economic impact of publically subsidized work intended to spur the economy of an especially depressed area was defused and the effort to provide work and contracts for distressed communities was frustrated in 1931 representative robert bacon rny and senator james davis rpa the latter having served as labor secretary in the cabinets of presidents harding coolidge and hoover proposed what would become known as the davisbacon act2 the initial enactment seems to have satisfied very few but given an executive order 5778 by president hoover in 1932 and restructuring of the statute by congress in 1935 pl 74324 the davisbacon act was modified and quickly became generally accepted part of federal labormanagement policy gradually the provisions of davisbacon came to be added to diverse number of statutes involving public works and related construction 1 inter alia see lloyd smith to eliminate irresponsible bidders the constructor jan 1925 pp 23

president hoover on mar 3 1931 crs2 by the late 1970s president carter commenced further restructuring of the act process carried on by president reagan in the 1980s during subsequent years criticism of the act has tended to reflect ideological perspectives some conservative often in opposition some mostly trade unionists and contractors operating with union crews in support3 among labor laws davisbacon is widely known but it may not be well known the act provides wage floor and is geared to specific types of construction ie residential building highway and heavy construction it is implemented on locality basis generally on county level although often mislabeled the davisbacon wage is not necessarily the union wage though in cases where the union wage prevails it may be that the davisbacon rate is indeed the union rate conversely the wages paid on davisbacon projects may be somewhat higher than prescribed by the act because of demand for labor and for other market considerations finally davisbacon applies only to federally contracted construction though its impact may spill over into the nonfederal sector depending upon the market and general conditions of employment perhaps the most frequently asked question concerning the davisbacon act is would the federal government and the taxpayers save money if the davisbacon act were repealed or modified to narrow its scope the short answer is one really knows conversely might davisbacon result in savings to the federal government in its purchases of construction that too would seem to be an open question one might like to say forthrightly that change in the statute could have positive or negative impact however the state of current research would probably be insufficient to justify just an assertion4 suspension of davisbacon under davisbacon the president is allowed to suspend the act in times of national emergency however the concept of national emergency is not defined in the statute as the implications of hurricane katrina became known there were increasing pressures upon the bush administration for suspension of davisbacon some suggested that advocates of suspension were simply using the disaster as means of advancing an agenda which they were not under normal circumstances able to move 3 see testimony of labor secretary william n doak in us cong senate committee on

davisbacon the act and the literature by william g whitaker crs3 in congress5 others affirmed that temporary suspension of davisbacon will help avoid costly delays that impede cleanup and reconstruction efforts along the gulf coast6 in addition it was affirmed that we need to be as flexible as possible in helping the gulf coast region and ease the burden on state and local officials as we begin one of the largest reconstruction projects in modern history7 others citing the massive rebuilding challenges ahead urged the president to issue presidential proclamation to suspend davisbacon until our country is once again whole8 on september 8 2005 president george w bush citing potential inflationary wage pressures suspended the davisbacon act as it relates to specific segments of the country ie to portions of florida alabama mississippi and louisiana9 the proclamation of suspension specified that both the act and provisions of all other acts providing for the payment of wages which provisions are dependent upon determinations by the secretary of labor would be suspended10 postsuspension legislation following the september 2005 suspension of the davisbacon act number of pieces of legislation were introduced that would deal in various ways with that action some it would appear would have broadened the suspension or made it mandatory others would have overturned that suspension the flake bill hr 3684 representative jeff flake was first to emerge with davisbacon proposal day before the president suspended the act11 the bill cited as the cleanup and reconstruction enhancement act care act would amend section 3147 of title 40 the provision that allows the president to suspend davisbacon by adding at the end the following 5 rep george miller

as the davisbacon act see crs report 98505 national emergency powers by harold c relyea 10 white house press releases sept 8 2005 davisbacon has been incorporated within series of other statutes specifically or by inference to which determinations by the secretary of labor refers 11 the flake bill had 29 original republican cosponsors now raised to 33 democrats signed onto the bill there appears to have been explanatory documents or introductory statement crs4 in any area that the president determines to be major disaster under section 1022 of the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act 42 usc 51222 the provisions of this subchapter shall not apply for period of 1 year from the date on which the president makes such determination the bill is short and direct whenever the president in the national interest finds it necessary to declare major disaster under the stafford act thus opening eligibility for various subsidies andor federal programs the davisbacon act will automatically be suspended for one year in the area of concern from the date on which the determination is made the bill would remove from the president what has been discretionary policy and render it automatic if major disaster is declared under 42 usc 51222 of the stafford act major disaster is defined as including any hurricane tornado storm high water winddriven water tidal wave tsunami earthquake volcanic eruption landslide mudslide snowstorm or drought or regardless of cause any fire flood or explosion for which the president determines there is need for major disaster assistance in statement subsequently applauding the presidents action representative flake affirmed that compliance with davisbacon can add weeks to federally financed construction projects often driving up costs12 hr 3684 was introduced on september 7 2005 and referred to the house committee on education and the workforce13 the miller bill hr 3763 introduced on september 14 2005 the proposal by representative george miller hr 3763 would basically overturn the presidents authority with respect to the particular case of hurricane katrina14 the bill states that the proclamation of the president dated september 8 2005 or any other provision of law notwithstanding the provisions of subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 united states code and the provisions of all other related acts to the extent they depend upon determination by the secretary of labor under section 3142 of such title whether or not the president has the authority to suspend the operation of such provisions shall apply to all contracts to which such provisions would otherwise apply that are entered into on or after the date of enactment of this act to be performed in the counties affected by hurricane katrina and described in such proclamation 12 rep flake statement to the press sept 8 2005 13 s 1817 companion bill was introduced on oct 4 2005 by senator jim demint and was referred to the committee on health education labor and pensions 14 the miller bill had 161 original democratic cosponsors including one independent one republican was an initial cosponsor but withdrew his name crs5 in short the davisbacon act and related federal statutes would be made to apply after enactment to the counties specified in the presidents september 8 2005 message of course the act would continue to be applicable to other us jurisdictions in an introductory statement representative miller explained that the davis bacon act requires that federal contractors pay their workers at least the prevailing wage simply the wage that is typical for their kind of job in their community he continued many of the workers subjected to these wage cuts under the presidents proclamation have lost everything their homes their property their jobs and even family members we owe it to these american workers to pay them wage that will allow them and their families to get back on their feet15 the miller bill cited as the fair wages for hurricane victims act was referred to the committee on education and the workforce16 the pallone bill hr 3834 introduced on september 20 2005 by representative frank pallone hr 3834 essentially duplicates the miller bill except that one phrase whether or not the president has the authority to suspend the operations of such provisions has been omitted the measure was referred to the committee on education and the workforce17 the king bill hr 4643 introduced on december 18 2005 after the president had reinstated the act but in some respects part of the cycle representative steve king proposed in hr 4643 to repeal the davisbacon act per the bill was referred to the house committee on education and the workforce and to the subcommittee on workforce protections18 the kennedy bill s 1749 introduced on september 21 2005 by senator kennedy s 1749 is companion to the miller bill the measure was referred to the committee on health education labor and pensions19 in an introductory statement senator kennedy observed that in rebuilding the gulf coast we are rebuilding communities and neighborhoods and the 15 congressional record sept 14 2005 p e1845 16 representative charlie melancon dla subsequently introduced hres 516 bill to provide for adoption of the miller bill hr 3763 the melancon bill was referred to the house committee on rules 17 there were other original cosponsors 18 cosponsors with representative king were representatives blackburn feeney flake hensarling and musgrave 19 the kennedy bill had 25 original cosponsors now raised to 28 all of them democratic crs6 foundation of such communities is good jobs with fair wages senator kennedy estimated that from 400000 to 1 million workers may become unemployed as result of the hurricane with the unemployment rate reaching 25 percent or higher in the gulf region many affected workers will be unemployed for 9 months or longer the rebuilding of the gulf coast communities will be major source of new employment and we need to be sure that they pay decent wages this is all that davis bacon does it simply ensures that workers on federal government projects earn typical wage20 the boxer bill s 1763 on september 22 2005 senator barbara boxer introduced s 1763 bill cited as the hurricane katrina reconstruction and displaced worker assistance act of 2005 the bill essentially has two parts first it would have the head of an executive agency give preference in hiring for hurricane reconstruction efforts to workers who have been displaced by the storm not less than 25 percent of the workforce that will perform such services are to be such displaced workers second notwithstanding the presidents proclamation of september 8 2005 all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the performance of federal contracts for the procurement of services in connection with hurricane katrina reconstruction efforts shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing for similar work in the locality involved the bill was referred to the committee on health education labor and pensions in an introductory statement senator boxer suggested that tens of thousands of people in the gulf states have lost their jobs and that over 200000 have filed for unemployment benefits further taking note of the presidents suspension of the davisbacon act she stated the tragedy of hurricane katrina should not be used as an excuse to take advantage of working people21 the kennedy bill s 1925 on october 26 2005 senator kennedy proposed bill s 1925 titled rebuild with respect act the measure with 11 original cosponsors began by mandating the reinstatement of the davisbacon act as it applies to work associated with hurricanes katrina and rita the bill also deals with affirmative action health and safety concerns and related matters the measure was referred to the committee on health education labor and pensions the miller resolution hres 467 on september 27 2005 representative miller introduced hres 467 measure requesting that the president transmit to the house of representatives information 20 congressional record sept 21 2005 pp s10302s10303 21 congressional record sept 22 2005 p s10382 senator boxer also introduced s 1644 sept 8 2005 which provides for preference for workers displaced by the hurricane the bill was introduced almost simultaneously with the presidents proclamation crs7 in his possession relating to contracts for services or construction related to hurricane katrina recovery that relate to wages and benefits to be paid to workers22 among the documents requested by the resolution to be provided later than 14 days after adoption of the resolution were materials that deal with reconstruction in the gulf region and with davisbacon this included copies of any portions of any contracts in his possession for services or building or other construction including preawarded contracts or contracts that were modified or extended related to hurricane katrina recovery or rebuilding that address wages and benefits to be paid to workers pursuant to the act commonly known as the davisbacon act the service contract act of 1965 or the fair labor standards act of 1938 that were awarded by the federal emergency management agency or at the request of such agency or by the departments of labor education homeland security health and human services or defense or the army corps of engineers the resolution requested presentation to the house by the president of any communications in his possession made or received on or after august 26 2005 by one or more of the several agencies related to compliance with or enforcement of the davisbacon act the service contract act or the fair labor standards act and that deal with the geographic areas specified in the presidents proclamation 7924 of september 8 200523 the resolution seldom used device was referred to the committee on education and the workforce in midoctober 2005 the committee voted to report the measure unfavorably along party lines see hrept 10925824 the latourette resolution hres 488 on october 7 2005 representative steven latourette introduced hres 488 similar to but more abbreviated than the miller resolution discussed above the latourette resolution was referred to the committee on transportation and infrastructure where reportedly committee chairman don young had agreed to schedule markup on the measure in early november25 on november 2 2005 the committee marked up the bill and reported it by voice vote without recommendation on the following day it was placed on the house calendar but by this point the issue was moot see discussion below 22 this language is taken from the title of the resolution see

bill was referred to the house transportation and infrastructure committee davisbacon is reinstated on september 8 2005 as noted above president george w bush suspended the davisbacon act as it applied to certain gulf coast jurisdictions the presidents suspension of the act seemed to have produced substantial backlash favorable to davisbacon and toward reinstatement on september 13 representative miller had charged while the administration is giving out nobid contracts that fail to protect the taxpayer it is also exploiting hurricane katrina to undermine the wages of the most desperate workers in our country26 the next day three trade union officials douglas mccarron terence osullivan and vincent giblin wrote to congress decrying the logic of the administration in suspending davisbacon27 the people of the gulf states have gone through so much and now the administration wants them to sacrifice decent pay it was suggested we dont hear contractors being asked to work for reduced profit28 representative james oberstar ranking member of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure was similarly critical it is particularly unfair to ask workers to work at low wages to rebuild the devastated areas when contractors are not being asked to make any comparable sacrifices29 meanwhile the cochairs of the house labor and working families caucus democratic representatives stephen lynch michael machaud and linda sanchez stated in an area so afflicted with poverty and with so many workers struggling to care for their families waiving this basic worker protection is big step in the wrong direction30 gradually consensus began to build leaders of the state labor federations in alabama louisiana mississippi and texas reportedly called upon the president to rescind his proclamation the union leaders also urged republican governors of the 26 daily labor report sept 16 2005 p a8 27 the trade unionists were presidents of the carpenters and

representatives latourette and frank lobiondo organized letter to president bush asking that the suspension of davis bacon be lifted letter signed by 37 house republicans32 the dissidents had met repeatedly with white house officials including andy card and karl rove and house speaker j dennis hastert in statement to the press latourette suggested there are thousands of skilled gulf coast workers who should be working to rebuild their communities and observed further companies are passing them by and hiring cheap unskilled illegal workers to beef up their bottom line33 representative lobiondo stated that it was critical that the congress have an accurate account of how all money is being spent34 on october 20 about 20 republicans attended meeting with white house chief of staff andrew card at the office of speaker dennis hastert card was described as more than receptive to suggestions from defenders of davisbacon and reportedly he acknowledged that they werent saving any money through the suspension according to latourette card told the republican lawmakers that he has some bases to touch and that hes going to take our message to the president and hopefully hell let us know next week meanwhile the latourette resolution hres 488 remained with the committee on transportation and infrastructure of whom representative young one of the signatories to the letter sent to bush served as chairman35 and representative oberstar served as ranking member few days later on october 25 card called to issue an invitation for meeting at the white house the following day at the meeting card advised that reversal would be under way36 during the white house meeting card was quoted as having said according to representative latourette that there appeared to be savings garnered from suspending the davisbacon act in subsequent statement by labor secretary elaine chao it was affirmed that review of current conditions in the declared areas has resulted in the reinstatement of davisbacon act provisions effective november 8 the decision to reinstate the act renders moot the resolution of inquiry then pending before the committee on transportation and

executive director of the associated general contractors of louisiana the issue of prevailing wages under davisbacon really did not mean much because the market was driving wage rates later perry nations executive director of the associated general contractors of mississippi when asked about pay rates in construction indicated that they were then well in excess of the davisbacon prevailing
