played an increasingly important role in budget policymaking the last several years these fees are charged to the direct beneficiaries of goods or services provided by the federal government user fee may be classified as governmental receipt or an offsetting collection depending on whether the fee is based on the sovereign powers of the government or on businesslike activities like other revenues of the federal government user fees classified as governmental receipts are paid into the general fund or special funds of the treasury user fees classified as offsetting collections however are deducted from the gross amount of spending the classification of user fees and whether the user fee offsets discretionary or direct spending affects the enforcement of budget procedures under the congressional budget act of 1974 and the balanced budget act and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended introduction user fees generally refer to fees charged to users of goods or services provided by the federal government1 unlike general revenues such as income or payroll taxes user fees are collected from limited segments of the public and are used to fund specific government activities rather than the general purposes of government for example entrance fees to national parks are charged only to those entering the park and the proceeds usually are appropriated by congress to finance the goods or services provided to users of the park the amount of the fee often is related to the cost of the good or service provided user fees are intended to represent payment for the benefit provided in some cases such as user fees collected by the nuclear regulatory commission user fees are set to cover the overall costs of the agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20439crs2 2ibid p 94

process washington the brookings institution 1995 pp 106108in fy1998 the most recent fiscal year actual data are available the federal government collected 135801 billion in user fees2 over 99 or 134804 billion of the total user fees collected were treated as offsetting collections almost 1 or 0997 billion were treated as governmental receipts of the user fees treated as offsetting collections 11 or 15417 billion were used to offset discretionary spending and 89 or 119387 billion were used to offset mandatory spending fees collected by the us postal service accounted for over 50 of these mandatory offsets according to studies by the congressional budget office and the general accounting office gao user fee collections have increased over the last two decades3 gao found that collections from user fees increased 27 in real terms between fiscal years 1991 and 19964 while the gao report illustrates the growth in the amount of user fees collected by the 27 feereliant agencies studied the overall growth of user fees collected by the federal government is more difficult to gauge recent data on the overall growth of user fees are not readily available primarily because the data have not been collected by single agency over an extended period of time some have argued that budget enforcement constraints have contributed to the growth in user fee collections and changes in the classification of user fees5 while this report does not evaluate these propositions it does focus on the budgetary treatment of user fees within the context of budget enforcement procedures budgetary treatment of user fees user fees are not recorded as separate category in the federal budget they may be classified as either governmental receipts or offsetting collections user fees resulting from the governments sovereign powers are treated as governmental receipts and are paid into the general fund of the treasury as are general revenues such as income tax collections user fees resulting from businesslike or marketoriented activities are classified as offsetting collections and are counted as offsets to spending offsetting collections are deducted from gross budget authority and outlays not all offsetting collections however are user fees for example intragovernmental transactions are classified as offsetting collections but are not user fees within the classification of offsetting collections user fees may be credited to either an expenditure account or receipt account user fees credited to an expenditure account are available for the purposes of the account without any additional action by congress the fees collected by the us postal service from stamp sales are made available automatically to finance its operations such fees offset spending ie budget authority and outlays at the account level user fees credited to receipt account require additional legislative action before the funds may be spent entrance fees collected by the

congress each year in order for these funds to be spent referred to as offsetting receipts such fees are deducted from the budget authority and outlays of the agency that performs the activity and the subfunction to which the activity is assigned some user fees classified as offsetting receipts are not offset against any agency or function but instead are deducted from the total gross spending of the federal government these user fees are classified as undistributed offsetting receipts while the classification of specific user fee generally follows this standard conceptual framework it is important to note that many exceptions exist and congress often uses its legislative authority to classify user fees as it chooses user fee legislation and jurisdiction most user fees are authorized by specific statutes6 user fee legislation like any other legislation is referred to the committees of the house and senate having jurisdiction the referral is made by the presiding officer of each house with the advice of the parliamentarian generally jurisdictional issues are resolved based on house and senate rules and precedents since user fees are collections from limited and specific segment of the public user fee legislation generally is not considered revenue measure standing committees of the house other than the appropriations and budget committees may report legislation creating or modifying user fees7 however based on precedents of the house ruling on whether user fee is general revenue measure depends on the nature of the charge rather than its label selftitled user fee may be ruled revenue measure if it is levied on broad segment of the public or for purposes that represent the governments sovereign powers senate rules and precedents are not explicit in distinguishing between user fees and taxes8 if user fee is considered to be broadbased fee it is subject to the rules that govern revenue measures the house ways and means and senate finance committees have jurisdiction over revenue measures generally house rules protect the ways and means committees jurisdict ion by prohibiting from consideration any revenue measure or amendm ent not reported by the committee while senate rules generally protect committee jurisdictions provisions exist explicitly protecting the senate finance committees jurisdiction over revenue measures9 article i section 7 of the us constitution further requires that all revenue measures originate in the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20439crs4 10for more thorough discussion of these procedures see us library of congress congressional research service manual on the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick crs report 98720 gov washington august 28 1998budget enforcement procedures user fee legislation like other budgetary policies is considered and adopted within framework of budget enforcement procedures established primarily by the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93 344 and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 as amended10 1974 congressional budget act the congressional budget act established the congressional budget process which is centered around the adoption each year of concurrent resolution on the budget the budget resolution sets forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and functional levels of spending for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years once adopted the total budget authority and outlays set forth in the resolution are allocated to each house and senate committee with jurisdiction over specific spending legislation the house and senate appropriations committees further subdivide their allocations among their respective subcommittees aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending allocations are enforced on the floor of each house by points of order section 311a of the cba provides point of order against any measure that would cause spending to exceed the aggregate spending ceiling or revenues to drop below the revenue floor section 302f provides point of order against any measure that would cause committees allocation to be exceeded also under section 302f point of order may be raised against any appropriation measure that would cause the appropriations committees subdivisions to be exceeded these points of order are not selfenforcing member must raise point of order against the violating legislation congress may waive these points of order by suspension of the rules by unanimous consent by waiver motion in the senate or by special rule in the house most waiver motions in the senate require threefifths vote of senators 60 votes if there are vacancies congress also may include reconciliation directives in budget resolution in order to initiate necessary changes in direct spending and revenue laws reconciliation directives instruct one or more committees to recommend legislative language necessary to achieve the levels of direct spending or revenue agreed to in the budget resolution the legislative language recommended by committees is packaged by the house and senate budget committees without substantive revision into one or more reconciliation bills in some instances reconciliation instructions may direct committee to report its legislative recommendations directly to its house reconciliation legislation is considered under expedited procedures that limit debate and place restrictions on amendments 1985 balanced budget act the balanced budget act as amended by the 1990 budget enforcement act title xiii of pl 101508 and most recently by the 1997 budget enforcement act title x of pl 10533 created sequestration process to enforce adjustable statutory limits on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo requirement on direct spending and revenue legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20439crs5 11in addition to exempting several programs from any sequestration the 1985 balanced budget act as amended limits the amount that may be sequestered in several other programs for example reduction in medicare spending is limited to 4 12under current budget scorekeeping rules specifically rule 3 an increase in mandatory user fees ie changes in mandatory programs included in an appropriation bill is credited against annual discretionary spending limits and the appropriations subcommittees in the house and senate thus offsetting discretionary spending for additional explanation of how these scorekeeping rules apply continuedadjustable statutory limits currently exist for four separate categories of discretionary spending violent crime reduction spending through fy2000 highway spending through fy2003 mass transit spending through fy2003 and total discretionary spending through fy2002 if the office of management and budget omb director determines in sequestration report issued 15 days after the end of session that spending category has been breached sequestration making acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs within the applicable category is required withinsession sequestratio n may occur when an appropriation such as supplemental appropriation causes spending cap to be breached during fiscal year in this case sequestration would occur seven days after the enactment of the appropriation if violation of the discretionary spending limits occurs in the last quarter of the fiscal year ie july 1 through september 30 the spending limit for the applicable category must be reduced by the amount of the violation in the following fiscal year paygo rules require that the effects of direct spending and revenue legislation enacted during session be recorded on paygo scorecard when combined with the existing scorecard balance such legislation may not yield negative balance if it does such legislation must be offset by an equivalent amount of direct spending reductions revenue increases or combination of both the paygo rules apply to direct spending and revenue legislation enacted through fy2002 and apply to the outyear effects of such legislation through fy2006 if the omb director determines in the final sequestration report that violation will occur sequestration making acrosstheboard cuts in nonexempt direct spending programs is required11 similar paygo rules are enforced procedurally in the senate as well point of order may be raised against any direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase the deficit for the first fiscal year the first five fiscal years or the following five fiscal years covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution the fy2000 budget resolution hconres 68 modified this point of order by allowing any future onbudget surpluses to be used to offset an increase in direct spending or reduction in revenue treatment of user fees under budget enforce ment procedures budget enforcement procedures that apply to user fee depend on whether user fee offsets discretionary spending offsets direct spending or is treated as governmental receipt discretionary spending is funded through the annual appropriations process such spending is provided in appropriation bills which are under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees user fee in an appropriation bill may be used to offset an increase in discretionary spending while still conforming to the spending policies agreed to in the budget resolution12 such an offset could prevent the successfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20439crs6 12continued to user fees see cbo the growth of federal user charges p 34 the current scorekeeping guidelines are set forth in the explanatory statement accompanying the conference report to the balanced budget act of 1997 hrept 105217 pp 10071053 13this prohibition does not apply to continuing resolutions in the houseraising of any one of the points of order enforcing aggregate spending totals the spending allocations of the appropriation committees and subcommittees also user fee that offsets discretionary spending may be used to stay within the statutory spending caps an increase in user fees would allow an equivalent increase in discretionary spending without triggering sequestration under the 1985 balanced budget act legislation creating or modifying user fee in an appropriation bill however may face procedural problems under house and senate rules house rule xxi and senate rule xvi generally prohibit the inclusion of legislation in appropriations13 point of order often could be raised against an appropriation bill that includes user fee legislation the rules however may be waived by suspension of the rules by unanimous consent or in the house by special rule direct spending and revenues are controlled in substanti ve laws most direct spending and revenues are permanent and do not require any annual action by congress although congress usually modifies some direct spending programs and revenues each session the authorizing legislation for direct spending is under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees new or increased user fee treated as an offsetting collection may be used to offset an increase in direct spending user fee treated as governmental receipt may be used to offset reduction in revenue the points of order enforcing the aggregate levels of spending and revenues and the committee spending allocations could be prevented by such user fee offset user fee also may be used to comply with reconciliation directives included in budget resolution for example committee that is required to reduce direct spending may do so by recommending an increase in user fee the user fee increase would reduce the level of direct spending by an equivalent amount similarly user fee that is treated as governmental receipt may be used by the house ways and means and senate finance committees to comply with reconciliation instructions that require change in revenues user fee offsetting an increase in direct spending or reduction in revenues also may be used to comply with the paygo rules an increase in direct spending or reduction in revenues may be offset by an increase in user fee which would prevent paygo sequestration at the end of congressional session or point of order under the senates paygo rule
