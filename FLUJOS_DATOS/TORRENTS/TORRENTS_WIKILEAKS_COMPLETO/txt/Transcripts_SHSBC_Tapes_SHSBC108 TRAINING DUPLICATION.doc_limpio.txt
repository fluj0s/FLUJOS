training duplication lecture given on 24 january 1962 thank you very much its not deserved ive been very mean to several of you in the last day or two very very mean with good results okay what is this audience 24th its the 24th of jan ad 121962in the year of our travail especially yours all right now i have some good news for you going to sit down in this lecture if you dont mind but i have some very very good news for you some excellent news for you that if you were beaten over the head tortured treated with sarcasm hammered and pounded and generally abused you eventually decide to find outyou go past you see merely attacking ron you see that breaks down and you go past that and you say well now if this much fuss is being made about it maybe there is right way to do it and so you try that for while and nothing much happens and then if you are hammered and pounded and beaten some more then you decide to do it right and then all of sudden theres tremendous dawning on every hand that there was something here and that has just happened on this good day of our dianetics in 1962 this just happened several of you in just the last session you ran discovered that 3d criss cross worked like crazy just discovered itbrandnew discovery some of you have not made that discovery yet but many of youthe majority that were having any difficulty with thisall of sudden it dawned that there was something here and that it did work and that the session ran like hot bomb and all became suddenly well now the oldtime student here who has had great deal of trainingi will say this great deal of training shows up along these linesgot results with 3d criss cross at once the second it was presented to them they started getting results with 3d criss cross which is quite interesting see they looked it over they said thats okay they started listing and everything and the next thing you know they were getting results with it but those of you who have just come up to the nervous state of newly created iis didnt measure up this well and youve been floundering and falling on your heads now for the better part of two weeks it has been pretty gruesome i mean i have actually suffered for you i didnt suffer for the pc i can always straighten out pc if i can straighten out pc why i dont worry about the pc particularly but i suffered for the poor auditor sitting there doing exactly what he was told if doing it backwards and with ron shouldering the total responsibility of it all going bad because it probably didnt work suddenly waking up deciding to do it right and then the second step finding out that it worked like mad now that is quite win that is win for however it tends to validate this system of activity system of activity which begins with apathy see you confront somebody in apathy nothing works anyway and there is way to do anything right anyhow but if you did do it right nothing would happen because there isnt any way to do it right because nothing would happen if you did do it right now it is sometimes necessary in action to throw bit of hand grenade into that particular type of activity and just say yow yow yow outrageously you see say well look ahere youre only writing on one side of your auditors report and the person says well yes of course im only writing on one side of the auditors report and all auditors do dont they well they mostly do but you shouldnt you see and then you should have known better than that see it has never been published or released so you should have known about it expect the student to have picked it all up telepathically expect the thing to have sort of leaked in through the pores by association with the tile or something like that you see doesnt much matter now this is very pertinent to you in the training of class iis when you start training class ii auditors you should recognize this for what its worth and its little lesson that i could teach you on the subject of raising hell thats the title of the lesson raising hell now there are two ways you could get somebody out of apathy see they dont know and there is right way to do it and there are probably results anyway now theres two ways to approach this problem one is on the route of making auditors and the other is on the route of auditing now the way you make auditors differs entirely of course from the way you audit pcs there are two routes here that we employ not necessarily for the betterment of cases but for getting the job done of course the net result of all this is the betterment of all cases but there are two routes that we actually employ and you should recognize these as distinctly different routes and the first of these is where person is concerned as an auditor and we have always had bit of line on this and you found in an academy in the old days where they didnt have this policy in force they made very bad auditors wow terrible and that was this type of an approach well we know you cant audit because you have case and well try to patch your case up and if we get your case up why then maybe some day you will be able to audit that type of approach does not work in the making of auditors just write it down to that you see if we admitted that the auditor had case then nobody on this whole planet would ever be sprung do you see that so this is just piece of arbitrary snarl do you see this datum must not be true it isnt that it is true or isnt true it just must not be true see theres logic to it at all it just must not be true because otherwise you would never bail anybody out of anything because there would never be anybody to audit him and true enough over the years watching academies that practiced the ideathe d of t if he had the idea that if we just processed all these students and somehow or another if i just gave them all little bit of case gain and i got them all in shape so they could confront their pc and if i could get their cases from getting in their roads why then i could make them into auditors and this goes out as far as this if we only let good people into the academy we dont know what this good person is he lurks out someplace under the rhododendrons or someplace but he never seems to have come near any organization to date this good person you see now if you could just get good people thats the other song you hear but thats just little bit of downgrade immediately after you hear this good people action the next tune that you hear being played on the outof tune street piano is if we just could audit all of the cases in the academy why then you see they would all be able to audit and they of course have propounded piece of nonsense you see if theres nobody to audit all these cases in the academy how the hell are they ever going to get audited and you dont have an academy at all you have an hgc so this quickly defeats itself as philosophy so very early i think it was about the 7th acc this philosophy was entered into the training of auditors and the philosophy is workable it is not necessarily true it is not necessarily easy it is not necessarily kind sweet or good it simply works and it is in workable line true but its only workable truth and that is simply auditors do not have cases period that is the one thing that we must insist on now it goes as far as this that if hes slightly warm and you can see mist on mirror held against his mouth he or she is in shape to audit if they can be dragged to the chair and if an emeter can be propped up in their vicinity theyre in condition to audit this goes to total extremity they could be sitting there with both legs cut off from street accident but they are in shape to audit thats it thats just it its like when nations get down to the lasttheyre getting the conscripts from their 14yearold class you know and the 72yearold class and the 15 yearold class anybody who dares walk back in through you see from hospitals or anything else anybody who dares come anywhere near the assembly officers who are putting together new regiments you see is instantly just stamped hugely fit for combat see we dont get it from that particular thing but it just gives you the idea now when time goes on and nation gets more fit to work they start then saying well this person is not fit for combat and should be audited and that sort of thing but let call something to your attention that we are not nation but we are certainly people and this is very germane we are not in that condition today where we can say well lets take this person and lets audit him for while and maybe hell learn how to audit some day andyou know if we get his case out of the road why maybe he can audit were not in that condition were not that wealthy see were just not that wealthy in people nor are we that far advanced along the lines so this datum not only has been true but will be true for quite while now oddly enough this is workable philosophy totally workable as philosophy it does work and today is one of those days when i have seen this philosophy work some people with class iis who are so far from clear they would have to have moon shot to comprehend it talking about cases now see just casewise blcuuhh see have actually been driven in toward the absorption of data the regularities of practice to an actual recognition that what they were doing ended in very very powerful fine gain for the pc and that they could do it thats much more important now this is one of those days when that philosophy has worked out now i dont say that youre in horrible condition id say when you get some processing and so forth you will probably get up to being in horrible condition compare the way youthe condition that you were in couple of trillion years ago or 500 trillion or something like that whatever the outrageous figure might be and youre not in such good shape these days you know and for you to actually start putting together beingnot human being anybody can put together human being you just take some electronic shock waves and some implants and kick him and destroy all their selfdeterminism then destroy other determinism and then racket him between destroyed selfdeterminism and destroyed otherdeterminism and you fix him up real good and get them to accumulate all masses and never asis anything and youve got human being all right so you justitd be virtue to make one of those lets move it up just little bit furtherbut to make functional being to take big sevenleague boot stride in the direction of making functional being now that has happened and thats just happened just in the last couple of days this sort of thing has been coming up im very happy about this because its far more significant than you might realize at first glance it means that the thing can be bootstrapped now we expect somebody thats been under training for half year of heavy duress and so forth to be able to pick up process and be able to do it but i was very proud when those older students just did that and were able to do that and just kicked it off from the starting line and that was it well that was little victory in itself but it was not particularly victory for this other philosophy because they have had good case gains and they are long ways from where they were the other people who have just come up to class iis have not had very significant case gains yet and they were able to do it now that was very important well you see this philosophy works and its distinct philosophy if hes warm he can audit get the idea and that you can actually bring enough pressure to bear and enough training to bear on an individual so that he actually can do properly laid out comprehension and action as far as the pc is concerned and arrive with tremendously significant result now thats victory because if that werent true we as people would never make it wed just never make it thats all there would be few able guys and they would quickly go out the bottom through auditing seven and half hours day ive already scolded two or three saint hill graduates who have left and who all of sudden sat down to grind of auditing of about seven and half hours day and just didnt do anything else didnt really bother to train anybody or try to pick it up or push it through they were just going to audit people audit people audit people audit peoplewell they cant audit enough people to do any good its just spot in the ocean now if you looked around you would find out that there arent on earth at the present moment enough auditors to give enough sessions to enough people to make any significant gain in the society at large in the next century the mathematics are all against it if you never made one more auditor if we just took the auditors we had at this particular moment and everybody audited hammer and tongs seven and half hours day for the next ten years or something like that you add it up and you compare it to the worlds population and you get drop in the bucket its discouragingly small amount and if we never trained another auditor the auditors that had been trained would have long since gone by the boards before they even got halfway through the population of new york city you see the mathematics are dead against it dont think that you with your auditing cannot make change in the society you certainly can you certainly can but you would be making actually taco and pobre society in other words youd be making the society of the rich and the poor the aristocracy and the slaves and so forth it wouldnt help but do that because of course you could pick out people here and there and put them into terrific condition and never fix it up so theyre ever backed up see well theyoh yeah theyve got big zone of influence thats for sure and theyll get things done thats for sure but let assure you they would not all of them be tempered by the peculiarities that i suffer from which is that man should be free not even after youd audited them would they suffer from that peculiarity uniformly let assure you that just wouldnt be done and give it decade give it two decades something like that and they would be starting to get little bit impatient enough victims would have been deposited on their doorstep for them to start erecting the stocks and the whipping posts the next thing you know wed find we had two or three classes of citizen we would have the clear and the slave you know wed divide the whole society up in some kind of line it would just be forced upon us to do this that is actually very dangerous direction in which to proceed because that direction has always led civilizations into decay and chaos there is such thing as successful civilization which is made out of slave masters and slaves i assure you that it is not successful its never been successful and it never will be successful now its attractive and it can be practical but its not successful it has great duration and it doesnt make anybody much happier so this is quite interesting from point of view of long look very few of you ever give long look to scientology you leave that up to to marked degree well thank you but when i look in the crystal ball and look up the line century i can see number of pictures presenting themselves number of aspects of what might come of all this and dont think you can fire shot of this volume and magnitude in planet of this type without creating an effect it might be slow effect just to the degree you see that it is practical its speed actually is determined not by the inertia of the masses but by the efficiency and effectiveness of what youre doing and you cant let go of something like this in society or world of this type or size without having repercussions that dont just go up century theyll be still racketing up the line until this planet is billiard ball now it might become billiard ball sooner than you think but not all of you will forget scientology even if you go to another planet so you see weve never fired this shot silently or without effect you see im not degrading what you yourself as one person can do but if youre going to do the job fully and wholly or do the job effectively then the job will be done rather swiftly and in doing the job relatively fast you save many of the cataclysmic aspects of what might happen because of the entrance upon this scene of scientology in other words the more rapidly you do it the better the job is done its just like auditing pc you see in one pc the world at large you see he is the microcosm and the world is the macrocosm and you see that what is happening to pcyou know that if you audit him slowly and poorly he makes thuhh and he goes duhhh and he gets little bit better and in about two or three days he says well maybe ill make it maybe ill blablablah and all of sudden he doesnt feel so well and so on he didnt get much of result and he slows down and goes into third gear and he puts it all on the back burner and so forth well those fits and starts would be the fits and starts of the track of the civilization in which we live if we did not approach this problem effectively and do it with fair effectiveness and part of that effectiveness is make enough auditors now youre not enough auditors you just arent enough auditors thats all there just arent enough were not against quantitative proposition here particularly but when i say auditor i mean somebody who merely audits you have to combine in your repertoire the ability to train auditors and then youre enough then you become enough auditors dont you see right away just the people in this room would be enough auditors if they trained auditors and providing you did your job superlatively well and you knew how to make an auditor do his job superlatively well you see if you knew that with that kind of progress you would wind up with enough auditors then you could do the job you see that could be done but not otherwise i know i myself at times have felt rather muscular mentally muscularand have stood up baring my breast to the tirades and freakerics of fate and fortune and have said well this is enough justi could do this all by myself you know just standing on my head you know help at all id just do it all by myself thats easy you know i just felt tough that day you know and before noon i didnt feel so tough now in my particular levels of training and background i would have perhaps not necessarily but perhaps more reason than you to believe that i could do the job all by myself see i have done jobs all by myself and they were not necessarily easy jobs now i did get away with them i dont think i could do this one all by myself see different type of job it goes out in terms of longevity it embraces many more lives and beings than anything else thats been attempted in this corner of the universe for very long time well now the better it is done the more rapidly it is done the more effectively it is done why the smoother forward track it will have so therefore you are busy learning to audit you are busy learning to audit and in that you are making progress and thats very very good progress we do not have here the facilities much to train you how to teach auditors but by training you we can certainly give you model and youll know how to handle somebody else when youre training them and maybe youll profit by some of the mistakes we have made but dont try to profit in the direction of being kind dont try to profit in the direction of if we just process him then he will be able to audit dont profit in that direction because theres profit to be had there if hes alive he can audit he walked into the pe course he is longterm christian scientist until he got so many overts on christian science that he became rosicrucianist and then had too many overts against rosicrucianism to remain anything but theosophist and has arrived to prove that scientology doesnt work you can make him audit you could teach him to audit you really could but now were getting to dividing line why that many handicaps on the auditor see why go quite that far afield to teach somebody to audit there are people around you at once in your immediate vicinity that could be taught to audit well and those are the people to put lots of time in on they are the people to put time in on because if you make them very good auditors of course they can make auditors and it is better to haveright now the way were goingit is better to have lot of crackerjack auditors than an awful lot of very mediocre auditors see thats better and you sometimes look over who are you going to spend time on well the natural impulse is to take this bird i just described who has so many overts on christian science that they had to take off into rosicrucianism got so many overts on rosicrucianism that they became theosophist and have wandered in to prove that scientology doesnt work well unfortunately you could make tremendous error and do you know that instructors will do this even an instructor here now and then catches himself fortunately he catches himself doing it hes so outraged by the performance he sees in front of him that he gives that person more time than he gives the apt auditor who needs just little bit more coaching to do very fine job instead of that hell give this total dud you see tremendous amount of time and pressure trying to get them up to high level of mediocrity remember that when youre training auditors take those that are very apt and give them the most time see thats the way to go about it and let the others drift along let them drift along theyve got certain rate of absorption and it isnt that you should let them go you shouldnt let this fellow go oh oh nothing like that see you might downgrade him little bit in the zone or area in which hes being trained but you dont forget about him but he plods along at certain rate and that certain rate has very little to do with anything youre trying to teach him hes just kind of sloggy for anybody to assign the length of time it takes for somebody to learn something is adventurous it cant ever be factual ill give you an experiment in this take one datum and try to teach it to somebody with the old educational processes of the 17th acc those were very interesting processes by the way try to teach him this datum take any datum in scientology say it to him and have him repeat it this is the simplest of all these just say it and have him repeat it you see and say it and have him repeat it and then say it and have him tell you what it is all about you know by giving you an example of it you say it he gives you an example of it that is the wildest thing you ever did with anybody that is quite incredible as simple as this mechanism is it has considerable horsepower and it is very interesting thing i have seen that datum move very tough case by the way that was what was interesting about those educational processes they were very limited in that they didnt move very many cases but they could knock aside this effect proposition on training now i recommend those to you we actually dont have any students bad enough to start chugging in with these educational processes and assign somebody to say datum and hes supposed to say the datum back and then he says the datum and they make an example or any of the combinations of those processes there were about three of them but theyre awfully good for the fellow you have despaired of utterly they are much better than auditing you assign student to teach him with this system you know you of course dont have to use scientology data you can say the cat is black all right now tell the cat is black and the fellow says well there are number of instances i could think of where cat wouldnt be black and you say all right good good but now just tell this one datum cat is black and youll finally get them to actually be able toyou say something they can say something and then the second grade of that is you say something and they can understand it in other words let them duplicate the words and then let them duplicate the understanding you in essence are doing this in training only youre doing it live you see youre doing it all the way you read bulletin and then you go in and see mike of course some of you wish you hadnt but thats all part of the game but look ahere hes not trying to be unreasonable with you hes just trying to get you to do one thingthats the one step of the educational process in essence what is happening is this i have said something to you and then hes trying to find out if you can duplicate it and dont think this isnt therapeutic it is it jolly well is but were not interested in it from therapy line were interested in it from the basis of the communication of datum and you get finally so that you can actually take datum and so on now lets look at this this process has been going on for six months or more with some of the older students here and 3d came out incomplete not well stated just brrrr you know and thats it and they did it at once and got results with it at once in other words it took themoh perhaps 10 minutes to understand it this is length of time to look at it and read it i mean it was that fast you see and they could put it into action and they could do something with it and all of sudden this happened well this doesnt mean that theyve become puppetized it simply means that their ability to duplicate it has now gone over into second stageunderstandbecause of course they werent given any data to duplicate now you look at the original issue of 3d or the original mention of 3d that was given to you why the first mentions of it are just some scribbles in the case histories you know in the case folders the first mentions of it and then theres rather incomplete description of 3d criss cross that doesnt amount to hill of beans and then theres class rumor well what im showing you is there was practically nothing there to duplicate in the way of wording and yet these people had actually gotten to this point where they not only could duplicate the datum that was said to them but they could get what this was and they could understand what this datum was and put it into use now look at that as considerable gain and look at it for just what it is as gain training gain and thats quite remarkable now the comm lag on others who hadnt had that much training has been something on the order of ten days to two weeks to first duplicate the wordingand complain because there wasnt any wording dont you see they were still in step where they had to have the exact words and then finally it took an amplification of bunch of exact words and lot of individual notations in case folders for them all of sudden to do what they were doing and get result and the understanding is dawning see thats slightly different action do you see this as training mechanism do you see where this winds up as training mechanism do you see what its stages are in other words your first gradient of the thing is comprehension of the words this is your first gradient see comprehension of the words now its quite shocking to find that morale is suffering and all sorts of things are going wrong in some hgcs by being made to exactly duplicate bulletin do you see where they are there do you see where they are on the training step it would not matter by the way as far as their ability to learn was concernedlets look this over lets say we were just trying to increase persons ability to learn learning ratethat was the only thing we were trying to increase lets just think of that see it wouldnt matter if we were teaching them automotive assembly books you know manuals used in detroit for the assembly of automobiles to person who is never going to assemble an automobile and has never assembled one and hasnt even played with toy cars see it wouldnt matter if we were doing that or the works progress administration history of socialism and its development in the northern part of arizona you know theres probably volumes of books on that they paid them if they got out some stacks of paper on the works progress administration theyd get somebody who was out of work so they made sure he didnt do any because otherwise he would have been in work and all he had to do was pile up old clippings and papers you see they didnt have to relate to anything and then at government expense they were published between very thick covers in very heavy volumes and they were quite available for while you could get them to hold up corners of desks where the leg was missing you know and they were very useful but they were the most non sequitur nowhere as far as data was concerned you ever cared to cast your eye over we could use that do you see we could use the legal code of the early church of england as interpreted by the catholic church we could i dont care what youre using as long as theres some data stated doesnt matter how much dunnage or how little dunnage as long as theres some data studied is data there to study you would still do this youd still use this as learning rate you see where we are see wed read it off wed have the individual sitting there and we would read it off to the individual this would be the stylized auditor type of approach on this and we would say all the churches of northumbria were deprived of their windows because of window tax which was three and six per window per sabbatical sabbatical thats what it said see and we tell the individual all right say that you know now what did i just say you know and hed say the window taxwindow tax what about window tax is this whats sabbatical mean whats this yeah what book are you reading anyway where did this come from what part of northumbria are you talking about you get all this confusion and youve got an example now of your first step as you try to merely get him to repeat line of sounds you dont even call them words you see he gets tremendous confusion so your first state in which the person is in is one of tremendous data confusion which blows off at any attempt to duplicate data so it blows off at once that theres an attempt to duplicate data on his part he starts blowing off this confusion northumbria what northumbria what sabbatical two and six two and six window tax but who would have been taxing them uhwhowhat tax what is tax was there anybody taxing anybody at that particular time now you get down to the communist level of this we would have had communist cell meeting to discuss whether or not capitalists should exist you see because weve mentioned tax in other words it just would have hung up on some button some place or another and would have come into total collision with this button and from there on we never would have moved off the button this is of tremendous use by the way when youre handling committees you know the art of getting something done through committee has never been perfected this has never been perfected in the history of man if you dont want to get anything done appoint committee and dont put anybody on it who has an individual responsibility for any piece of its work just give it in general to the committee now weve really got malfunction in screaming exclamation points malfunction from here on out well similarly the way you can park any committee or any boardand some of you might want to know this sometime its sometimes of great moment for you not to have something discussed and not permit them to come to any conclusion or pass motion committees being only medium of half thoughtout averages anyway generally will arrive at the wrong decision about most anything you know they havent got much of the data and theyre not really interested and nobody there is responsible and they sort of just want to get rid of it all you know and they get into that state of mind and theyre suddenly discussing something that is very very important point that is going to affect the longevity and management of this company or group and man you just are not about to get something like that the way you want to do this is just introduce any button that will cause them to take zero responsibility just introduce any button that will reduce their responsibility anything it doesnt matter give them restimulative word just do it by symbols you see youre trying to paralyze this committee thats what youre trying to do you see just overtly so they wont make wrong act they say well i dont know shouldnt the pay plan that is being brought up someplace shouldnt the pay planthis pay planmaybe we could check with the guyits being prepared by the accounts department pay plan shouldnt that be thought up by someone pay plan and you say well yes you can just see it now some outrageous damn thing that nobody could put into execution you see nobodys particularly interested in this thing so one of the principal buttons that is used in this is the word study see and that just hangs everybody just introduce study into the thing you see bang and it just hangs the works here and just say well make proposal that the matter be given further study and hit study hard you get it parked right there itll just stop its gorgeous you dont have to introduce like that you can say something well wasnt the last time this type of proposal was proposed wasnt that you know there was fellow by the name of bellham who was just hated throughout the whole organization you see just say this word and everybody went eeeee and so onyou say wasnt that last proposed by bellham everybody of course takes responsibility for it instantly you see and then they will get into discussion about bellham and youre all set but they just derail on button like that and youll see somebody do this youll see it when theyre studying like this this fellows got lots of overts on the sabbath so you say sabbatical hes wondering if this is connected with sabbath and you just get into total discussion of sabbath is it right to have sabbath where was the sabbath originated really wasnt it pagan introduction in the first place and we go on and on and on it has absolutely nothing to do with what were studying hell derail right at that point thats very interesting now youd think this person would have to have lots of auditing to get rid of this there is another system that gets rid of this and that is it sort of teaches him that he can ride past these hung points see that the hung points dont keep him from duplicating and he gradually learns this you see these buttons that hes got really dont keep him from duplicating something see even if its upsetting and he doesnt like it he can still duplicate it and eventually he begins to see duplication in its proper light duplication is duplication it is not running out buttons it is simply duplication it just is itself that is all now you couldnt see at all unless you could duplicate youve got to be able to look down that row of doors or something like that you look down the row of doors and you see that there was row of doors there you can play this on some pcs in processing with the most fantastic results you just say well whats over there along that wall and some fellow will say oh uhuhmust be students lockers those doors dont fit very well at the top do they well they must be some kind of students lockers they were probably put in there for some purpose or another then all of sudden hed say well do you have carpenter working for you what did you ask him you said whats down that wall you see actually all hes got to do is look down the wall and say theres some doors there but he always does it the hard way just watch him at first glance and he will just do it the hard way thats the way it will roll off of this whole operation you ask somebody what is over your head just ask them that sometime what is over your head right now say it very meaningfully so that they really understand that its over their head and you mean now and brother youre going to get some of the most interesting discussions you ever heard of things which are threatening them and so forth well theyre not quite sure some girl says well yes i know my hair looks rather messy but uh you get all sorts of oddball offbeat derailments of the whole thing well whats over your head right now the ceiling of course is whats over your head right now they always manage to miss the obvious and factually it takes lot of drilling before people will observe the obvious and that is all there is to that step is obnosis the observation of the obvious what is in front of your face lust ask somebody sometime who has low havingness and cant reach much just ask that question what is in front of your face of course the obvious answer is you are but you know you can get some of the most conditional and oddball responses you ever want to hear of from simple questions of that particular type well thats because the individual isnt really adding significances into everything its because every time he thinks of something significance plunges in and he thinks hes got to pay more attention to the significance than he pays to what was going on in other words what is happening to him right now you see is less important than what might happen to him or what is coming in on him or the consequences of all of it hes consequencehappy so hes really not in present time at all well when you take this parking button called study people tend to go sort of ummmmm you know on this anyhow and thats very good button to work on because its inflow of data therefore the duplication of data and more important than that just the duplication of the datum spoken you understand im not now saying datum like problem is postulatecounterpostulate im not talking about significant datum im talking about any datum either significant or nonsignificant you could say there is one christmas in year and some people will promptly say well that is insufficiently important of course everybody knows theres one christmas in year youll get all kinds of chitterchatter and so forth the only thing youve asked them to do is repeat this after you what you say you say there is one christmas in year and the person would say of course i know theres onlyany damn fool knows theres only one whatwhat kind of thing is ityou thinkwhat what is this all about and you say well all right good butjustjust lets just repeat this after there is one christmas in year well theres sense in it of course everybody knows that theres one christmas in year and so forth and theyre into the terrible non significance of it you see you stated something sufficiently non significant that they cant do anything about it theres nothing there to attack and they just get terribly disappointed you see you say most men are male you know most men are male or you say women are females women are females well of course we know most women are fewhat are you talking about naturally and so forth naturally of course everybody knows that whatwhat are you saying that for and you will getall of sudden the fellow becomes very curious about you and what your motives are and what your intentions are and what youre trying to do here well its fantastic proposition you just say women are females theres one christmas in year days begin at midnight some people would not realize that you know and theyd say oh really do they and you say well all right but days begin at midnight i just want you to repeat that just days begin at midnight well thats funny thing i never knew that before you see and theyve just flown off into interest see and theyre all stuck on the interest you see and youre just saying days begin at midnight thats what youre supposed to say and the fellow says ah well why should i go into that you know days begin at midnight what are we studying here is this lesson in scientology or about time or is time part of scientology are there any axioms about time oh i see oh i see yes i see the days begin at midnight and itsoh what axiom does that refer to anyway and you say just repeat after days begin at midnight yeah but why you get the whole idea see in other words they have an automatic reflexive mechanism theyre going on total basis of stimulusresponse and nothing else just total stimulusresponse but whats responding the person or bank and this is just another way of digging up thetan eventually you get to point where the thetan responds you say the day begins at midnight he says the day begins at midnight it doesnt bother him any if the day begins at midnight or the day doesnt begin at midnight has nothing to do with it you just say the day begins at midnight he says the day begins at midnight good all right you say christmas comes once year he says christmas comes once year right now people who dont like this and are still enturbulated on it say well youre making slave there you see thats slavery or something like that thats something very deepseated and very significant theres something very significant about this operation if you can get person to do this he of course thereafter is slave see obviouslyexcept the data is never borne out the only time you really get person to talk back sensibly is when he can do this because he can observe what hes talking back about and up to that time you get people talking back about things that arent happening and thats very disconcerting somebody comes in and raises hell with you because of the hussars that are all over the front lawn and you go and look you dont see any hussars on the front lawn and you ask him to go look and see if there are any hussars on the front lawn and he says why should i look i just know and you say well thats fine well lets go look at the front lawn and see if there are any hussars there why should i do that are you doubting my word and now we go off into discussion of whether or not you think he is gentleman do you see the various excursions that we get on this he starts with some unreasonable premise and winds up with an idiocy all youre asking person to be able to do is simply duplicate datum you say christmas occurs once year and he says christmas occurs once year and it doesnt bother him and it doesnt not bother him now at the same time this individual can turn around and do something else which is quite interesting this individual can cause himself to be duplicated so he has brandnew thought all of his own little own and he said im going to paint this house green and he goes out and he says to somebody paint the house green and the person says umhmmmmmm viridian eh just green oh well theres lots of greens you know green theres lots of greens theres lots of types of paint too what paint store do you deal with well i tell you what i will do there is house over in the next county that is painted particular shade of green and we will write them letter and find out what paint company they got the paint from and what shade it was but of course you will have to go over and take look at that house first to find out what color that house really is and youd say i want this house painted just common ordinary runofthemill just green and they will try again they will say some paints dont last as long as others if you can do that you yourself have developed the ability to get yourself duplicated on your own ideas and youd be surprised if you can do this well youd be surprised as your ability rises how the duplication occurs with the greatest of ease you go out and tell somebody to paint it green he pulls color card out of his pocket and says you want this one or this one or this one you want that one thats it all right he goes and gets the paint and he paints the house green does good job of it and thats all fine this cuts down randomity like mad in other words by learning to duplicate you can get into state where you yourself can be duplicated now this is not exactly processing activity this is the process of life and livingness that is most significant and its havingness like mad because you start to have the things that youre surrounded with all right beyond duplication comes understanding understanding comes after duplication not before now how much understanding do you think this fellow did when you said christmas comes once year and he said well why are we taking that up it doesnt seem to have very much to do with the process and so on and so on well youll find out nearly everything hes asking you summates into not understanding or trying to understand youve told him the datum christmas comes once year this is the datum youve told him now he tries like mad to understand that datum and he cant grasp it hell just work himself frantic trying to understand this datum to understand what datum is there understand your motives in trying to get him to understand this datum trying to understand what the datum applies to try to understand why there is nothing there to understand and youll find out most of his oooooooooooooummmm is just some kind of an effort to understand and this is why study is such an important button because thats getting somebody else to understand relieves anybody of any responsibility for understanding every government in the world at the present moment is totally seized with this as mechanism this is their operating mechanism they dont have to understand anything because they can always have it studied you see and that just absolutely stops any progress in committee or anything else youve stopped it instantly and at once you say its going to be otherwise studied so therefore you dont have to duplicate any part of it if its going to be studied you dont have to understand any part of it and therefore all we expect from you is to execute something which you have comprehension of and havent found out in the first place and you get the usual democratic processes when they are totally abused theyre pretty mad see democracy does not work in the absence of understanding it cant work now heres your second thing then if responsibility for understanding depends on personal study and it doeswhy then of course you have raised the persons ability to comprehend or understand not only does christmas come once year but now beyond that point he is capable of understanding and studying christmas and once year and what this refers to now hes capable of finding out that its totally unimportant datum up to that time it might be important it might not be important god help us we never would be able to find out whether it was something we had to know or something that we didnt much care about or something were liable to be shot because we didnt know or something that wed certainly better forget in hurry or something that goes along with the fact that most peoples have shoes the bottoms of the soles of which are dirty you see that so classification of the importance of data is the thing which lies up there as the second step well thats your third step your first is non comprehension non duplication confusion your second one is merely the ability to duplicate and after that we get the ability to comprehend to understand and therefore get the ability to observe judgment lies in that field and this is road to judgment now nobody has really ever bothered to teach anybody judgment before in the last 200 trillion years and youre not going to find much judgment in any bank youve got if there had been much judgment in it you wouldnt have it as bank lets look at that if this valence had been capable of enormous study differentiation and judgment you wouldnt have it as an aberrative valence isnt that so so this has been scarcity on the track so you have here in essence new skill its going to be very difficult to process it into somebody because theyve never had it they were capable of observation once but how did they observe they always put curve on the observation in order to make game out of it or something like that pure observation pure study pure duplication pure comprehension or pure judgment have never been study in the field of philosophy they just dont exist you just will not find these things as subjects of discussion even they are touched on very slightly by the platos and socrates and so forth of yesteryear but just touched on very slightly totally avoided in religions and religious philosophies oh theyre just avoided like mad oh its just like showing them snake spitting in their face you know huuuuh comprehension understanding duplication oh thats what youre not supposed to do and of course we know what the source of all this is the greatest overt there is is enforcing non comprehension thats an overt you dont believe it take somebody sometime you say what have you done oh this girl has got withholds shes got crimes she cant wear any of her frocks because theyre so bloodstained you know she doesnt dare reach into any of her purses because of the asps shes stacked away at one time or another you know she cant even open up her own medicine chest with any feeling of security because of the arsenic coming out you know and we say what have you done and she says done well i ate dinner and you say well what have you withheld i havent withheld anything all right good well what have you done oh i sat down here while ago good well what have you withheld nothing i never withhold anything my life is an open book and you go utterly mad trying to security check this person because you cant find any responsibility on which to hang the security check youve got to increase their responsibility before you can find any withholds theyre there but theyre totally muzzled you see by the irresponsibility of the attitude of the pc you see one of the ways you tell if case is gaining is whether or not its getting more withholds off well thats just way of saying is the case gaining in responsibility yes the case is gaining in responsibility because theyre getting more withholds off werent withholds up to that time but you can take this same person this same girl and you could say what doesnt your family know about oh well that is something else well they dont know that i poisoned joe that i shot pete they dont know anything much about where i hid the body last month they dont know what happened to the children hahaha theyah see and dont know is still button all the way down dont know is still button all the way down and all the way up its button the whole way you can always security check with dont know and not know when overts and withholds are passing right over the pcs head like these orbiting space nights that arent taking off you know see dont know goes all the way so study of notknowingness has been approached by philosophy by two philosophers notably two philosophers one is kant and the other one is spencer theyve concluded that what wasnt known couldnt be known oh how interesting in other words the closest approach philosophy has ever made to dont know or not know has been that you couldnt know thats interesting isnt it so as i tell you there has been road to judgment now for many years ive been trying to teach you characters judgment it has been tough and difficult job judgment on the subject of another being the ability to understand what was going on in session and operating with judgment so as to do the right thing about it now do you know what bars you from judgment its just the notknowingness of it all well wheres the notknowingness of it all come from it begins first with duplication there is the entrance oh of course you could security check it out what dont people know about you and so forth and smarten the guy up end but thats processing approach and were not now talking about processing approach because there is nothing there to process to you see processing processes to what is there see now if thetan ever got himself in bad condition hes invalidated his own judgment hes come off of his own judgment the whole lesson of this universe teaches person not to duplicate just as it teaches him not to communicate you know there are only two crimes in this universe that you have committed and that you have made others guilty of having committed one is being there and the other is communicating those are the two crimes there are other crimes than that being there and communicating now if those two crimes are crimes and those things have been made into crimes then theres only one other thing that you can possibly make up your mind about it person has to learn you might say not really learn but become comfortable with being there and communicating and the way and the route one would take to bring comfort on the subject of being there and communicating would of course be duplication of datum now datum is location which doesnt have to be pinned down datum is location cousin to thetan you know all data is sort of cousin to thetan you know hes an idea he thinks sometimes and hes got ideas and he can communicate ideas you can always put whole stack of ideas into your thetan briefcase and have mass at all so its ideally portable most portable thing in the world is an idea so thetans chased out of here and chased out of there begin to use ideas for location they feel comfortable when they have an idea you known and that idea that they feel comfortable about is an identity even though the identity is mobile they feel more comfortable with an identity than without one because it gives them the sensation of being located they like this so whats the conclusion here the conclusion is that you can learn to have judgment and the way you learn to have judgment is just those two steps duplication of data and pursuant to that understanding theres the duplication the understanding you dont get it this way you dont get understanding and then duplication now what you should know about this is its any data would serve as long as it is data any data classification of the geological formations of the middle east as observed by the geological department serving after the fact of the appointments from the rockmount foundation appertaining only to schists and slides of the lower saudi arabian canyons in 185 volumes folio see thats data you know its wild data you know anamorphic schists are often found most closely blended with hornblende you say to the pc anamorphic schists are most closely blended with hornblende well this would be fascinating situation he would wind up of course with drill he would wind up with an ability to do something and he would also wind up with judgments on the subject of women which i think is marvelous nobody could wind up with that ive been trying all these years its impossible and yet he could by studying the anamorphic schists for the formation of hornblende very interesting now beyond that you cannot go in the teaching of judgment you cannot teach man how he should judge something and still have him judge something you understand that you can teach person data yes by force of beingness in you you can relay communication and understanding to people and they do understand it well ill give you an example of that one acc i did nothing but lecture nobody processed anybody this whole acc and they all had marvelous profile gains i gave them two lectures day and we went over all kinds of data and so on well that was just relay of understanding and comprehension and they felt better and they had bunch of cognitions on the thing and life looked better to them you understand so that was in itself kind of processing that had one of the highest gain accs we ever had which is interesting now this is totally possible and without that possibility of course wed never get anyplace so that possibility natively exists but lets take the other one lets take the other one lets raise level of skill on the subject of judgment just overtly and directly create level of skill on the subject of judgment we would do that by duplication all right whats this amount to here whats this amount to we are doing thisyou do not see how this is working out according to the educational processes of the 17th acc first reason to have withhold from you and so forth is it wasnt realized or rationalized from those directly what youre dealing with right this minute stems from prior understanding to the 17th acc 17th acc is an outcrop of that understanding of how to go about these things nor are you dealing necessarily with preconcerted effort to give you understanding youre not dealing with that either you are dealing accidentally with two different things and one of those things is just the action of understanding and duplication youre dealing with that and at the same time you are dealing only with the data of scientology which you can learn but incidentally the data of scientology is being used to develop in you judgment not on the subject of scientology now you dont notice this because youre learning judgment across pretty high beefy line this is highvoltage line you see so if you can learn judgment off of this line marvelous because this line of all others would tend to destroy your self determinism and judgment wouldnt it yeah youre not given any chance to think what lifes all about my god is there anything else to think about than what life is all about isnt that right well ill give you what life is all about and then you dont have to think about it at all and youre all set and thats it hm well the data is true so therefore it tends to stick right do you know that lot of you unbeknownst to you have run straight through having been taught it and some of you havent noticed that youve gone through having been taught it youve come up on the other side of the thing into realization of it and now you have the realization of it not because youve been taught it but because you realize it and this is what we know as making it your data youve often said this to student but some of you perhaps have not looked too closely on what we mean by make it your data in other words he has to go along the line of duplication of the data to an understanding of the data and with that understanding of the data he has the final step which is the realization totally self determined of the existence of the data and when youre dealing with truth you always have this fourth step you have the ability to realize and to perceive so you have first this thaa what wall dont ask to duplicate anything then you have simple duplication and thats followed by understanding and that is followed by realization or own comprehension so therefore ones own selfdeterminism is restored on such track of course its most rapidly restored on such track by teaching the person the exact truth of something there is the truth of something he is able to duplicate the truth of something after many travails and this truth of something is immediately pursued by the understanding of that something he has been taught you understand that that is stage hes still dependent on you for the understanding of whats been taught and your next stage up is realization which he reached at sudden step up the line on his own bootstraps so to speak he regained an ability to understand and so then he himself could realize thats the route that youre taking that route has total selfdeterminism and otherdeterminism and of course therefore pan determinism all mixed up in it all at one fell swoop the person becomes pandetermined over the data the person can not only understand why they learned the data but why the data was taught to them and understand and realizeof course the realization includes the independent truth of the datum regardless of having been taught the datum and with that of course person has reached high peak of the ability to judge something person then has judgment theres other route that i know of i mean if this is not perfect route all right so it isnt perfect route there is perfect route perhaps there is perfect route but there is perfect route to hand at the moment if this is not perfect route but there is this that it is the first route through to such an end product it certainly is that and it is married in against an entirely different function so you get side play of the same thing that is to say youve got this thing doing two things it wouldnt matterwell your instructor has the horrible idea occasionallyhe says all right now what time span is there in an instant read how soon must the read occur after the thing an instant read i dont know how many answers youve got i wouldnt set it right for worlds not for worlds i wouldnt set it right gives the instructor marvelous opportunity he can say yes but that tape see what does it say on that tape that tape and you say well actually its half second quarter of second fifth of second tenth of second it doesnt matter i mean therethere it is ah but which one is it on that tape well i cant tell you what that tape is it doesnt matter whether its quarter of second half of second fifth of second and so on so on i mean all these answers and so on natter natter natter natter and he says flunk and you go back and snarl and run up whole bunch of overts against and so forth and listen to the tape again and you say well what do you know hang on lets see what was it on that exact tape oh gorblimey i never heard that before twentieth of second twentieth of second kaaa all right and you go in twentieth of second all right thats it now you see itd be totally pedantic and were not doing it on this other system for the instructor to say what are the first seven words in the fifth paragraph of the third bulletin written in 1959 in the month of june see that is just becoming memory contest and if youll notice nearly all study is devoted to memory contests and nobody is asking you to engage in memory contest somebody is asking you to engage in duplication activity if you can duplicate the data your memory will come up sooner or latereven yours its very very horrible some of you first confronting this thing you find it ghastly you find it utterly horrible its the most terrible thing you ever confronted recognize the mechanism youre up against and recognize that not for moment is anybody going to relent on this datum also find out as you go along all of sudden youre able to understand things you werent able to understand before which is all quite peculiar and you possibly have never noticed this but youre now understanding things you never understood before that have to do with other things that have nothing to do with training nothing to do with the subject matter youre training on which is quite amazing you get something going like this why youve made gains in another direction and thats what an auditor has to have an auditor has to have comprehension he has to be able to understand what he is looking at he has to understand what is going on an auditor who gets into this kind of situation is dead one hes lost the pc says ah women are such bore and hes pulled the same gag you might have pulled on the committee as far as the auditor is concerned he said that fatal wordtwo fatal words he said women and bore these things are not compatible outrageous one cant possibly marry up those two words in the same sentence whoever imagined they could become bored with women this is incomprehensible and the auditor just sits there and he starts some kind of natter natter natter interrupt the pc you see women bore women bore what are you talking about and instead of saying tr 4 cheerily and going on with the session he says natter sub natter he does all kinds of things says q and what did you say where are we going what are you doing why why did you say that have you got an engram there whats happening in the thing and so forth in other words the auditor goes into trying to understand do you hear that pc can sometimes put you into trying to understand and youll find yourself having hard time auditing the pc for quite another reason you dont audit pcs by telepathy and this pc isnt talking very much or loudly you see and you say to the pc all right now what is your opinion of women and the pc says ummmummm and you have to say what did you say not to understand what the pc says is misdemeanor of the first water the pc is sort of putting you on point where you are made to think that you dont understand the pc because you cant understand what the pcs saying i remedy this usually quite well pc goestips over is all curled up in ball head is down in the chair mouth totally compressed against the curve of the arm and is saying ummm ummmm and so on i dont risk any arc breaks on my part or theirs i say sit up thats right sit up thats good now speak up and the pc says ummmmmm you say all right now what was that answer again oh women are such bore all right thank you very much you know all right in other words i make the pc communicate to which may be tougher but youll find out that youll run up arc breaks when you dont you pays your money and you takes your chance in other words if you leave him in that condition youre going to have soon youre going to be totally out of comprehension of whats going on with the pc youre also going to feel that you dont comprehend what the pc is doing and therefore you cant observe anything thats happening to the pc and all sorts of things go wild but lets get back on the other thing lets take an auditor who cannot happily duplicate datum non sequitur datum but always insists that he hang up on button and the pc says women are such bore and he knows that this cant exist and he himself has lots of trouble with women and his immediate response is why is women boring what is this and so on and go squabble out of session here youve challenged i dont believe that that hasnt anything to do with this just why did you come to that particular conclusion i dont see what there is in the auditing command that would make you come to that conclusion the pc finally says well it was just cognition and the fellow says well its cognition thats remarkable thing to say when you come to think about it you know its remarkable thing to sayjust cog but the pc says but its just cognition you know i just said it you know he says well all right and the auditor goes on you see and audits him little bit longer and the pc says but all men are stupid when it comes right down to that and stupid you know thats button so the auditor says stupid who oh who who who what didwhat did you say again all men are stupid why did you say that do you have picture there and so forth whats going on i mean have you got an arc break got some withholds are you withholding something is that what youre withholding that all men are stupid just exactly how does this add up and so on and the pc says but its just cognition ii justjustiii just had the idea im sorry im sorry and you then have pc who wont blow anything you have pc who is punished for cogniting you have pc who is punished for auditing and therefore have pc who is punished for getting rid of pieces of the bank and if you audit the pc in that framework the pc will make gain because theyre being taught not to blow anything because they dont ever dare mention anything and theyre made sorry every time they open their mouths because theres comprehension they look up the auditors trying to understand trying to understand trying to hear trying to hear trying to find out what it is what it is what it is where it came from where it came from whadadadadadaif youll justyou dont noyouve got the auditor on trying to comprehend trying to comprehend trying to comprehend and of course you havent got an auditor at that stage who is capable of duplicating what the pc said my god ive heard pcs say some of the most outrageous things you ever heard of in your life now this never startled particularly but once in while i have been startled by something you notice that youre normally most startled by overts or withholds the pc has which pertain immediately and directly to you or to somebody youre close to or like you know youre immediately influenced by these particular overts and withholds well what if the whole sessionsupposing the auditor were in such poor state with regard to duplication that every bit of the auditors auditing was as reactive toward the pc as your sudden rrorrr when the pc has just told you some fantastic lying withhold about you now you know your own startlement when youve heard one of these occasionally well supposing theyre trying to understandwhere did you hear that you know right away youre just yanked out of it sometimes you know he says well ii have withhold ii saw you you say yes what well i saw you up at the corner of the lane up there the other night withwell you know who well who who who you know who who did you see up there with and so forth oh wellwell you know we neednt really go into it well whats this all about where did you hear that i mean did you see that yourself did you see it in person were you there what time was it well did anybody else see it you know youll get caught off base and you will ask more questions about it than you ordinarily would ask about something else thats your effort to try to understand because youre hung up on some kind of button that concerns you intimately do you see that all right now an auditor who cant duplicate runs the whole session in that frame of mind not just things that relate to him but anything that relates to anything the auditor has the same greeting of that the same greeting from the auditor the pc says its been nice day all day the auditor says what what where where where i mean where did you hear that oh you you what today oh youre talking about today not yesterday well i thought it was nice day today too that is this morning early yes lets see what were we talking about oh yes the auditing command was what was the auditing command yesyes have i withheld anything from you all right have i withheld anything from you you watch it man therefore if you get zone or area where the auditors are having one awful time trying to duplicate bulletin what must you also assume that theyve been in there endlessly trying to understand the pc trying to understand the cases being hung up on all kinds of wildball buttons and theyre right down there at the first stage i gave you theyre in that stage see if their morale is going down because they cant pass any bulletin tests you would know at once how theyve been handling pcs do you see that so duplicative training is absolutely essential and it is successful now you can make up your mind to that now what ive talked to you about you may or may not have found very burningly interesting naturally it doesnt apply to you personally but in training auditors you should know it the baptism of fire that causes people to look so pale and so drawn under the thing is for instance duplicating under resentment see they go through all kinds of emotional bars on this particular thing learn like mad but its all resented like mad you see because uhhhhh it couldnt possibly beuhrrhhh and so on well they pass through that one too but sometimes you see student here who goes around for the first two or three weeks and they get paler and paler and shadowier and shadowier more and more holloweyed more and more gaunt things looking worse and worse or they look more and more apathetic you can hear them the way they start up their cars and things you can hear about how new student is going you know at first why they start up their cars in sort of puzzled way and then they start up car you know very angrily indeed you see you can hear the gears crash about three times as they get up the drive you know and then eventually they wander up the driveway running into both sides of the verge you know about what state they have reached and so on thats all done by training and it is not the route of processing dont consider it processing route it is just route by training because it is new skill you very often have been asked in the past to memorize the structural components of mark vii space vessel with gyro rotators complete all number parts im sure youve had to do something like this im sure you have had at some time or another and the funny part of it is you wound up at the other side being able to look at the space vessel and on the other side of that somebody says to you oh well these mark viis these mark viis they theythey sure fly low and they sure fly slow mark viis do you say you dont really understand this ship you know you dont understand how to run one when you first get them into the outer area of an atmosphere you see you turn on the coolers you see at that moment see you dont slow them down as you come in just turn on the coolers way out there you see so that you supercool the whole hull you see thats the way you really handle these things and then you come in hit the atmosphere on skip always hit it on 8 skip the first time you see and then sort of smush in you know with everything super cooled come in fast dont lose your speed youre all right you see and then have your counterblasters in excellent condition so that when you come down toward the surface and that sort of thing right at the exact properand so as not to waste any fuelthese mark viis you really have to pour that blaster to it and if you pour it to it very suddenly and very quickly you stop you see and then you land all right and the reason theyre having crashes with them is they just dont understand them and somebody comes out and watches you land mark vii you dont land one that way at all but you sure understand one you understand how to land one but every time you land mark vii you land it entirely differently than at any other time you ever landed mark vii you never land mark vii the same way twice yet you always land them and they never crack up and everything is fine you got the idea but you never drive the same ship the same way two days consecutively running thats because you understand it routine and rote in other words are poor substitute for understanding and the place im trying to get you to is place where you can process by realization process by comprehension process by the exercise of judgment if i can get you to that point i will have considered it very well worth doing matter ow eroic it has been on the way thank you
