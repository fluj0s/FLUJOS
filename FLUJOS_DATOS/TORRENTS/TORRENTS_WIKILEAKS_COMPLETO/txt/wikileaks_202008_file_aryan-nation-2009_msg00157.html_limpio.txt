bay132w23e5ff46cd1dbdc1d0177fdb5e0phxgbl sealsendtime sat 22 dec 2007 234732 0500 ok rich sorry about the phone call went celebrating the holidays with free bottle of very tasty scotch i should know i finished it talked to gerald again looks like we should get something going also i can send you phone number of someone that can assist on your website and i can also lend you someone that will respond to emails within 24 hours of each request here is the current situation as far as gerald and i discussed so far i did not discuss everything with him so if you speak to him see what he thinks 1 the aryan nations should be centralized idaho and churches founded should be named separately but stay under the banner church of jesus christ christian idaho north west b church of the messiah new york north east c church of the sons of light arkansas south east d church of jesus christ california possibility south west eventually we should regionalize central zones like michigan and texas church i have possibilities in austria spain italy this can regionalize the us and allow outposts to begin and each will have qualified quadrant leader leadership changes 1 high council delegation of 5 that reviews activity and is advisory to the director 4 of 5 vote would remove the director the director has free hand on minor matters three pastors from the spiritual leadership council must always be part of this 2 national director someone from the past that is not involved with either party like charlie juba or drew bostwick someone that has an excellent political track record these are possibilities if you have any ideas its all open myself or pastor obrien should not be selected 3 minister of information not part of the political machine an appointment someone responsible for answering emails phone calls operating bookstore woman would be fine 4 treasurer should be obrien collect the mail process the orders to the information dept delegate funds andor mailings from central office spiritual leadership council the identity ministry is anarchy people preach whatever they want from ufos to hollow earth council of pastors will review beliefs and performance of the practitioners consists of world chaplain responsible for the radio ministry and public releases others can contribute but responsibility lies on the world chaplain synod 4 other pastors that review activity advisory and research ranks world chaplain senior pastors biblical priests law 30 years of age with 3 years of proven study would prefer 6 years junior pastors those allocated the title of pastor with less than 6 years study or are under 30 years of age so there should be three public persons at all times national director world chaplain minister of information we can supply the following identity materials radio program womens org we have response team for the internet but mailing address yet bookstore and tapecd program i think that my people would be more interested in operating the spiritual leadership council let think about this some more one thing that i can assure you i have allot of experience operating large organizations i know how to do it and within 60 days i will bet money that we double in size i will pick up one penny from jew york sidewalk and you must find one outside synagogue there for this bet i have web materials going back 8 years so we can provide much this is important because everyone that looks at your website sees little and your webguy never responds to emails it was over 4 months before obrien called he had idea that i wrote you in june cincinatus clause consideration i will coordinate operations in the beginning it is very important that rapid response quality personnel and efficiency are what people get for contacting us slouching the high council must take over and maintain the operations of the organization once established i will be more than happy to be advisory only for organizational things i am pastor this is what i want to do so the spiritual leadership thing is more my piece of cake operating an organization interferes with the ministry it always has and always will more next email consider these possibilities original message from r s to jay faber sent friday december 21 2007 221 pm subject meeting greetings jay i will contact you after the holidays i need to talk with council and see where
