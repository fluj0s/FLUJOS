transnational organized crime presents serious threat to us national security and global stability organized criminal groups have benefitte d from the demise of legal structures following the collapse of the soviet union and in many failed states they have been able to expand their ne tworks across national borders globalism serves these groups which increasingly re ly upon advanced technology and the global financial system to accumulate wealth from their illicit activities these gr oups engage in wide array of criminal activities across national borders that include the illicit drugs trade trafficking in persons alien smuggling and financial crimes these transnational crimes directly threaten american communities and businesses experts also warn of the potential opportunistic links between such cr iminal groups and terrorist organizations the recent decrease in st atesponsorship and support may lead terrorist groups to increas ingly rely upon transnational criminals for finances

which emerge from transnational organized crime and describes the us g overnment response to combat global crime it outlines the overall framework of us policies formulated to combat transnational

threats to us interests for the sake of their own profits there is single accepted definition of transnational organized crime in 1994 researchers defined transnational crime to include offences whose inception prevention andor direct or indirect effects involve more than one country6 other experts suggest that transnational or ganized crime involves any concerned or organized group of people which continuously practices its criminal activity and whose main goal is to make profit ever ywhere without refere nce to national state boundaries7 us law defines organized crime as transnational threat to the national security of the united states8 transnational organized crime thrives especially in nations where law enforcement institutions are weak money laundering and corruption are rampant and citizens have few viable econo mic alternatives following the collapse of the soviet union for example transnational criminal groups took advantage of the decline of government institutions reduction in border controls and resurgence of ethnic and regional conflicts in the states of the former soviet union and easter europe to expand their criminal activities and networks across national borders

based in north america western europe china colombia israel japan mexico nigeria and russia will increasingly form networks with each other to expand their criminal activities14 threats to the united states experts caution that measuring the true extent of transna tional organized crime is difficult because the clandestine nature of criminal activity means that much of the crime is unreported in so countries law enforcemen t officials manipulate data to produce selfserving reports15 another challenge for those trying to get complete picture are the differences in criminal penal codes and definitions of crime despite these challenges there is consensus that transnational organized crime has grown dramatically the us governments international crime threat assessment has been developed by an interagency working group to provide various measures of global crime the latest assessment released in december 2000 concludes that the most significant areas of criminal activity include 1 terrorism and drug trafficking 2 illegal immigration and trafficking in pers ons 3 trafficking of products across international borders 4 economic trade crimes and 5 financial crimes16 from this and

forced into bondage can keep paying returns to the criminal organization24 so trafficking in persons can generate both short and long term profits organized smugglers also make s hortterm profits from

have political motivation some criminal orga nizations have used terrorist attacks against foreign governments to disrupt investigations eliminate effective law enforcement officials coerce judges into mo re lenient sentencing policies and create an environment conducive to more crimin activity in contrast terrorist organizations usually engage in organized criminal activity aside from terrorism only to support themselves financially36 because terrorists view crime as means to political end drug trafficking investigations37 reveal that 14 of the 36 designated foreign terrorist organizations38 engage in narcoterrorism often in alliance with other traffickers39 much like transnational organized crime there is formal definition of narcoterrorism the department of defense dod

criminal activities on american communities and businesses us policymakers also have to concentrate on ot her national security threats following september 11 2001 federal agencies have re structured their programs and resources to focus on the war on terrorism analysts who criticize the level of federal spending on counterterrorism programs compared to other anticrime efforts argue that the economic losses from terrorist attacks are small by comparison to transnational crimes such as drug trafficking however other analysts warn policymakers that psychological and political costs in ddition to direct economic losses are potentially enormous and unquantifiable some analysts have criticized the tendency for law enforcement officials to use terrorist criminal and insurgent to define the same person or organization for example the dea calls pablo escobar narcoterrorist both drug trafficker and terrorist69 some agencies are suspected of using the terrorism nexus to receive additional funds for progra ms related to transnati onal crime under the guise of counterterrorism experts argue that some of the same vulnera bilities in the global financial system allow both terrorist and criminal organizations to pursue their illegal activities coordinated law enforcement and intelligence approach that targets key vulnerabilities may effectively combat both groups what if any performance measures are in place to monitor the effectiveness of federal programs related to transnational crime following gao inquiry an ns c official revealed that performance measurement system envisioned under the 1998 internati onal crime control st rategy was never established because individual agencies were given discretion to devise and implement their own measurement systems70 analysts urge agencies to establish system to measure the effectiveness of th eir transnational crime control programs such mechanism may provide an agency some flexibility to adapt its strategies and program activities agency officials may argue that performance measures are hard to formulate because of the challenges associated with obtaining accurate international criminal data another challenge for agencies is to establish uniform system across programs to measure the overall impact on transnational crime some observers propose developing network similar to the department of justices organized crime and drug forcement task force ocdetf which coordinates federal law enforcement effort s to combat national and international organizations that cultivate process and distribute illicit drugs whereas ocdetf focuses on drug trafficking parallel task force could focus on other forms of trafficking that involve tran snational criminal organizations this task force could also expand its network overseas to include foreign law enforcement and intelligence officials in pursuing major investigations are benefits associated with increase overseas presence of us law enforcement and intelligence offici als worth the corresponding risks some experts support the increased overseas presence of fbi dea and other federal agents in an effort to gain cooperati on from foreign law

supported for their overseas military operations to pursue counternarcotics ac tivities other experts remind policymakers that objections to american presence have provoke d terrorist attacks in the past for example in 1993 osama bin laden trai ned the somali tribesmen who ambushed us peacekeeping forces in somalia71 in 2003 leftist gu errillas in colombia kidnaped three american cont ractors and according to j ournalist have killed four american contractors since 200272 would increased participation in multilateral institutions help or hinder us criminal investigations some observers propose that the united states build additional international law enforcement networks because transnational c ooperation supports domestic investiga tions intelligence gathering and helps to develop worldwide strategy to combat transnati onal crime proponents ar gue that multilateral institutions can develop international standards for documentation requirements eg passports bills of lading among nations and efficient mechanisms to identify fraudulent documents that fac ilitate criminal activities others are concerned about possible complications that might arise from the sharing of law enforcement techniques and intelligence with foreign governments organized criminal groups invest in the corruption of government fficials in several countries in order to weaken law enforcement institutions that would otherwise undermine their activities furthermore some experts believe multilateral organizations are not very effective while participation is timeconsuming and
