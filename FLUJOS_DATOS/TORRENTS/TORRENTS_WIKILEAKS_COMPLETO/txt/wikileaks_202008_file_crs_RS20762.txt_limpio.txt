amendment issues henry cohen legislative attorney american law division summary media projections may be based both on exit polls and on information acquired as to actual ballot counts the first amendment would generally preclude congress from prohibiting the media from interviewing voters after they exit the polls it apparently would also preclude congress from prohibiting the media from reporting the results of those polls congress could however ban voter solicitation within certain distance from polling place and might be able to include exit polling within such ban it also might be able to deny media access to ballot counts either when the polls have not closed in the jurisdiction whose votes are being counted or when the polls have not closed across the nation when the media project the winner of an election before the polls close some people who otherwise had planned to vote might decide not to vote if enough such people would have voted against the projected winner then their decision not to vote could affect the result in the election media projections then might indirectly affect the outcome of an election and some have suggested that congress therefore ban them media projections may be based both on exit polls and on information acquired as to actual ballot counts completed up to the time of the projections the first amendment would preclude congress from prohibiting the media from interviewing voters after they exit the polls at most congress might be able to include exit polling within more general prohibition on voter solicitation within certain distance from polling place we consider this point in section ii of this report the first amendment apparently would also preclude congress from prohibiting the media from reporting the results of exit polls congress therefore apparently could not ban media projections outright could congress however deny media access to ballot counts either when the polls have not closed in the jurisdiction whose votes are being counted or when the polls have not closed across the nation could it in other words prohibit governmental officials who are counting votes from releasing election results we consider that question in section iii of this report congressional research service the library of congress crs2 i banning media projections media projections are speech and the first amendment provides that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press it is possible however though by means certain that congress could limit the right of broadcast radio and television stations to report election result projections this is because the supreme court citing spectrum scarcity ie the limited number of available broadcast frequencies has permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than of speakers in other media turner broadcasting system v federal communications commission 512 us 622 637 1994 but to restrict broadcast radio and television but not cable television and the internet would seem to go only small way toward banning media election projections statute that restricted speech of media other than broadcast radio and television if challenged would be subject to strict scrutiny by the courts this means that the courts would uphold it only if the government proves that it is necessary to promote compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest sable communications of california inc v federal communications commission 492 us 115 126 1989 would there be compelling interest in prohibiting media projections though there might be compelling interest in preventing the media from interfering with elections so as potentially to affect the outcome it seems questionable whether election projections if they are understood by potential voters to be merely projections could be said to interfere with elections voters who hear or read such projections presumably know that they are only projections and that their votes could still make difference in the election if they decide that that difference is not significant enough to make it worth their while to vote then they have made free choice the supreme court has written in another context the first amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good 44 liquormart inc v rhode island 517 us 484 503 1996 if there is concern that some potential voters might be misled by projections to think that the winner of an election has been determined then congress might be able to require that disclosures accompany projections although the first amendment protects the right not to speak as well as the right to speak the courts might view compelled disclosures in this case as serving compelling interest in protecting the right to vote in the seemingly unlikely event that court were to find compelling interest in prohibiting media election result projections then the government would still have to show that there was less restrictive means to further that interest making this determination would entail consideration of other proposals to deal with the perceived problem ii banning exit polling within prescribed distance from the polls the purpose of legislation banning exit polling within prescribed distance from the polls would be to make exit polling more difficult in burson v freeman 504 us 191 1992 the supreme court upheld tennessee statute that prohibited the solicitation of crs3 votes and the display or distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance to polling place the court recognized that this statute both restricted political speech to which the first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application and barred speech in quintessential public forums the use of which for assembly and debate has from ancient times been part of the privileges immunities rights and liberties of citizens id at 196 197 further the statute restricted speech on the basis of its content as it restricted political but not commercial solicitation and therefore was not facially contentneutral time place or manner restriction id at 197 the court therefore subjected the tennessee statute to strict scrutiny which means that it required the state to show that the regulation serves compelling state interest and is necessary to serve the asserted interest id at 199 although applying strict scrutiny usually results in statutes being struck down in this case the court concluded that state has compelling interest in protecting voters from confusion and undue influence and in preserving the integrity of its election process id or more simply in preventing two evils voter intimidation and election fraud id at 206 the next question then was whether 100foot restricted zone is necessary to serve this compelling interest the court noting that all 50 states limit access to the areas in or around polling places said that though it would not specify precise maximum number of feet permitted by the first amendment 100 feet is on the constitutional side of the line id at 206 211 in daily herald co v munro 838 f2d 380 9th cir 1988 decided prior to burson the ninth circuit struck down washington statute that prohibited exit polling within 300 feet of polling place the court granted that states have an interest in maintaining peace order and decorum at the polls and preserving the integrity of their electoral processes id at 385 but the court found that the statute is not narrowly tailored to advance that interest because it prohibits nondisruptive as well as disruptive exit polling id moreover the statute is not the least restrictive means of advancing the states interest the statute is unnecessarily restrictive because another washington statute already prohibits disruptive conduct at the polls and that several other less restrictive means of advancing this interest exist for example reducing the size of the restricted area requiring the media to explain that the exit poll is completely voluntary requiring polling places to have separate entrances and exits or prohibiting everyone except election officials and voters from entering the polling room id this reasoning of the ninth circuit may longer stand after the supreme courts decision in burson as for the statutes being unnecessary because another statute already prohibited disruptive conduct the court in burson found that intimidation and interference laws ie laws that prohibit only disruptive conduct fall short of serving states compelling interests because they deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts to impede elections 504 us at 206207 as for there being less restrictive means to preserve the integrity of the electoral process the court in burson did not require the state to provide factual finding to determine the necessity of its restrictions on speech 504 us at 222 stevens j dissenting rather it found that the link between ballot secrecy and some restricted zone surrounding the voting area is common sense id at 207 but the plaintiffs in munro also argued that the statute is unconstitutional for another reason that the stated purpose for the statute of protecting order at the polls was pretext and that the states true motive was to prevent the media from broadcasting crs4 election results before the polls closed id at 386 the court found that assuming that at least one purpose of the statute was to prevent broadcasting early returns the statute is unconstitutional because this purpose is impermissible general interest in insulating voters from outside influences is insufficient to justify speech regulation id at 387 in addition the court said even if this were permissible purpose the statute is not narrowly tailored to protect voters from the broadcasting of early returns election day broadcasting is only one use to which the media plaintiffs put the information gathered from exit polling id at 387388 the information is also used to analyze the results of elections and prohibiting exit polling prohibits speech involving such other uses of the information reading munro together with burson suggests that congress could prohibit the solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet or some other reasonable distance of the entrance to polling place but could not prohibit exit polling for the purpose of preventing voters from receiving media projections any limit on exit polling would seem permissible only to the extent it could be justified as part of general restriction on interfering with voters before they vote in burson the court found that the tennessee statutes restriction could be limited to voter solicitation and need not restrict other types of speech such as charitable and commercial solicitation or exit polling within the 100foot zone 504 us at 207 but the court did not say that statute could not also restrict other types of speech if it could demonstrate that doing so was necessary to serve compelling governmental interest postburson court of appeals case found greater justification for restricting campaigning than for restricting exit polling because while there is evidence of widespread voter harassment or intimidation by exitpollers there is evidence that poll workers do create these problems schirmer v edwards 2 f3d 117 122 5th cir 1993 cert denied 511 us 1017 1994 the court distinguished munro on this basis and upheld 600foot campaignfree zone iii banning media access to ballot counts if congress could not ban media projections outright could it prohibit government officials from releasing ballot counts to the media could congress that is deny media access to ballot counts either when the polls have not closed in the jurisdiction whose votes are being counted or when the polls have not closed across the nation the purpose of restricting access in the latter case would be to prevent potential voters in states in western time zones from being influenced by learning the results in states in eastern time zones the first amendment the supreme court has written goes beyond protection of the press and the selfexpression of individuals to prohibit government from limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may draw free speech carries with it some freedom to listen in variety of contexts this court has referred to first amendment right to receive information and ideas crs5 richmond newspapers inc v virginia 448 us 555 575576 1980 nevertheless although news gathering is not without its first amendment protectionsbranzburg v hayes 408 us 665 707 1972 these protections are not generally as great as are protections from censorship the court has held that the first amendment does not prevent prison officials from prohibiting facetoface interviews between press representatives and individual inmates pell v procunier 417 us 817 819 1974 in so holding the court did not find it necessary for the government to establish compelling need to justify the prohibition as the government in the ordinary case must to justify statutes that censor speech rather the court balanced first amendment rights against governmental interests such as the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system and internal security within the corrections facilities taking into account available alternative means of communication id at 824 822 823 furthermore the court wrote although the first amendment bars the government from interfering in any way with free press it does not require government to accord the press special access to information not shared by members of the public generally id at 834 833 if congress enacted statute prohibiting the release of ballot counts and it were challenged as unconstitutional the court presumably would apply the sort of balancing test it used in pell v procunier to reach decision it would assess the importance of denying media access to ballot counts perhaps considering whether media projections or learning the results in other states tend to mislead potential voters or whether potential voters are merely making free choices about the importance of their vote in light of status of the election at the time they hear media projection or the result in another state court might also evaluate the efficacy of prohibiting the release of ballot counts considering for example whether if denied access to ballot counts the media might nevertheless make projections based merely on exit polls which might be more misleading than those based on ballot counts finally court might consider whether congress could accomplish its goal by alternative means that would restrict speech less an example might be to require that projections be accompanied by disclosure of the information on which the projection is based iv concluding note whether or not there is first amendment barrier to banning exit polling within prescribed distance from the polls or to prohibiting the release of ballot counts there is still the question of congresss power to regulate in this area congress has clear power to regulate house and senate elections but less clear power to regulate presidential elections aspects of which the constitution vests in the states for additional information on this subject see crs report rl30747 congressional authority to
