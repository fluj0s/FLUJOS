aid restrictions on international criminal court icc member countries that have not signed agreements exempting us citizens from icc prosecution have prompted policymakers to alter the policy somewhat latin america has been at the forefront of that reassessment in particular some negative consequences for us relations with latin america have occurred as result of iccrelated sanctions restrictions on military training aid have resulted in dramatic decline in the number of latin american military personnel receiving training in the united states similarly restrictions on economic aid have hindered the ability of us democracy and rule of law programs to work with governments in the region esp ecially in the andean countries although most members of congress still s upport efforts to shield us citizens serving abroad from icc prosecution many are beginning to oppose the use of sanctions to attempt to pe rsuade countries to sign bilateral immun ity socalled article 98 agreements some members of congress advocate ending all icc related aid restrictions while others believe that at l east some restrictions should remain in place in order to encourage othe r countries to sign

department spokesman sean mccormack w the us government fully support bringing to justice those responsible for crimes and atrocities th at have occurred in darfur we are at point in the pro cess where we could call upon the sudanese government to cooperate fully with the icc6 other analysts remain skeptical about whether fundamental shift in us polic towards the icc is occurring and believe

fundamental objections to the proposed courts jurisdiction led the united states to vote against the rome statute the united states primary objections to the rome statute focus on the iccs possible assertion of jurisdiction over us soldiers who could be charged with war crimes resulting from legitimate use of force or us ci vilians who could be charged for conduct related to carrying out us foreign policy initiatives accordingly the united states has sought immunity provisions through the security council for authorized peacekeeping operations and has pursued bilateral agreements with

asserted that the loss of imet is severing an important linkage between future military leaders from the region learning aboutthe us model of civilian control of the milita ry reduced opportunities in the united states he added may lead countries in the region to look elsewhere including china russia or venezuela for training similarly esf restrictions may hamstring both us bilateral and regi onal efforts to push desperately needed structural reforms especially in the andean countries18 another analyst asserted that the implementation of aspa has damaged u s standing in the region and that the effort to punish countries that dont sign article 98 agreements has been perceived as bullying or armtwisting19 the witnesses suggested several ways to mitigate the possible negative consequences of aspa on latin ameri ca and the caribbean those suggestions included encouraging the bush administration to issue national interest waivers to key allies in latin america or declare more countries in the region to be major non nato allies thereby exempting them from the aid restrictions another suggested option would be to repeal section 2007 of the aspa and omit the nethercutt provision from 2007
