for iraq as average the programme was adequately managed and the majori ty of key controls were being applied the recording and monitoring of expenditure against budgetary provisions was affected by certain deficiencies in the legacy systems fmis and purund which the iraq support unit isu mitigated by maintaining detailed subsidiary records human resources salaries and travel costs the expenditure data on payroll and travel that or iginated from unog and was incorporated in fmis provided only limited information conseq uently it was not possible to match the us 5 million in salary payments to the individ ual staff members either by name or index number or any other unique identifier in fmis and b to match over us 2 million in travel expenditure recorded in fmis to the travel authoris ations or to the individual staff members isu concurred with oios and stated that it was diff icult to obtain accurate and updated expenditure data which was required for donor repo rting nonetheless to address some of the systemic deficiencies isu maintained additiona l records in order to be able to meet reporting requirements oios has been informed that system deficiencies are being addressed by msrp financial management about 50 per cent of the total expenditure or us 2 5 million was reported against unspecified subitem z99999 oios subsequently found that about us 135 million related to of procurement and another us 10 millio n related to salaries and travel and other administrative expenses through various entities i nter alia unog nevertheless such incorrect recording in the legacy financial systems prevented meaningful expenditure analysis the finance section explained that qua lity control mechanism is now in place to ensure expenditure recording in msrp is in line

warehous in jordan iran and turkey oios assessed that isu had established satisfactory cont rols over the procurement storage receipt distribution andor redeployment of these items considering that over us 13 million of relief item s are still held in warehouses in the middle east unhcr should explore the possibilities of rec ording these items in the inventory module of msrp this may be good

headquart ers in geneva the audit was conducted in accordance with the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing promulgated by the institute of internal auditors nd adopted by the internal audit services of the united nations organizations 2 unhcr was prepared to meet the needs of an expected outflow of iraqis to neighbouring countries in early 2003 by the end f the first quarter of 2003 unhcr and the international federation of red cross and red c rescent societies had stockpiled relief items to meet the needs of 600000 refugees reg ional approach was adopted and unhcr prepositioned supplies and equipment in strategic l ocations like amman and aqaba in jordan kermenshah and ahwaz in iran and iskenderun in turk ey unhcr worked closely with the governments in the region unhcr also deployed eme rgency preparedness and response teams in all the countries in the region 3 the largescale population movements into n eighbouring countries ultimately did not take place unhcr started however concentrating on protecting refugees within iraq as their living conditions had deteriorated considerab ly also unhcr planned for the return of uprooted iraqis from within the region and from oth er places as the security situation remained unstable and shortterm socialeconomic pr ospects were not promising unhcr did not promote largescale return to iraq but was prepared to assist voluntary orderly and gradual returns 4 following the attack on the offices in b aghdad on 19 august 2003 international staff were withdrawn and offices were established i n amman and kuwait to support the national staff and the implementing partners that w ould shoulder the responsibilities to manage the programme inside iraq 5 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 13 may 2004 draft audit report detailing the audit fin dings and recommendations was shared with the director of the bureau of caswaname in june 200 4 the comments which were received in july 2004 are reflected in the final report the bureau has accepted most of the audit recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial information safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations rules and policies 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on the 2003 special progr amme in iraq with expenditure of us 516 million budget us 62 million unhcrs expe nditure was us 295 million in the first phase sb1 january to june 2003 which rela ted to programme preparedness to address possible exodus of iraqi refugees to countries in the region the second phase sb2 july to december 2003 mainly related to voluntary repat riation of iraqi refugees to iraq and their reintegration inside iraq the total expenditure i n the second phase was us 221 million 8 oios reviewed the activities of the iraq pport unit isu of the bureau for central asia south west asia north africa and the middle east caswaname our review concentrated on the procurement of relief items and assets costing about us 16 million during the preparedness phase and programme support costs such as salaries over us 5 million and travel of staff members over us 2 llion for the entire supplementary programme our review also covered the monitoring and administration of the programme by the bureau oios did not undertake any field missi ons for this audit nor did we assess the substance of the activities 9 the audit activities included review and an assessment of the internal control systems established interviews with staff analysi s of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations financial data recording 10 the overall financial information for the programme is provided below millions of us dollars disbursements commitments total sb1 2820 130 2950 sb2 1380 830 2210 4200 960 51 60 it was difficult to ascertain how much was disburse d on relief items assets and other programme costs for the supplementary programme as extracting critical information from the unhcrs legacy systems fmis and purund was co mplex furthermore the financial data from these two systems varied and it was diffi cult to reconcile the data separately recorded on them oios hopes that with the implemen tation of msrp these difficulties will be resolved 3 11 the following table provides an overview f the us 516 million expenditure by sector millions of us dollars sector disbursed budgeted domestic needshousehold support 760 690 instalments to implementing partners 670 shelterother infrastructure 620 1620 salaries 490 600 transport and logistics 460 800 agency operational support 330 890 acquisition of

5160 6170 12 from the expenditure recorded of us 42 llion unhcr offices and unhcr headquarters spent us 295 million various imple menting partners expended the balance of us 125 million 13 isu and the finance section stated that most of the financial reports from the implementing partners had been received and that th outstanding instalments of us 67 million had also been cleared since the end of 2003 an analysis of the disbursement at the subitem lev for example tents stoves and vehicles disclosed that us 32 million or 78 per cent of ex penditure was recorded under unspecified code z99999 of this outstanding instalments to implementing partners the only type of disbursements which should have been recorded under z99999 amounted to us 7 million the bulk of the balance related to procurement us 135 million and salaries and travel expenses us 10 million the p ractice of charging unspecified is not only misleading and incorrect it also prevents any meani ngful expenditure analysis oios considers that these expenses should have been reco rded under appropriate subitems to reflect the actual implementation and to provide better overview of the programme the bureau accepted that there was problem but under fmispurreq when processing payment only the sectoractivity code is required and therefore the system did not allow the bureau to specify the budget code at the subitem l evel the finance section explained that these deficiencies had now been resolved in msrp an d that quality control mechanisms had been put in place to ensure that the use of unspec ified subitem code is restricted to outstanding instalments to partners and not for ot her transactions oios will review this issue as part of its overall audit of msrp b accounting for staff cost and travel cost 14 according to iom1895 and fom1795 of 1 march 1995 titled headquarters and field staff travelling on official mission for pe riod of more than two months for all missions of duration of less than two months the requesting country or bureau will normally be required to meet the costs of travel an d dsa for missions of two months or 4 longer the full salary of the staff member concerne d must also be charged to the location benefiting from the mission 15 this policy was reiterated in 2004 in iom fom0122004 titled special operations approach payments of solar accordingly when staff member on travel status remains in the special operations area soa beyond 60 days the salary of that staff member must be charged to the operation this is i n addition to all the travel costs such as dsa and hazard allowance which are charged to the b udget of the operation from the first day the staff member is on travel status in the soa if the staff member is siba staff in between assignments hisher salary and other rela ted costs must be charged to the operation from day one 16 the isu confirmed that the above guideline s were used for accounting for the staff costs for the iraq operations isu also provided l ists of staff travel and staff appointed and had estimated the staff costs by compiling informat ion from different sources this information was used for the internal monitoring of programme expenditure salaries 17 oios found that the total salaries charged to the supplementary programme amounted to us 486 million us 365 million and us 121 million in the first and second phase respectively our review of the unhcr administra tive projects for the iraq operations 700 and 800 series projects programme support and adm inistration that corresponded to the 15 digit administrative budget code used for accountin g for salaries etc disclosed the following head2right from the expenditure recorded in fmis it was impos sible to identify most of the staff members because neither the staff members name r index number was recorded on the voucher head2right some of the personnel actions initiated by the divi sion of human resources management dhrm did not provide any allotment cod for salary payment head2right unhcrs budget section sometimes made adjustment tries in fmis to change allotment codes to reflect staff movements like sion to soas and reassignments review of these adjustment entries provided littl information on the staff members involved travel costs 18 oios found that us 216 million was spent on official travel us 1 million and us 116 million in the first and second phases res pectively isu provided list of staff members and copies of the travel authorisations for staff who were authorised to proceed on mission to the soa however most of the names on the isus mission list could not be traced to fmis due to lack of transparency since the travel costs recorded could not be identified to staff member or travel authorisat ion example adjustment voucher f8360 of 30 november 2003 for us 131180 transferring trave l costs from sb1 to sb2 19 oios noted that the bulk of the less infor mative data personnel and travel related expenditure in fmis was recorded through unog as result of the deficiencies in data 5 recording the reconciliation of differing sources f information was difficult for example head2right the reconciliation of payroll information to fmis consequently the salaries paid to staff member as recorded in fmis could not be tra ced back or matched to the staff members listed in staffing table and viceversa head2right the travel expenses recorded in fmis particularly the travel authorized by headquarters could not be identified to staff mber or travel authorisation head2right the salaries and related costs and travel costs of staff member could not be matched or compared with the services rendered for example missions undertaken 20 as result oios was unable to obtain ass urance that head2right all the staffing and travel related expenses charge d to the iraq programme were legitimate complete and related to the staff membe rs who worked on the iraq supplementary programme head2right staffing and travel related costs for the iraq supp lementary programme were not charged to other programmes head2right the salaries and travel related costs charged to th iraq supplementary programme were in conformity with the policies spelt out by t he above iomfoms 21 oios is aware that the deficiencies mentio ned above are not limited to the iraq supplementary programme but are an organizationwi issue as salaries and travel costs under the annual budget are subject to the same fla ws it is significant to note that dhrm in iomfom 262004 of 24 march 2004 on temporary assi stance lines in the context of the 2005 annual programme review acknowledged that the re has been growing gap between the total number of posts and the number of staff m embers in unhcr trend which was brought about by the extensive use of temporary ass istance lines under administrative budgets abod 22 dhrm has estimated that between us 30 and us 40 million of staff costs are embedded under abods and that 25 per cent of staff workforce is performing functions on temporary assistance these conclusions make it im perative for unhcr to matchidentify the staff costs charged to the programme to the sta ffing table and vice versa these shortcomings should be addressed in msrp without wa iting for the new payroll module the bureau stated that it had faced difficulties to obtain accurate and updated financial data on personnel and travel from fmis which was requir ed for donor reporting though the constraints were systemic in nature the bureau wou ld work together with other operational units to overcome this issue recommendations head2right the unhcr division of operational support and the d ivision of financial and supply management should ensure that all payment vouchers for salaries and related costs recorded in msrp through the unhcr payroll or adjustment vouchers affecting payroll costs are easily identified to staff members this should be applicable to both special and annual programmes ef fective from 6 2005 the key field should be either the staff mem bers name or the index number rec 01 head2right the unhcr division of operational support and the d ivision of financial and supply management should ensure that all travel costs recorded in msrp are identified to travel uthorization or to staff members name or index number as the infor mation could be sensitive the staff costs and travel informatio n should be available for queryreview online to certain users for example business unit managers senior resource managers an d bureaux directors rec 02 human resources management 23 unhcr issued the first fasttrack compendi um for the iraq operation in early february 2003 later in july 2003 after the appro val by orb the fasttrack compendium for the iraq operation with 94 professional and 239 gen eral and field service temporary lines was issued the attack on office in baghdad in augu st 2003 however postponed the staff placement decision process the bureau explained t hat since then the staff members have been assigned to the functions based on the operati onal needs 24 according to the bureau staffing table was available for the supplementary programme isu provided an overview on the staffin g such as the positions needed positions filled date the staff members took over their assi gnments staff on mission status performing various functions and vacant positions oios found that of the 94 professional positions required staff members were assigned to only 26 in addition there were 7 staff members on mission status most of them for more than 6 months and 10 under temporary assistance for staff in the general service category such overview was available the bureau explained that due to the continuing uncertainty in iraq the staffing issues were complex the staffing requirements for the second half of 20 04 would be revised based on the operational needs in the foreseeable future taking into account the political and security constraints c supply management relief items 25 in the months leading up to the military i ntervention in iraq unhcr and other humanitarian agencies prepared for possible large scale population movements into neighbouring countries unhcr procured over us 16 million worth of relief and other items mainly vehicles telecom and it equipment f or the emergency preparedness phase in addition over us 5 million of relief items and as sets were redeployed mainly from the balkans 26 the relief items have been stored in five warehouses in iran turkey and jordan unhcr has contracted commercial companies for wareh ousing services both storage and handling in jordan and turkey for the stockpile i n iran the warehousing functions are directly implemented by unhcr the isu in geneva i s responsible for controlling and monitoring of these stocks 7 27 isu has systems and procedures in place to track the movements in and out of the warehouses in the region stocks are released f rom these warehouses unless there is an authorisation from isu our review noted that sati sfactory controls existed in isu for the procurement receipt and distribution of relief ite ms for iraq operations or their redeployment to other operations valued at over us 2 million t african operations 28 isu reported that the supplementary progra mme neither paid nor obtained any consideration for the stocks received or redeployed oios has already recommended that unhcr establish policy to account for stocks and assets redeployments between operations in the audit of unhcrs central and regional stockp iles vehicles 29 oios noted that about 150 vehicles were pu rchased for the entire supplementary programme isu has performed physical verificati on of the vehicles in the region and confirmed the existence of about 125 vehicles in l locations except about 25 used in central and northern iraq isu explained to us that it was difficult to obtain confirmation from the offices inside iraq due to the prevailing security situation oios noted that over 70 light vehicles trucks and armoured vehicles valued at ov er us 3 million were not used but were kept ready for deployment in case of need msrp inventory module 30 since isu would continue to retain control over the stocks the warehouses for iraq operations should be considered for inclusion in th inventory module of msrp implemented at unhcr headquarters in fact most of the relief items stored in the region were procured through the sms over us 13 million of them still held in stocks and all the controls over their receipt issue and storage are vested in isu geneva further while the assets for example vehicles procured by the sms are recorded in the asset management module of msrp through the assettrak system at the field offi ces the relief items procured by sms will not be subject to similar controls until msrp is implemented in the field except for the warehouses in copenhagen and the it and telecoms in geneva 31 including the stocks in the msrp headquart ers inventory would facilitate redeployment and managerial decisions and could als be pilot project to prepare for the msrp roll out to the field the bureau agrees and supports this recommendation to include the iraq regional stock in msrp the bureau explain ed that it would coordinate with sms and msrp teams to formulate the implementation stra tegy recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau of caswaname in coordination with the supply management service should explore the possib ility of including the stocks valued at over us 13 million held in iran turkey and jordan for the iraq operation in the hea dquarters msrp rec 03 8 future use of assets and relief items 32 in the 2004 operational plan for iraq som of the following activities were envisaged the orderly return of iraqi refugees protection an d durable solutions to refugees in iraq reintegration for the internally displaced persons capacity building of national institutions and the provision of legal and technical advice on property issues while these activities are subject to number of assumptions including favour able security situation functioning public administration implementation of the transfer of s overeignty etc unhcr has stated that international staff presence is envisaged in iraq t least in the near future 33 considering that unhcr has invested substa ntially in the region isu should ensure that strategy is in place for the use of the reli ef items and assets already procured to ensure the best interests of the organisation and that th items are effectively utilised for example alternate use of the vehicles held in the warehouses should be explored moreover leaving some of these items like blankets in extre temperatures may result in their deterioration isu responded that it had been decided to maintain stock level that would benefit 300000 beneficiaries to appropriately resp ond to humanitarian crisis or to any eventuality the overall usefulness and life span f the stocks are part of the bureaus strategy v acknowledgement 34 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditor by the staff of the bureau of caswaname
