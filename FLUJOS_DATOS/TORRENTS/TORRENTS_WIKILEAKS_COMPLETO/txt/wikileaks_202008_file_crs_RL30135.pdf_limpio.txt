members to deliver one minutes on the issue designated as the partys daily message on days when the number of oneminute speeches is limited these party members usually receive priority seating for recognition purposes ie on the right side of the partys first row the daily message usually presents the partys views on specific legislation before the house or its position on policy or political

address the house for one minute and to revise and extend their remarks 9 permission is almost always granted members speak from the well of the chamber they are limited to one minute and cannot ask unanimous consent for additional time when the chair announces that one minute has expired the member can finish the sentence underway but must then stop speaking the chairs calculation of time consumed during oneminute speech is not subject to challenge on point of order 10 when members cannot finish their remarks in one minute the permission to extend allows them to complete their speech in writing in the congressional record the undelivered portion of their speech appears in distinctive typeface permission to extend also authorizes members to insert extraneous material such as newspaper article or constituent letter during oneminute speech the inserted material appears in distinctive typeface joint committee on printing regulations for publication of the congressional record provide that any extraneous matter included in any statement by member be printed in the extensions of remarks section of the congressional record but noted in the members remarks 11 this requirement is not always observed review of 10 one minutes containing extraneous matter from january to july 1997 found that in each case the extraneous matter was printed in the house section not in the extensions of remarks of the congressional record along with the one minute speech the joint committee on printings regulations also require that oneminute speeches longer than 300 words delivered during the morning business ie during the oneminute speech period at the start of the day be printed following the business of the day in practice these one minutes 8 by contrast special order and morning hour speeches must be reserved in advance through each partys leadership 9 permission to revise gives members the opportunity to make technical grammatical and typographical corrections only permission to extend authorizes the insertion of material such as newspaper article or constituent letter during the oneminute speech 10 house practice consideration and debate chapter sec 50 p 426 11 extensions of remarks is the section where members of the house can insert speech that was not actually delivered on the floor or extraneous materials related to the subject under discussion with the houses permission there are three sections in the daily congressional record 1 the proceedings of the house 2 the proceedings of the senate and 3 the extensions of remarks

speech in the house section of the congressional record alongside the one minutes delivered on the floor that day the representative asks unanimous consent to insert the oneminute speech in the congressional record and yields back his time the inserted speech is published in distinctive typeface the practical difference between inserting and delivering oneminute speech is the speechs audience inserted one minutes are available to readers of the hard copy and online versions of the congressional record by contrast delivered one minutes reach larger audience through c spans

oneminute speeches make them an attractive communication tool for individual members and the party leadership in addition the usual position of one minutes at the start of day means they can be covered by broadcast news organizations in time for evening news programs individual members often use one minutes to share information with colleagues such as announcing new bill they have introduced or explaining floor amendment they will offer later that day in practice these one minutes serve as visual dear colleague letter representatives also use oneminute speeches to deliver eulogies and tributes concerning individuals and organizations in their congressional district one minutes also provide members with an opportunity to express their views on bills policy issues and local national and international events for junior members oneminute speeches provide valuable debate opportunity representative chabot highlighted this point in 105 th congress oneminute speech on the importance of one minutes as my colleagues know freshman or sophomore member might sit at committee meeting for two hours before being able to pose one question to witness he or she if lucky might get 30 seconds to debate pending bill on the floor oneminute speeches give these members and the people they represent back home chance to be heard 12 some representatives have made oneminute speeches regular part of their media and communication strategy by delivering one minutes they reach national audience of cspan television viewers and webcast users including constituents some members also disseminate their oneminute speeches through other channels such as mailing constituents copy of the speech printed in congressional record or providing local news organizations with video press release 12 rep steve

g347g561as mentioned earlier the democratic message group and the republican theme team sometimes use oneminute speeches as vehicle for transmitting the partys daily message the oneminute speech period provides forum where different members of the party can speak on the designated theme to national audience this use of one minutes has been criticized by some representatives and congressional observers during 104th congress special order speech on civility in the house one member stated that one minutes in the morning had become themeteam efforts just to excite and aggravate to get sound bites for television rather than healthy discourse on the issues 13 g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 breaches in decorum during oneminute speeches in the 104th and 105th congresses have prompted some reform proposals that range from eliminating one minutes to postponing them until the completion of legislative business these proposals have been advanced in letters to the speaker in testimony at congressional hearings and in the civility in the house of representatives report that was prepared for the march 1997 bipartisan retreat of house members the 1999 report updated the data for the 105 th congress but did not contain recommendations14 g14g142g157g157g142g155g156g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561g21g153g142g138g148g142g155g561 in august 1996 representative archer and former representative beilenson sent letter to the speaker urging him to stop recognizing members for oneminute speeches at the start of the day signed by bipartisan group of 50 members the letter proposed that one minutes only be permitted after the completion of legislative business the letter noted that one minutes had increasingly become series soundbite assaults often prepared not by members themselves but by republican and democratic political staff who have found this format to be highly conducive to the kinds of attacks that used to be reserved for campaign commercials 15 postponing one minutes until after legislative business the letters signatories argued would reduce this manner of using one minutes on september 5 1996 the proposal in the letter was discussed at joint hearing of the two subcommittees of the house rules committee representative archer testified that partisan and poisonous 1minute speeches unfavorably set the tone for our legislative business if we move 1minutes to the conclusion of the day members will be less inclined to focus on the negative politically charged messages and 1minutes would once again turn to their
