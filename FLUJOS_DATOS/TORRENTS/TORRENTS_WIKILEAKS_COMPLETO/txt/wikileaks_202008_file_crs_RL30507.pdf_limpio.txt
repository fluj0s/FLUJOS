corps of engineers civil programs is often contentious issue between the white house and the congress with final appropriations bills typically providing more funding than requested for fy1998 for example the congress added 270 million 7 to the 363 billion requested by the administration similarly the fy1999 bill as passed included total of 386 billion for the corps 638 million more 20 than

latest version includes approximately 481 million more than requested corps management reforms the house appropriations committee noted in report language concerns about the corps project review process and indicated its desire for more streamlined process the committee also mentioned recent allegations that agency officials have improperly manipulated study of navigation improvements on the upper mississippi river and illinois waterway however the committee noted that because these allegations are still under inves tigation it is recommending specific action to address the alleged behavior on relatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs4 matter the committee addressed accusations of the corps efforts toward improperly trying to grow its civil works program it noted that while pressure on planners and engineers to inappropriately justify projects is clearly unacceptable it viewed it the proper role of the chief of engineers to advise the administration the congress and the nation of the level of investment in water resources infrastructure needed to support the economy and improve the quality of life for our citizens the senate appropriations committee report also noted criticisms of the corps operations and the committees dissatisfaction with the administrations proposed management reforms while the committee initially did not include language prohibiting such reforms it put the administration on notice that it would continue to assess the need for such language as the process moves forward mention of such language was included in the conference bill or the statement of conference managers language was included however in the senatepassed water resources development act for 2000 which would direct the corps to contract with the national academy of sciences to study the feasibility of establishing an independent review panel for corps project studies hr 2796 section 220 missouri river water flows the latest version of the energy and water development appropriations bill deletes section 103 of the conference bill section 103 would have prohibited under certain circumstances the use of funds to revise the corps missouri river master water control manual the administration has said it would veto the bill if such language remained floor consideration of hr 4733 stalled in the senate on july 21 over the language and senate amendment to strike the provision was defeated 4552 during floor consideration september 7 the issue involves the controversial subject of how to operate mainstem dams along the missouri river given the diverse statutes potentially affecting the corps river management activities upper basin states generally contend that the current master manual which has been under review for many years does not reflect changes in demand along the river this is especially true they argue of increased demand for water and water releases to meet fish and wildlife and recreational uses particularly water to support the pallid sturgeon and other threatened and endangered species downstream states generally fear that changes in the operations manual to accommodate upstream concerns may result in an inadequate supply of water to meet full season navigational uses downstream states have also noted fears of increased flooding below gavins point dam if higher water releases are made in the spring months

10631 background on reclamation policy most of the large dams and water diversion structures in the west were built by or with the assistance of the bureau of reclamation bureau whereas the corps built hundreds of flood control and navigation projects the bureaus mission was to develop water supplies and to reclaim arid lands in the west primarily for irrigation today the bureau manages more than 600 dams in 17 western states providing water to approximately 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people the bureau has undergone many changes in the last 15 years turning from largely dam construction agency to selfdescribed water resource management agency the agency describes the intent of its programs and projects as follows to operate and maintain all facilities in safe efficient economical and reliable manner to sustain the health and integrity of ecosystems while addressing the water demands of growing west and to assist states tribal governments and local communities in solving contemporary and future water and related resource problems in an environmentally socially and fiscally sound manner in practice however the agency is limited in how it can address new demands and new priori ties because of numerous federal state and local statutes compacts and existing contracts which together govern the delivery of water to project users consequently any proposal to change bureau water allocation or water management policies often becomes difficult to implement and extremely controversial key policy issues bureau of reclamation the conference agreement for hr 4733 includes 77642 million for fy2001 for the bureau of reclamation which is approximately 10 million more than enacted for fy2000 funding for the bureau was not affected by modifications to the conference bill as included in hr 4635 the housepassed bill includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs7 approximately 730 million for the bureau of reclamation for fy2001 the senate passed versi on included 7527 the administration requested an appropriation of approximately 80103 million approximately 33 million more than enacted for fy2000 both the house and senate appropriations committees stated they would not fund the admini strations request of 60 million for the california baydelta restoration program baydelta or calfed the same amount as was enacted for fy2000 until the program received an authorization for such appropriations funding for baydelta is requested in the bure aus budget but the appropriation would be allocated among several federal agencies proposal to include 20 millio n in calfed funding for fy2001 was dropped in conference as was proposal to adopt authorizing language similar to that recently reported from the house resources committee hr 5130 the administration submitted language to extend the baydelta appropriations authorization through fy2003 for an additional total of 4299 million averaging 1433 million per year but not requested by year the fy2001 request of 60 million for baydelta activities included 30 million for ecosystem restoration activities 5 million maximum for planning and management and 24 million for other activities the fy2001 request also includes 718 million for dam safety program activities 17 million of which is for the depart ment of the interior dam safety program the administration has also submitted language to increase the appropriations ceiling under the safety of dams act the agency notes that sufficient appropriations ceiling exists for the fy2001 request however without an increase in the ceiling outyear commitments created in fy2001 will be managed to remain within the existing ceiling it appears that actual work on high priority dams dam modifications is made under the initiate safety of dams corrective action program isca which unlike dam safety evaluations is subje ct to the appropriations ceilinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs8 title iii department of

million is to be spent on road map for the commercial deployment of next generation power reactor 1 million is earmarked to analyze potential improvements in advanced versions of todays commercial light water reactors 1 million is for initiatives supporting an advanced gascooled reactor and the final 1 million is for feasibility study for deploying small modular reactors the conferees went

to improve the economic competitiveness of existing nucle ar power plants the conferees specified that nonfederal partners share at least half the costs of nepo projects funding for nepo is part of the administrations climate change technology initiative to be matched by industry the nepo funding would focus on research to extend the operating lives of existing reactors and to allow them to operate more efficiently and reliably the programs goal is to increase the average production of us nuclear plants to 85 of full capacity by 2010 the capacity utiliz ation percentage of us reactors generally averages in the mid70s although it was close to 85 in 1999 because nuclear plants directly emit carbon dioxide greater production of nuclear power from existing reactors could help the united states reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions nuclear energy is the only proven largescale power source that has unlimited potential to provide clean and reliable electricity into the next century according to the doe budget justification however opponents have criticized does nuclear energy research programs as providing wasteful subsidies to failing industry controversy has also been

requires doe to submit report by march 2001 on the types of waste that the process would produce opponents of electrometallurgical treatment contend that it is unnecessary and that the proce ss could be used for separating plutonium to make nuclear weapons they note that the process uses much of the same technology and equipment developed for the plutoniumfueled integral fast reactor or advanced liquid metal reactor which was canceled by congress in 1993 partly because of concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation the confer ence agreement would establish new doe program called advanced

citing severe funding constraints appropriated level funding for the project of 100 million the senate however approved 221 million for construction touting the importance of the project for advancing science and technology again conference action restored funds providing 2595 million 24 million below the request doe also requested 49 million increase for civilian information technology it research the latter focuses on development and application of high performance computing for scientific applications the house again citing funding limitations approved only 5 million of the requested increase the senate approved funding about 20 million of the requested increase although much of that would come by shifting funds from other programs the conferees provided nearly all of the requested funding although specific amount was not given the third major program request by doe was an additional 36 million for nanoscience and nanotechnology research within bes the house made mention of this initiative although its appropriation for the bes program not including the sns was 629 million below the request the senate expressed strong support for the initiative but provided only about 56 of bes funding requested for it funds were restored in conference with the conferees providing the full request the houses appropriation for the ber program was 88 below the request again funding constraints were cited although the house argued that the appropriation was in line with previous years when new projects started in fy2000 were removed the senate approved funding the program at 03 below the request the conferees provided 5003 million for this program 141 above the request much of the increase is for projects specifically identified by congress the house approved funding the high energy and nuclear physics programs at their requested level it did note however that it was not anxious to fund design work for large new accelerators in period of limited funds the senates appropriation for these two programs was about 53 below the request the senate cited severe budget constraints as the reason funding was restored by the conferees recommended final total 20 above the original request the house also approved an increase of 75 million above the request for the fusion energy sciences program which would be slight increase over the fy2000 level the senate again citing budget constraints approved funding fusion research at 81 below the request conferees adopted the house mark nuclear weapons stewardship rd this activity is aimed at developing the science and technology to maintain the nations nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing principal activities are the development of computational capabilities that can simulate weapons

senateapproved amount was assigned to the nif project see below the national security budget for fy2001 was prepared for the first time under the rubric of the nnsa the new organization created by congress pl 10665 hrept 106301 to manage most of does defense activities in the wake of security conc erns uncovered in 1998 implementation of the nnsa has been quite controversial and several in congress have expressed displeasure about the way doe is undertaking this task the house noted that it has been citing doe management problems for some time and expressed its desire that the new director of the nnsa take the opportunity afforded by the reorganizati on to make major changes in the current doe management structure the senate expressed hope that nnsa can resolve the serious concerns the senate has with the current stockpile stewardship program the conferees expressed their support of efforts to staff the nnsa and agreed that such actions should not be affected by change in administration major problem that has emerged is the large cost overrun on the national ignition facility nif currently doe estimates the total project cost to be about 326 billion compared to the original estimate of 203 billion gao estimates the cost to be 39 billion the overrun is due primarily to significant management and technical problems that emerged during nif construction3 doe has not amended its fy2001 budget request for nif which was 74 million for construction plus about 85 million in related costs with the fy2000 appropriations congress had directed doe to provide new cost baseline by june 1 2000 or provide an estimate of termination costs doe has only provided an estimate of the new baseline and will not have firm number until september the house noted does failure to meet the deadline and stated that it would reserve judgment about the nif project until september in the meantime it approved funding the original doe request for nif for fy2001 the senate bill included an amendment that would cap funding for nif at 741 million until the results of study by the national academy of sciences on the project was deliver ed the study was to be completed by september 1 2001 and wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs15 among other things examine the contribution of nif to the stockpile stewardship program ssp and determine whether existing technical problems are likely to add to the projects cost and whether smaller version of nif would suffice in conference the funding of 199 million for nif for fy2001 was agreed to of this amount 65 million would come from funds transferred from other weapons programs and 1341 million would be in new appropriations the final appropriations bill limits the amount available to doe for nif to 130 million at the start of fy2001 releasing the remaining funds after march 31 2001 and only after certification by the nnsa that several conditions have been met these conditions include among other things review of alternative construction options certification that project milestones schedule and costs are being met completion of study on whether fullscale nif is needed to meet the goals of the ssp and fiveyear plan for the ssp that describes how nif is to be paid for in the out years another issue raised by the house concerned the amount and use of laboratory directed research and development ldrd funds for fy2000 the congress had reduced the ldrd funding level to 4 of funds appropriated for labs from 6 doe requested restoring the level to 6 for fy2001 but the house retained that 4 level and further directed doe to submit speci fic request for these funds within each program in future budget submissions in an amendment adopted on the floor the senate approved level of 8 and included funds from the environmental management programs the conferees adopted level of 6 for ldrd for the laboratories and 2 for the weapons production plants the house requirement that doe produce financial accounting report of these funds was also adopted nonproliferation and national security programs does nonproliferation and national security programs provide technical capabilities to support us efforts to prevent detect and counter the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide also included are cooperative threat reduction programs to reduce nuclear chemical and biological weapon dangers in russia and other countries of the former soviet union and arms control treaty verification programs some intelligence programs are also included these nonproliferation and national security programs are to be included in the newly established national nuclear security administration nnsa the administrations fy2001 request for these programs was 682 million an increase of 135 million from the fy2000 request congress appropriated 547 million for fy2000 and nearly 580 million for fy1999 the house approved 861 million for doe nuclear nonproliferation progra ms in the energy and water appropriations bill for fy2001 part of the increase is due to the committees inclusion of the us russia fissile material disposition program and other russia programs with the nonpr oliferation programs the administration had proposed separate funding the fy2001 request for nonproliferation and national security programs includes 100 million for new longterm nonproliferation program with russia the new program part of the administrations expanded threat reduction initiative is the result of several years of negotiations aimed at ending russias continuing production of plutonium that can be used to make nuclear weapons the funds would be used to store russian nuclear waste instead of reprocessing it to recover plutonium andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs16 to accelerate efforts to improve the safety and security of nuclear materials in russia the house approved 485 million for these programs but funded them separately instead of as distinct new program not included in the administrations nonproliferation and national security budget request was separate fy2001 budget request for 223 million to dispose of excess us and russian nuclear weapons materials an increase of about 21 million over the fy2000 appropriation for fissile material disposition the united states and russia have each declared 50 tons of former weapons materials to be excess and removed from military stockpiles many tons of additional materials are expected to be added to these amounts does fissile material disposition program is aimed at disposing of the excess material to make sure that it is not reused to make nuclear weapons the house included 241 million for us and russian fissile material disposition in its energy and water appropriations for fy2001 but not as separate budget item from the nonproliferation account environmental management does environmental management program em is responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination and disposing of radioactive waste at doe nuclear sites the fy2001 conference level for the program is 64 billion nearly the full request excluding the uranium enrichment decontamination and decommissioning fund the house had voted 300 million reduction from the budget request and the senate had cut about 100 million the conference agreement cuts all but 65 million of the 539 million request for the privatization of major doe waste management projects primarily project to solidify highlevel radioactive waste at hanford washington because doe decided in spring 2000 that the hanford project would not be privatized after all the conferees transferred 377 million from the privatization account to the office of river protection at hanford where the waste solidification effort will be managed under more routine doe contract the conferees also approved rescission of 97 million that had previously been appropriated to the contract the fy2001 em budget request is based on the programs accelerated cleanup strategy which attempts to maximize the number of sites that can be completely cleaned up by the end of fy2006 doe managers contend that substantial longterm savings can be gained by focusing on completing work at those sites allowing the earliest possible termination of infrastructure costs major sites scheduled for shutdown during that period are included in the defense facilities closure projects account for which 11 billion is included in the conference agreement the same as the administration request the largest facilities under that account are the rocky flats site in colorado and the fernald site in ohio another 9815 million is provided for siteproject completion about 65 million above the request for cleanup activities to be finished by 2006 at doe sites that will remain in operation despite the 2006 cleanup goal the bulk of ems funding is in the post2006 completion account inclu ding the office of river protection at hanford this account includes cleanup projects that are expected to continue sometime after 2006 the conferees approved 346 billion for post2006 comple tion projects including thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs17 377 million transfer for the hanford waste solidification project from the privatization account the administration had sought 297 billion the hanford waste project called the tank waste reme diation system twrs consists of pilot vitrification plant that would turn liquid highlevel waste into radioactive glass logs for eventual disposal the 450 million sought by doe for twrs was by far the largest item in ems fy2001 privatization funding request twrs suffered severe setback in spring 2000 after contractor bnfl inc announced that costs would total 152 billion more than twice the previously estimated level doe announced in may 2000 that it would select new contractor and switch to traditional financing methods for the project the house had cut does fy2001 appropriations request for twrs to 194 million and the senate had voted 259 million another major privatized project is facility to treat mixed radioactive and hazardous waste at the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory for which 65 million was requested and approved by the conference agreement the idaho project the advanced mixed waste treatment project is opposed by some residents of wyoming who are concerned about radioactivity from planned incinerator in response to that opposition energy secretary bill richardson halted further work on the incinerator on march 27 2000 and established panel to recommend alternatives however the construction of the rest of the treatment project is to proceed the em privatization effort is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting portion of project risks from the federal government to contractors profits to contractors would depend on their success in meeting project schedules and holding down costs potentially profits could be substantially higher or lower than under traditional doe contracting arrangements in typical nonprivatized doe project contractor would be hired to build and operate facility with government funds doe would approve and pay all the contractors costs and then award the contractor profit based on performance under the privatization initiative contractor would be expected to raise almost all funding for necessary facilities and equipment for project the contractor would recover that investment and earn profit by charging previously negotiated fees to doe for providing services under the contract such as solidification of radioactive waste with privatized project the contractor could earn higher profits by reducing costs but the contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expected or the required services were not delivered if doe cancelled the project the federal government would repay the contractor s expenses to that date to cover that contingency doe needs enough funding to be appropriated as construction proceeds if the project were to begin operating as planned the accumulated appro priations would be used to pay for waste treatment under the contract in the case of the hanford twrs project however doe concluded that the risks involved would cause the private sector to charge excessive prices to the government negating the potential cost savingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs18 does 295 million request for decontamination and decommissioning of uranium enrichment plants and mill sites would provide 21 boost over the fy2000 appropriation and the conferees provided further increase to 345 million much of does proposed increase was targeted toward environmental cleanup activities at does uranium enrichment plants at paducah kentucky and portsmouth ohio which are currently leased to private firm recent controversy has focused on environmental hazards posed by the plants particularly contamination resulting from the past enrichment of reprocessed uranium at paducah the conference agreement provides an additiona l 42 million above the request for reimbursing the mining industry for cleaning up uranium and thorium mill waste the house had voted to cut the request to 260 million because of severe funding constraints according to the appropriations committee report while the senate had approved 298 million civilian nuclear waste the conferees voted to provide 391 million for the civilian nuclear waste program in fy2001 nearly 40 million below the budget request but 40 million increase over the fy2000 level house had voted to provide 413 million while the senate had voted to provide 351 million as required by the nuclear waste policy act doe is studying yucca mountain nevada as the site for national waste repository currently scheduled to open in 2010 final environmental impact statement for the proposed yucca mountain repository is to be completed in fy2000 doe contends that increased funding will be needed to prepare site recommendation report for the president in fy2001 and to work on license application to be sent to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc in 2002 but the house appropriations committee report contended that doe could meet its objectives with smaller increase funding for the program comes from two sources under the fy2001 budget request 3255 million would be provided from the nuclear waste fund which consists of fees paid by nuclear utilities and 112 million would come from the defense nuclear waste disposal account which pays for disposal of highlevel waste generated by the nuclear weapons program the house voted to appropriate 213 million from the nuclear waste fund and 200 million for the defense disposal account the house also voted to rescind 85 million appropriated in fy1986 for interim nuclear waste storage funding that was contingent on the passage of legislation that was vetoed by the president the senate approved 292 million from the defense disposal account and 59 million from the nuclear waste fund and also included the rescission of 55 million for interim storage the conference agreement provides 191 million from the nuclear waste fund and 200 million from the defense account it also rescinds 75 million from the previously appropriated 85 million for interim storage and authorizes doe to use the remaining 10 million if it is needed to complete the yucca mountain site recommendation report on time the 2010 target for opening permanent repository is 12 years later than the nuclear waste policy act deadline of january 31 1998 for doe to begin taking

administr ations does four power marketing administrations pmas developed out of the construction of dams and multi purpose water projects during the 1930s that are operated by the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers the original intention behind these projects was conservation and management of water resources including irrigation flood control recreation and other objectives however many of these facilities generated electricity for project needs the pmas were established to market the excess power they are the bonneville power administration bpa south eastern power administration sepa southwestern power administration swpa and western area power administration wapa the power is sold at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies at the lowest possible rates consistent with sound business practice and priority on pma power is extended to preference customers which include municipal utilities coops and other public bodies the pmas do not own the generating facilities but they generally do own transmission facilities except for southeastern the pmas are responsible for covering their expenses and repaying debt and the federal investment in the generating facilities the 104th congress debated sale of the pmas and did in 1995 authorize divestiture of one pma the alaska power administration the future of the remaining pmas may rest on decisions yet to be made about the treatment of public power in the broader context of electric utility restructuring bpa receives annual appropriation the administrations request for the other three pmas for fy2001 was 1996 million reduction of 25 from the fy2000 appropriation the savings stemmed from the administrations proposal that beginning in fy2000 customers of sepa wapa and swpa would be responsible for making their own powe r purchases and transmission arrangements from any suppliers other than the pma to satisfy their needs under the purchase power and wheeling program ppw the pmas have purchased electricity and transmission capability which is repaid by pma customers to supplement federal generation the premise behind the proposed elimination of the ppw program was that deregulation should make it less expensive and less complicated for pma customers to make these arrangements another possible reason is that the money appropriated to the pmas under ppw is repaid to the treasury rather than to doe this means that the ppw appropriation is fully scored against the caps on discretionary domestic spending with which doe must comply the committee recommended and the house approved 1956 million reflecting reduction to wapa that will be offset by the use of prior year balanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30507crs20 4 includes appropriations from nuclear waste fund and
