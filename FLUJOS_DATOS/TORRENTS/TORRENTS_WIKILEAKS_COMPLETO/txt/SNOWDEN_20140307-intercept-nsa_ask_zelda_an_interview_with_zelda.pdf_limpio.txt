u an interview with zelda from sidtoday run date 05052011 u with the first anniversary of the ask zelda column looming on the horizon in june we decided to interview zelda herself we thought her readers might be interested in learning more about the advicegiver u sidtoday zelda your advice column ask zelda has been the most successful nontechnical series in the history of sidtoday lot of people have questioned whether zelda is real person or team of people and why she uses pen name u zelda well as you can see im real person in the first issue you published my credentials and that description was accurate but the picture that runs with the column above looks nothing like as for zelda being team of people i do occasionally consult with another person for sanity check but i am the sole author of the column u the decision to use pen name came about for several reasons the idea for the column was proposed by the sid today editor who was looking for venue where sid supervisors could write in to ask advice since sid today is like an online newspaper we decided to follow the tradition of newspaper writein advice columnists such as dear abby and miss manners and give nom plume i like it because using pen name creates persona whos more memorable and accessible than ask mary smith chief of s456 plus it creates certain mystique about zelda shes bigger than life it also prevents from getting inundated with hate mail and requests for advice outside of the column ed note some people have asked for zeldas direct help with personal problem but didnt want it published in sidtoday u st you said it was an advice column for supervisors u z yes that was the original plan but nonsupervisory employees began writing in asking questions and requesting someone like zelda help them with their issues too u st so you branched out to answer anything work related u z laughs more or less i dont give technical or romantic advice however u st what has been the reaction to zelda u z im very pleased and surprised that it has been overwhelmingly positive each month it is among the top 5 most widely read articles and i want to thank my loyal followers for that im thinking of making little rubber bracelets that say wwzd what would zelda do to give out at front line leader classes or maybe tshirts that say be foz friend of zelda u st but it hasnt all been positive ufouo z heavens there have been few people who didnt appreciate zeldas sense of humor and at first some of the other nsa organizations like hr and adcl were uncomfortable with an unknown person in sid dispensing advice in their areas of expertise but we made it clear that this was just zeldas opinion and not an official answer strict policy questions can and should be addressed by these other organizations but zelda fills void for people who are seeking advice she acts as wise friend or senior coworker which isnt the same thing as asking for policy interpretation and many areas of interpersonal relations cant be addressed by policy i dont believe theres policy on how to deal with an obnoxious or smelly coworker for example besides i think people would rather read something with bit of personality zelda has been called cheeky even opinionated as opposed to bland whitewashed party line that reads like policy manual and has been approved by chain of managers to scrub it of anything that might offend zelda is not afraid to offend although thats not her intent u st some readers are probably wondering if the questions are really sent in by your readers or if you make them up u z they were all from readers except for the very first one i had to prime the pump since one knew about zelda to ask questions before the first article came out also in december i turned the tables on the workforce and asked them to give advice on situation of my choosing u st how do you decide which questions to answer u z i try to address variety of topics so if you write in about specific problem and i just answered similar question yours probably wont get published at least not for while also some questions are more appropriate for the policy expert in that area to answer in that case sidtoday forwards the question with the askers permission to that poc u st what issues do you see people concerned about most u z how to deal with their supervisor is big one i devoted whole article to managing up because several readers had asked similar questions along those lines u st is there an underlying theme or philosophy that ties all your advice together u z hmmm if i had to pick something i might say common sense also be nice to people and assume noble intent u st what one piece of advice do you have for sid managers u z throughout my career ive seen too many micromanagers its probably inevitable we hire people for their technical skills and then when they get to certain level they find they need to go into management to keep getting promoted however they still have secret hankering to do the technical work managers need to be open minded just because the organization has always done something certain way doesnt mean its the only or even best way to do it my advice to sid managers is to take care of your people and let your people take care of the mission u st one last question will the readers ever find out who zelda really is u z i dont know probably when the column wrapsup whenever that may be doing it too soon might be disappointing like unmasking the lone ranger
