blishment of the fbf to finance the capital costs of federal facilities with income derived from rent assessments represented an important revision to prev iously enacted federal real property law8

the treasury to give effect to and execute the provisions of existing legislation to acquire property and to enter into contracts for the construction of fe deral buildings9 the federal government s acquisition of federal property was suspended in 1914 at the onset of world war i and was not reinstated until the enactment of the public buildings act in 192610 this 1926 act provided the basic authority for construction of fe deral buildings by the congressional authorizations and ppropriations process11 congress later enacted the public buildings act of 1949 to authorize the ac quisition

administering federal real property in 1954 congress amended the public buildings act of 1949 to authorize the gsa administrat or to acquire titles to real property and to construct federal buildings through leasepurchase contracts14 under this procedure building was financed by pr ivate capital and the federal government made installment payments on the purchase price in lieu of rent payments title to the property was vested in the federal gove rnment at the end of the contract period generally of at least 10 and not more than 30 years when authority for leasepurchase contracts expired in 1957 congress approved successor statute th public buildings act of 195915 the 1959 act re established earlier requirement s to provide for direct fe deral construc tion of public buildings through

or additions to sites for such buildings as part of the funding authorization process gsa is required to submit to the senate committee on environment and public works and the house committee on transportation and infrastructure detailed prospectus of all proposed building projects17 in the decade following the 1959 passage of the public buildings act congress appropriated approx imately 115 million each fiscal year to gsa for new construction projects however by 1972 total of 63 congressionally authorized building projects had not received appropriations largely as result of fiscal constraints18 in april 1972 the house committee on public works reported that while congress repeatedly asserted its insistence that direct federal construction of public buildings was the most efficient and economical way to meet the governments urgent space requirements an additional 1 billion would be needed in direct congressional ppropriations to fund the 63 uncompleted construction

by income from rental charges assessed to tenant agencies occupying gsaownedandleased space that approximated commercial rates for comparable space and services each tenant agency would budget for its own sp ace needs in the annual congressional authorizations and appropria tions process the legislative history reveals that congress believed that the requi rement for tenant agencies to be directly accountable for their space needs would result in more efficient utilization of federal office space21 during its 1971 consideration of legi slation to create the fbf the senate committee on public works reported that individual agency requests and justifications for office space during th annual budget process represented significant step toward performance budge ting resulting in greater congressional oversight of the fede ral buildings program22 the 1971 congressional deliberations focused on two different methods to establish agency rental charges the costrecovery method and the rentequivalent method under the costrecovery method charges would have been based on estimated maintenance costs the cost of leasing space and depreciation costs on gsaowned facilities income resulting from the depreciation charges would have been available to finance future gsa c onstruction and repairs projects the cost recovery approach was rejected by cong ress because not enoug h revenue could have been generated in fact gsa estimated that it would have needed additional appropriations of nearly 150 million each ear to finance future construction projects the second option the rentequi valent method based on commercial rates for leasing space was ultimately embodied in law gsa officials estimated that based on 1971 funding obligations appr oximately 800 million in rental charges would be paid to the fund of this tota l congress and gsa anticipated that nearly 300 million in revenues would be av ailable for capital expenditures23 the senate committee on public works

the act authorized appropriations to the fund for the first two fiscal year s in which the fund became operational and any additional appropria tions as might be necessary to carry out the funds

increased from 414 million in fy1975 to nearly 571 million in fy198038 another reason the fbf generated less revenue than anticipated for needed capital investment was that congress nd the office of management and budget omb periodically restricted the rent payments that gsa was allowed to charge tenant agencies gao reported that between 1975 and 1988 administrative and legislative rent restrictions reduced available fbf revenues by nearly 4 billion39 when the federal buildings fund became operational in fy1975 the gsaadministrator established agency rental ch arges and prescribed regulations providing for the rates that gsa charges to tenant agencies for use of its space 40 these rates were based on computing composite commercial rates charged in various locations throughout the country and included rating factors pertaining to the quality of structure and design elements for different types of commercial facilities according to gaos findings the quality rating was an important component since the higher the rating the greater the building rental charge gao reported however that gsas quality ratings were largely based on subjective judgment and limited criteria and that gsas reliance on market surveys di d not provide an adequate basis for determining approximate rental rates41 tenant agencies also criticized gsas methodology in determining f ees based on composite market rates instead of actual costs based on more favor able longterm leases42 during consideration of gsas fy 1975 budget request the house committee on appropriations reported that gsas

in addition gsa internal audit committee issued report which criticized the agencys method of calculating composite rental rates without giving adequate consideration to the location of facilities and the corresponding differen ces in market values49 in order to provide more equitable thod to determine agency rental charges gao recommended that gsa conduct an indi vidual survey and appraisal for each gsaownedandleased buildin g to determine rent that would be equivalent to commercial rent for comparable space and services50 in part because of gaos recommendations gsa began conducting i

limitations in fbf reve nues are exacerbated by the heightened demands for repairs and alterations associated with aging buildings gaos analysis of fbf revenues from fy1994 through fy1999 determined that gsa was authorized approximately 580 million in new obligational authority from the fbf each year to co mplete repairs on ex isting gsa facilities while gsa completed substantial work ne w requirements were frequently added to gsas repairs inventory61 in 1999 gsa estimated that nearly 4 billion was needed to complete repairs and alterations to 903 buildings or appr oximately 54 of its entire inventory of 1682 federal buildings62 the repair and alteration work identified in 446 buildings was estimated to cost 500000 or less per building however 44 aging facilities classified by gsa as rge office buildings or courthouses needed major repairs of more than 20 million fo r each facility accounting for nearly 60 of the almost 4 billion estimated as need ed to fund all iden tified repairs and alterations63 furthermore gao found that some of the repairs nd alterations that had been identified more than five years earlier were still unfinished gsa officials stated that some tasks

the deteriorating physical condition of many federal buildings and the corresponding underutilization and vacancy of many government facilities has serious cost implications for gsas real property portfolio investigations by gao have revealed that many pr operties in the fede ral inventory are not financially self sustaining and are longer relevant to their agencies changing missions68 according to gao by identifying and dis posing of unneeded properties gsa could give greater attention and funding to the repair of streamlin ed federal inventory due to the vast size and diversity of
