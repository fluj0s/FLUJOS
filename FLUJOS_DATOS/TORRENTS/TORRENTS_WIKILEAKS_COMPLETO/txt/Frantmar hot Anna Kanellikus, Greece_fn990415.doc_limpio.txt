frantmar trust frantmar ventures international ltd fancey development limited review notes 15 april 1999 statements from inception to may 1996 have been archived off site the following notes do not include any comments on that period 1 the trust was settled in june 1994 the initial settlement as per the deed was us5000 the trustee acceptance of the additional settlement of us2650 million has not been formally resolved there is letter on file from the settlor asking the trustee to accept this additional settlement the shares of fancey developments bvi company have not been formally accepted into the trust there is letter on file from the settlor asking the trustee to accept the shares into the trust she is the sole director the bearer share certificate is in the jbtc custody file at bank julius baer co ltd zurich 2 over all structure the deed is revocable it requires the prior written consent of the protector for exercise of powers under clauses 4 and 5 and schedule 3 clauses 1345679111316 exercise of clauses in relation to distributions and apportionment of capital and income as well as most of the general powers re investments etc 1st protector is settlor and main beneficiary and the second protector are the three secondary beneficiaries her children addition and exclusion of beneficiaries requires prior written consent of settlor the powers retained by the settlor protector are very wide and raise the question as to whether the settlor has actually given up control of the assets furthermore the settlor and main beneficiary constantly refers to the trust account as my personal account with your bank there are copies of correspondence on file between the settlor and main beneficiary and david silberman who is the rm which would strengthen any suspicions that the control of the structure has remained in the hands of the settlor 3 there are significant payments under the loan agreement which have not been approved by trust committee resolution and other payments which have not been approved by the trust committee for which we have details and copies of requests from the settlor and main beneficiary 4 the stated purpose of the trust in the trust creation questionnaire is estate planning the trust appears to be funding the settlors shipping business and indeed is receiving payments from it on regular basis it appears that either simple estate planning is not the sole purpose of the trust or proper consideration was not given to the familys financial planning prior to the settlement of the us265 million 5 loan interest of approx 86245470 was charged in 1998 with only three exceptions amounts charged correspond exactly with amounts paid in by pearl sea marine and first ashore during 1998 it could be seen that the trust is providing financing for pearl sea marine and first ashore and the payments from them are loan interest payments who owns and what are the two companies who controls the companies who has ultimate control over the interest payments if interest is being paid on the loans should the trust have charged interest to the beneficiary then the payments from the two companies would not be additions to the trust but payments of interest from mrs k on the loan made to her 6 we hold the shares of fancey developments ltd which in turn holds shares in anangelamerican listed shipping company however the settlor and main beneficiary is the sole director of this company i would suggest that we take over the directorship of the company so that we have control over the assets of the trust we can also then ensure that the company is maintained in good standing we have not been given any reason why these shares cannot be held in the main frantmar ventures portfolio 7 the trust has granted an interestfree loan to the settlor and main beneficiary of the trust in the amount of us15500000 which has been funded by loans to the trust from bank julius baer co ltd zurich secured by the portfolio of frantmar ventures international there is copy of the loan agreement on file original is in sc the loan is the total of the following payments made over the past few years date of paid to

march 1997 but have been included again in the us15500000 loan the other payments have not been resolved the loan from bjbz to frantmar ventures international ltd is covered by the following agreement loan for us155 million expiring 14 june 1998 interest rate 55625pa they are secured by lien on the portfolio covered by the general pledging of collateral and assignment signed june 20 1994 it should be pointed out to the rm and the settlor beneficiary that the loans are not from the bank to her or from the company to her they are from the trust to her the trust is funding them through the company by borrowing the money from the bank the correspondence between the rm and mrs k would lead one to believe that the money is being lent by the bank to mrs k and that the company is being used just to formalize the payments payments which have been resolved are as follows date details usd trustee details resolutio ns 12061996ac 189296av 1350000025jun96distribution to settlor and main beneficiary

also been made from frantmar ventures international to fancey developments ltd totaling usd279100 fancey developments sole investment is 76000 shares in anangel american shipholding adr listed company payments are made from fancey developments panazur inc presumably its agent in bvi resolution to authorize distribution of usd3000000 to mrs k has been signed by rb and sdg but not by car or pg it seems that this usd3m is actually part of the usd15500000 lent to mrs k under the agreement signed may 98 and as such is not distribution from the trust 8 fees we receive fixed fee of us25000 pa plus the ci government fee this represents approximately 008 of the assets of c us30million we have not charged any time spent on this account we probably should have for last year given that we had to sort out all of the loans etc bjbz wrap fee usd14307848 for 1998 and the interest charged on the portfolio secured loan was 86245470 9 the investment performance has been good index of 16570 as at
