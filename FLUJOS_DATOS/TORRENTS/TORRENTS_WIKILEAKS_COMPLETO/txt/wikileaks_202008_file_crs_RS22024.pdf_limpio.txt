pine forests this report summarizes c ongressional action through 2004 and will not be updated introduction wildfires and efforts to reduce the damage they cause have received increased attention in recent years the 2000 and 2002 fi re seasons were by most measures among the worst in the past 50 years many argue th at the threat of seve re wildfires has grown in recent years because many forests have unna turally high fuel loads eg dead trees and dense undergrowth and histor ically unnatural mix of plant species eg exotic invaders or an understory of trees differing fro m the overstory see crs report rs20822 forest ecosystem health an overview these higher threats have raised concerns about potential damage to homes that increasingl abut or are surrounded by forests the wildlandurban interface or wui see crs report rs21880 wildfire protection in the wildlandurban interface the threats have led to bates over fire protection efforts including questions about fundi ng levels and fuel reduction treatments eg thinning and prescribed burning congressional debates about wildfire protection have focused on federal lands especially the national forests administered by the usda forest service fs and the lands administered by the bureau of land management blm and other department of the interior doi agencies since these lands are managed usin g federal appropriations and federal land ma nagement is subject to congressiona l oversight however the threats are not limited to federal lands and many lands in the wui are privately owned this report briefly summarize s federal wildfire funding then discusses fuel reduction activities and the related administration actions and legislation in the 108th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22024crs2 wildfire funding the severe 2000 fire season led president clinton to propose new program of fire protection and funding the na tional fire plan he reque sted an additional 18 billion to supplement the 11 billion for fy2001 wildfire management requested before the fire season began much of the additional fundi ng was to pay for fy2000 firefighting but more funds also were also sought to treat fuels restore burned areas assist affected communities and prepare for future fire s easons congress largely enacted this proposal in the interior and related agencies appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106291 president bushs subsequent budget request s have proposed continuing most of the wildfire management programs expanded under president clinton congress appropriates funds for fire protection on fe deral lands for assistance to state and local governments in protecting other lands and for research and other programs see crs report rs21544 wildfire protection funding these programs are all considered part of the national fire plan table 1 shows national fire plan funding or the equivalent accounts since fy1991 total annual f unding has risen from about 500 million to more than 3 billion durin g this 15year period funds generally are included in the annual inte rior appropriations acts and often in laws appropriating emergency supplemental funds fs and blm wildfire management accounts include funds for fire suppression fighting wildfire s for preparedness equipment training personnel prevention and det ection and for other opera tions rehabilitation and fuel treatment on federal lands as well as research and othe r programs in addition fs and blm wildfire management funding supports fire research and programs to assist landowners and communities affected by wild fires the fs also administers fire protection assistance programs funded under the state and private forestry line item that provide financial and technical help to states for preventing and controlling fires and for using

activities the presence of unnaturally high fuel ads dense undergrowth and dead trees in many forests is widely presumed to be significant factor in the apparently increasing severity of recent fire seasons several tool s exist for reducing fuel loads prescribed burning setting fires under prescribed weathe r and fuel conditions can be effective for converting small fuels grasses needles or leaves twigs to minerals and to carbon dioxide and other gases but prescribed fires produce large quantities of smoke and can be difficult to control salvage and other timber harvesting can reduce biomass from medium and largediameter trees but the limbs and tree tops slash that are left after logging increase fuel loads at least until the slash has rotted or been burned or removed in addition generally only sound trees of at l east 6 inches in diameter can be sold for wood products and thus commercial sales may be ineffective for removing small diameter and lowquality trees thinning especially precommercial thinning cutting trees with little or commercial value may be effective at reducing medium and small diameter trees but also leaves behind slash and is usually quite expensive these and other tools and techniques co mmonly are used in combination to achieve the desired goals such as lower fuel loads and better water quality single tool might be sufficient for particular site but the variety of fo rest conditions suggests coordinated program of relevant tools and tec hniques in many locations many interests have concluded that lowering fuel loads will reduce the extent severity and costs of wildfire s critics of that conclusion contend that the recent severe fire seasons are the result of prolonged drought combined with lightning to start fires and high winds to push them and assert that lowering fuel loads may have little effect on the extent and severity of wildfires critics also question the effectiveness of fuel treatment research has shown that treatments including but not limited to reducing fuels can protect individual structures and can reduce fire damages in certain ecosystems however research documenting the effectiven ess of broadscale fuel reduction treatments for reducing the extent sever ity and control costs of wildfires is generally lacking many fuel reduction treatments as with many activities on federal lands are subject to analyses of their environmental effects public involvement in planning and decision making and possible administrative and judici challenges to agency decisions the national environmental po licy act of 1969 nepa pl 91190 42 usc 4321 4347 requires federal agencies to assess the possible envi ronmental effects of their actions and to involve the public in their d ecisions the fs is also required by 322 of the 1993 interior appropriations act pl 102381 this section is commonly known as the forest service appeals reform act to allow administrative appeals of most plans and decisions the doi agencies have different administrative review processes but their processes have not been as c ontroversial as the fs appeals process the agencies and certain interest groups contend that these laws delay projects that are critical to protecting both wildlands and communities from wildfire accordingly they propose eliminating or streamlining environmental studies and administrative andor judicial review opponents of such changes contend that the reports of delays are exaggerated and that these laws are designed to protect the environment they are also concerned that such changes could increase timber harvest levels and road construction into roadless areas while reducing public input into decisionmakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22024crs4 administration actions the severe 2002 fire season prompted pres ident bush to propose healthy forests initiative in august 2002 late in the 107th congress the initiative included proposed changes to federal forest management laws to accelerate procedures for reducing the fuel levels on federal lands because such legislation was not enacted in the 107th congress the bush administration made two administrative changes to facilitate fs and doi fuel reduction both changes sought to exped ite the authorized activities by reducing environmental review ndor public involvement one change added two new categories of actions that could be excluded from nepa analysis and documentation 1 fuel reduction and 2 postfire rehabilitation activities 68 federal register 33814 june 5 2003 categorica lly excluded fuel reduction is limited to 1000 acres if by mechanical mean s eg thinning and to 4500 acres if by prescribed burning and is limited to the wui or to certain hazardous condition classes and historic fire regimes the fuel reduc tion exclusion may be used for projects that include timber sales if fuel reduction is the primary purpose postfire rehabilitation projects are limited to 4200 acres and must be completed within three years after the wildfire these categorical exclusions cannot be used in wilderne ss or in wilderness study areas if doing so would impair the suitability of those areas for preservation as wilderness or if extraordinary circumstances exist and the managers determine that the effects might be significant also fuel reduction and rehabilita tion projects cannot be categorically excluded if they use herbicides or pesticides or involve new permanent road construction the second change revised the fs administrative appeals process 68 federal register 33582 june 4 2003 among the many m odifications is clarification that some emergency actions may be implemented immediately and others may be implemented after complying with notification requirements the change expands emergency situations to include those that would result in substantial loss of economic value to the government if implementation of the proposed action were delayed while deleting examples of emergency situations it also would exclude public notice and opportunity for the public to comment on or to appeal actions categ orically excluded from nepa such as the fuel reduc tion activities di scussed above these changes are best read in conjuncti on with other final and proposed regulatory changes to understand the poten tial consequences for fuel reduction public involvement and environmental impacts ne w procedures for addressing categorical exclusions when extraordinary circumstances are present were finalized on august 23 2002 67 federal register 54622 new categorical excl usions for small fs timber harvesting projects were finalized on july 29 2003 68 federal register 44598 and new fs forest planning regulations were issued on january 5 2005 70 federal register 1023 the total impact of these actions seems to be greater discretion for the fs and to lesser extent for the blm to act without environmental studies and with fewer oppor tunities for the public to comment on or to administr atively appeal those actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22024crs5 legislation in the 108th congress many bills were introduced in the 108th congress to enhance wildfire protection two that were enacted are discussed below in more detail most of the bills would have provided expedited procedures for fuel reduc tion projects on federal lands although they have significant differences these bills generally would have authorized or directed categorical exclusions from nepa for fuel reduction pr ojects on certain lands and under certain conditions over five ears with priority generally on the wui and forest lands supporting municipal water supply systems various bills also contained ancillary provisions such as authorizing insect infest ation assessments biomass utilization grants forest health inventory and monitoring emergency biomass fuel reduction grants to private landowners priority for assistance to communities with proactive steps to reduce fire risks funding for wildfire risk re duction and burned area restoration on nonfederal lands watershed forestry assist ance federal compensation for private forest reserves and an economic assistance program for forest resource dependent communities other wildfire bills also were introduced some focused on relatively narrow aspects of wildfire protection eg firefighting equipment availability firefighter compensation landowner compensation for fire damages one bill the forest rest oration and fire risk reduction act hr 1042 would have author ized cooperative program for wildfire hazard reduction and forest restoration on private and ssociated federal lands with special procedures for projects meeting specific conditions however only the two bills discussed below were enacted the healthy forests restoration act of 2003 attention on wildfire protection in the 108th congress focused mostly on the healthy forests restoration act of 2003 hr 1904 the bill as passed by the house contained many provisions to expedite authorized fuel reduction projects on fs and blm lands as well as several other titles for related programs the version of hr 1904 repor ted by the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry s rept108121 was quite similar but with modifications in many of the details after the bill was reported the committee developed compromise version that was offered as substitute on the senate floor the new version passed the senate on october 30 2003 it also was generally similar to the housepassed bill but with many differences in the details and with many additional sections an agreement was reached reso lving differences between the house and senatepassed versions and the conference report hrept 108386 was agreed to in the house and the senate on november 21 th president signed pl 108148 on december 3 2003 title i of the law addresses hazardous fuel reduction on federal lands it does not authorize any fuel reduction activities not previ ously authorized instead it authorizes new alternative process for reducing fuels on up to 20 million acres of national forests or blm lands in or near the wui and municipa l water supply systems as well as certain endangered species habitats and areas affected by wind or ice storms or by insect or disease epidemics that threaten ecological health or natural resources priority is directed to protecting atrisk communities and municipal watersheds authorized projects must be consistent with land management plans they generally are to focus on small trees thinning fuel breaks and prescribed burning while retaining large trees and maintaining old growth stands but are prohibited on certain lands such as wilderness areas the law authorizes 760 million annually for fuel reduc tion on federal lands including projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22024crs6 authorized under the new law an other fuel reduction activities and grants to states the law does not allocate funds among authorized proj ects other projects nd grants to states or among the agencies previously the au thorization for fuel reduction projects was not specified in law for authorized projects the fs or bl m must prepare nepa documents but are allowed to analyze very limited number of alternatives the public can be involved through scoping collaboration and multiparty monitoring of project impacts the public also must be given chance to comment on proposed projects for fs projects the agency is to develop new predecisiona l review process to supplant the existing administrative appeals process and administrative reviews must be exhausted before litigation is allowed lawsuits must be filed in the district court for the area where the project is proposed and courts are encouraged to review cases expeditiously preliminary injunctions are limited to 60 days but can be renewed and courts are directed to balance short and longterm impacts of action and of inaction pl 104148 contains five other titles as we ll title ii expands biomass research authorizes new biomass rural revitalization program and authorizes grants for biomass use title iii establishes watershed forestry assistance program with costsharing assistance to landowners and financial and technical assistance to states and tribal governments to protect water quality through forestry practices title iv authorizes data collection on forestdamaging insects and applied silvicultural assessments treatments for research purposes of up to 1000 acres each 250000 acres total which are categorically excluded from nepa but with peer review and public notice and comment on each project title v authorizes progra m to pay willing private landowners to protect or restore their lands as hab itat for endangered species using 10year agreements or 30 year or longterm up to 99year easements finally title vi authorizes an early warning system for environmental threats primarily to eastern us forests the southwest forest health and wildfire prevention act of 2004 the 108th congress also enacted the southwest forest health and wildfire prevention act of 2004 pl 108317 almost year later on oc tober 5 2004 the act di rects the secretary of agriculture to establish three institutes to promote the use of adaptive ecosystem management to reduce the risk of wildfires and restore the health of forest and woodland ecosystems in the interior west defi ned as arizona colora do idaho nevada new mexico and utah the institutes are to be located at northern arizona university at new mexico highlands university and in th state of colorado each institute is to cooperate with federa l land management agencies in researching promoting and monitoring fuel reduction trea tments to reduce the risk of severe wildfires and improve the health of dry forest and woodland ecosy stems in the interior west defined as ponderosa pine and associated ecological types each institute is also to produce peer reviewed annual report the act authoriz annual appropriations of 15 million for the institutes which may not be used for constructing facilities
