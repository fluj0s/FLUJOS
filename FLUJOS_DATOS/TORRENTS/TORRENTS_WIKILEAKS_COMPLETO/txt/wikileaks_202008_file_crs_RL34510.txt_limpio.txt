fair labor standards act flsa pl 11028 although the wage issue may now have been momentary settled the act includes other provisions that have been subject to legislation through the years and may again become the focus of legislative consideration examples include the following issues youth subminimum wage instituted in 1996 was not included in the 2007 amendments and is 425 per hour the cash wage employers of tipped employees must pay last updated in 1996 is 213 per hour in 1989 the small business exemption was restructured to exempt from minimum wage requirements qualifying firms with an income of under 500000 but as administered exemptions have only been available for employees not involved in interstate commerce in 2001 the clinton administration proposed restructuring of the companionship exemption under the flsa in 2002 the measure was withdrawn the issue has recently been the subject of supreme court ruling 2007 and of proposed legislation hr 3582 and s 2061 through nearly century some economists and later some members of congress have proposed in various formats indexation of the federal minimum wage an issue that still sometimes arises in 1986 section 14c of the act was amended to remove any specific minimum wage floor for handicapped workers replacing it with negotiated wage commensurate with the workers productivity it has been contested through the years in 2003 proposal was issued dealing with overtime pay for persons classified as executive administrative or professional employees under section 13a1 of the act at that time the issue was extremely contentious how has it worked out in practice industry has threatened to leave american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands were the full flsa to be made applicable there as it would be under pl 11028 what will be the impact upon those islands increasingly the states now 34 in number have moved to provide minimum wage rates higher than the federal rate what

included an increase in the federal minimum wage under the fair labor standards act flsa it was the first such increase in decade1 under pl 11028 among other things the federal minimum wage which had been 515 per hour is increased in steps to 585 per hour on july 24 2007 655 per hour on july 24 2008 725 per hour on july 24 2009 in addition the bill raised wages in two insular territories of the pacific the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and american samoa the level of wages in the islands will rise at different rates to equal the federal minimum2 under the flsa an increase in the minimum wage has been the element around which other aspects of the act have clustered it was often the vehicle for consideration of overtime pay child labor industrial homework and similar issues that are part of the flsa3 the federal minimum wage now having been raised may perhaps be dormant for time this could provide an opportunity absent more sustained pressure for new rate increase to examine the basic concept of the fair labor standards act and its various component parts this report discusses few of the topics that collectively make up the flsa in some cases the report is historical because there is long and often important history to the evolution of the act on other occasions it tends to focus 1 the fair labor standards act the flsa was adopted in 1938 it sets the federal minimum wage establishes overtime pay standards regulates child labor and controls industrial homework it is the primary federal labor standards statute in these areas 2 for history of the 2007 flsa amendments see crs report rl33754 minimum wage in the 110th congress by william g whittaker 3 in 1996 procedural change occurred minimum wage was added as very small item in series of tax and related issues of special interest to industry the same pattern was followed with the 2007 amendments to the flsa the related aspects of the act have tended to be considered on their own merits crs2 upon the administration of the act and the interpretation of provisions which congress has left largely to the discretion of the secretary of labor this report also considers judicial decisions which inevitably make up substantial part of wagehour issues and have an impact upon enforcement of the statute the several issues discussed here are suggestive and by means definitive none of these issues needs to be taken up in the sense that they are obligatory and indeed the congress may choose not to address any of them for many of these issues general crs background papers exist and are listed in the footnotes the youth subminimum wage under current law subminimum wage at 425 per hour is allowed for youth workers under 20 years of age through the first 90 consecutive days of employment with an employer change was made by the 2007 amendments background during the 1960s and 1970s when major employers of youth workers such as retail and service industries were brought under the flsa the issue of youth sub minimum wage became extremely active proponents of the concept most notably from the hotel and restaurant industries but other segments of the economy as well urged that youth workers be paid at rate lower than the standard minimum wage regardless of experience or the quality of work they performed the period was marked by very high youth unemployment rate especially among black teenagers some suggested that by reducing the wage rate more young workers could be employed others charged that the plan was one more general reduction in wages and chipping away at the minimum wage further in market overflowing with willing workers reducing the wage floor would seem to benefit chiefly employers who might otherwise hire youth workers at the full minimum4 early attempts at subminimum wage the concept of reduced wage for youth had been pending for number of years but it seems only to have been given serious attention during the 1960s and later as industry took up its advocacy conversely organized labor and civil rights groups were strongly opposed 4 see walter williams the shameful roots of minority unemployment readers digest october 1979 pp

1983 p 23 crs3 suggesting that the minimum wage was truly that minimal any further reduction would be inequitable and counterproductive they argued5 during the nixon administration 1972 representative john erlenborn ril proposed an 80 subminimum but the initiative failed in 1974 erlenborn and representative john anderson ril presented new proposal but that too failed to that date the initiative had been associated largely with republicans but in 1977 two democrats became sponsors representatives robert cornell dwi and paul simon dil the cornellsimon proposal called for employment of youth less than 19 yearsofage for up to six months at rate of 85 of the standard minimum wage proposal that some viewed as opening up the labor market to disadvantaged youth representative parren mitchell dmd member of the congressional black caucus though exceedingly grateful for the keen interest that is now being demonstrated in minority youth employment argued that youth differential would be mistake observing that unemployment is chronic and endemic and deep across the board in the black community and it does not make any sense at all to play one group of workers off against another6 again the effort failed as did other similar proposals during the period presidentelect ronald reagan 1980 was believed to support youth sub minimum wage he had been widely quoted to the effect that the minimum wage per had caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the great depression7 as the new administration commenced various hearings were conducted on the issue but again without legislative success representative erlenborn viewed the issue as standoff that some will want higher minimum wage for all workers that others will call for subminimum rate for youth for either side it may have been too high price to pay8 it would be standoff that would continue throughout the reagan presidency bush and experimental youth wages what had been subminimum wage gradually evolved into youth opportunity wage by the 1980s and then once more morphed into training wage by the late 1980s and 1990s the concept was still the same lowering wages would produce jobs for young persons when

measure there followed new round of hearings and negotiations after extended reconsideration congress presented the president with new bill which he did sign and which contained subminimum wage for youth10 the youth wage was initially 335 per hour and after april 1 1991 not less than 335 an hour or 85 of the otherwise standard rate whichever is higher the program was divided into two parts and focused upon youth under 20 yearsofage part one covered cumulative total of 90 days at the subminimum wage with conditions beyond those imposed by the employer and youths willingness to accept the work part two was more complex it involved an additional 90day period and included training wage component11 at the close of 180 days regular minimum wage or more at the employers discretion would be required for the employee the program was experimental to begin on april 1 1990 and to end on april 1 1993 at the end of the trial period the secretary of labor was to provide congress with an assessment as it turned out almost one used the training wage and it was not extended12 clinton and the youth wage made permanent in 1996 minimum wage legislation came up as floor amendment to bill containing tax and other considerations the subminimum wage for youth was just one of its provisions following floor debate and approval in the house the measure was forwarded to the senate negotiations continued in the senate and ultimately the measure was passed with the subminimum wage in place the bill was subsequently signed into law by president william clinton pl 10418813 as

observed i should note that i disagree with certain provisions added to the minimum wage title of the act such as the provision creating new subminimum wage for young people and the one denying increased cash wages to most employees who rely on tips for part of their income still those defects do not obscure the central accomplishment of this act securing the first minimum wage increase since 1991 see public papers of the presidents of the united states william j clinton book continued crs5 employer to pay youth under 20 years of age subminimum wage of 425 per hour through the first 90 consecutive days of employment with an employer having set the youth rate for persons under 20 years of age congress then raised the general minimum to 515 an hour but without linking the youth worker option to the new standard when in may 2007 congress again raised the general minimum wage mention was made of subminimum wage for youth thus under current law youth may be hired at 425 cents an hour legislatively the youth rate is separate issue from the general wage floor14 the tip credit provisions during the 1960s and 1970s the flsa was progressively expanded to cover retail and service employees some of these workers were tipped employees and their employers argued that since they were given tips by the public they the employers should not be required to pay such employees full minimum wage as things stand under the tip credit provisions of the flsa all covered workers do receive at least the federal minimum wage of that wage at least 213 per hour must come directly from the employer the employer may have to include higher amount in order to supplement tips that the employee receives ie to make up for deficiency but whatever tip income the worker receives employers must pay at least 213 per hour through the years the level of the tip credit the difference between 213 per hour and the minimum wage has varied background how much of tipped workers wage should be accounted for through tips how much should be paid directly by the employer speaking generally organized labor and tipped employees may be said to prefer zero tip credit the standard minimum wage should be paid directly by the employer whatever income is derived from tips they suggest should be the property of the tipped employee conversely still speaking generally industry and employers would prefer 100 credit from this viewpoint the employer provides the context for the workers services the quality of the food the ambience and deserves to be reimbursed so long as the worker is actually paid through tips the tip credit thus has become an issue of equity and of percentages the early statute initially persons in the retail and services trades among others were exempted from coverage under the flsa in the 1961 amendments the secretary of labor was instructed to explore the complex problems involving rates 13 continued ii 1996 washington united states government printing

of pay of employees in hotels motels restaurants and other food service enterprises who are exempted from the provisions of this act and to submit report to the congress the result was two reports heavily statistical that examined the general issue of tipped and nontipped employment in the targeted areas through that mechanism the visibility of the issue was raised and the foundations were laid for subsequent actions15 in the 1966 amendments despite significant opposition the new tip credit provision was added to the flsa tipped employee was defined as one who customarily and regularly receives more than 20 month in tips16 an employer could count up to 50 of the applicable minimum wage as tip credit in case of dispute appeal could be made to the secretary thereafter adjustment of the tip credit provision became largely technical moving either up or down as congress judged appropriate when the basic minimum wage was raised in 1974 the credit remained at 5017 in 1977 the tip credit was restructured and the threshold was moved from 20 to 30 per month in tips at the same time congress diminished the value of the credit from 50 down to 45 and to 40 by january 1 198018 then in 1989 congress essentially reversed its action of 1977 new amendments to the act provided that the tip credit would rise to 45 of the minimum wage as of april 1 1990 and to 50 after march 31 199119 the 1996 flsa amendments and beyond in 1996 revisions of the flsa differed somewhat from earlier measures in that they came to the floor as amendments incorporated into bill of special interest to industry the essence of which had little to do with standard wagehour issues20 the bill provided that the credit would remain at 213 per hour or 50 of the then statutory rate of 425 per hour21 then with the minimum cash wage for tipped employees locked into place congress raised the general minimum wage in steps 15 pl 8731 section 13 see us department of labor wage and hour and public contracts

figure 50 of 425 or 213 per hour to specific number 213 per hour to be paid by the employer there was decrease in the employers statutory obligation to his or her employees now to 414 when the 2007 increase in the federal minimum to 725 takes effect in july 2009 the cash wage obligation will sink to 294 of the minimum wage see table 1 the employer however will still be required to supplement the difference between the 213 per hour and the amount theoretically earned through tips where the latter may be insufficient to reach the minimum amount by retaining the current structure of the tip credit the real value of the cash contribution of the employer to the tipped employee can be expected to decline with inflation in that context payment of tipped employee will be transferred from the employer per to the customer at his or her discretion it may be that the current tip credit arrangement is satisfactory conversely some modification in the basic formula might be in order either raising or lowering the terms of the credit or going back to straight percentage figure there may be other possibilities as well table 1 the tip credit under the 2007 amendments to the fair labor

companionship services through long island care and now charged denial of overtime pay and minimum wage22 in justice breyers opinion for the court all third party employees who provide companionship services those hired by firms like long island care at home were termed exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay coverage23 background through the early 1970s there had been efforts to extend coverage under the flsa to new groups of workers among them were persons employed to provide companionship to persons who were aged or infirm24 these companions however may be asked to provide substantially more that is anything that does not require the services of licenced practitioner at the same time there was considerable opposition to extending minimum wage and overtime coverage to these workers much of this opposition was due to the potential cost to employers allen nixon president of the southern states industrial council expressed one aspect of the dilemma nixon was concerned

benefits for domestics some caregivers some babysitters others of more diverse background and skill in 1971 there was total of 24 million persons employed as private household workers excluding babysitters with housekeeping duties their number was 18 million nationwide females comprised threefourths of the domestic workforce some 237 were in the 20 to 44 age bracket 437 were 45 years of age

to have focused upon domestics in broader sense their hours tended to be irregular as did their work nor was it always clear how they might fit into family unit not quite servants and yet not really professionals27 their wages were low28 there was also concern that employers of companionship workers might not accurately report their earnings for social security and related purposes29 devising flsa coverage for caregivers posed number of problems robert thompson for the chamber of commerce thought that minimum wage on domestic employment will double the number of people in that field who are on welfare30 carl perkins dky said exactly the opposite will occur by extending coverage to these workers he stated we will provide more respectable working conditions and sense of dignity31 when new legislation was introduced in 1974 there were still differences to be resolved hr 4757 of the 93rd congress applied both the minimum wage and overtime pay to most domestic workerscaregivers32 the aflcio supported the measure33 but representative bella abzug dny objected there is an unfortunate exception in the present bill domestic workers who live in will not be entitled to overtime compensation here again there was the issue of the family status of livein maids or caregivers34 in the final bill pl 93259 minimum wage and overtime pay provisions were included but not unambiguously congress did not render judgment on each and every category of companionship arrangement thus it provided that coverage would be established for such persons as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the secretary35 interpretation by the wagehour administrator once the 1974 amendments were in place it was left up to the wage and hour administrator betty 26 continued 53 distinction

governed as part of that process her role was to define and to delimit the terms used by the congress certain of the targeted employees she seemed to suggest were not covered by the new requirement because they were already covered under sections 3r and 3s1 of the act36 when the final regulations appeared there may have been reversal murphy noted in an introductory section that one major change was made to section 29 cfr 552109 that deals with the concept of third party employment the new regulations read that domestic employees employed by third party are exempt from the acts minimum wage and overtime pay requirements by virtue of 13a15 emphasis added she stated this interpretation is more consistent with the statutory language and prior practices concerning other similarly worded exemptions37 once enacted the statutes new provision seems not to have attracted major attention38 in november 1976 the national committee on household employment nche trade association with special interest in the field indicated that there had been little compliance with the new law39 clinton bush and the companionship exemption in 1993 and again in 1995 proposed rules were published governing the nature of the companionship exemption under the fair labor standards act in neither case did they move forward finally under date of january 19 2001 just as the clinton administration was leaving office proposed rule was published40 the clinton proposal the role of family and friends in providing companionship services had begun to change before the 1974 amendments making shift to some level of institutionalization of such services these changes produced workers who today provide inhome care and are performing types of duties and working in situations that were not envisioned few years ago thus the wagehour 36 federal register october 1 1974 p 35385 section 13a15 as codified deals with babysitting and companionship services section 3r and 3s1 deal with the enterprise tests murphy

had intended as result the clinton department of labor felt that it was necessary to narrow the exemption so that more workers would be covered under wagehour standards41 the clinton proposal focused upon the charitycompanionship nexus under three scenarios under the first scenario specific percentage of time would need to be devoted to fellowship with the patient but it would need to be significant component of the companions duties under the second scenario fellowship and related duties must take up at least 50 of the caregivers time finally under the third scenario companion would need to spend at least 80 of his or her time in companionship responsibilities in each case some patient related nonfellowship duties could be accommodated cooking meal washing clothing changing bed but clearly such activities would need to be marginal the rule could be interpreted to mean that all third party employment would be subject to minimum wage and overtime pay legislation42 as the clinton proposal defined companionship it might involve reading book or newspaper to the person chatting with him or her about family or other events playing cards watching television or going for walk the activity must involve personal interaction between the inhome care provider and the care recipient in order for the proposed companionship services exemption to apply distinction would need to be made between an impersonal maid and personal companion43 the bush administrations reaction having inherited the clinton rule the bush administration in late april extended the comment period to july 23 2001 dol in general way reviewed the clinton proposal and noted that continuing interest had been expressed concerning the measure44 as of the july deadline the bureau of national affairs reported dol had received more than 800 responses employers in the home health care industry are stridently resisting the change some from within the administration were also opposed turning from the provider to the recipient of services it was noted that the change would force thirdparty employers to charge higher hourly fees for the services of the care providers45 attorneys for the health care industry argued that the existing regulations are entirely consistent with the statute and accompanying legislative history and that current regulations all have been approved by the courts as an accurate portrayal of 41 federal register january 19 2001 p 5482 the companionship exemption is written in double negatives from the clinton administrations perspective the intent was to reduce or narrow the exemption so that fewer workers would qualify as exempt and thus that more workers would be protected under minimum wage and overtime pay requirements 42 federal register january 19 2001 pp

representatives for workers applauded dols initiative given the shortage of home care services it is more important than ever to foster working conditions that create stable workforce and to promote conditions that include adequate wages and benefits good training supervision and advancement potential47 in april 2002 dol withdrew the clinton companionship proposal the notice observed based on its review of the rulemaking record as whole the department has decided to withdraw the proposed rule and terminate the rulemaking action48 recent legislative interest in the wake of dols withdrawal of the companionship rule the matter returned to the courts the issue is one about which reasonable people may disagree and indeed the second circuit court had ruled twice against long island care however the supreme court has now ruled unanimously affirming the exemption of third party employees who provide companionship services from the requirements of the flsa49 in september 2007 bills were

reference to as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the secretary crs13 indexation of the minimum wage indexation of the minimum wage has been topic of discussion among economists through nearly century increasingly during recent years the states have moved in this direction with several states having indexed their own minimum wage among them arizona missouri montana oregon vermont and washington might indexation work at the federal level some think that it might others are less certain while still others reject the concept outright the concept of indexation various theories have been offered with respect to indexation of the minimum wage in general the concept would be to anchor the minimum to an independent economic variable such as the consumer price index cpi or average hourly earnings in manufacturing ahe other options are also available according to some proponents of indexation if one were to link the minimum wage to the cpi for example it could be expected automatically to keep pace with inflation however use of indexation would seem to imply looking backward to last quarter or to last year and using that level of increase as the basis for increasing the federal minimum wage given the variation in the economy backward looking model may have certain drawbacks although indexation may be viewed as device through which members of congress would be relieved of responsibility for wage settings some suggest that having members actively involved rather than having formula is useful this depends upon ones interpretation of the minimum wage whether it represents social policy or conversely is primarily an economic measure to be used on occasion in response to general economic conditions having the minimum wage associated with relatively stable economic variable could provide assurance to lowwage workers that as the costofliving increases their earnings will also increase under the present system there have been relatively long periods during which the minimum wage was not raised sometimes for as long as decade while the general economy moved along an upward trajectory at times this was the result of philosophical design on other occasions it may have resulted from the press of business before the congress however during such periods the statutory wage of the working poor has been allowed to atrophy51 early concerns and equity during 1937 and 1938 congress debated the federal minimum wage under severe pressure from certain parts of the country notably the south it agreed to 25 cent per hour minimum to be phased up to 40 cents an hour over the next seven years in the process there was twoprong approach general structure of wages 51 for more serious study of indexation see crs report rl30927 the federal minimum wage the issue of indexation by gerald mayer crs14 plus wage board the latter an appointed body under the secretary of labor would inspect various industries since most covered workers were industrial and assess whether and how soon they could meet the 40 cent minimum52 during the 1940s and 1950s the issue of indexation arose in hearings with considerable bipartisan support but action was taken in the early 1970s the concept received somewhat more consideration with an early proposal by representative john dent dpa which would have raised the minimum wage to 300 an hour and thereafter indexed it to the cpi53 but again action was taken on the dent bill consideration of indexation was renewed during the carter administration ray marshall secretary of labor throughout the carter era proposed in 1977 250 minimum followed by indexation at 50 percent of the straight time hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers dent had proposal from the aflcio floor at 300 an hour with an automatic mechanism in the law to provide for 60 of average hourly earnings in manufacturing ahe54 meanwhile another proposal emerged in the senate 265 minimum followed by 53 of the ahe formula55 the house acted first representative john erlenborn ril proposed to rid the bill as he termed it of the mindless thoughtless rule of indexation56 erlenborn carried the day by vote of 223 ayes to 193 nays indexation for all practical purposes was dead for the duration of the 95th congress subsequent legislative interest during the reagan administration proposals to increase the minimum wage whether through indexation or by other more direct means were largely set aside when george h w bush took office in 1989 congressional interest in raising the wage and indexing it resumed some members were concerned about indexation but not always through hostility toward the concept an exchange between gerald kleczka dwi and austin murphy dpa the latter chair of the subcommittee on labor standards may be illustrative 52 the wage board concept continued up into the 1940s but after the war it fell into disuse in more recent times the concept has been utilized with respect to the offshore territories

indexation formula pl 10115758 following the 1989 amendments there seems to have been change in the approach to indexation of the minimum wage although the issue was raised in almost every congress through series of individual bills the concept was not linked to the more general enactments that were adopted in 1996 and in 2007 still interest has been sustained and given its long legislative history it may not be unlikely that someone will once again introduce the issue59 the small business exemption under the flsa provision has been made for small businesses to be exempt from the minimum wage andor the payment of overtime where their workers are employed for more than 40 hours week the terms of such provisions have varied through the years under the 1989 flsa amendments still in effect small businesses defined as those that earn 500000 or less in gross receipts are exempt however there is an offsetting provision where worker is engaged in interstate commerce he or she may be individually covered by the statute early history of the small business provision the fair labor standards act initially applied largely to industrial employees significant numbers of workers were exempt or not covered by its provisions for example agricultural retail and service workers including public employees and those who would be defined as not being engaged in interstate commerce in this manner among other things substantial number of workers employed by small businesses were excluded from the act 57 us cong house the minimum wage restoration act of 1987 hearings before the

whittaker crs16 still there were numerous small business people who rightly as it turned out anticipated that the act would gradually be expanded through the years to include progressively greater numbers of employers and workers some of the concerns expressed by the small business community were generic having to do with federal regulation of industry by government other concerns were rooted in the particular features of the wagehour legislation then before congress but the question some raised and still raise was should small businesses if profitable be allowed an exemption and be permitted to pay their workers less than the otherwise standard federal minimum wage based solely upon their size conversely should profitability be consideration in wagehour applicability much of the early argument against the minimum wage was framed in terms of small business some argued that the tremendous amount and prohibitive cost of the bookkeeping and records involved would make payment of the minimum wage inequitable for small business and involve such businesses in processes with which they are unfamiliar60 as was frequently true the case for small business was argued not in terms of the owners ie personal loss of profit but rather as defense of employees of small firm who would surely be hurt if profits for their employers were affected it is the little fellow for whom i am talking observed one member it is the little industries in my district that are giving employment to those few people situated way up on the mountains and out in the country that cannot pay this wage those people he suggested will be out of employment61 while some expressed concern that adoption of minimum wage would have negative impact upon the economy others expressed sense that employers under the profit motive were opposing such legislation in order to enhance their personal or corporate gain one senator proposed that firms employing 10 or fewer than 10 persons be automatically excluded from wagehour coverage62 yet another argued i do not care whether the manufacturing unit is small one or large one the american people are opposed to the exploitation and oppression of workers in plants of any size63 member from texas affirmed i think that we can all agree that any industry that serves useful economic purpose should be able to pay this wage the projected minimum and operate on this workweek64 while member from pennsylvania responded industry can be but of negative value to society if its existence is predicated upon paying of wages lower than that required to support the american family up to established standards in america65 others were perhaps less dramatic i look upon minimum wage such as will afford decent living as part of sound national policy affirmed senator

to the minimumwage employees in the united states66 small business and current policy debate about the impact of minimum wage or small business exemption eventually came down to the actual wording of the statute the intent of the legislation may not always have been clear as the act was expanded and new groups of workers were included protests arose from employers on some occasions congress designed an exemption to meet particular industry and it wrote into the statute very specialized language on other occasions exemptions were more generic that is employers earning less than given amount would not be covered the various modes of exemption came to exist sidebyside in 1977 general small business exemption was set at 362500 but with other options included for particular industries the result seems to have caused confusion among employers and possibly among workers67 with the 1989 amendments to the flsa there was some effort at consolidation figure of 500000 taking into account increased general wages and prices seemed reasonable to some and congress adopted it68 as reported in the house it was explained small enterprises whose total volume of sales or business done is less than 500000 would longer be covered in eliminating several confusing tests to determine applicability of the act to various industries the committee continues to demonstrate its sic support for the principle of true small business exemption the report continued this streamlined threshold test coupled with the elimination of exemptions elsewhere in the act should make it much easier to determine which enterprises are covered and which are not 69 the measure was signed into law in midnovember 1989 in early february an article in the nations restaurant news explained that in consolidating and simplifying the language of the act the meaning had been altered requiring that some firms that might have been exempt under dollar volume test 500000 would now fall under an interstate commerce test as result employers will need to categorize each employee to determine which ones engage in 66 congressional record july 29 1937 p 7793 67 in some states small business exemptions were arranged under state law either superseding the federal standard or adding nuances of interpretation to it generally the standard more nearly in the interest of the worker prevails but that may not always be readily apparent to the parties concerned 68 see section 3a to of pl 101157 69 us cong house fair labor standards amendments of 1989 report together with minority and additional views to accompany hr 2710

exemption general test at 500000 but also an individual test based upon the work performed by each employee during the next several months bills were introduced that proposed to correct what some members viewed as miscalculation by drafters of the 1989 legislation but what others saw as clear statement of policy ultimately congress moved on to other matters without altering the 1989 amendment when the 1996 and 2007 flsa amendments were before congress the dispute over the small business exemption was superceded by other interests71 treatment of persons with disabilities under section 14c of the flsa special treatment is afforded to persons with physical or mental disabilities under certificates issued by the secretary of labor such persons can be employed at rates below those otherwise specified in the flsa and with absolute minimum wages for persons with disabilities are based upon the relative productivity of the individual that is the commensurate wage rate origins of section 14c the origins of section 14c are linked to the national industrial recovery act of the early new deal codes of conduct which normally included minimum wages and overtime pay were written for most industries once in place they provoked complaints that employers took advantage of the codes to break down decent standards for workers some charged that ordinary workers were artfully classified to exempt them from otherwise applicable labor standards this may have been according to some observers especially notable with respect to older workers and to minorities72 70 the nations restaurant

flsa was adopted and under section 14 later section 14c the several approaches were drawn together the wage and hour administrator dol set floor of not less than 75 of the standard 25 cent federal minimum wage however fearing that the specified rate might disrupt the work of rehabilitation being carried on by charitable groups he ruled that the wages in sheltered workshops special facilities employing the disabled would be set on the basis of earning capacity73 thus in practice dual standard was established productivity wage in sheltered workshops and specific minimum rate for other sheltered employment from the beginning the social services industry tended to dominate the program and generally spoke for employers of the disabled it was not clear however who spoke for persons with disabilities once the program had been established it continued in place through the next several decades reform and oversight practical problems arose in the administration of the program some though disabled sought employment in the private sector and at the minimum wage or better their compensation would be arranged whether collectively or individually on the same basis as other workers some workers remained sheltered under variety of programs more complex issue was the basic structure of the program within the system some workers were marginally disabled and with minor assistance could function nearly as well or in some cases better than the standard worker others were severely disabled perhaps victims of several interrelated disabling conditions often the two groups the marginally disabled and the severely disabled seem to have found themselves associated in single work environment and under circumstances that affected mutual productivity this may have been especially notable where production was shared or where an integrated unit was produced in such cases how were each of the parties responsible for only segment of product to be paid74 these questions have persisted through the years advocacy groups for the disabled tended to be fragmented representing groups of individuals with different types of disabilities and to this were added other problems for example whether the disabled were to be regarded as clients or as patients was an important consideration where treatment was concerned over time the issues continued to be debated in 1986 new hearings resulted in more formal treatment of the disabled and new compensation structure the commensurate rate under this formula wage rates were to be determined as follows 73 us department of labor wage and hour division press releases r series october 12 1938 and november 10 1938 74 in theory shared work with shared responsibility might assist the more severely disabled to develop better industrial skills but in practice it seems to have been source of endless dispute among the parties creating sense of frustration on both sides since in practice all of the nonsupervisory workers were in some measure disabled crs20 lower than the minimum wage applicable under section 206 of this title b commensurate with those paid to nonhandicapped workers employed in the vicinity in which the individuals under the certificates are employed for essentially the same type quality and quantity of work and c related to the individuals productivity75 thus the system continued at the discretion of employers administrators parents or guardians and only after the rules and procedures had been established it appears were those individuals actively engaged in work or therapy either patients or as clients brought into the picture the current structure in midmarch of 1994 representative austin murphy dpa chairman of the labor standards subcommittee convened an oversight hearing on experience under the 1986 legislation murphy explained that in 1986 we listened primarily to the nonprofit employers and carefully considered the explanations of the work administrators the result had been an arrangement which had offered expedited hearings on complaints of disabled workers few complaints had emerged however and the subcommittee wanted to learn why was there lack of problems or some difficulty in reporting them 76 testimony seemed to fall into three groups industry representatives seemed satisfied with things as they were b spokesman for the blind james gashel was more blunt i am here to tell you that the safeguards are not working gashel then proceeded to lay out the case for the blind or vision impaired77 c there was testimony from donald elisburg former assistant secretary of labor in the late 1970s elisburg characterized the present system for challenging workshop abuses as study in futility he reminded the subcommittee that persons filing these complaints were fighting for the option of being paid only at the federal minimum wage the hearings though contentious did not produce legislation78 the issue continues today very much as it has through the greater

reached thereafter according to the 2007 legislation they will proceed along in tandem with the flsa standard in addition study was to be made by dol that would focus on insular conditions in the wake of changing wage rates79 american samoa the samoan islands are of two segments western samoa formerly british and now independent and american samoa cluster of seven islands with small population governed from the insular capital of pago pago there has been an american presence in samoa since the latter 19th century but with the spanish american war 1898 there developed series of treaties and leases between the insular officials and the united states in 1900 president william mckinley directed the navy to assume responsibility for eastern thereafter american samoa in 1951 authority was transferred to the department of the interior doi and that agency began concerted recruitment for an economic base that could replace the naval station as it closed down in 1938 it appears mention was made of minimum wage coverage for american samoa but generally it was assumed that it was covered just as were puerto rico and the virgin islands in 1948 legal action involving the british territory of bermuda vermilyabrown co inc et v connell et 335 us 377 1948 raised eyebrows and prospects of insular wage rates though vermilya brown did not deal with samoa its implications were felt there in 1956 van camp sea foods recruited by doi to come to samoa sought special arrangement under the flsa an administered minimum wage as was then operational in puerto rico and the virgin islands the issue was referred to the 79 impact of increasing minimum wages on the economies of american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands prepared by office of the assistant secretary for policy us department of labor january 2008 crs22 congress which amended the statute to accommodate insular development some fifty years later the insular minimum wage had remained at subminimum level and tuna canning had become the largest private sector industry in the islands government was the largest public sector employer each has supported maintaining low wage rates now under the 2007 flsa amendments the insular minimum wage has once more been restructured the rate by industry was raised by 50 cents per hour on july 24 2007 it was scheduled to be increased by industry by another 50 cents per hour on may 25 2008 it will then be increased each may 25 again by industry until the federal rate has been reached american samoa will then fall under the same minimum wage structure as the states of the union commonwealth of the northern mariana islands the cnmi controlled sequentially by spain germany and japan was part of the united nations trust territory administered by the united states after world war ii during the mid1970s movement for expanded selfdetermination commenced this led ultimately to the creation and ratification of the covenant of association 19751976 between the mariana islands and the united states establishing the current commonwealth status like guam and american samoa the northern mariana islands are lightly populated culturally different from the united states and geographically distant most of the population resides on saipan but with several other islands notably tinian and rota sharing in density as trust territory unlike guam or samoa the mariana islands were not initially thought of as part of the united states per rather they seem to have been regarded as in temporary association with the united states thus establishment of us standards for the local population may not have been high priority in 1947 shortly after the close of world war ii the northern marianas were still undergoing transition to cash economy and lacked both trade unions and traditional wage standards80 with time things seem to have changed little in 1976 the department of state reported that there is minimum wage law for the trust territory and that wage rate determination is very much up to each employer81 with the adoption of the covenant responsibility for labor standards was divided between the cnmi and the united states the united states assumed responsibility for example for regulating overtime pay but left issues related to the minimum wage in the hands of the cnmi meanwhile the cnmi saipan took responsibility for alien labor immigration it was also agreed that goods produced in the cnmi would move in commerce under made in america label 80 us department of state 27th annual report to the united nations trust territory of the pacific

flsa rate after which the two rates will move forward in tandem complications in each of these jurisdictions american samoa and the cnmi the problems are quite similar finding work for their resident populations the circumstances were it appears somewhat different in the cnmi the garment industry has largely left the islands reportedly the victim of tariffs and wage rates in american samoa the tuna canneries have threatened to leave though they have not yet done so reportedly for similar reasons given the economy of the general area the proximity to other lowwage countries can suitable employment be found and can these islands emerge as prosperous members of the american community84 as the insular minimum wage increases toward parity with the federal minimum representative eni f h

the 20th century massachusetts wisconsin oregon the district of columbia california and other jurisdictions had experimented with various aspects of wage regulation but often where such efforts were effective they were overturned by the courts then in 1937 the supreme court in west coast hotel co v parrish86 reversed long tradition of opposing federal regulation of labor standards by affirming the right of the state of washington to regulate working conditions federal legislation was promptly introduced with passage of the fair labor standards act the following year attention focused upon the federal jurisdiction and intermittently the federal act has been expanded new focus of legislative authority after 1938 the thrust of minimum wage and related legislation came to rest in washington dc while the states continued frequently to enact and to update their state minimum wage laws these seem largely to have been peripheral filling in gaps in the federal legislation or where deemed appropriate extending coverage to specific groups that had been exempted under the federal statute decline of value of the federal standard up to the 1980s consideration of the minimum wage remained largely with the federal government then during the 1980s the statute remained somewhat dormant in 1989 there was momentary boost during the bush presidency as the rate moved in steps from 335 an hour in place since 1981 to 425 an hour by 199187 after the 1989 round the minimum wage declined in value under the impact of attrition until 1996 when twostep increase was enacted bringing the wage floor to 425 in 1996 and to 515 in1997 nothing further occurred for more than decade in 2007 the wage was once more raised in steps to projected level of 725 an hour by mid2009 however by the time that the 2007 increases will have been given effect the real value of the minimum wage will have declined substantially leaving the field open once again to the states88 86 west coast hotel co v

the federal statute failed to keep pace with inflation during periods in which there was action at the federal level the focus shifted back to the states see table 2 there are now 34 states and other jurisdictions that have wage rates in excess of the federal minimum and several of the states have indexed the minimum rate to increase at regular intervals see section on indexation the shift from federal action back to the states may seem appropriate to some but it may also have implications for public policy for industry and for labor it means dealing with variety of jurisdictions each with its own standard it may also mean renewed competition between highwage state and state with relatively low wages89 for investors it could also be factor among many in considering where to invest especially in regions where there may be significant crossborder traffic or where other factors come into play for example in states with righttowork laws 90 though wage rates may differ from one state to the next other aspects of wagehour law may also be different for example in some states tip credit may not be allowed while just across the state border it may be or hiring youth workers at subminimum rate may be permitted in one state but precluded in neighboring state in short each state may prescribe its own conditions for employment so long as they do not conflict with the federal standard under the flsa where there is conflict between state and federal standards the requirements most in favor of the worker the higher standard normally will prevail as state rates rise relative to the federal standard states could find themselves in competition for jobs and for development 89 one of the elements discussed in the 1937 debates was interstate competition based upon wage rates more recently during hearings in 1995 senator nancy kassebaum rka noting that massachusetts had raised its state minimum wage above the federal inquired of senator john kerry dma if we keep it the federal minimum wage at 425 do you think businesses would consider relocating in say kansas or somewhere else if there is that disparity because it obviously is going to be consideration for some businesses senator kerry responded that was and is an issue that was raised and it is very legitimate question i am passionately committed to not having massachusetts be disadvantaged as to other states and clearly one of the things any business will look at is the question of the minimum wage see us senate fair labor standards act the minimum wage hearings of the committee on labor and human

on march 31 2003 wagehour administrator tammy mccutchen published in the federal register proposed rule updating section 13a1 that portion of the flsa that deals with minimum wages and overtime coverage for executive administrative or professional eap workers under section 13a1 bona fide staff in the several categories are exempt from the basic wage and hour provisions of the statute the mccutchen proposal was contentious triggering several congressional hearings speaking generally organized labor was strongly opposed to the new regulation the department of labor was strongly in support of the change with modification final rule was issued in april 2004 taking effect in august 2004 since that time dol has been engaged in review of the operation of the rule offering series of new opinion letters administrative advisories on classification of workers about the rule the original rule governing eap workers with roots going back to the early new deal era had been given effect in 1938 and had been revised periodically up to 1975 thereafter although various suggested changes were announced the regulation was not updated until the 20032004 rulemaking as implemented in order to qualify for exemption from the flsa targeted workers have to be paid at least 23660 per year and be engaged in activities that would qualify one as an executive administrator or professional for persons paid in excess of 100000 per year there is presumption that he or she has met the qualifying criteria absent any contention to the contrary what does it mean to qualify for exempt status if one meets the salary and duties tests one is an eap employee this means in effect that one does not need to be paid for overtime hours worked regardless of how frequent and extensive such overtime may become working through to the completion of ones task is merely part of the responsibility that goes along with being an executive an administrator or professional thus there is tradeoff each of these categories may have certain advantages associated with them but in wagehour terms the bottom line is relatively simple eap workers do not need to be paid overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 per week there are two tests for qualification under the rule the first test is one of salary as noted above the second test involves duties each position is judged individually but the duties of each individual worker can present problem for example when is an emergency medical technician professional or simply staffer with very serious work but with real professional responsibility how about funeral director journalist paralegal or chef in each of these fields and in many others clear distinction between exempt and nonexempt must rest upon precise analysis of the work that is being crs28 performed the duties test number of questions need to be asked does the worker exercise independent discretion and judgment does he have choice of work assignments and some measure of independence over the content of his work does she have the power to hire or fire subordinates what is their primary duty and as telling how important is their primary duty to their employer such questions under dol regulations need to be addressed for each type of work and frequently must be defined in the context of the work environment and culture in some cases though it may longer be controlling the amount of time that one spends in performance of task may assist in determining eap status is one task an executive or administrative or professional function performed once year sufficient to render worker exempt or if one looks at the element of hiring and firing of subordinates does the decision rest strictly with the putative epa worker or is there an internal review panel that oversees such actions how much real latitude does the worker have the duties test can be enormously complex involving categories of workers across the entire spectrum it can also be source of near endless litigation as persons move into and out of exempt or nonexempt status in place and being tested the new rule is in place and being tested91 during recent months the department has been engaged in numerous reevaluations of the work processes of eap workers mainly these reviews and analyses deal with the duties test but such efforts tend to be of limited reach often resting upon specific case and particular assumptions and unable to be applied with confidence to general categories of workers in early 2004 prior to release of the final rule labor secretary elaine chao stated that the primary goal of the proposed rule is to have better rules in place that will benefit more workers especially lowwage workers its intent she affirmed is to restore overtime protections especially to lowwage vulnerable workers who have little bargaining power with employers ms chao added clear concise and updated rules will better protect workers and strengthen the departments ability to enforce the law92 when the final rule was released in april 2004 ms chao stated the department is very proud of the final rule93 she added that she was pleased to see people recognize the significant gains to workers under our final rule and noted that there can be doubt that workers win94 91 see crs report rl32088 the fair labor standards act historical sketch of the overtime pay requirements of section 13a1 by william g whittaker 92 testimony of labor secretary elaine chao january 20 2004 senate appropriations committee website visited january 29 2004 93 secretary chao testimony before the house committee on education and the workforce april 28 2004 94 secretary chao is quoted in kirstin downey plan expands eligibility for overtime pay continued crs29 but again there are two tests involved raising the qualifying floor to 23660 may be win for certain low income workers95 how the law or regulation might affect worker earning 30000 year higher than required but in some regions low wage assigned as primary duty an executive or administrative or professional function and be stripped of hisher overtime pay protections may be less clear96 the dispute continued through the implementation date in august 2004 and into the 109th congress 2005 but largely without effect the predictions were not accurate howard radzely then dols solicitor was quoted as saying shortly after the new regulations had gone into effect almost without exception the reports indicate people are gaining overtime protection97 later radzely was quoted as saying we have not seen single incident let alone the predicted 6 million incidents of an employee who has lost pay as result of the regulations and further once we got past the extreme rhetoric there have been surprisingly few issues in contention98 the real test may come with the administration of the rule in particular the longterm impact upon the kinds of workers to which ms chao has referred recently the bureau of national affairs reported that three years after the new fair labor standards act whitecollar exemption regulations were implemented referring to discussion by panel of attorneys at the american bar associations employment law section the changes have opened the door to new areas of wage and hour litigation that were not predicted when the rules were launched steven zeiff an attorney from san francisco suggested that the increased emphasis on the duties test has occurred because the new regulations clarified that the whitecollar exemption analysis should look to an employees duties and not merely the job title zeiff stated courts are all over the place when it comes to the duties test99 the administration is several years into the new section 13a1 regulations have workers been bumped up or down in terms of pay and duties as result of these tests in order to assist them in qualifying for exemption how many noneap workers from before the rule was implemented now find themselves with the status 94 continued washington post april 20 2004 p a8 95 under the 1975 regulation in effect until august 2004 an executive or administrator could be paid 155 per week 8060 per year professional 170 per week 8840 per year and could still qualify for eap status the minimum wage at that time would have earned worker roughly 10712 96 in presenting the final rule the department affirmed the existing duties tests are so confusing complex and outdated that often employment lawyers and even wage and hour division investigators have difficulty determining whether employees qualify for the exemption see federal
