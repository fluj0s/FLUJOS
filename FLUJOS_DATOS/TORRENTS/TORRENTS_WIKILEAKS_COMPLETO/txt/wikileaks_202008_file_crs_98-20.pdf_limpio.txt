nate version would liberalize the rules on attorneys fees in internal revenue code 7430 and house section 312 and senate section 3102 would permit taxp ayers to collect damages for negligent actions of irs collection agents attorneys fees and costs under present law any person who substa ntially prevails in tax case involving determination collection or refund of taxes interest or penalties may be awarded reasonable administrative costs incurred after the earlier of the date the taxpayer receives the notice of the decision of the irs office of appeals or the date of the notice of deficiency and reasonable litigation costs only individuals with net worth of 2 million or less and corporations with net worth of 7 million or less can be awarded costs the biggest component of reasonable costs is atto rneys fees but reimbursementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9820crs2 for attorneys fees is limited to 110 per hour as adjusted for inflation in certain cases court may award more than 110 per hour if the court finds that special factor justifies higher rate in case can reasonable co sts exceed the amount actually paid or owed under current law taxpayers can only be awarded attorneys fees for services of attorneys although cpas and enrolled agents are author ized to practice before the tax court and the irs currently only actua l costs may be reimbursed the house version of the bill proposes five minor changes in irc 7430 the provision dealing with awards of costs fi rst although the bill retains the statutory cap on attorneys fees judges would be permitted to adjust the award of attorneys fees upward based on the difficulty of the issues presented in the case or on the local availability of tax expertis second administrative co sts could be awarded on the earliest of three occasions the two under existing law ie the date of appeals office notice or the date of notice of deficiency or the date on which the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the internal revenue service office of appeals is sent this change should allow taxpayers to be reimbursed for administrative costs incurred before the actual notice of deficiency third fees for the services of cpas and enro lled agents authorized to practice before the tax court or before the internal revenue service may be awarded to prevailing taxpayers as if those individuals were attorneys f ourth the statute would be amended to allow court to award appropriate ttorneys fees to those who undertake pro bono representation of taxpayers fifth in determining wh ether the position of the irs was substantially justified the court would be required to take into account whether the irs has lost in courts of appeal for other circuits on substantially similar issues the committee on ways and means report hrept 105364 at 59 indicat that the court may also take into account whether the united states has won in c ourts of appeal for other circuits this provision could present courts with the d ecision of whether to punish the irs for inappropriately pursuing lost cause or whether to tolerate an irs attempt to obtain conflict between circuits in order to have the supreme court decide an issue the senate version contains seven changes to current law 1 it would eliminate the statutory cap on attorneys fees and permit the award of reasonable fees paid or incurred 2 like the house bill it would permit administrative costs to be awarded for attorneys fees incurred as early as the date on which the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the internal revenue service office of appeals is sent 3 like the house bill the substitute would permit fees to be awarded to those individuals admitted to practice before the tax court or the irs 4 courts could award reasonable attorneys fees in excess of those actually paid or incurred if an individual represented prevailing party for free or for nominal fee 5 the senate version is identical to the house bill in taking into account whether the irs has lost in courts of appeal for other circuits on substantially similar issues 6 the senate bill goes beyond the house bill in that it would treat taxpayer as having substantially prevailed if irs wins but the judgment is for less than qualified offer made by the taxpayer during the qualified ffer period 7 the senate version would allow taxpayer to be awarded attorneys fees in addition to damages allowed under current law if the taxpayer prevails in case involving unauthorized inspection or disclosure of tax return or tax return information under irc 7431 the bills do not propose changes to the net worth requirements in both versions the changes are proposed to apply to cost s incurred or for pro bono services performed more than 180 days after the date of enactmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9820crs3 damages for disregard of the law under present law irc 7433 taxpayer may sue the government for up to 1 million of damages caused by an irs officer or employee who recklessly or intentionally disregarded the law while collecting the taxpayers taxes damages can be reduced if the taxpayer did not exhaust available administrative remedies or if the taxpayer did not take reasonable steps to mitigate damages both versions of hr 2676 propose to expand the authority to pay damages to include cases where the irs causes taxpayer economic damages because of negligent disregard of the internal revenue code or regulations while collecting taxpayers taxes damage s for negligence would be limited to 100000 and taxpayers would have to exhaust available ad ministrative remedies before court could award any damages the committee on wa ys and means report hrept 105364 indicates at 59 that inadvertent errors in irs functions such as in computer programming do not trigger the pplication of this provision the senate version would provide for payment of damages in two additional situations first it would amend irc 7426 which under current law gives third parties whose property has been wrongfully sold or vied on by the irs certain remedies the senate version would permit third parties to recover the lesser of 1 million or actual damages sustained as the result of an irs em ployees reckless or intentional disregard of the internal revenue laws the limit woul d be the lesser of 100000 or actual damages if the irs employees actions were negligent plaintiffs would be required to exhaust administrative remedies before going to c ourt second irc 7433 relating to damages for unauthorized collection actions would be amended to include willful violations of certain provisions of the bankruptcy code i ncluding the automatic stay provisions and the effect of discharge provisions damages for violations of title 11 the bankruptcy code could be awarded by bankruptcy court both versions would apply to actions of officers and employees of the internal revenue service after the date of enactment
