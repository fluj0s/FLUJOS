assistance and welfare background and issues summary the 19951996 debate over creation of bl ock grant to states for cash aid to needy families with children temporary assistance for needy families tanf focused on reducing welfare rolls by prom oting work except for child care costs it gave scant attention to other living expenses of lowincome parents the issues of housing cost and affordability were essentially absent fro m the debate although rent is the largest expense for many lowincome families the important role housing plays in familie s lives has been recognized through system of programs administered by the department of housing and urban development hud that subsidize the hous ing costs of lowincome families the three major direct housing assistance pr ograms are the lowrent public housing program the housing choice voucher pr ogram also known as section 8 vouchers and projectbased rental assistance both housing programs and tanf are designed to serve the needs of low income households as result many lowincome families w ho receive tanf cash assistance or services or have in the past also qualify for housing assistance it is estimated by crs that possibly half million households were receiving both cash welfare assistance and housing assistance in 2001 although the two programs in many cases serve the same populations the structures and rules of the two programs are often in conflict this inconsistency in program rules can lead to inefficiencies for dual program participants some ch anges have been made to enhance the compatibility of housing and welfare progra ms further changes to one or both of the programs to enhance coor dination have been considered as part of the debate surrounding both welfare reauthorization and proposed housing

welfare background and issues introduction this country has long deba ted how best to meet the needs of the poor some argue that income supplements that allo w families to participate in the consumer market are the most effective and efficient means for the government to ensure that the basic needs of the poor are met others argue that poor people cannot effectively participate in the free market for variety of reasons beyond income and as result society has responsibility to provide them with the goods and services they need to survive the social welfare programs r by the federal gove rnment have shifted from time to time in their relative emphasis on providing cash welfare versus subsidizing the costs of goods and services looking at the changes in welfare and housing programs over time helps to illustrate this tension during and after the great depressi on the government created number of programs that provided both cash welfare nd subsidized goods and services to the poor the social security act of 1935 offere d grants to states to help fund cash aid for three groups of needy persons child ren aid to dependent children aged persons oldage assistance and blind pe rsons aid to the blind the housing act of 1937 created federal constructi on program both to create jobs and to stimulate the economy as well as to build lowcost housing for the poor by the late 1930s and early 1940s the federal governme nt was providing surplus food to the poor in select cities in 1964 the food st amp program was enacted both to eliminate surplus food as well as supplement the f ood needs of the poor in 1965 the medicaid program which provided access to h ealth care for the poor was created by the late 1960s the childrens cash we lfare program renamed aid to families with dependent children afdc had become the target of widespread criticism some argued that cash welfare programs for single mothers promoted outofwedlock childbirth and dependency while discouraging work at the same time critics attacked federal housing programs c iting rising crime in publicly constructed housing developments and chronic fraud nd abuse in their management in 1969 president nixon proposed radical change to the federal social welfare system guaranteed minimum income in the form of negative income tax nixons plan was not adopted but some reforms were made to the cash welfare program by 1973 nixon declared moratorium on all federa l housing construction programs in their place number of programs were devel oped the largest being system of rental subsidies which families could use in

to provide families with temporary cash benefit while they transitioned into work under tanf states have new flexibility which paired with large reduction in the welfare caseload in the mid1990s has made it possible for them to use their tanf funds to provide wide range of services including child care and jobsearch assistance spending on services now accounts for larger portion of tanf spending

families is often ju stified by looking at the percentage of income that these families pay for housing the general rule used by hud is that housing is affordable if it costs more than 30 of lowincome familys annual gross income many lowincome families pay much more than 30 of their incomes towards housing costs according to the 2003 state of the nations housing released by the harvard joint center for housing studies there were over 14 million households who were severely rentburdened meaning that they paid more than half of their income towards rent almost 75 of these 14 million severely

housing number of direct housing assistance programs have been deve loped these programs are administered by the department of housing and urba n development hud and authorized under the housing act of 1937 pl 93383 as amended according to the 1937 act it is the policy of the united states that our nation should promote the goal of providing decent and affordable housing for all citizens through the efforts and encouragement of federal state and cal governments and by the independent and collective actions of private citizens organizations and the private sector the three major forms of direct7 housing assistance currently administered by hud are the lowrent public housing program the housing choice voucher program and projectbased assistance programs public housing is rental housing that was cons tructed using federal funds and is publicly owned and managed by local quasigovernmental public housing authorities phas lowincome fa milies who live in public housing pay approximately 30 of their incomes for rent the costs of maintaining the buildings beyond what can be supported by tenant rents are subsidized by the federal government in fy2003 there were 12 million pub lic

families and indi viduals to lease housing from private landlords families who r eceive vouchers pay between 30 and 40 of their incomes towards rent and the federal government subsidizes the remainder

number of people who receive direct cash assistance from tanf they are not required to track the number of people who par ticipate in tanf funded services approximately 22 million families received cash assistance from tanf in fy200313 in fy2003 24 of adults who received cash assistance from tanf were employed in paid jobs their averag monthly earnings were 621 while on the tanf rolls this amount is well below the poverty level and low enough that most families working and on the tanf caseload would be eligible for housing assistance however only approximately 20 of the caseload reported receiving some form of housing assistance14 states are not required to track those who have left the tanf cash assistance caseloads although national data are unava ilable some resear chers have tried to study this population referred to as wel fare leavers hhs funded leaver studies have found that for most leavers earround work paid more than welfare however the average monthly income for leavers from all sources including income generally lies near the poverty line many leavers come back to welfare the leaver studies found that between onequart er and onethird of all families who left welfare returned within one year15 housing assistance it was estimated that in fy2004 approximately 5 million housing units were eligible to r eceive some form of direct housing assistance16 because housing assistance is provided through multiple programs data on the entire population of housing assistance recipients are not readily available however data are available on the character istics of the populations of the individual programs this program specific data can be used to make so generalizations as table 2 illustrates large percentage of the housing assistance caseload is elderly or disabled this portion of th housing assistance caseload is much lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32104crs8 17 some elderly and disabledheaded households may receive childonly tanf benefit if they are caring for the child of lowincome parent they may also be receiving tanf funded services 18 housing data defines welfare to include both tanf cash assistance as well as state funded general assistance hud estimates that only about 12 of the housing assistance caseload receives general assistance since the vast majority of families who report receiving welfare receive tanf cash assistance for the purposes of this paper welfare will be defined as tanf cash assistancelikely to be eligible for tanf cash assistance17 families who might qualify for tanf nonelderly nondisabled househol ds with children constitute over half of the housing voucher caseload more than onethird of the public housing caseload and little over fifth of the section 8 pr ojectbased caseload of the nonelderly nondisabled portion of the housing assistan ce caseload more than half reported some income from work less than 10 reported combining welfare18 and work about onefifth of these households were receiving income from welfare but not from work given that the caseload is approximately 5 million households that around half of those households are nonel derly nondisabled 25 million and that about one fourth of those households are receiving welfare we can very roughly estimate that around half million househol ds are receiving bot h tanf assistance and housing assistance this estimate was

sources such as child support andor gifts as well as reports of zero income how the programs interact the interaction of tanf and direct hous ing assistance can be assessed in two ways first one can look at how the ru of the two types of programs either complement each other or c onflict and the implications th at may have for households who receive both benefits the conflict in these rules has been discussed both by housing and welfare advocates second one can look at how the provision of services under one program can help fu rther the goals of the other program regardless of whether family is participating in both both housing research and welfare research have attempted to measure the impact of these programs on family outcomes the interaction of program rules for families who receive benefits from both tanf and hud housing assistance programs the different features of the two programs can create unintended conseque nces the emphasis of tanf on work sanctions and time limits could have implications for the cost of housing assistance programs additionally the benefit structure of housin g assistance programs may undermine the work incentives built into tanf tanf rules while the tanf goals do not explicitly include increasing families incomes the programs emphasis on work sanctions and time limits has the potential to significantly impact the in comes of welfare recipients when tanf was enacted some lowincome housing dvocates were concerned that since housing assistance benefit levels are ba sed on family income if tanf caused fluctuations in family inco mes it could have serious impacts on the federal housing budget for example if under tanf more families are working and states are maintaining generous earnings disregards it is possible that families incomes will rise if families incomes rise they re quire less housing assistance and the housing assistance programs could cut their costs or serve more families if under tanf many families are sanctioned from cash ssistance or reach their time limit it is possible that families incomes will drop if families incomes drop they require more housing assistance and phas could ither request additi onal federal funds or cut the number of people they serve preliminary research findings have shown that tanf while promoting work has not significantly increased or decreased the incomes of current or formerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32104crs10 19 final synthesis 20 sandra j newman ed and joseph hark ness theeffects of welfare reform on housing national analysis by sandr j newman and

families in the future the housing budget could be impacted housing rules while one of the major goals of the tanf program is to promote work the benefit structure of the hud housing assistance programs may undermine tanf work policies the amount of housing assistance family receives fluctuates with the familys income if familys income falls the familys housing assistance will typically rise to make up for that fall in income as result the family may be cushioned from the full impact of sanctions and time limits and therefore might have fewer incentives to meet work requirements in the other direction if familys income rises as result of work then the amount of housing assistance family receives is typically re duced the family may not feel the full impact of an increase in earnings and as result might have fewer incentives to increase earnings under tanf furthermor housing assistance is targeted at extremely lowincome households putting lesspoor potentially working households at

portable voucher progra m allows families the flexibility to move to housing virtually any place in the us31 while voucher families typically live in areas with lower concentrations of poverty than do families in public housing families w ith vouchers still often live in neighborhoods with high poverty an experiment undertaken by hud the moving to opportunity mto fair housing demonstration was designed to test the impact on families of requiring them to move from areas of high concen trations of poverty to areas with low concentrations of poverty preliminary findings indicate that families who used vouchers to move to low poverty areas had improved health outcomes improved educational test scores and lower rates of juvenile crime these preliminary findings have not yet shown any wage or employment effects32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32104crs14 the research seems to i ndicate that at the least housing assistance does not appear to hurt the employment and earnings efforts of families leaving welfare instead housing assistance may actually imp rove their outcomes furthermore housing assistance that provides for families to move to areas of lower poverty may actually improve other aspects of the families lives including health and education outcomes issues after observing the ways in which fede ral housing and welfare programs do and do not work together possible changes may be considered to the programs to help improve their coordination several program changes have been considered in past congresses that may be introduced agai n these changes fall into two broad categories adjusting program rules and increasing the amount of housing assistance available conflicting program rules there are several areas in which existing housing and welfare program rules are in c onflict and adjustment s could be made to alleviate that conflict enhance existing program featur that promote employment as noted earlier housing assistance programs for the most part do not have the same emphasis on work as do welfare programs this difference in focus may lead to conflicting messages for dual program par ticipants who eventually see benefits reduced as income increases however housing assistance program features which promote employment such as the family self sufficiency fss program may enhance the effectiveness of welfaretowork programs currently fss funds which are issued by hud to phas can be used only for families who live in public housing or receive tenantbased section 8 housing choice vouchers some have argued to allow phas to use fss funds for families with projectbased section 8 vouchers fss funds can be used to provide case management and services to assist families in attaining educational and employment goals similarly ross funds which ar also issued by hud to phas are only available to public housing residents pr oposals have been made to make ross funds available to phas for use with section 8 voucher recipients one concern that has been raised is that by expanding the use of these funds without expanding the amount of fundi ng available would result in greater competition for the existing funds change the way housing assistance programs are administered housing programs and welfar programs are administere d at different levels of government which may contribute to the di fficulty in coordinating these two sets of programs as result some have proposed to make changes to the administration of housing programs in or der to enhance compatibility with welfare programs superwaiver was proposed by the administration and version of this proposal was included in the administra tionbased welfare reform bills the superwaiver would enable states to request waivers of the statutory or regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32104crs15 33 the following housing provisions are not included under the superwaiver authority rental assistance under section 8 provisions that designate public housing units for the elderly and disabled provisions

proposals in current welfare reform debate by karen spar 34 midwest welfare peer assistance network recreating social assistance or how to use waiver authority to eliminate program silos may 2002 35 the center on budget and policy priorities superwaiver would allow fundamental changes to public housing and homeless programs sept 16 2002 at httpwwwcbpporg91602houspdfrules for wide range of work suppor t programs including housing assistance programs33 the superwaiver provision has several potential implications for housing advocates of the superwaiver pr ovision assert that it will foster greater coordination among work support programs and will allow localitie s to better adjust programs to meet the special needs of their population one potential use of the superwaiver cited by the midwest welfare peer assistance network welpan could be to override the sixmonth rest riction on followup and supportive service assistance to recently housed homeless familie s that exists in the supportive housing for the homeless program welpan asserts that superwaiver would allow administrators to extend follow up and s upportive service assistance to meet the needs of individual families beyond the current sixmonth cap34 those who oppose the expanded waiver authority express c oncern that states would have too much authority to undermine the goals of pr ograms for the poor as established by congress for example the center on budget and policy priorities has expressed concern that superwaiver authority could allow state to sell off large public housing building that currently serves ex tremely lowincome families and then use the money for housing assistance fo r moderateincome individuals35 additional housing assistance if housing assistance helps improve the outcomes of families transitioning from welfare to work lowincome housing advocates argue then more housing assist ance should be made available to these families there are two ways to do th is one increase the amount of housing assistance provided or two prioritize these families for existing assistance the first is difficult because housing assistance is ve ry expensive the second is difficult because of the competing needs of the elderly and disabled the following strategies have been suggested for creating additi onal housing assistance for welfare families use tanf for housing assistance while new housing assistance money can be difficult to obtain in tight budget year states can use their existing tanf funds to support housing both in the form of ongoing housing assistance as well as rehabilitation of the housing occupied by t anf recipients as noted earlier while tanf funds can currently be used fo r onetime or ongoing housing related assistance housing aid lasting beyond four months now counts as assistance which triggers time limits work requirements and child support re porting requirements proposals to redefine housing as nonassistan ce were included in the senate finance committees welfare reauthorization bill from the 107th congress which was nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32104crs16 enacted it is thought that such changes to the law would entice more states to use tanf funds to provide housing assistance prioritize tanf recipients for housing assistance local communities can set local preferences fo r distributing housing assistance if preference is given to families leaving tanf more assistance may be available to this population however phas f ace tension between prior itizing working families moving off of welfare and prioritizing the elderly andor disabled one way to avoid this tension is to create and fund vouchers specifically for fam ilies moving from welfare to work fiftythousand welfaretowork wtw housing vouchers were authorized and funded in the 1999 veterans administrationde partment of housing and urban development and other independent agenci vahud appropria tions legislation pl 105276 none has been funded ce then and the program has never been authorized the wtw voucher program targets families who have critical need for housing in order to obtain or retain viable em ployment in order to participate in the wtw program that was ppropriated in 1999 housing au thorities were required to develop welfaretowork v oucher plans that demonstr ated how housing assistance is combined with job training child care and other services families need to transition from welfare to work some wincome housing advocates have argued on behalf of authorizing the wtw hous ing voucher program however it is expensive to create new vouchers congre ss has not created any new vouchers since 2002 in fact in the face of recent budget constraints congress has placed funding restrictions on the voucher program in both fy2004 and fy2005 that have led to reductions in the number of available vouche rs in some parts of the country for more information on current issues in the voucher program see crs report rl31930 section 8 housing choice vouc hers funding and related issues conclusion because the populations that are served by hud housing assistance and welfare programs overlap the pressure to ensure that the programs are wellcoordinated will likely continue to face congress while veral changes have been made in recent years to improve this coordination the di fferences inherent in the two sets of programs such as the high proportion of elderly and disabled households served by housing programs the different levels of government that administer housing and welfare programs and the costs associated with providing additional services may make further changes difficult to enact
