the 028 acrosstheboard rescission central focus of the debate over nasas budget was president bushs vision for space exploration announ ced on january 14 2004 the president directed nasa to focus its activities on returning humans to the moon by 2020 and someday sending them to mars and wor lds beyond robotic probes would serve as pathfinders for human missions and also be used to continue studies of the universe using spacebased lescopes for example ot her countries were invited to participate the president directed nasa to develop crew exploration vehicle cev to take crews to earth orbit by 2014 but its primary purpose is taking them to and from the moon in septembe r 2005 nasa estimated that returning humans to the moon by 2018 would cost 104 billion not including approximately 20 billion for using the cev to take crews to and from the international space station nor the costs of robotic lunar probes cost estimate for sending people to mars was not provided the president did not propose signif icant increased funding for nasa to accomplish the vision instead most of th funding was to come from redirecting funds from other nasa activities deba over the vision initially focused on whether the country could afford such an initiative considering other national funding needs and the relative importance of funding the vision versus other nasa activities the original nasa fy2006 request was crafted by thennasa administrator sean okeefe who left th agency in february 2005 the original request did not specify how much was for the vision although nasa briefing chart identified 6 billion for explorati on specific activities another 64 billion was requested for the space shuttle and sp ace station programs often described as the first steps in the vision the rema inder of the budget 41 billion was labeled earth science aero others aerois for aeronautics in terms of the first issue supporters of the vision point to the relatively small percentage of federa l budget authority that is allocated to nasa 07 in fy2005 as an indication that it is not significant factor in the nations overallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32885crs46 spending skeptics counter that spending more than 16 billion on nasa is luxury when many domestic discretionary prog rams are being cut and federal rd spending overall is not keeping pace with inflation regarding the second issue vision proponents argue that nasa should focus on the presidents vision even though it may mean cutting back on nasas aeronautics earth sc ience and certain space science activities others disagree including the new administrator of nasa dr griffin he has repeatedly stated that he will not take money from nasas space science earth science or aeronautics ac tivities in order to fund the vision although he is taking funds from physical and life sc iences research instead the vision will be conducted on go as you can afford to pay basis dr griffins approach apparently has alleviated concerns by many members of the space science earth science and aeronautics communities who feared their programs would suffer because of the vision nevertheless nasas budget remains constrained because of the funding requirements for the vision hi gher than expected costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status following the 2003 columbia tragedy cost growth in other nasa programs including severa l space science programs shortfall of 35 billion for the shuttle program in th fiveyear budget plan submitted together with the fy2006 budget request and costs associated with funding congressional directed items nasas current human space flight pr ograms the space shuttle and the international space station iss are being si gnificantly affected by the vision both will be terminated earlier than planned to make that fundi ng available for the vision the president directed that the space shuttle be retired in 2010 af ter iss construction is completed dr griffin has indicated his intent to terminate the shuttle at the end of fy2010 september 30 2010 whether or not iss construction is completed the president directed that the new cev be available by 2014 which would leave multiyear gap when the united states would not be able to launch its own astronauts into space dr griffin wants to accelerate development of the cev to reduce the gap when nasa have to rely on russia to launch us astronauts he hopes to have the cev ready by 2012 and is reprio ritizing activities with in the exploration systems mission directorate to provide more funding to the cev in the next several years some members of congress want to void gap entirely by continuing the shuttle program until the cev is available s 1281 the senate version of the nasa authorization bill as reported from committee directed nasa not to retire the shuttle until replacement is available that was modified in the version that passed the senate however it now states that it is us policy to possess the capability for assured human access to space and directs the nasa administrator to act to ensure that capability and to make number of related reports to congress in future years the house bill hr 3070 as passed by the house is silent on the issue the house passed the senate bill on november 18 after striking all after the enacting clause and inserting the text of hr 30 70 in lieu therefore the house appointed conferees the same day as for the iss the president directed nasa to restructure the broadlybased research program it had planned to c onduct aboard iss to support only research needed to accomplish the vision some want to restore the research program to what was planned prior to the vision s 1281 the senate verison of the nasahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32885crs47 authorization bill as passed by the senate adds funding for iss research and makes other changes to augment its research role hr 3070 as passed by the house directs that 15 of the research funding fo r the iss be used for research not related to the vision nasa budget chart rel eased along with the presidents speech showed nasa completing its use of the i ss by fy2017 what will happen to it after that time is unclear the initial fy2006 request for the iss was 2180 billion 1857 billion for construction and operations including 160 million for iss crewcargo services and 324 million for research the amended request moved iss crewcargo services to another part of the nas budget and reduced the amount for iss construction and operations commensurately although it identified 168 million for that activity instead of 160 million as was indicat ed in the original request in the final version of the fy 2006 appropriations bill pl 109108 congress cut 80 million from the iss program including 60 million from iss crewcargo services they also cut 25 million from the account that funds research on iss though they did not specify that the cuts be made to the issrelated portion of that account the authorization bills do not identify an amount for the iss the house and senate appropriations and authorization committees that oversee nasa have all expr essed support for the vision with the proviso that nasa should continue to have balanced t of programs in sc ience exploration and aeronautics not focus solely on the vision the amount of funding that is ava ilable for various nasa activities will affect workforce levels nasas fy2006 budget request assumes that the number of budgeted civil service full time equi valents ftes will drop by almost 2500 in the next year and half from 19227 in fy2005 to 16738 for fy2007 how to right size nasa its facilities and its workforce and ensure nasa has the necessary skill mix for the vision are among the issues facing congress hr 3070 as passed by the house prohibits reductions in force rifs or other involuntary separations except for cause at nasa prio r to february 16 2007 the final version of the fy2006 appropriation act pl 109 108 restricts nasas use of buyouts and reductions in force rifs prior to nas providing certain reports to congress another issue is whether or not to send the shuttle to service the h ubble space telescope see crs report rs21767 hubble space telescope should nasa proceed with servicing mission by daniel morgan two days after the presidents vision speech thenadministrat or okeefe announced that the shuttle would not be used to conduct further hubbl servicing missions citing shuttle safety concerns in the wake of the february 1 2003 columbia tragedy as the primary reason widespread criticism led nasa to explore the possibility of robotic servicing mission instead but decembe r 2004 report from the national research council concluded that robo tic servicing mission was not likely to succeed in the time available in the fy2006 request nas requested money only for deorbit mission to ensure that hubble reenters from orbit without posing danger to populated areas dr griffin has pledge d to revisit the possibility of shuttle servicing mission after the shuttle completes its two return to flight rtf missions and its risk factors are better understood following the post columbia modifications the first rtf mission was launched on july 26 2005 but problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32885crs48 27 this section was prepared by christine m matthews specialist in science and technology policy resources sc ience

other financial institutions to make longterm lowinterest loans to sma ll businesses that are victims of hurricanes earthquakes other physical disasters and acts of terrorism and to serve as an advocate for small business within the federal government state justice institute sji39 the state justice institute sji is private nonprof it corporation that makes grants to state courts and funds researc h technical assistance and informational projects aimed at improving the quality of judicial administration in state courts across the united states under the terms of its enabling legislation sji is authorized to present its request directly to c ongress apart from the presidents budget pl 109108 hr 2862 funds 35 million for sji in fy2006 compared with 20 million proposed earlier by the h ouse 5 million proposed by the senate and 26 million enacted for fy2005 like all discretionary budget authority in pl 109 108 sjis ppropriation is subject to general rescission of 028 provided for in title vi of the act sji had requested 5 million for fy2006 while the bush administration as it had in its budg ets for the previous three years proposed eliminating federal funding fo r the institute altogether the 35 million approved by congress fo r sji in fy2006 marks the second fiscal year in row in which funding for the institute has been increased following number of years during wh ich appropriators in cong ress considered whether to provide any funding for sji fo r fy1999 2000 and 2001 sji received an annual appropriation of 685 million afte r which the level of f unding dropped significantly to 30 million in both fy2002 and fy2003 and to 22 million in fy2004 in fy2005 the downward trend was revers ed with 26 million approved for the institute during the previous four fiscal year s appropriations c onferees in congress had encouraged sji to obtain funds at least in part from sources other than congress in response to specific dir ectives from conferees for the fy2002 and fy2003 cjs bills sji explored the availab ility of support from private donors statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32885crs69 and local agencies state and local bar associations and state court systems but was unable to secure funding from any of them for fy2004 and fy2005 conferees on the cjs bill suggested somewhat different approach encouraging sji to apply for funding from programs in the department of justice doj which suppor t state court programs accordingly during those two fiscal years pursuant to an agreement between sji and doj the latter transferred 12 million to the institute to support st ate court projects educating judges about rape sexu assault and other violence against women after scaling back the appropriati ons level for sji in fy2002 fy2003 and fy2004 congress in separate action aut horized multiyear funding for sji at significantly higher level on september 30 2004 the nate by unanimous consent passed hr 2714 state justi ce institute reauthorization act of 2004 authorizing 7 million in funding for sji annually for fy2005 through fy2008 in october 2004 the house agreed to the nateamended versi on of hr 2714 and the bill was signed by the president into law pl 108372 ear lier in its report on hr 2714 hrept 108285 p 2 the h ouse judiciary committee endorsed sjis continued operation sustaining the in stitutes operations the committee said is necessary because the states as practical matter devote the great majority of their judicial funding to address personnel construction and maintenance needs they simply lack the resources to develop programs that improve the administrative efficiency and overall productivity of their courts sji serves federal interest precisely because it makes state courts more efficient state courts are the primary fora in which the vast majority of lawsuits are resolved in fulfilling that mission state courts address federal constitutional and statutory issues every day in sum if litigants largely resolve their legal differences at the state level including those that involve federal issues then congress promotes federal interest by supporting sji in the fy2006 appropriations process the house appropriations committee endorsed an approach of provi ding some directly appropria ted funds to sji but with the institute as well seeking additional f unding from department of justice grant programs in reporting hr 2862 the house committee in hrept 109118 p 154 stated that it understood that sji had b een unable to generate stable sources of nonfederal funding and that the sji had contacted bar associations and court organizations as possible alternative s ources of funding however the committee noted these groups are not inclined to contribute to operations of the sji beyond providing matching grant funds for indi vidual projects for this reason the committee said it continued to recomme nd funding for sji even t hough the presidents fy2006 request did not the committee commended sji for beginning to work with the department of justices office of justice programs ojp on issues involving state courts and encouraged sj i to continue to seeking funds from ojp grant programs in addition to sj is fy2005 appropriation of 26 million funds transferred from ojp increased total f unding available to sji in fy2005 to 34 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32885crs70 40 this section was written

noted simply that sji was created in 1984 to further the developm ent and adoption of improved judicial administration in state courts housesenate conferees on hr 2862 in recommending 35 million for sji for fy2006 did not address the subject of po ssible sources of sji funding other than direct appropriation instead in h rept 109272 p 206 it focused on procedural requirements to be followed by applicants for sji grants the conferees stated that they expected that successful applicants for new and continuing sji grants will provide cash match of not ss than 50 percent of the total cost of the project and reminded grantees that adherence to grant guidelines is required in order to receive further federal funding us commission on international religious freedom40 the commission on
