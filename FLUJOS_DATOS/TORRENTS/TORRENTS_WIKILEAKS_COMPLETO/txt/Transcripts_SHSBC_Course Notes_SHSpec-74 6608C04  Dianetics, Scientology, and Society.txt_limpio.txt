6608c04 shspec74 dianetics scientology and society dianetics has an interesting history it hit like battering ram and the planet hasnt recovered from the impact it got neglected after 1951 but it is the entrance point to what the mind is all about it gives superficial explanation of what behavior is all about it wrapped up the world of mental healing it is very junior subject when it became clear that we were addressing the human spirit working on his mind seemed of far lesser importance the backflash against dianetics and scientology is based on the fact that it works and that it is in competition with psychiatry not that it is fraud not all psychiatrists are really evil some are merely caught up in routine that they cant escape however lot of them are sps those that arent are pretty pts they dont understand what we are doing nor do we understand what they are doing because we dont have the same goals as the psychiatrists on soliciting approval from psychiatrists i rarely go around zoos wondering if i am acceptable to the monkeys in the cages in unsuccessful activities you get change of titles every once in awhile mental healers keep changing their titles at present they are psychiatrists in the 1920s they were alienists etc one reason that they are unsuccessful is that they give all their time to down statistic and keep getting pulled under if we were to approach the same area as our major purpose we would in order to make it first have to be very well and successfully established in other fields the west is scientific barbarism not really civilization yet man has to be pretty civilized before he can be trusted with much power current society has power without gentler social graces to restrain it people in society are trying to control human behavior by brute force this is very crude technology it is very dicey to put technology out for those who are accustomed to abusing technology it would only be safe if the technology itself or learning the technology produced enough case gain to prevent their abusing it tech must be able to work rapidly enough to counteract the tendency to abuse tech something peculiar is going to happen you are taking off from the tremendous technical background of scientology and going back to its immediate entrance background of course this is very easy to clarify it is best not to use dianetics as an entrance point for dissemination purposes but to get the person into scientology and then teach him dianetics as training technique we are advancing the most powerful psychosomatic technology on the planet as training technique as it advances dont lose sight of scientology it is great to be able to salvage the body so that you can salvage the being there is use for dianetics but dont put fixing up body above helping being remember that you are salvaging being not his particular peculiarities you could change someones peculiarities by finding and running out engrams if you had an individual with certain aberration you could find chain of engrams to explain it that when run would change his behavior but there is some more basic reason for his being that way his more fundamental life has been dedicated to going wrong in that direction so of course he has accumulated great number of incidents that demonstrate going wrong in that direction scientology technique could release him from this tendency to collect engrams you had better be sure to go back far enough for this you need to have the concept of the spiritual nature of man if you dont accept the spiritual nature of man you cant make dianetics work because it goes back too far there is piece of scientology tech that gets him over his tendency to accumulate engrams on subject reach and withdraw with this technique you can bring the individual up to pt without bothering to inquire about which mass is causing him to crack up airplanes this could work for several lifetimes scientology is just that much stronger than dianetics it is true that in one lifetime several experiences can ruin someone it is true that as long as the traumatic shock is contained in broken leg healing can be normal or prolonged if you ran the incident even just this lifetime you would reduce the time of healing from six weeks to two weeks use dianetics when injury or illness prevents auditing patch the pc up so that you can audit him in other words if actual advance of the being is seriously hindered by physical distractions dianetics is useful as means of getting rid of them you might need to run out the pcs efforts to cure the illness in short space of time it blew anyway on the auditing that the pc had had but there was just moment when it seemed too overwhelming to permit of actual auditing so engram running was used to take the edge off engram running has some use and one ought to know how to do it spectacular things do happen with dianetic auditing for instance goiter the size of large baseball could shrink and disappear in half an hour the insane can sometimes run engrams and go sane they are just pts they keep wanting to run the incident that the psychiatrist said wasnt true lrh concluded that being sane or insane has nothing to do with someones state of case many people in institutions have been put there for other causes than insanity that is one of the things wrong with suspending civil rights because of insanity making the able more able may not be as profitable as it could be but it is much sounder as basis for organizational and personal repute and growth if you set up to cure lumbosis you are standing on slippery log across roaring stream picking up boulder you are in an enturbulated area and it is risky and prone to relapse it takes lot of effort and the auditor generally gets kicked in the teeth lrhs records tend to show that it doesnt pay to reward the down statistic it is getting so that government penalizes the up statistic and rewards the down statistic rioters welfare cases etc you could probably be very agreeable with society by rewarding the down statistic eg if you helped the retarded etc but when you are standing on slippery log over raging torrent you dont lean over to lift heavy rock out of the stream first build bridge and bolt derrick on it so we are swimming against the stream of society so we are holding constant purpose trying to help our fellow man just doing that would get us someplace the rest of society has been slipping if we just held constant we would win but we are doing more than that the size of our movement is growing everyone connected with it is getting more able as an individual the 22 clears are just now enrolling on part i of the ot course the first 30 clears are to get it free so as society sinks we are on rising platform lrh has received an unofficial statement that if he wanted permanent residence in rhodesia he could have it the fda thing has been dropped by the government the lawyers are conferring to see how they can give the seized materials back without getting sued lrh wasnt allowed to appear at the inquiry in australia because they knew that it would make them look silly we win these things but one ever announces the fact in the papers scientology looks bad legally because the newspapers and other media always report the suits attacks and entheta against scientology in banner headlines and the fact that we always win in court and elsewhere is never reported in general entheta can just be dropped and neglected this would always be safe for an ot further down the line you must take rapid action the problem of what you do with what you know is determined by the framework of the society in which you are working it is not always the same solution violinist who went to perform for some lumberjacks would do well to consider his audience in deciding what to play working within the human race you monitor your use of technology by the society dianetics could be good entrance point in some societies eg atheistic or materialistic ones it wouldnt be so acceptable in moslem or buddhistic scientology with its approach to man as spirit wouldnt reach them your problem in disseminating is just how to tailor your approach to the group that you are addressing in dissemination you must present to person only that part of gradient of what you know about existence that the fellow doesnt have to protest and argue with to preserve his own integrity you are trying to sell him what he already knows down deep but this is covered with lot of false information somewhere however there is an entrance point get the other guy to contribute somewhat to the conversation so you can have an agreement never give someone false data just to get agreement your force and impact consists of the fact that you speak the truth truth is such fast arrow that it goes through without the guy knowing what is happening he may feel that he is under attack give the person something he can use eg data or processing you can select the pieces of scientology that come nearest to his reality estimate the guys position on the tone scale his problems his use for scientology data etc when disseminating if you dont reach to the persons reality level you will make him feel as though you are attacking him give people data they can use or they wont have much use for it if you do it right the reaction you will get is gee where has this been all my life dianetics has an important role in dissemination it is the finest dissemination material use it people arent ready for example to hear about scientologys ow techniques but dont practice dianetics on people let them practice dianetics the greater truth lies in scientology but the experience lies in dianetics it teaches people something about the mind it gives new auditors practice in auditing lrh has used meter dating with newspaper reporter to disseminate he got the reporters last accident with the meter and managed to turn on somatics the statement in the introduction to book one that says that any two people can cure up to 70 of peoples ills was put there by joe winter not lrh you can direct someones attention to picture and key out the picture you could ask has anyone in your family ever had that problem and key out the picture just by getting him to look at it or you could ask are you worried did you ever know anyone who was worried can you see them worrying etc just seeing his first picture gives person case gain
