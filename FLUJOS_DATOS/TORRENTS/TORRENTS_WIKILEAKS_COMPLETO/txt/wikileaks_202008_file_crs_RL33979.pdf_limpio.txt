service fund background and options for reform introduction the concept that all americans shoul d be able to afford access to the telecommunications network is commonly called the universal service concept this concept can trace its origins back to the 1934 communications act1 since then the preservation and advancement of unive rsal service has been basic tenet of federal communications policy and congress has historically played an active role in helping to preserve and advance universal service go als in 1996 congress passed the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 which not only codified the universal service concept but also led to the establishment of federal universal service fund usf or the fund to meet the universal serv ice objectives and principles contained in the 1996 act ccording to fund administrators since 1997 over 50 billion in support has been disburse d by the usf with all 50 states the district of columbia and all territories receiving some benefit2 over the past decade the telecommuni cations sector has undergone vast transformation fueled by rapi d technological growth and s ubsequent evolution of the marketplace wide range of new services have become available offered by growing list of traditional as well as nontra ditional providers one of the results of this transformation is that the nations expectations for communications services have also grown in the past access to the public switched netw ork through single wireline connection enabling voice service was the standard of communications today the desire for simple voice connec tivity has been replaced by the demand on the part of consumers business and government for access to vast array of multifaceted fixed and mobile services consumers are also demanding greater flexibility and may choose to gain access to the same content over variety of technologies whether it be computer television or mobile telephone the trend towards sharing information such as music movies or photographs is also growing making it necessary to ensure that network upload speeds match download capabilities these advances require that networks transition into converged next generation wireline and wire less broadband networks cap able of meeting these demands one of the challenges facing this transition is the desire to ensure that all citizens have access to an affordable and advanced telecommunications infrastructure so that all members of american society may derive the benefits3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs2 3 continued crs report rl33542 broadband internet regulation and access background and issues by angele gilroy and lennard g kruger 4 communications act of 1934 as ame nded title i sec147 usc 151 5 specific federal programs such as the rural telephone bank and rural utilities service loan programs were also developed to assist high cost rural areas technological advances such as the ability of the internet to provide data voice and video the bundling of service offerings the advancement of wireless services and the growing convergence of the tel ecommunications sector have according to many policy makers made it necessary to reexamine traditional policy goals such as the advancement of universal service manda tes these changes in technology and the marketplace declining funding base and significant increases in the amount of support disbursed by the fund have led to concerns that the usf is in need of reform there is growing consensus among policy makers including some in congress that significant action is needed not only to ensure the viability and stability of the usf but also to addr ess the numerous issues surrounding such reform the 110th congress may take prominent role in this debate how this concept should be defined how these po licies should be funde d who should receive the funding and how to ensure proper ma nagement and oversight of the fund are among the issues expected to frame the policy debate the universal service concept since its creation in 1934 the federal communications commission fcc or commission has been tasked with making available so far as possible to all the people of the united states rapid effi cient nationwide and worldwide wire and radio communications service with ad equate facilities at reasonable charges4 this mandate led to the deve lopment of what has come to be known as the universal service concept the universal service concept as originally designed called for the establishment of policies to ensure that telecommunications services are available to all americans including those in rural insular and high cost areas by ensuring that rates remain affordable during the tw entieth century government and industry efforts to expand telephone rvice led to the development of complex system of cross subsidies to expand the network and address universal service goals the underlying goal of the crosssubdization policy was to increase the number of subscribers to the network by shiftin g costs among network providers and subscribers profits from more densely populated lower cost urbanized areas helped to subsidize wiring and operation costs fo r the less populous higher cost rural areas higher rates and equipment charges for bus iness and long distance customers helped to subsidize the charges for residential local calling the funding for universal service objectives was built into the rate structure and effectively most telephone subscribers have contributed to universal service goals for decades5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs3 6 sec 254 d also states that other provid ers of interstate telecommunications may be required to contribute to the preservation and adva ncement of universal service if it is in the public interest 7 many states participate in or have progra ms that mirror fcc universal service mechanisms to help promote universal service go als within their individual states 8 for further information on the fccs universal service support mechanisms see httpwwwfccgovcgbconsumerfactsuniversalservicehtml 9 the highcost fund consists of five subf unds which address specific needs highcost loop support highcost model support loca l switching support interstate common line support and interstate access supportwith the advent of competition and the breakup of the bell system the complex system of cross subsidies that evolved to support universal service goals was longer tenable the telecommunica tions act of 1996 pl 104104 47usc codified the longstanding commitment by us policymakers to ensure universal service in the provision of telecommuni cations services sec 254 the 1996 act also required that every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services be respons ible for universal service support sec 254d and that such charges be made explicit sec 254e6 the 1996 act also expanded the concept of universal service to include among other principles that elementary and secondary sc hools and classrooms libraries and rural health care providers have access to telecommunicati ons services for specific purposes at discounted rates sec 254b6 and 254h the federal universal service fund over the years this concept fostered the development of various fcc policies and programs to meet this goal new fe deral universal service fund usf or fund was established in 1997 to meet the specifi c objectives and principles contained in the 1996 act the usf is administered by the universal service administrative company usac an independentnotforp rofit organization under the direction of the fcc the fcc through the usf offers universal service support through number of direct mechanisms that targ et both providers of and subscribers to telecommunications services7 the usf provides support and discounts for providers and subscribers through four programs highcost support lowincome support schools and libraries support nd rural health care support8 highcost program highcost support provided through the hi gh cost program is an example of providertargeted support under the high cost program eligible telecommunications carriers usually those serving rural insular and high cost areas are able to obtain funds to help offset the higher than av erage costs of providing telephone service9 this mechanism has been particularly important to rural america where the lack of subscriber density leads to significant costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs4 10 support is not given directly to the subscrib er but to their designated telecommunications service provider who in turn char ge these subscribers lower rates lowincome program fcc universal service policies have been expanded to target lowincome subscribers two incomebased programs lifeline and linkup established in the mid1980s were developed to assist economically needy individuals the linkup program established in 1987 assists lowincome subscribers pay the costs associated with the initiation of telephone service and the lifelin program established in 1984 assists lowincome subscribers pay the recurring monthly service charges incurred by telephone subscribers10 schools and libraries or erate program under universal service provisions cont ained in the 1996 act elementary and secondary schools and classroom s and libraries are design ated as beneficiaries of universal service discounts universal service principles detailed in section 254b6 state that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services the act further requires in section 254h1b th at services within the definition of universal service be provide d to elementary and seconda ry schools and libraries for education purposes at discounts that is at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties the fcc established the schools and libr aries division within the universal service administrative company usac to administer the schools and libraries or educationrate program to co mply with these provisions under this program which became effective january 1 1998 eligib schools and libraries receive discounts ranging from 20 to 90 pe rcent for telecommunications services depending on the poverty leve l of the schools or school districts population and its location in high cost telecommunications area three categories of services are eligible for discounts intern connections eg wiring routers and servers internet access and telecommunications and dedicated services with the third category receiving funding priority unlike the hi ghcost and lowincome programs the fcc established yearly ceiling or ca p of 225 billion for this program rural health care program section 254h of the 1996 act requires that public and nonprofit rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services necessary for the provision of health care services at rates comparable to those paid for similar services in urban areas subsection 254h1 further specifies that to th extent technically feasible and economically reasonable h ealth care providers should have access to advanced telecommunications and information services the fcc established the rural health care division rhcd within the usac to administer the universal support program to comply with these pr ovisions under fccestablished rules only public or nonprofit health car providers are eligible to receive funding eligible health care providers with the exception of those requesting only access to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs5 11 any health care provider that does not have tollfree access to the internet can receive support support is available for limited long distance charges for accessing the internet this has become an increasingly rare occurre nce however and the last time such support was given was in 2001 12 for additional information on this program including funding commitments see the rhcd website httpwwwunive rsalserviceorgrhc 13 these companies include wireline telephone companies wireless telephone companies paging service providers and interconnected voic over internet protocol voip providersinternet must also be located in rural area11 similarly to the schools and libraries program this support program went in to effect on january 1 1998 and funding ceiling or cap was established in this case at 400 llion annually the primary use of the funding is to provide re duced rates for telecommunications and information services necessary for the provision of health care12 funding the usf receives federal monies but is funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications carriers that provide interstate service13 under current rules carriers contributions are assessed based on percentage of its interstate and international enduser telecommunications revenues this percentage is called the contribution factor the fcc calculates th contribution factor based on anticipated funding needs of the usf in the upcoming quarter this information is submitted quarterly to the fcc by usacs univers service administrator the contribution factor is calculated four times year on quarterly basis and may increase decrease or remain the same depending on the needs of the universal service programs drawing on the usf the fccs wireline competition bureau releases public notice stating the proposed factor after 14 days absent any fcc action the factor becomes final as shown in appendix table 1 from 2001 to the first half of 2005 the contribution factor generally saw steady increase during that period the contribution factor varied from low of 67 percent in the first quarter of 2001 to high of 111 percent in the second quarter of 2005 since reaching that high the factor had begun to modera however the contribution factors for the second and third quarters of 2007 at 117 percent and 113 percent respectively were strong reversal of this trend resulting in si gnificant increase from the first quarter 2007 contribution factor of 97 percent si nce reaching high of 117 percent the contribution factor began to moderate with first quart er 2008 factor of 102 percent however the contribution factor has once again begun to climb reaching 114 percent for both the third and fourth quarters of 2008 the overall growth in the factor over this decade remains significant policy concern see policy options section of this report for discussion of some of the reasons attributed to this increase there are some exceptions to this f unding process under the fccs rules telecommunications providers are not required to contribute in given year to universal service if their annual contributions to the program would be minimis that is less than 10000 in that year or if they provide only international services filers are also not required to contribut based on international revenues if their interstate enduser revenues meet the 12 percent rule that is if their interstate end user revenues represent less than 12 percent of their combined interstate andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs6 14 these providers have expressed concern over their inability to dis tinguish between their interstate and intrastate revenues however in lieu of using the safe harbor percentage they do have the option to submit traffic study data to show that they should contribute less 15 fcc updates approach for asse ssing contributions to the federal universal service fund available at httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatch doc266030a1pdf 16 it should also be noted that an assessed prov ider is not permitted to collect any fees from lifeline or linkup subscriber unless that s ubscriber has incurred longdistance charges 17 these figures are based on usac 2007 unaudite d financial data detailed data including statespecific information on usf support can be found in the universal service company 2007 annual report at httpwwwusacorg _resdocumentsaboutpdfusacannual report2007pdfinternational enduser revenues in other cases the fcc has determined that selected categories of providers for example wireless carriers and interconnected voip providers may but are not required t base their contributions on an fcc established revenue percentage or safe harbor that attempts to estimate the percentage of the providers total revenues that are interstate and international end user revenues14 the current effective june 2006 safe harbor for wireless carriers and voip providers is set at 371 pe rcent and 649 percent of total revenues respectively15 many assessed providers ve chosen but are not required to recover usf contributions directly from their customer s they pass through universal service payments directly to consumers and earmark universal service charge on subscribers bills this is legal and common industry practice however if an assessed provider does c hoose to collect usf fees dir ectly from their customers the provider is not permitted to recover through federal universal service line item on customers bill an amount that exceeds the universal service charge contribution factor16 disbursements according to usac universal service support disbursements for calendar year 2007 totaled about 695 billion17 figure 1 below shows the breakdown of calendar year 2007 usf disbursements as percentage by individual program high cost support accounted for 616 percent of total disbursements or 43 billion schools and libraries support represen ted 260 percent of disbursements totaling 18 billion low income support was 118 per cent of disbursements totaling 8228 million commitments for rural health ca re support were about 374 million or 05 percent of disbursements it should be noted that disbursements for the schools and libraries support program and the rura l health care program operate on school year calendar and represent commitments as of december 31 2007 for the funding year which runs from july 1 june 30 th erefore these figures do not represent the full yearly commitment made to these progra ms although subscribers benefit from the usf only companies that provide the services draw money directly from the fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs7 18 contribution allocation among states is an f cc staff estimate net dollar flow is annual payments minus estimated contributions 19 for breakdown of usf distributions and cont ributions by state for previous years see table 112 of the fccs universal service mon itoring report monitoring reports issued since 1991 are available at http wwwfccgovwc biatdmonitorhtml 20 47 usc sec 254 b5source data from usac 2007 nnual report unaudited data appendix table 2 provides data on usf paymen ts and contributions broken down by state and program for 2006 the data show that service providers and their subscribers in every state territory and commonwealth received to varying degrees some 2005 usf payments for example ll received at least some payments from both the low income program and with the exception of american samoa the schools and libraries pr ogram the allocation of bene fits vary depending on which individual program is examined ho wever when overall net dollar flow18 is examined 24 states and the district of co lumbia were net contributors to the 2006 usf program as whole the service pr oviders in the remaining 26 states and 5 territories were net receivers that is they received more payments from the usf for 2006 than estimated cont ributions although there is so variation within programs and among states in any given year on the whole whether particular state is net receiver of or contributor to the usf program is fairly stable pattern19 in general rural states with low population density typi cally tend to benefit most as they receive significant funding from the high cost program but tend to contribute less to the usf program overall since they tend to generate lower telecommunications revenues policy options the fcc is required to ensure that there be specific predictable and sufficient mechanisms to preserve nd advance universal service20 however changes in telecommunications technology and the mark etplace while often leading to positivelow income 118 rural health 05high cost 616 schools

access and the digital divide federal assistance programs by lennard g kruger and angele gilroybenefits for consumers and providers have had negative impact on the health and viability of the usf as presently designed these changes have led to growing imbalance between the entities and revenue st ream contributing to the fund and the growth in the entities and prog rams eligible to receive f unding the desire to expand access to broadband and address what some perceive as digital divide has also placed focus on what role if any the usf should take to address this issue21 the current policy debate surrounding us f reform has focused on four major concerns the scope of the program who should contribute and what methodology should be used to fund the program eligibility criteria for benefits and concerns over possible program fraud waste and abuse separate and more narrowly focused issue the impact of the antideficiency ac t ada on the usf also has become an issue of concern program scope one of the major policy debates surroundi ng universal servi ce is whether access to advanced telecommunications services ie broadband should be incorporated into universal service objectives the rm universal service when applied to telecommunications refers to the ability to make available basket of telecommunications services to the public across the nation at reasonable price as directed in the 1996 telecommunications act section 254c federalstate joint board was tasked with defining the services which should be included in the basket of services to be eligible for fede ral universal service support in effect using and defining the term universal servi ce for the first time the joint boards recommendation which was subsequently adopted by the fcc in may 1997 included the following in its universal services package voice grade access to and some usage of the public switc hed network single line rvice dual tone signaling access to directory assistance emergency service such as 911 operator services access and interexchange long distance service some policy makers have expressed c oncern that the fccadopted definition is too limited and does not take into consideration the importance and growing acceptance of advanced servi ces such as broadband and internet access they point to number of provisions contained in th universal service section of the 1996 act to support their claim universal service principles contained in section 254b2 state that access to advanced telecommunications services should be provided to all regions of the nation the subsequent principle b3 calls for consumers in all regions of the nation including lowi ncome and those in rural insular and high cost areas to have access to telecommunications and information services including advanced services at comparab level and comparable rate charged for similar services in urban areas such provisions they state dictate that the fcc expand its universal service definition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs9 22 for summary of the joint boards re commendations see httphraunfossfccgov edocs_publicattachmatchfcc07j4a1pdf 23 it should be noted that the fcc is not re quired to implement the recommendations of the federalstate joint board however the pres ence of three fcc commissioners on the board gives much weight to their recommendations 24 for example the usdas rural utilities service has broadband loan and grant program for rural areas for information on this program see crs report rl33816 broadband continuedthe 1996 act does take into considera tion the changing nature of the telecommunications sector and allows fo r the universal service definition to be modified if future conditions warrant section 254cof th act states th at universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services and the fcc is tasked with periodically reevaluating this finition taking into account advances in telecommunications and inform ation technologies and servi ces furthermore the joint board is given specific authority to recommend from time to time to the fcc modification of the definition of the servi ces to be included for federal universal service support the joint board in july 2002 concluded such an inquiry and recommended that at that time changes be made in the list of services eligible for universal service support the fcc in july 10 2003 order fcc 03170 adopted the joint boards recommendation thereby leaving unchanged the list of services supported by federal universal service more recently however the joint board was once again called upon to reexamine this issue and came up with different conclusion the joint board on novemb er 19 2007 recommended that the fcc change the mix of services eligible for universal service suppor t and concluded that the universal availability of broadband internet services be included in the nations communications goals and hence be supporte d by federal universal service funds22 the fcc is not required to adopt joint board recommendations but is given up to one year to complete proceeding to consider them23 see joint board recommendation and the fcc response secti on for discussion of the joint board recommendation issued in november 2007 other policy makers caution that more modest approach is appropriate given the universal mandate asso ciated with this definition also at issue is the uncertainty and costs associated with mandating nationwide deployment of such advanced services as universal service policy goal some ve expressed concern that given the pressures currently facing the fund and their impact on the contribution factor the inclusion of broadband services at this time is taking on too large mandate current policy concer ns regarding both the contribution and distribution mechanisms should be addressed fi rst they state prior to any expansion of the usf definition furthermore they state the usf has already taken on limited broadband deployment respons ibilities through the erate and rural health care programs and indirectly through the high cost program as funding is used to upgrade existing telephone ne tworks if ubiquitous br oadband deployment is national policy goal they state policym akers should not place further stress on the usf program but should seek out other means of achieving this goal which may be more effective such as providing economic incentives easing economic regulation encouraging municipal ownership expanding other existing programs or establishing new program24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs10 24 continued loan and grant programs in the usdas rural utilities service by lennard g kruger 25 however it should be noted that in revers of this trend the fcc in an august 2005 decision exempted digital subscriber line d sl service from usf assessments on the basis of its august 2005 informa tion service classification 26 see fcc updates approach for assessing cont ributions to the federal universal service fund available at httphraunfossfc cgovedocs_publicattachmatchdoc 266030a1pdfcontribution methodology one of the major policy questions surr ounding usf reform is to what degree if any there should be change in the way the program is funded consensus has been forming that some reform to broade n the contribution base is needed how this should be accomplished however remains open to debate proposals range from modest options to expand the existing funding base to broadening the base to include intrastate revenues to calling for complete restructuring of the contribution methodology expanding the base one option is to broaden the base of entities that must contribute to the fund by calling for technol ogy neutral funding the fcc has taken number of actions over the years to expand the pool of contributors thereby broadening the base of entities supporting the fund25 for example in 1998 the fcc established revenue percen tage or safe harbor of 15 percent of revenues for determining the usf contribution for wireless carriers that percentage has been increased twice since and is currently t at 371 percent in june 2006 decision the fcc further expanded the pool of cont ributors by requiring that providers of interconnected voip contribute to the usf26 some policy makers have recommended that the list of providers be expanded to include broadband providers which were removed from the base when the fcc ruled that internet access services are information services not telecommunica tions services however they generally recommend that this expansion be contin gent on the understanding that usf support be used to upgrade the telecommunicati ons infrastructure to include broadband capabilities intrastate revenues another proposal calls for broadening the revenue base by assessing fees on intrastate as well as interstateinternational revenues although this would provide an additional source for usf funds many state that this option may not be available absent cong ressional action to specifically designate intrastate revenues as source for fede ral usf contributions the recommendation for specific congressional clarification is ba sed to large part on successful court challenge of an earlier attempt by the fcc to collect support for the erate program based on combined interstate and intrastate revenues in the case of texas office of public utility counsel v fcc 183f3d 3931999 the united states court of appeals 5th circuit concluded that the agency fcc exceeded its jurisdictional authority when it assessed contributions for sec 254h schools and libraries programs based on combined intrastate and interstate revenues of interstate telecommunications providers and when it asserted its jurisdictional authority to dohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs11 27 for more detailed discussion supporting this proposal see the usf by the numbers coalition the benefits of

how americas most vulnerable consumers could suffer under universal service fund reform available at httpkeepusffairorgkeepusffairresourceshtmlthe same on behalf of high cast support proponents of in cluding intrastate revenues cite technological and marketplace changes which have eroded the distinction between interstate and intrastate services as well as the growth of combined calling plans in support of such action some how ever have expressed concern over the potential negative impact that the inclusion of intrastate revenues may have on state supported usf programs since many are funded by intrastate telecommunications revenues numbers or connections another proposal calls for shift in the basis of support away from revenues to comple tely new thodol ogy based on working numbers or connections under this proposal contributions for usf would be assessed based on monthly flat fee or charge per working telephone number since users need discrete number to connect to the public switched network supporters claim this proposal would lead to more stable assessment would be technologically neutral would spread c ontributions over broa der base and would be easier to administer27 opponents however state that using numbersbased approach shifts the burden of usf from high volume users directly to all subscribers as regressive fixed charge this they st ate not only adds financial burden on low volume subscribers who may be elderly ndor on low and fixed incomes but could possibly lead to subscriber dropoff thereby defeating the purpose of the usf program28 distribution methodology another major issue facing usf reform concerns the eligibility criteria used to distribute usf funds over the past decade 19972007 annual usf receipts have grown from 18 billion to an estimated 72 billion and the contribution factor needed to support this growth has more th an doubled to reach an all time high of 117 percent for the second quarter of 2007 this si gnificant rise in the funding level and subsequently the contribution factor s led to an examination of the funds eligibility criteria and distribution methodol ogy as concerns have been voiced over the long term sustainability of the fund and the cost burden it imposes on contributors examination of usf progra m revenue flows since 2003 shows that three of the four programs low income schools and libraries nd rural health care have been relatively stable or declining however the high cost program has experienced significant growth 31 percent with disbursements increasing from 32611 million to 42708 m

chairman kevin martin before the federalstate joint board on universal service february 20 2007 available at httphraunfossfccgovedocs _publicattachmatchdoc271011a1pdf 31 ibid gregg more specifically revenues disbursed between 2003 and 2007 decreased from 32349 million to 31053 million 32 it should be noted how ever that both the 109th and 110th congresses enacted legislation prohibiting the fcc from using any of its ppropriated funds to change its rules or regulations to limit usf support payments to single connection or primary line pl 109 108 title vi sec 622 and pl 110161 title v sec 511 contributing to the usfs recent overall growth29 within the high cost program the growth can be traced to support given to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers for example payments for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers which are largely wireless ca rriers increased from 1 million in 2000 to 1267 million in 2003 but are estimated by usac to total 1 billion for 2006 and potentially may go as high as 25 billion by 200930 on the other hand while incumbent eligible telecommunications ca rriers still receive th majority of funds from the high cost program revenues disbursed in 2003 and 2007 decreased from 32 billion to 31 billion31 hence most policy discussions regard ing the distribution methodology focus on proposals to stem the growth of th high cost program by limiting eligibility criteria andor controlling the amount of f unding disbursed variety of proposals to be used on their own or in combin ation are being discussed including limiting usf support to single line per household eliminating the identical support rule using reverse auctions to determine eligibility placing cap or ceiling on funds and improving targeting primary or single line limitation as presently designed usf support is available to multiple lines per househol d some policy makers have proposed that one way to curb the increase in funding requirements is to limit eligibility criteria usf funding they state should be limited to single or primary line not multiple access32 the universal service mandate they claim is not to artificially construct competitive marketplace with multiple carriers in areas that are not able to support single carrier but to ensure that high cost areas receive service at reasonable rate the use of usf funds to support multiple carri ers in high cost areas they claim is an abuse of funds and places unnecessary strain on those supporting the program others however have argued that limiting us f support to single provider relegates those areas to lower standard which does not fulfill the universal service principle to afford consumers in rural insular and high cost areas access to telecommunications and information services that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areass ec 254 b 3 high cost areas they state should have the benefits and c hoices of competition and the opportunity to select from variety of providers just like other regions of the nation line limitations opponents state will only discourag investment in rural infrastructurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs13 33 the provider would be required to meet cert ain carrier of last resort obligations which would be detailed when the bids are solicited for example the carrier would be required to offer specific package of services and provide that service to the entire designated service area regardless of cost and would have to meet interconnection mandates reverse auctions one proposal under consideration for selecting an eligible carrier is the use of reverse auctions or competitive bidding under this method geographic area would be designated as high cost providers interested in offering service would be asked how little universal service support they would need to provide service and the provider that submits the lowest bid all else equal would receive the funds33 this approach in theory would result in decrease in funding for high cost support since it would be based on low bids submitted by providers instead of on the current method that is based on the embedded costs of the incumbent telecommunications provider in th area this supporters claim will lead to the use of the most efficient technolog and will relieve the growing pressure on usf funds however there is single methodology that must be used and the reverse auction concept could be designed in number of ways and impose variety of requirements and obligations for ex ample some support phasedin approach to reverse auctions where it is used solely to select competitive carrier for an area while the designated incumbent eligible telecommunications carrier remains under the present system indefinitely or for specific time period others suggest that an auction system could reward the lowest bidder with the most support but still give other participants so limited support still others ggest the establishment of pilot program to test for successes andor unintended consequences on the other hand others have expressed re servations about adopting re verse auctions stating that many questions remain about how to implement reverse auctions how to administer the costs associated with their adoption and the long term impact they would have on consumers as well as providers concer ns were also expressed that reverse auction would not create favorable envi ronment for network investment possibly resulting in stranded investme nt erratic funding and ultima tely inferior networks identical support rule the criteria used for the distribution of funds for the high cost program has also come under scrutiny high cost program fund distribution is based on what is known as the identical support rule under this rule funds are distributed to competitive eligible telecommunica tions carriers based on the embedded costs or per line support of the incumbent carrier typically the incumbent carrier is wireline carrier while the competitive carrier is wireless carrier the infrastructure costs associated with the investment and maintenance of wireline system are generally significantly higher than those associated with wireless system therefore some have questioned whethe r basing funding levels on the incumbent carriers costs particularly when support is based on more expensive infrastructure is reasonable or even fair switching to more refined distribution methodology more reflective of carriers actual costs they claim would help to alleviate some of the pressure facing funding of the high cost program furthermore they state it is anticipated that the growth in competitive eligible telecommunications carriers will be increasing based on the number of applications pending at the fcc and that therefore addressing this issue is of growing significance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs14 34 joint board recommends cap on highcost fund available at

native regions and competitive telecommunications carriers that file their own cost data will not be subject to capcapping some have also proposed pl acing cap as temporary or permanent measure on the funds available for distribution to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers through the high cost program supporters of capping claim that it will prevent the uncontrolled growth of this part of the high cost program which is the major contributor to the overall growth in the usf in turn they state this will bring stability to th fund and the usf contribution factor they note that both the erate and the rural h ealth care programs operate under yearly caps and with the exception of the low income program which has been relatively stable the high cost program is the only program with builtin restraints on its growth others however are opposed to implementing cap they point out that placing cap on an existing program such as the high cost program could lead to confusion and be very disruptive the dy namic they state is very different than capping programs such as the erate and rural health care at their inception the high cost program they claim is an ongoing program responsible for providing basic voice service and connection to th network fundament tenet of the universal service mandate th placing of cap on this program they claim could have significant unintended consequences which could undermine universal service goals the federalstate joint board recommended that the fcc immediately impose an interim cap on portion of the high cost fund34 more specifically the joint board in may 1 2007 action issued recomme ndation that the fcc place an interim emergency cap on the amount of highc ost support that competitive eligible telecommunications carriers receive for each state from the high cost program the joint board recommended that the suppor t be based on the average level of competitive eligible telecomm unications carrier support distributed in that state in 2006 and that the interim cap apply until one year from the date that it makes its recommendation regarding comprehensive usf reform this is seen as temporary measure to curb the growth of

the use of funds which may be mo re appropriately used elsewh ere taking more refined and precise approach they state will resu lt in using funds more effectively in areas that truly need support

which was comprised of 459 aud its of usf program participants for beneficiaries of all f our programs and contributors to the usf was released by the oig in october 2007 according to the oi g analysis of 459 audits which covered beneficiaries of all four programs as well as contributors in general the audits indicated complia nce with the fccs rules although erroneous payment rates exceeded 9 in most usf program segments the audit resulted in the following erroneous payment rates contributors payments 55 385000000 low income 95 75500000 schools and libraries 129 210000000 high cost 166 618000000 and rural health care 206 445000045 it should be noted that an erroneous paym ent as defined by omb is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount which includes overpayments underpayments and th inappropriate denial of payment or service46 despite this activity however the oig continues to cite the need for additional resources stating that although we have made progress in achieving the goal of establishing more effective oversight program we need significant increases in audit investigative and legal resources to achieve the goal of having truly effective oversight program47 the fccs enforcement bureau is the primary entity within the fcc tasked with enforcing the provisions of the communications act including those related to section 254 universal rvice the enforcement bureau pursues violators and initiates enforcement actions including notices of liability suspensions consent decrees and debarments48 the department of

all four of the programs will be subject to oversight to prevent an fraud waste or abuse see activity in the 110th congress below for discussion of congressional oversight activities concerns about fraud and abuse are shared by both critics and supporters of the program for example critics of the erate program have used examples of fraud waste and abuse to call for halt to the program or at minimum its suspension until additional safeguards are in place s upporters also want to ensure the integrity of all four programs since the misuse of funds or unreasonable administrative costs not only leave the program vulnerable to critics but would only decrease available funding to meet the programs goals antideficiency act compliance more narrowly focused policy issue relating to the operation of the usf deals with antideficiency act ada compliance with the guidance of the office of management and budget omb the fcc decided in august of 2004 that the accounting requirements contained in the ada should be applied to the operation of the usf under this accounting methodol ogy the government is precluded from incurring obligations prior to the funds being available erate fund commitment letters which are issued far in advance of actual funds payment were considered to be obligations therefore ada complian ce requires that the funds be on hand to cover obligations and the pr ogram was required to have the cash on hand to cover all of the commitment letters usac change d the timing of its funds distribution in order to meet this requirement leading to temporary fourmonth suspension from august through november 2004 of erate funding commitments the temporary halt in the disbursement of erate funding commitments the concern that funding for other usf programs might be disrupted and that compliance might necessitate significant increase in usf revenues brought this issue to congressional attention the 108th congress enacted legislation to provide for oneyear exemption through december 31 2005 from the ada for the usf pl 108494 since then the temporary oneyear exemption has been extended three times once to december 31 2006 in conjunction with the

federalstate joint board on universal service released on november 20 2007 available at httphraunfossfccgov edocs_publicattachmatchfcc07j4a1pdfclose of the 110th congress and congress may choose to address this issue in variety of ways it may continue to enact legislation to provide shortterm relief by extending the temporary exemption also it could choose to enact legislation to provide the usf program with perman ent exemption from ada requirements or it may choose to take furt her action allowing the tem porary exemption to expire thereby requiring the fcc to ensure through whatever steps it deems necessary that the usf is in full compliance with ada requirements the fcc has resolved at least temporarily any compliance problems fcc chairman martin in response to ques tioning during his september 2006 senate confirmation hearing stated that the commission has concluded that the ada does apply to the usf however he ssured commerce committee members that funds will be sufficient and that erate program commitment letters will not be delayed50 some however have continued to express concern that the actions taken by the fcc are only temporary and that ada complian ce may jeopardize disbursements for not only the erate program but possibly other usf programs and may cause significant increase in the contribution factor joint board recommendation and the fcc response in 2004 the fcc asked the joint board to review the fccs rules relating to the highcost universal support mechanisms fo r rural carriers in may 2007 the joint board recommended that the fcc impose as temporary measure an interim emergency cap on the amount of highc ost support that competitive eligible telecommunications carriers receive for each state from the high cost program to halt the increasing growth of the high co st fund see the capping section for more details concurrent with that action the joint board committed to forwarding more comprehensive recommendation to the fcc within six months joint board recommendation the joint board on november 20 2007 fo rwarded its further recommendation for comprehensive highcost univers service reform to the fcc51 included among the joint boards recommendations are thos which expand the scope of the universal service basket of services and propose f undamental change to the usf high cost fund the joint board recommended that the definition of the basket of services eligible for universal service support be expanded beyond the current basic voice telecommunications services to include the universal availability of mobility serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs20 52 the joint board anticipates that over the l ong term total funding levels can and should be decreased as broadband and wireless infrastruct ure deployment becomes widespread 26defined as wireless voice and broadband internet services at affordable and comparable rates for all rural and nonrura l areas however unlike currently where an eligible telecommunications carrier must provide all supported services to receive support under the proposed system carrier is not required to offer all three services voice mobility and broadband in order to receive any highcost support the recommendation also calls for the high cost fund to be restructured and capped over an unspecified transition peri od the current high cost fund would be divided into three separa funds broadband fund wireless mobility fund and provideroflastresort fund each fund would have separate distribution mechanism and separate f unding allocation combined funding for the three would be capped at 45 billion which is approximately equal to the 2007 level of highcost funding and would be distributed in th following manner the broadband fund at 300 million the wireless fund at 10 billion and the provideroflastresort fund at 32 billion52 the states pursuant to federal rules would be given major role in the administering and awarding of funds from both the broadband and mobility funds however usac would process and udit the funds funding grants for all three funds would be awarded to only one provider in any geographic area recommendations regarding the provide roflastresort fund which would replace the legacy support systems for incumb ent local exchange carriers were more general in nature as agreement among board members on specific changes was not reached however the board did recommende d that this fund be comprised of the sum of all current incumbent local exch ange carrier support systems and for the present generally remain intact the board did recommend that the fcc establish process and timetable to review and modernize the existing highcost mechanisms and develop coherent system that can be applied to all incumbent carriers 23 furthermore the joint board recommended that the identical cost rule be eliminated the joint board concluded that it is longer in the public interest to use federal universal service support to subsidize competition and build duplicate networks in highcost areas 35 it was noted that many of the wireless carriers currently receiving support through the identical support rule will be eligible to receive support from the mobility fund p ara 28 see identical support rule section for further discussion the joint board also recommended that the fcc seek further comment on changing the distribution methodology for hi ghcost funds to an auction mechanism while not specifically endorsing the use of reverse auctions the joint board did state that reverse auctions may offer advant ages over current highcost distribution mechanisms 6 details on how ch process should be implemented where left up to the fcchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33979crs21 53 comments were due may 5 2008 with replies
