to designate substances of concern and highpriority facilities for regulation both bills requi re assessments of vulnerab ility for designated facilities and preparation and impleme ntation of security plans beyond these basic provisions however the bills would mandate facility actions federal oversight mechanisms and other requireme nts that differ in signifi cant and often controversial ways the purpose of this report is to summarize key provisions of the two bills highlighting selected areas of disagreement and agreement s 2145 collins senator collins chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee hsgac introduced s 2145 the chemical f acility antiterrorism act on december 19 2005 following four full committee hearings on the subject1 co sponsors on

carper and senator levin all members of the hsgac the hsgac reported an amended bill without written report on june 26 2006 chemical sources and substances of concern s 2145 would direct the dhs secretary to promulgate rules for designating chemical facilities referred to in the legislation as chemical sources that would be subject to regulation assigning these facilities to various riskbased tiers and establishing performance based security standards for each tier f acilities would be consid ered for designation if they produced used or stored substance of concern in quantity equal to or greater than threshold quantity to assist dhs in identifying facilities the bill would establish duty to report to dhs for facilities handling more than threshold quantity of designated substance of concern substances of concern would be those that trigger risk management planning requirements under the clean air act caa section 112r72 as well as ammonium nitrate nd any other substance designated by the secretary decision to designat substance would be based on the potential extent of death injury or serious adverse effects to human health and safety or the environment or the potential impact on na tional or economic security or critical infrastructure caused by terrorist incident vulnerability assessments and planning requirements designated facilities would be assigned to riskbased tiers and required to complete and submit to dhs vulnerability assessments security plans and emergency response plans for terrorist incidents dhs w ould be required to review th submissions within five years of their date of submission and to provide written determination to approve disapprove or modify facility assessments and plans as well as implementation of plans dhs would be prohibited from disappr oving site security plan based on the presence or absence of particular secur ity measure if the plan satisfied the performance standards established for th applicable riskbased tier for facilities in the higherrisk tiers s 2145 would require preliminary dhs review of facility assessments and plans within nine months of the date when dhs issues regulations concerning assessments and plans at that time dhs would have to provide notice and compliance assistance to facilities for which an assessment or plan may not be approved three months ter within one year of the date when dhs issues regulations cerning assessments and plan s s 2145 requi res written determination by dhs to approve disapprove or modify facility assessments and plans as well as implementation of plans for higherrisk facilities s 2145 would require intergovernment coordination nd requires facility owners or operators to specify in their pl ans steps taken by the chemical source to coordinate security measures and plans fo r response to terrorist incident with federal state and local government officials including law enforcement and first responders plans would have to be fficient to deter to the maximum extenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs3 practicable terrorist incident or substa ntial threat of such an incident and include security measures to mitigate the consequences of terrorist incident enforcement s 2145 would provide adminis trative civil and criminal penalties for facility owners or operators who fail to submit assessments or plans or to implement plans adequately dhs would be authorized to issue an order for the chemical source to cease operation if the f acility persisted in nonc ompliance with the requirements estab lished under s 2145 coordination the bill would mandate coordination with existing security and emergency response planning in cluding planning under the maritime transportation security act mtsa to ensure coordinati on s 2145 establishes regional security offices and area security committees and plans state and local laws would not be preempted unless they we re inconsistent with federal law information disclosure dhs other federal agencies and state and local agencies would be prohibited from releasin g to the public protected information that term is defined to include vulnerability assessments site security plans security addenda to emergency response plans area s ecurity plans or ma terials developed or produced exclusively in preparation for asse ssments or plans s 2145 also includes in the definition of protected informati on any document obtained by dhs or state or local government from chemical sour ce in accordance with this act and any document prepared by or provided to fede ral agency or state or local government to the extent that the record contains information that 1 describes specific chemical source or the specific vulnerabilities of chemical source 2 was taken from vulnerability assessment site secu rity plan addendum to an emergency response plan materials produced by che mical source exclusiv ely in preparation of such documents or copy of such r ecord in possession of the chemical source and 3 would if disclosed be detrimental to the security of chemical source the introduced bill would have requi red public disclo sure of written certifications of compliance by facility ownersoperators dhs certificates of compliance issued for individual sources dhs orders issued for noncompliance and lists of facilities for which dhs has issued an approval or disapproval unless the secretary determined that release of par ticular record would increase security risk an amendment to s 2145 was approved durin g markup that reverses this provision such that certifications and orders could not be disclo sed unless the secretary were to determine that release of particular r ecord would increase security risk even if the secretary determined an absence of increased risk the secretary would be authorized but not required to disclose the record judicial review as introduced s 2145 was silent with respect to judicial review however s 2145 was amended dur ing markup to permit any person to file petition with the us court of appeals fo r the district of columbia for judicial review of rule within 60 days of prom ulgation the reported bill directs the court to review rules in accordance with the administrative procedure act ie 5 usc 701 et seq the amended bill would allow only an owner or operator whose facility is affected by final agency action to file petition for judicial review of the actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs4 3 the caa 112r2c defines stationary s ource to mean any buildings structures equipment installations or substanceemitting stationary activities i which belong to the same industrial group ii which are located on one or more contiguous properties iii which are under the control of the same person or persons under common control and iv from which an accidental release may occu r the caa 112r2a defines accidental release to mean an unanticipated emission of regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air fro m stationary source the caa 112r2b defines regulated substance to mean substance listed under caa 112r paragraph 3with an appropriate us dist rict court the standard of review would remain that in the administrative procedure act only the owner or operator and the secretary could participate in such civil actions in addition the bill expressly prohibits any private civil actions against an owner or operator to enforce provisions of the act other accountability measures other provisions of s 2145 would require reports by dhs and gao estab lish process by which any person might submit report to dhs regarding vulnerabilities of chemical source and protect whistleblowers from retaliation during markup an amendment was approved that would prohibit gao from releasing to the pub lic any protected information in its reports ammonium nitrate s 2145 directs the dhs secr etary in consultation with the secretary of agriculture to regulate the production and sale of ammonium nitrate to prevent misappropriation or use in violation of law the bill would require registration of facilities and purchasers and restrict sales to registered producers sellers and purchasers s 2486 lautenberg senator lautenberg member of the hsgac introduced the chemical security and safety act of 2006 s 2486 on march 30 2006 cosponsors on introduction included senator obama sena tor kerry senator menendez senator durbin and senator biden chemical sources and substances of concern s 2486 addresses security and safety at stationary sources which are defined by reference to the caa section 112r23 but also to include other facilities that produce process handle or store any substance of concern and which the dhs secretary designates as high priority substances of concer n are defined as substances listed under the caa section 112r3 in threshold quantity or any other substance designated by the secretary under section 5d of the ch emical security and safety act in threshold quantity the dhs secretary in consultation with the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa woul d be directed to designate by rule at least 3000 facilities handling substances of c oncern as high priority categories in designating highpriority facilities the secretary would be directed to consider potential severity of har m proximity to population cent ers threats to national security threats to critical infrastructur threshold quantities of substances ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs5 concern that pose serious threat and othe r safety or security factors that the dhs secretary in consultation with the epa ad ministrator determines to be appropriate s 2486 also would require the secretary to identify the 600 highest priority stationary sources general duty to ensure safe d esign operation and maintenance for all stationary sources s 2486 w ould establish general duty to identify hazards that may result from criminal release of substance ensure that the facility is designed operated and maintained in asafe manner and reduce the consequences of criminal release owners or operators of stationary sources would be required to involve employees in ensuring the design operation and main tenance of safe fac ilities an obligation that is defined to include use of inhere ntly safer technology ist to the maximum extent practicable s 2486 defines ist as the use of technology product raw material or practice that as compared to the technology products raw materials or practices currently in use significantly reduces or eliminates the possibility of the release of substance of concern and significantly reduces or eliminates the hazards to public health and safety and the environment associated with the release or potential release this definition includes such actions as chemical substitution process redesign product reformulation and proce dural and technological modification vulnerability assessments and planning requirements each owner or operator of highpriority facility would be required to submit to dhs written report that would include vulnerability assessment hazard assessment and prevention preparedness and response plan th at would incorporate the results of the assessments and meet require ments established by dhs each plan would have to include discussion of the practicability of implementing each element of safe facility design operati on and maintenance the bill also requires consultation with employees at the facility in developing the assessments and plan s 2486 would require the dhs secretary to review each submitted report to determine whether it complied with dhs regulations and to certify approval for compliant facilities in addition the bill directs the dhs secretary to notify any owner or operator who submits plan that is disapproved s 2486 would establish an information clearinghouse to assist facilities in complyin g with requirements enforcement s 2486 would provide administrative civil and criminal penalties for f acility owners or operators who failed to comply with compliance order or directive issued by the secretary if threat of terrorist attack is beyond the scope of submitted prevention prep aredness and response plan or current implementation of the plan is insufficient dhs would be authorized to issue compliance order if facility persiste d in noncompliance the secretary would be authorized after notifying the facility of that fact to seek judicial relief to abate the threat such judicial relief could include an order to cease operation and such other orders as would be necessary to protect public health or welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs6 4 the judicial review provisions of the apa are codified at 5 usc 701706coordination s 2486 mandates c oordination of implementation for the chemical security and safety act with the mtsa and directs the dhs secretary to minimize duplication of requirements for ri sk assessment and response plans under other federal law information disclosure s 2486 would protect dhs from public disclosure requirements of the federal freedom of information act foia for all documents provided to the dhs secretary under this ac t and all informati on that describes specific vulnerability or stationary source derived from those documents few documents are excepted from this protection such as compliance certifications by the dhs secretary in additi on information derived from th protected documents may be disclosed if it would not divulge tr ade secrets not identify any particular stationary source and is not reasonably likely to increase the probability or consequences of criminal release protection is provided for information at other federal agencies but state and local government agencies are protected from disclosure requirements of all federal state and local laws as for dhs information protection few documents are excepte d from protection at state and local government agencies judicial review s 2486 is silent with resp ect to judicial review of dhs actions that means that final actions by dhs whether rules or orders would be subject to judicial review as provided by the generally applicable administrative procedure act apa 5 usc 501 et seq the apa permits any person the right to petition federal district court for review of final agency action under the apa an agency rulemaking can be held unlawful or set aside if it is found to be arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or ot herwise not in accordance with the law4 the court can also compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed other accountab ility measures s 2486 would establish employees safety and security committees at stationary sources with at least 15 employees and mandates employee training at all stationary sources with respect to the acts requirements in addition the bill woul d require notificati on and involvement of employees in facility inspections and investigations protection is provided for employees who might report problems at their facilities to authorities ammonium nitrate s 2486 does not author ize additional regulation regarding sale or purchase of ammonium nitrate key similarities and differences chemical sources both bills would direct the secretary to focus on chemical sources regulated under the c aa 112r however s 2145 provides the secretary discretion with respect to designating and requires only that the secretary consider any facility that is stationary source for which the owner or operator is required to complete ri sk management plan fac ilities required to complete risk management plan are those at whic h regulated substance is present at ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs7 quantity greater than threshold quantity caa 112r7 in contrast s 2486 would apply to all stationary sources which the bill defines with reference to the caa 112r2 that definition includes any buildings structures equipment installations or substanceemitting stationary activities arguably wider category than facilities i which belong to the same indus trial group ii which are located on one or more contig uous properties iii which are under the control of the same person or persons under common cont rol and iv from which an accidental release may occur in addition both bills would authorize designation of add itional facilities for regulation s 2145 but not s 2486 exempts facilities owned or operated by the department of energy the partment of defense or licensee or certificate holder of the nuclear regulatory commission substances of concern s 2145 would define substance of concern as chemical substance present at chemical source in quantity equal to or exceeding the threshold quantity as established under the caa 112r3 and 5 ammonium nitrate in quantity to be determined by the secretary or any other chemical substance above threshold quantity design ated by the secretary s 2486 would define substance of concern similarly but does not include ammonium nitrate in its definition general duty s 2145 would not impose general duty on stationary sources that produce process handle or store any substance of concern as does s 2486 the latter would require owners or operators of stationary sources 1 to identify hazards that may result from criminal release 2 to ensure the design operation and maintenance of safe facilities and 3 to eliminat or minimize the consequences of any criminal release inherently safer technology s 2486 would require owners or operators of stationary sources to ensure the design operation and maintenance of safe facilities which the bill defines to include the use of ist to the maximum extent practicable higher priority stationary sources are required to consider use of ist implement ist to the maximum extent practicable and document consideration in security and response plans s 2145 does not require consideration or implementation of ist although it exp licitly allows consideration and use of technologies that would reduce potential c onsequences of any successful terrorist attack as security measure in site s ecurity plan during markup of s 2145 the committee approved an amendment that would prohibit the secretary from disapproving security plan because it failed to incorporate particular security measure this provision was adopted to sure that the secret ary would not require ist information protection both bills would exempt dhs from foia requirements for public disc losure of agency documents s 2145 would prohibit disclosure of protected in formation see definition above in addition it prohibits disclosure of certifications and orders that might reveal the compliance status of regulated facilities certifications but not orders may be released only if the secretary determines that release of such information would not increase the risk to facility s 2145 directs the secretary to develop protocols to ensure to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs8 maximum extent practicable that protected information will be maintained in secure location and that access will be limited to persons granted access for the purpose of carrying out the chemical facility antiterrorism act the bill also mandates that any officer or employee of federal state or local government agency who knowingly discloses any protected inform ation be imprisoned for up to one year fined under chapter 227 of title 18 united states code or both and if federal employee removed from office or employment s 2486 would exempt dhs from foia requirements with respect to all documents provided to the dhs secretary under this act and all information that describes specific vulnerability or stationary source derived from those documents but the bill also would allow public disc losure of information derived from the documents and information that is protect ed if it would not divulge trade secrets identify any particular stationary source and is not reasonably likely to increase the probability or consequences of criminal release s 2486 would not restrict disclosure of certifications under 6b orders under 10a or best practices established under 134 of the act the b ill would require the secretary to develop information protection protocols but s 2486 would not authorize penalties for unauthorized disclosure of protected information regional and area planning s 2145 would establish regional dhs security offices to oversee facility effort s and area committ ees to coordinate local state and federal security and emer gency response planning s 2486 does not include such provisions judicial review s 2145 distinguishes between rulemaking and other final agency actions with respect to courts of jurisdiction as well as parties authorized to act s 2145 would allow challenges to fina l rules only in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia but challenges to any other final ac tions could be filed only in the appropriate fede ral district court becau s 2486 does not address judicial review of fi nal dhs actions actions may be filed in any fe deral district court s 2145 would permit any person to file petition for judicial review of final regulation but would permit only the owner or operator of chemical source to file petition for review of final agency action or order only that owner or operator and the secretary would have the right to par ticipate in such civil action in contrast because s 2486 does not address judicial review of final dhs actions any person who is affected by final dhs action incl uding promulgation of final rule has the right under the administrative procedure act to file an action for its review and to participate in any civil action initiated by another finally s 2145 explicitly denies any right to private civil actions against an owner or operator to enforce provisions of the act again s 2486 is silent with respect to private rights of action as re sult it is unclear whether private right of action would be permitted worker involvement s 2486 would establish employees safety and security committees at facilities with 15 or mo re employees to identify discuss and make recommendations to owners or operato rs concerning potential hazards and risks relevant to security safety health and the environment these committees are tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs9 participate in developing reviewing and revising vulnerability assessments hazard assessments and prevention preparedness and response plans at their facilities owners or operators would be required to provide em ployees annually with four hours of training relevant to security and safety planni ng s 2145 does not have such provisions both bills provide protection for employees who might report problems at their facilities to authorities but whistleblower protection provisions are more extensive and detailed in s 2486 than in s 2145 ammonium nitrate s 2145 directs the dhs secr etary in consultation with the secretary of agriculture to regulate the production and sale of ammonium nitrate to prevent misappropriation or use in violation of law the bill would require registration of facilities and purchasers and it would restrict sales to registered producers sellers and purchasers s 2486 does not contain such provisions table 1 summarizes selected provisions of the two billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs10 table 1 comparison of s 2145 as reported and s 2486 as introduced in the 109th congress provision s 2145 as reported s 2486 as

dhs under 3a but not facilities owned or operated by the department of energy department of defense or licensee or certificate holder of the nuclear regulatory commission in designating facilities the dhs secretary must consider 1 any facility that is stationary source under the clean air act caa 112r2 and for which the owner or operator is required to complete risk management plan in accordance with caa 112r7 bii 2 any other facility that produces uses or stores substance of concern and 3 any additional facility that the dhs secretary determines shall be designated chemical source 3cd includes all stationary sources under the caa 112r2 in addition to any other sources designated in regulations as high priority under 5d by the dhs secretary 5 criteria for designating facilitiesrequires the dhs secretary to establish criteria for designating chemical sources by regulation the dhs secretary must base designation criteria on the following risk factors perceived threat to facility potential extent and likelihood of serious adverse effects to human health and safety or to the environment threats to or potential impact on national security or critical infrastructure potential threats or harm to the economy proximity of facility to population centers nature and quantity of substances of concern and other securityrelated factors necessary to protect public health and safety critical infrastructure and national and economic security 3ab comparable provision but criteria for designating high priority sources are similar see identifying priorities belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs13 provision s 2145 as reported s 2486 as introduced identifying priorities requires the dhs secretary to promulgate rules establishing riskbased tier system of chemical sources consisting of several tiers and providing guidance to owners and operators regarding actions that would enable source to move to lower risk tier one or more tiers must be higher risk tiers directs the dhs secretary to determine the tier applicable to each designated chemical source note that the listing of facilities is not through rulemaking 3erequires the dhs secretary in consultation with the administrator of the us environmental protection agency epa and state and local government agencies responsible for planning for and responding to criminal releases and for providing emergency health care to designate high priority facilities by regulation based on the severity of the threat posed by criminal release at least 3000 facilities must be designated high priority in designating facilities high priority the dhs secretary must consider potential severity of harm proximity to population centers threats to national security threats to critical infrastructure threshold quantities of substances of concern that pose serious threat and other safety or security factors that the dhs secretary in consultation with the epa administrator determines to be appropriate each stationary source must be considered individually the dhs secretary also must identify the 600 highest priority stationary sources 5ab and 6c1 in designating highpriority categories the dhs secretary in consultation with the epa administrator is authorized to designate by rule any chemical facility as stationary source 5d httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33447crs14 provision s

general duty 1 to identify hazards that may result from criminal release 2 to ensure the design operation and maintenance of safe facilities and 3 to eliminate or minimize the consequences of any criminal release requires that the owner or operator of stationary source involve employees of the source in each aspect of ensuring the design operation and maintenance of safe facilities 4 security standards requires the dhs secretary to establish security performance standards for each riskbased tier of facilities with stricter requirements for tiers posing greater risks the standards must allow an owner or operator to select security measures that in combination satisfy the security performance standards and must be riskbased performancebased flexible and include consideration of the
