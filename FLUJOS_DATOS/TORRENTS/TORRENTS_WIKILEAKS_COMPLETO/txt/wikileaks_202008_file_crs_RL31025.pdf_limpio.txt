5 in fatheronly families according to some estimates 60 of children born during the 1990s will spend significant portion of their childhood in home without their biological father re search indicates that children raised in singleparent families are more likely than children raised in twoparent families with both biological parents to do poorly in school have emo tional and behavioral problems become teenage parents and have povertylevel in comes as adults2 nonetheless it is widely ac knowledged that most of thes mothers despite the added stress of being single parent do good j ob raising their children that is although children with absent fathers are at greater risk of having the aforementioned problems most do not experience them in hopes of improving the longterm outlook for children in singleparent families federal state and local governments along with public and private organizati ons are supporting prog rams and activities that promote the financial nd personal responsibility of nonc ustodial fathers to their children and reduce the incidence of father absence in the lives of children the third finding of the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 states promotion of responsible fatherhood and mo therhood is integral to successful child rearing and the wellbeing of children mo reover three of the four goals of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program are consistent with the components of most fatherhood programs the three fatherhoodrelated goals are ending welfare dependence by employme nt and marriage reducing outofwedlock

federal ch ild support enforcement cse program fathers historically have been ignored with regard to th eir input or participation in welfare programs moreove r it was not until 1996 that congress broadened its view to acknowledge the noneconomic contributions that fathers make to their children by authorizing the use of cse funds to promote access and visitation programs with the enactment of the 1996 welfare refo rm law which helped reduce the welfare rolls increase the employment of lowincome mothers and strengthen the cse program congress began focusing its ttention on the emotional wellbeing of children historically congress had treat ed visitation and child support as legally separate issues with only child support enforcement activities under the purview of the federal government the 1996 law authorized an annual 10 million entitlement of cse funds to states to establish and operate access and visitation programs3 it appears that consensus has occurred regarding the need to connect or reconnect noncustodial parents to their children during the 106th congress representative nancy johnson then chair of the ways and means subcommittee on human resources stated to take the next step in welfare reform we must find way to help children by providing them with more than working mother and spor adic child support she noted that many lowincome fathers have problems similar to those of mothers on welfare namely they are likely to have dropped out of high school to have little work experience and to have significant barriers th at lessen their ability to find andor keep job she also asserted that in many cases these men are dead broke rather than dead beats and that the federal government should help these noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional obligations to their children during the 106th 107th and 108th congresses legisla tion was passed by the house but not by the senate that would have established categorical competitive grants to community and faithbased organizations for responsible fatherhood programs moreover each of president bushs budgets has included grant programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31025crs3 4 national

detailed legislative hi story of fatherhood initiatives see the discussion of legislative action later in this report what are fatherhood initiatives the realization that one parent especi ally lowincome parent often cannot meet the financial needs of her or his ch ildren is not new in 1975 congress viewed the cse program as way to make noncustodi parents responsible for the financial support of their children in more recent years congress has viewed the cse program as the link that could enable si ngle parents who are lowwage earners to become selfsupporting with the advent of welfare reform in 1996 congress agreed that many noncustodial parent s were in the same financia l straits as the mothers of their children who were receiving cash welf are thus the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 requires states to have laws under which th state has the authority to issue an order or request that court or administrative process issue an order that requires noncustodial parents who were unable to pay th eir child support obligation for child receiving tanf benefits to par ticipate in tanf work activities as noted earlier the 1996 law also provided funding for states to develop programs that supported the noncustodial parents right nd responsibility to visit and interact with his or her children to help fathers and mothers meet thei r parental responsib ilities many policy analysts and observers suppor t broadbased colla borative strategies that go beyond welfare and child support agencies and include schools work programs prison systems churches community organi zations and the health care system although congress only recently author ized federal funding specifically earmarked for responsible fatherhood progra ms many states and localities private organizations and nonprofit agencies have been operating fatherhood programs for several years4 most fatherhood programs include media campaigns that emphasize the importance of emotional physical ps ychological and financial connections of fathers to their children to counterbalan ce some of the procedural psychological emotional and physical barriers to pate rnal involvement most fatherhood programs include many of the following componentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31025crs4 parenting education course that descri bes the responsibilities of parents to their children it discusses the need for affection gentle guidance financial support the need to be proud example and respectful of the childs mother and the need to recognize developmentally appropria behavior for children of different

listening to childre ns concerns setting firm limits on behavior and job training opportunities skills development interviewing skills job search job retention skills job advancement skills etc although most people refer to programs that seek to help fathers initiate or maintain contact with their children and become emotionally involved in their lives as fatherhood programs the programs generally are genderneutral their underlying goal is participati on of the noncustodial parent in the lives of his or her children funding for fy2001 congress appropr iated 3 million for nong

responsible fatherhood programs the contracts in aggregate am ounted to 41 million per year10 research and evaluation research findings indicate that father absence affects outcomes for children in terms of schooling emotional and behavioral matu rity labor force participation and nonmarital childbearing these findings hol d when income is taken into account so the negative effects of father absence are not limited to those created by reduced family income11 both advocates and critics of the cse program agree that parents should be responsible for the economic and emotional wellbeing of their children they agree that many lowincome noncustodial pare nts are unable to m eet their financial responsibility to their children and are barely able or unable to support themselves they also agree that some noncustodial parents do not know how to be responsible parents because they were not taught that knowledge or were not exposed to enough positive role models that they could emulate below are several examples of demonstration programs that seek to or sought to help lowincome men become responsible fathers by helping them to gain employment or job mobility and by teaching them life skills so that they might reconnect with their children in positive sustained manner mdrc parents fair share demonstration project the parents fair share pfs demons tration was nati onal

the pfs demonstration which was designed by mdrc and conducted and funded by public and private organizations found that parents who receive d pfs services were more likely to pay child support through the cse system than those who remained in the control group in all seven sites the pr oportion of parents who paid child support during the 18 month followup period increased significan tly but the amount of child support paid over the 18 months increased by statistica lly significant amount in only two of the seven sites the final report on the pfs demonstration concluded that the program did not significantly increase employment or earnings among the full sample of pfs participants during the two years after they entered the program however the program did increase earnings among subg roup of men who were characterized as less employable ie those without high school diploma and with little r ecent work experience13 in addition another of the fi nal reports found that although pfs did not affect the frequency of fathers visits with their children it did increase the level of disagreement betw een parents about childrearing according to the researchers this finding might suggest that some noncustodial parents were becoming more involved in new areas of d ecisionmaking about the child which the researchers viewed as positive development the report noted that the increased level of disagreements between the parents was not accompanied by an increased level of aggressive forms of conflict or domestic violence which researchers surmise might indicate that the parents were able to distinguish between legitimate parental differences of opinion versus latent animo sity in their malefemale relationship14 one of the reports noted the following as lessons learned from the pfs demonstration lowincome noncustodial fathers are disadvantaged group many live on the edge of poverty and face severe barriers to finding jobs while those who can find work typically hold lowwage or temporary jobs despite their low irregular income many of these fathers are quite involved in their childrens lives and when they can provide financial and ot her kinds of support some services such as peer support proved to be very important and valuable to the men and became the focal point of the program other services such as skillbuilding were hard to implement because the pr oviders had little experience working with such disadvantaged group it was difficult to find employers willing to hire the men and the providers were not equipped to deal with the circumstances of men who often were simply trying to make it from one day to the next finally we learned about the challenges of implementing program like pfs which involves the partnership of various agenci with different goals and about the difficulty of recruiting lowincome fathers into such program15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31025crs8 15 continued november 2001 pp vvi 16 ibid p v 17 sara

programs included structure the program to encourage longert erm participation and to include job retention services provide fathers who cannot find private sect or employment with community service jobs earmark adequate funding for employ ment services involve custodial mothers in the program and provide fathers with legal services to help them gain visitation rights and encourage partnerships betw een cse agencies and fatherhood programs16 some researchers of the pfs approach c ontend that broader array of intensive employment services such as skills training combined with parttime work and community service employment for persons who were unable to get job might have improved the outcomes of the program other analysts maintain that most of the fathers who participated in the pfs demonstration were estranged from their children when they entered the program and that some of them participated in lieu of serving time in jail they assert that new unwed fathers are generally very attached to their children around the time of the childs birt h and probably are more motivated than fathers of older children to take advantage of the opportunities andor services offered by fatherhood programs17 fragile families and child wellbeing study fragile family consists of lowincome children born outside of marriage whose two natural parents are working together to raise them either by living together or frequent visitation according to the 1997 national survey of americas families nsaf 25 of poor children under the age of two who were born outside of marriage lived with both of their biologi cal parents another 35 lived with their mother and saw their father at least every week18 the fragile families and child wellbeing study is following group of 4700 children who

partners for fragile families pff demonstration projects the purpose of the demonstration projects was to develop new ways for cs agencies and communitybased nonprofit and faithbased organizations to work toge ther to help young noncustodial fathers age 16 to 25 who had not yet established paternity and who had little or involvement with the cse program obtain employment health nd social services make child support payments to their childre n learn parenting skills and enable then to work with the mothers of their children to build stronger parenting partnerships the pff demonstration operated from 2000 to 2003 in 13 projects in 9 states26 the demonstration project sites were located in california colorado indiana maryland massachusetts minnesota new yor k pennsylvania and wisconsin27 according to hhs of the 97 million in federal funding budgeted for the projects 71 million was spent an additional 14 million was sp ent for an evaluation of the projects the underlying theory of the pff demons tration projects was that by targeting new fathers at point when they had little or previous involvement with the cse system and when they still had an opportun ity to develop positive relationship with the mother of their children and the children themselves the projects could better assist these young parents to become str ong financial and emotional resources for their children recent evaluation of the implementation of the pff projects included the following statement although the concept of pff was unique when it was developed in 1996 by the time the demonstration was fully implemented other responsible fatherhood programs had started in many communities nationwide independent of pff the child support enforcement system was already incorporating more father friendly approaches to service delivery at about the same time pff was in its developmental stages the child support system had begun to absorb the lessons learned from earlier fatherhood initiatives such as the parents fair share project and the responsible fatherhood demonstration by the time pff was operational some may have viewed it as less pioneering than when it was conceived several years earlier in addition the number of young fathers who had not established paternity for their ch ildren decreased in the mid to late 1990s as result of the success of inhos pital paternity blishment initiatives across the country that established paternity at the time of childs birth the pool of young fathers without paternity established for their children had diminished in the pff sites by the time the projects were implemented28 the department of health and human services hhs has sponsored several other evaluations of the pff demonstrati on projects according to hhs

department of health and human services administration for children and families center for policy research and policy studies hhs10093 0012 september 1996reports will include case studies of selected fathers and their families and an analysis of economic and child support outcomes issues an underlying tension in the debate on fatherhood initiatives is the concern of some womens and mothers rights gr oups such as the national womens law center and the national organization for women now that an emphasis on the importance of fathers may lead to underval uing singleparent families maintained by mothers that services for fathers may be at the expense of services for mothers and that the profatherhood discourse might gi ve fathers rights groups some leverage in challenging child custody child suppor t and visitation arrangements some analysts contend that the policy debate on fatherhood initiatives mu st be based on the view that the welfare of fathers mothers and children are intertwined and interdependent otherwise the debate will be very divisive and unproductive29 many issues are associated with the federal governments support of fatherhood initiatives few examples are is the go of federal policy to promote and support the involvement of fathers in their ch ildrens lives regardless of the fathers relationship with the childrens mother what if the father has children by more than one woman what is the federal policy with regard to incarcerated parents and parents recently released from prison does the federal government support counseling education and supe rvised visitation for abusiv fathers so that they can reconnect with their children the discussion below examines two issues that will likely impact the success of congressional fatherhood initiatives the first deals with the role of the cse agency in fatherhood programs presently the cse program is the starting place for many fatherhood programs some analysts contend that since many noncustodial parents have negative view of the cse program the use of the cse program to recruit fathers does not bode well for the ccess of such programs several of the fatherhood bills would make competitiv grants available to community organizations and other groups that have experience in working with lowincome men many of the fatherhood bills in troduced in recent congresses included evaluation components the second issu examines father involvement in the context of the fathers relationship to the childs mother the second issue is based on the premise that formal ma rital relationships last l onger and are more conducive to longterm interaction between fathers and children than other types of relationshipshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31025crs14 30 wade f horn and isabel v sawhill making room for daddy fathers

payments collected by the cse agencies increased from 1 billion to 239 billion moreover the program has made significant improvements in other program measures as well such as the number of parents locate d paternities established and child support orders established advocates of the cse prog ram say that this dramatic program performance is aside from the indirect and intangible benefits of the program such as increased personal responsibility and welf are costavoidance critics of the cse program contend that even with an unpreceden ted array of big brother enforcement tools such as license professional driv ers recreational nd passport revocation seizure of banking accounts retirement f unds and lottery winnings and automatic income withholding from pay checks th program still collects only 19 of child support obligations for which it has respon sibility and collects payments for only 54 of its caseload although the cse program has historically been the policy answer to the problem of father absence because its focus until recently was exclusively on financial support it has had the practical effect of alienating many lowincome fathers who are unable to meet their child support obligations some policy analysts maintain that fathers are in effect devalued when their role in their childrens lives is based solely on their cash contributions they argue that public policies are needed to support the fathers role as nurturer disciplinaria n mentor and moral instructor30 information obtained from noncustodial fa thers for various surveys and studies consistently tells the same story not surprisingly nonc ustodial parents especially lowincome fathers prefer informal ch ild support agreements between themselves and the childs mother wherein they c ontribute cash support when they can and provide noncash aid such as taking care of the children from time to time and buying food clothing presents etc as often as they can many noncustodial fathers maintain that the cse system is dismissive of their financial condition and continues to pursue child support payments current as well as arrearages even when it knows that many of them can barely support th emselves they argue that for welfare families the cse program generally does not improve their childs wellbeing because their child support payments are used to benefit the state and federal government ie welfare reim bursement rather than thei r child they contend that the cse program causes conflicts between them and their childs mother because the women often use it as leverage by threatening to report them to cse authorities take them back to court have more of thei r wages garnished or have them arrested31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31025crs15 31 continued on fathers families and public policy 2000 pp 911 32

singleparent participants subject to new policies under mfip got married and fewer of the twoparent participants had divorced w ithin three years after the program beganmany observers maintain that noncust odial parents and the cse program have irreconcilable differences and that the mo st that should be expected is for the noncustodial parent to clearly understand the purposes of the cse program the requirements imposed on the custodial pare nt the noncustodial parents rights to have their child support payments modified if they incur financial change in circumstances and that they as noncust odial parents have moral and societal responsibility to have to build lovi ng relationship with their children32 if the cse program continues to be the entrance to fatherhood programs most observers contend that the fact that the cse program has not been effective in gaining the cooperation and trust of ma ny noncustodial parents must be acknowledged and addressed several an alysts suggest that to be ccessful fatherhood programs may need to operate independently of the formal cse system others assert that more than any other agency of state government the cse program has the responsibility and is in th position to reach out to fathers who need supportive services they state that cse agencies are already involved in forging relationships with fathers through partners hips with communitybased organizations they also note that cse agencies provide natural link to coordinate with tanf agencies to help families achieve selfsufficiency33 although we do not have any evaluati ons on the effectiveness of fatherhood programs delivered through cse framewo rk versus fatherhood programs that place little emphasis on the formal cse system all of the fatherhood bills introduced in the 107th and 108th congresses included funding for ev aluation and so did many of the fatherhood bills in the 109th congress readers should note that pl 109171 does not include funding for the evaluation of responsible fatherhood grant programs noncustodial father involvement vs promotion of marriage vs maintenance of fragile families the first finding included in the 1996 welfar reform law is that marriage is the foundation of successful society the second finding is that marriage is an essential institution of successful society whic h promotes the interests of children34 however some child welfare advocates argue that marriage is not necessarily the best alternative for all women and their children it is generally agreed that singlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31025crs16 35 see is marriage viable objective for fragile families fragile families research brief 9 princeton bendheimthoman center for research on child wellbeing july 2002parent families are better alternative for children than living with an abusive father many observers caution that government must be careful about supporting programs that provide cash incentives to induce people to marry or that coerce people into marrying they note the problems associated with childbride marriages and the shortterm and often unhappy nature of the socalle d shotgun marriage others respond that many longlasting marriages we re based on financia l alliances eg to increase economic status family wealth status in the community etc they also point out that most government programs are sensitive to the issues of domestic violence and include supports to prevent or end such actions many young children live with both of their parents who are not married but who are cohabiting noting this some analysts argue that coercive policies designed to promote certain types of family structures eg nuclear families at the expense of others may undermine nontra ditional family relationships they contend that more emphasis should be placed on trying to m eet the needs of these fragile families to enable them to stay together for longer periods of time they maintain that if these parents wanted to be married they would be married35 they also point out that because of the complexity of many family relationships there are easy answers from their perspective singlefocus po licy matter whether it aims to support traditional family relationships or fragile families can pl ace children in less desirable situations for instance promoting marri age of biological parents may result in supporting situations where some children in the household have stepparent if all the children are not from the same union similarly promoting fragile families also could result in supporting situations where bi ological parent is absent if all of the children in the household are not all from the same union some promarriage analysts point out that about 75 of children born to cohabiting parents will see th eir parents separate before they reach age 16 compared to about 33 of those born to married pare nts some observers note that even with supports it is unlikely that fragile families unmarried couple will remain together as long as married families thus they argue that the promo tion of marriage should be incorporated into fatherhood programs if the goal is lif etime involvement of fathers in the lives of their children in contrast fatherhood initiatives are so metimes viewed as incompatible with initiatives that encourage the formation and maintenance of twoparent families and with initiatives that promote marriage in fact many observers argue that the focus should be the participation of fathers in their childrens lives regardless of the marital status of the parents as mentioned earlier the tanf law states that the second purpose of the block grant is to end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by pr omoting job preparation work and marriage the fourth purpose of the tanf block grant is to courage the formation and maintenance of twoparent families there has been so discussion about whether the fourth purpose means marriedcouple families or just two parents who are involved in their childrens lives regardless of whether they are married or even living together in late 1999 the clinton administration issued guide on funding for children

activities in contrast hr 4737 107th congress authorized 20 million annually for five years for responsible fatherhood grantsfamilies through the tanf program which broadly interpreted twoparent families to mean not only marriedcouple families but also nevermarried separated and divorced parents whether living together or not thus many states classify their fatherhood programs and programs that enc ourage visitation by noncustodial parents under the rubric of fulfilling the purposes of the tanf program36 in addition it should be noted that some research indicates th at there may be racial component in the ma rriage promotion versus fa therhood involvement debate in 2005 695 of black births were to unmarried women whereas only 254 of white births were to unmarried women given this demographic reality of black and white families in the us the authors of the study37 contend that proposals that earmark five times as much money fo r marriage promotion as for responsible fatherhood promotion38 seem racially insensitive readers should note that pl 109171 funds marriage promotion grants at twice the amount of responsible fatherhood grants ie 100 million per year for five years versus 50 million per year for five years legislative action during the 106th congress president clintons fy2001 budget included 255 million for the first year of proposed f athers
