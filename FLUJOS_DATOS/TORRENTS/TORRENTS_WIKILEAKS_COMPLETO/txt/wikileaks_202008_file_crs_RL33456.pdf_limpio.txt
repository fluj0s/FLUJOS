the leftist workers party pt was inaugurated for second fouryear term as president of brazil lula was reelected in the second round of voting with fairly broad popular support his immediate tasks were to boost brazils lagging economic growth and address the issues of crime violence and poverty despite president lulas personal popularity many predicted that interparty rivalries within his governing coalition would make it hard for him to push his agenda through brazils fractured legislature president lula enjoys high approval ratings 70 in december 2008 and is benefitting from relatively strong economy gdp growth was expected to exceed 5 in 2008 despite the onset of the international financial crisis ongoing corruption investigations involving president lulas pt have not diminished the strength of his second term in office some have criticized president lula however for not using his significant political capital to gain legislative approval for more robust political and economic reform agenda during the first lula term brazils relations with the united states were generally positive although president lula prioritized strengthening relations with neighboring countries and expanding ties with nontraditional partners including india and china brazilus cooperation has increased during president lulas second term particularly on energy issues two presidential visits in march 2007 culminated in the signing of the usbrazil memorandum of understanding mou to promote greater ethanol production nd use throughout latin america in november 2008 brazil and the united states announced plans to expand their biofuels cooperation to assist five additional countries in africa central america and the caribbean in developing their domestic biofuels industries some predict that brazil could eventually become major oil supplier to the united states given its recent deepwater petroleum discoveries the 110 th congress remained interested in brazil particularly its role as an ethanol producer and the 111th congress is expected to maintain similar interest on october 9 2007 the house passed hres 651 engel recognizing the expanding relati onship that exists between the

significant political and economic power in latin america and an emerging global leader former portuguese colony that achieved independence in 1822 brazil occupies almost half of the continent of south america and boasts immense biodiversity including the vast amazon rainforest and significant natural resources brazil is the fifth most populous country in the world brazils 191 million citizens are primarily of european african or mixed african and european descent 1 with an estimated gross domestic product gdp of 18 trillion in 2007 brazils diversified economy is the tenth largest in the world the largest in latin america and one of the largest in the developing world but per capita gross national income is only 5910 and the country has an unequal income distribution2 brazil has long held potential to become world power but its rise to prominence has been curtailed by political setbacks including twentyone years of military rule 19641985 social problems and uneven economic growth between world war ii and 1990 both democratic and military governments sought to expand brazils influence in the world by pursuing stateled industrial policy and an independent foreign policy since the 1990s brazilian foreign policy has focused on strengthening ties with other south american countries engaging in multilateral diplomacy and acting at times as countervailing force to us influence in latin america in recent years for example brazil led other south american countries in blocking the cr eation of usbacked free trade area of the americas ftaa under president luis inácio l ula da silva brazil has aimed with varying degrees of success to raise its global profile brazil has become leader of developing countries in the doha round of the world trade organization wto talks and has sought to increase trade ties with other emerging economies such as china india and south africa additionally brazil is commanding multinational united nations stabilization mission in haiti brazil has also become global leader in biofuels production and may become an increasingly important petroleum exporter currently relations between the united states and brazil may be characterized as warm and friendly the united states has increasingly regarded brazil as significant regional power especially in its role as stabilizing force in latin america despite periodic disagreements on trade and political issues brazil and the united states have worked closely on wide range of bilateral and regional issues us officials have responded positively to brazils recent efforts to reassert its regional leadership which has been challenged by the rise of oilrich hugo chávez in venezuela 3 early in 2007 two highlevel meetings between presidents bush and lula strengthened usbrazilian relations the latter meeting culminated in the march 2007 signing of usbrazil memorandum of understanding mou to promote biofuels development in the western hemisphere4 the initiative was expanded in november

other countries in latin america the countrys federal structure comprising 26 states federal district and some 5581 municipalities evolved from the decentralized colonial structure devised by the portuguese in an attempt to control brazils sizable territory even during the centralizing government of getúlio vargas and the tado novo or new state 19371945 landowning remained the source of local power in brazil and states retained considerable autonomy brazils military governments ruled from 19641985 and while repressive were not as brutal as those in other south american countries although nominally allowing the judiciary and congress to function during its tenure the brazilian military stifled representative democracy and civic action in brazil carefully preserving its influence during one of the most protracted transitions to democracy to occur in latin america brazil was also one of the last countries in the region to abandon stateled economic policies in favor of market reforms significant promarket reforms did not occur until the government of fernando henrique cardoso 19942002 6 during the first decade after its return to democracy in 1985 brazil experienced economic recession and political uncertainty as numerous efforts to control runaway inflation failed and two elected presidents did not complete their terms one elected president died before taking office the other was impeached on corruption charges in 1994 cardoso prominent sociologist of the centerleft brazilian social democratic party psdb was elected by wide margin over luis inácio lula da silva of the workers party p t former metalworker and union leader who had led the pt since the early 1980s cardoso was elected largely on the basis of the success of the antiinflation real plan that he implemented as finance minister which resulted in new currency the real pegged to the dollar in july of 1994 during his first term cardoso achieved macroeconomic stability opened the brazilian economy to trade and investment and furthered privatization efforts despite those achievements the cardoso government was unable to enact muchneeded political and social changes such as social security tax or judicial reforms president cardoso sought second presidential term after constitutional reform was passed in 1997 to allow for reelection and he defeated lula da silva in the first round of voting in october 1998 with 53 of the vote president cardosos popularity fell towards the end of his second term however as brazil faced series of financial crises most analysts credit cardoso with restoring macroeconomic stability to brazils economy and solidifying its role as leader of the 5 joint statement by the united states and brazil announcing the expansion of cooperation on biofuels to advance

campaign for the presidency of brazil unlike in his previous failed campaigns he moderated his leftist rhetoric and while still advocating greater attention to social issues promised to maintain the fiscal and monetary policies associated with brazils standing international monetary fund imf agreements the 2002 presidential election proved to be referendum on eight years of neoliberal policies enacted by cardoso high unemployment rates and economic stagnation led voters to support lula critic of neoliberalism lula was elected decisively in the second round of voting with significant majority of the vote compared to cardosos designated successor josé serra the minister of health and senator from são paulo during his first term president lula maintained the restrained economic policies associated with his predecessor in 2003 the lula government enacted social security and tax reforms and in 2004 law to allow more private investment in public infrastructure projects president lula launched several social programs some of which have been more successful than others the bolsa familia family stipend program which provides monthly stipends to 111 million poor families in exchange for compulsory school attendance for all schoolage children has been credited with reducing poverty but some critic s argue that it has made poor households too dependent on government handouts 9 by 2005 legislative initiatives had stalled and president lula was increasingly criticized for failing to develop effective programs to address land distribution and crime critics argued that iron ically one of the lula governments only major achievements in the first term was to maintain the orthodox economic policies of the cardoso administration in 2006 some analysts began to dismiss president lulas efforts to expand brazils international profile as leader among developing countries as relatively inexpensive tactic to shore up domestic support 10 that had failed to yield many concrete results criticism of lula further escalated with the onset of several corruption scandals involving top pt officials that occurred during the latter half of lulas first term11 congressional inquiry in april 2006 cleared president lula of any direct responsibility for the scandals g17g140g157g152g139g142g155g561g344g342g342g348g561g7g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561

brazilians though divided by class and region effectively voted in favor of continuing macroeconomic stability under second lula administration despite the corruption scandals that had involved lulas party during the first term the pt did not fare as well as president lula in the legislative elections suffering loss of 9 seats in the chamber of deputies and losing 4 senate seats some assert that the election outcome shows that president lula successfully distanced himself from the pt and its corruption scandals relying on his personal popularity rather than his party affiliation to win others attribute his win to the success of the bolsa familia program and the countrys macroeconomic stability which led voters in poorer income brackets to overwhelmingly support him 12

from an expanding economy president lulas second administration has been periodically hindered by corruption scandals and lack of support from members of his coalition for example legislative progress stalled throughout 2007 as the president of the brazilian senate renan calheiros key lula ally faced corruption charges in december 2007 senators voted to acquit calheiros of all wrongdoing even though congressional ethics panel had recommended that he be impeached president lula suffered major setback in december 2007 as senatorsincluding some of his own supportersvoted not to extend the provisional tax on financial transactions cpmf that his government had requested 14 the october 2008 municipal elections dominated the political scene in brazil throughout much of the year although polls predicted that pt candidates would sweep majority of the mayoral races held in large cities in the first round of voting the pt did not perform as well as expected while the number of pt mayors increased from 411 to 559 the pt only won 6 mayoral races in state capitals and lost second round runoff election for the politicallyimportant mayorship of são paulo the ptallied pmdb won 1201 mayoral races while the main opposition party the psdb won 786 together the 12 parties in the ru ling coalition won 769 million votes nearly 60 of all votes cast 15 some claim that the outcome of the municipal ballot will have significant impact on the 2010 presidential election as result of having demonstrated the relative strength of political parties and electoral coalitions as politicians

have focused primarily on inflation control when president lula took office in 2003 brazil had an extremely high level of public debt virtually necessitating that he adopt austere economic policies despite his leftist political origins president lula has maintained restrained economic policies even surpassing the imfs fiscal and monetary targets as result brazil has begun to experience some benefits including lower inflation and lower credit risk rating in december 2005 the lula government repaid its 155 billion debt to the imf ahead of schedule the governments overall foreign debt was reduced by 199 between 2003 and 2006 17 fiscal discipline has also been accompanied by record exports that enabled brazil to post gdp growth of 54 in 2007 and record trade surpluses in each of the last four years however brazil still suffers from high real interest rates which have dampened investment and economic growth in addition rising inflation rates largely attributed to high food prices and swelling domestic demand are of increasing concern to brazilian consumers brazil is major exporter of agricultural and industrial products and plays significant role in the world trading system

reform gdp growth in brazil reached 54 in 2007 and is estimated to have reached 53 in 200820 despite the success of these efforts some analysts have identified several factors that could constrain brazils longterm growth potential these include sizeable public debt burden excessive government spending inflation high taxes and interest rates low investment and savings rates and an unwieldy public pension sy stem that 2006 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd asserted is significant obstacle to sustained economic growth21 despite his tremendous

the brazilian economy in order to address the credit shortage the government reduced the rate of compulsory cash deposits for commercial banks which freed 379 billion in credit the national social and economic development bank bndes increased credit lines to productive sectors and the central bank provided 124 billion to small banks23 president lula has also acted to maintain domestic consumption

increase pac investments by 53 billion to total of 255 billion through 2010 however only 30 billion of the pac investment is government funded and it is unclear if the private sector will be willing

despite its welldeveloped economy and large resource base brazil has had problems solving deepseated social problems like poverty and income inequality brazil has had one of the most unequal income distributions in latin america region with the highest income inequality in the world 2004 world bank study reported that some 50 million brazilians live in poverty27 the development program has identified 600 braz ilian municipalities many in the north and northeastern part of the country in which poverty levels are similar to those present in poor african countries one major cause of poverty and inequality in brazil has been the extreme concentration of land ownership among the countrys elites 2004 study found that 1 of the brazilian population controlled 45 of the farmland28 the brazilian government has also acknowledged that there is racial component to poverty in brazil people of african descent in brazil also known as afrobrazilians represen t roughly 45 of the countrys population but constitute 64 of the poor and 69 of the extreme poor 29 other factors that inhibit social mobility in brazil include lack of access to quality education and job training opportunities for the countrys poor brazils endemic poverty and inequality have until recently not been significantly affected by the governments social programs march 2005 oecd study found that even though brazil has spent the same level or more of public spending on social programs as other countries with similar income levels it has not achieved the same social indicators as those countries 30 there has been more recent evidence however that the lula governments bolsa familia family stipend program combined with relative macroe conomic stability and growth over the past few years has reduced poverty rates

stabilization force of some 9000 personnel in haiti brazilian foreign policy has tended to emphasize regional integration first through the common market of the south mercosur and now the rio group and the union of south american nations unasur brazils role as leader in south america has been challenged by hugo chávez in venezuela who has used his countrys vast oil wealth to gain influence in the region particularly in bolivia and ecuador whereas lula emphasized forging relations with other emerging economies during his first term he appears to have adopted more pragmatic foreign policy during his second term including focus on improving brazil us relations since the mid1990s brazil has had much more success in developing political cohesion than true economic integration among its neighbors in the southern cone mercosur was established in 1991 by brazil argentina paraguay and uruguay in 1996 chile and bolivia became associate members peru followed in 2003 not implemented and venezuela and mexico in 2004 34 associate members have voting rights and need not observe the common external tariff in october 2004 after years of talks mercosur and the andean community of nations signed trade pact giving all andean countriesbolivia colombia ecuador peru and venezuelathe equivalent of associate membership this breakthr ough led to the creation of the south american community of nations later renamed unasur two months later in pact that included 12 countries those in mercosur the andean community along with chile guyana and suriname in december 2005 mercosur agreed to the accession of venezuela as full member which some say could add decidedly antiamerican factor to the pact the paraguayan congress has yet to approve venezuelas accession in december 2006 bolivia expressed its intention to join mercosur as full member but critics say that its accession would politicize the union unnecessarily recent events do not bode well for the future of mercosur in 2006 mercosurs internal dispute resolution process proved unable to resolve dispute between argentina and uruguay over whether to allow european companies to construct two paper mills along the river that demarcates their border at the same time uruguay diversified its trade with the united states and even threatened to withdraw from mercosur arguing that it seems to serve only the needs of argentina and brazil furthermore mercosur has not addressed trade asymmetries among its members resolved the issue of double tariffs on some imports from outside the region or drafted common customs code leaving some analysts to believe it has become forum for foreign policy posturing some within the brazilian gove rnment and private sector believe brazil has outgrown mercosur these thoughts have only been reinforced by recent talks between brazil and the european union concerning the possibility of bilateral trade deal 35 in addition to trying to expand its regional profile through established political and economic channels brazilian government and business officials have worked together to expand the countrys commercial interests in the region some of those efforts have been more

moraless demandsincluding cutting tariffs for bolivian exports to brazil and stepping up investments in boliviain order to secure access to bolivian gas 37 brazils political business and military ventures are complemented by the countrys trade policy in brazil the ministry of foreign relations continues to dominate trade policy causing the countrys commercial interests to be at times subsumed by larger foreign policy goal namely enhancing brazils influence in latin america and the world38 for example while concluding meaningful trade agreements with developed economies such as the united states and the european union would probably be beneficial to brazils longterm economic selfinterest the brazilian government has instead prioritized its leadership role within mercosur and expanded trade ties with countries in africa asia and the middle east some analysts assert that these southsouth initiatives have enhanced brazils international profile but others have noted that they have yielded few concrete results for the country and that they have come at the expense of brazilus relations roberto abdenur the former brazilian ambassador to washington criticized the southsouth approach of the brazilian foreign ministry for indoctrinating brazilian diplomats with antiimperialist and antiamerican attitudes 39

brazil as friendly country similar to chile governed by moderate leftist government they assert that the united states seeks to increase cooperation with moderate leftist governments in latin america
