subject iran brother of irgcs safavi says us terror designation of irgc will preclude iraq security cooperation classified by political minister counselor maura connelly for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary xxxxxxxxxxxx iran revolutionary guard corps irgc xxxxxxxxxxxx told london iran watcher xxxxxxxxxxxx that irans cooperation on security in iraq though not yet evident would be forthcoming but in the same breath argued that us terrorist designation of the irgc would prevent any such cooperation xxxxxxxxxxxx for the usg to hold its hand on designation came xxxxxxxxxxxx engaged with the invited group at length on tehrans view of usiran relations iraqi security and the nuclear issue xxxxxxxxxxxx candid remarks which included extremely vigorous exchanges with xxxxxxxxxxxx alternated between aggressive characterizations of irans relations in the persian gulf admissions of the irgcs presence and role in iraq and afghanistan and apparently earnest statements of irans desire for cooperation with the united states xxxxxxxxxxxx appeared to pay close attention to xxxxxxxxxxxx message on need for irans behavior in iraq to match its stated support for iraqi stability and for iran to weigh the benefits of the e3 3 incentives package and suspension for suspension offer which remains on the table end summary xxxxxxxxxxxx private plea on irgc designation 2 c xxxxxxxxxxxx made his private plea on not designating the irgc under us law after threehour long larger group discussion during which xxxxxxxxxxxx had stressed that attacks on us forces in iraq by militias using iranianprovided ordnance had actually increased from may to july despite irans claim to support iraqi stability xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that the usg would soon see he was vague on how soon evidence of iranian security cooperation in the form of diminished attacks taking the july discussions in baghdad as opposed to those held in may as the point at which the irgc had decided it could go forward with such cooperation xxxxxxxxxxxx described how irgc orders to our allies are in the pipeline but it takes time for such orders to be disseminated throughout iraqi militia networks and acted upon it is very large machine with delayed effect 3 c by way of illustration of this delayed implementation phenomenon xxxxxxxxxxxx said there had been an unintended attack by our shiite iraqi allies on uk forces immediately after the release of the uk naval hostages last april xxxxxxxxxxxx said the irgc had indeed issued an order for attacks on uk forces in response to what he called an earlier uk attack on the iranian consulate in basra but that iranian expression of unhappiness had been satisfied with the hostage episode and that irgc authorities were consequently exasperated by the militia attack occuring shortly after the hostage resolution xxxxxxxxxxxx said their iraqi allies explained the incident as the result of standing general order to launch such attacks which had not yet been rescinded xxxxxxxxxxxx indicated that similar organizational snafus lie behind the current continuing attacks on us forces in iraq 4 c xxxxxxxxxxxx went on to argue however that usg designation of the irgc as terrorist organization would effectively end all interest or political ability of the irgc to cooperate with the usg on iraqi or afghan security he stressed that unlike few years ago under khatami london 00003175 002 of 003 the irgc plays central and preeminent role in the iranian government and that if the irgc is designated as terrorist organization the usg will have iranian partner with which to engage on security or other issues of mutual concern xxxxxxxxxxxx said it makes difference to iran whether the proposed irgc designation is done under us domestic law or international authority all sanctions financial measures and designations are seen by iranian authorities and the public as authored by america with international partners such as the e3 plus 3 and the as mere cutouts for us initiatives the practical effects of such measures are unimportant to the iranian government but the symbolic and psychological consequences do matter group discussion highlights 5 c the evenings larger group discussion had several highlights surprising degree of selfprofessed confusion by xxxxxxxxxxxx at the what he called the multiple and conflicting signals on iran policy from various parts of the usg including the congress an open acknowledgment by xxxxxxxxxxxx that the irgc is present and operating in both afghanistan and iraq with us occupation and sunni attacks on shias given as justification xxxxxxxxxxxx description of shiite militias in iraq as our allies whom we created against saddam fiery statements by xxxxxxxxxxxx on us injustices perpetrated over the years against iran on irans resolve and capabilities to launch military and asymmetric responses and on how iran should replace or join with the united states as the gulf regions comanager all of which provoked vehement rejoinders from xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx reflections on more mature irans nolongerrevolutionary approach to its foreign relations xxxxxxxxxxxx repeated return to the theme of desiring constructive and cooperative relationship with the us first on afghanistan and iraq and secondly on the nuclear issue xxxxxxxxxxxx neargloating remarks on hezbollahs 2006 conflict with israel and xxxxxxxxxxxx description of the united states as having become irans hostage in iraq you cannot stay and you cannot leave your forces there and in the region are our target comment 6 c although impeccably turned out outwardly genial and speaking with confidence and an evident sense of authority xxxxxxxxxxxx appeared to be under significant stress and at great pains to listen carefully and closely to all interlocutors and especially to xxxxxxxxxxxx standard comments on the e3 plus 3 offer as well as the need for iranian behavior change in iraq xxxxxxxxxxxx apparently genuine desire to engage and move towards cooperation was coupled to his equally apparent sense that iran is entitled to use violent means against us until london 00003175 003 of 003 such time as there change in the usgs regional behavior biographical background 7 xxxxxxxxxxxx visit londons classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurlondonindex cfm tuttle
