the united states has fostered and encouraged unfettere d discussion and debate regarding political issues facing the nation indeed the firs t amendment affords th greatest protection to political expression to assure the free interchange of ideas coupled with this respect for free speech and politica l expression though is the sometimes contrary notion that states possess authority to regulate the electoral process in order to avoid campaign related disorder due to the increased popularity of the use of ballot initiatives and referendums as tool for political change and resulting state efforts to regulate these activities these two lines of legal thought have been the source of significant conflict whil the supreme court has always served as stalwart protector of first amendmen t rights relating to political expression its prior decisions dealing with the topic related mainly to areas of pure speech leaving significant questions regarding how thes rights would be interpreted in light of states interest in preserving the integrity of its electoral processes the supreme court addressed this conflict in buckley v america n constitutional law foundation inc t case arising from the court of appeals for the tenth circuit specifically the court analyzed the constitutionality f provisio ns enacted by the state of colorado requiring that petition circulators b registered voters to wear identification badges and mandating the disclosure f amount s disbursed to paid circulators while the court had handed down previou s rulings pertaining to state regulation of the electoral process and associated firs t amendment free speech considerations it had not spoken directly on the applicability of such rulings to the initia tive process justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court that such provisions constituted an unconstitutional restriction on firs t amendme nt freedoms regarding political expression and was joined by justice s stevens scalia kenne dy

circulator on monthly basis2 as noted by the supreme court the district court struck down the badg requirem ent and portions of the disclosure regulations and upheld the age an d affidavit requirements as well as the sixmonth limit on petition circulation3 however the district court upon determining that the registration provision posed significant constitutional problems nonetheless held that the law could not b invalidated as it had been adopted by the voters of colorado as constitutiona l amendme nt according to the district court this fact immunized the registratio

circui t affirmed the determinations of the district court except for its decision on th registration requirement specifically the court of appeals held that the regulation was not exe mpt from review merely because it was based upon constitutiona l provision enacted by petition explainin g that the voters of state may not violate the stricture s of the united states constitution by petition any more than governin g body may via legislation4 in order to appreciate fully the supreme courts review of the reasoning of the lower courts one must gain an understanding of the two divergent lines f jurispruden ce at play in its analysis specifically it is well established that the first amendment affords the broadest protection to political expression in order to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and socia l changes desired by the people indeed the court has always vehemently protected5 this view of the first amendment stating that first amendment protection is at its zenith in regard to communic ation pertaining to political change at the same time6 however the court has been quick to recognize that state has strong ofte n compelling interest i n preserving the integrity of its electoral system accordingly7 the court has recognizedthat there must be substantial regulation of election s if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order rather than chaos is t accompany the democratic processes as noted above these two lines of lega l8 thought have largely existed independent of one another rarely coming into direc t conflict in the present case though the s upreme court was forced to determine the scope of these two doctrines as they relate to the petitioninitiative process at the out set of its analysis the supreme court explained its summar affirmance of the tenth circuits determination that the age restriction sixmont h circulation limit and affidavit requirement were valid noting that states allowin g ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability f the initiative process as they have with respect t election processes generally the9 court pointed to these

foundation inc et 97930 1999 wl17 7723 at 6 sct jan 12 1999aforementioned regulations did not significantly burden political expression the11 court cautioned however that such decisions are not made lightly as the firs t amendme nt requires court to be vigilant in making those judgments to guar d against undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas12 having explained this caveat the court went on to analyze in depth the provision s at issue voter registration regulations the first major issue addressed by the court centered on the constitutionality of col rev stat 1401121 which required that ll petition circulators be registered voters the tenth circuit ruled that this requirement was unconstitutional in that it prohibited unregistered voters from circulating petitions excluding them fro m participating in an activity constituting core political speech the main basis fo r13 this analysis rested on the supreme courts earlier decision in meyer v grant14 in meyer the court addressed colorado law which prohibited the payment of any consideration for the circulation of referendum or initiative petitions specifical ly the court established that circulation of petition involves the type of interactive communication concerni ng political speech that is appropriately described as core political speech accordingly the court applied exacting scrutiny in its15 review and held that the law constituted an impermissible restriction of politica l expression as the court explained by reducing the number of individual s advocating particular message the law impaired the ability of advocates to obtain the number of signatures needed to place an issue on the election ballot16 in its analysis of the registration issue the supreme court noted that it wa s clearly evident that the registration requirement severely reduced the number f individuals both volunteer and paid available to circulate petitions accordingly17 the court turned its attention to whether the asserted state interests justified th reduction upon determining from statistical and testimonial evidence establishin g such reduction the co urt confirmed the tenth circuits holding that 1401121 restricted core political speech specifically the court noted that the regulation t issue proscribed speech in th same fashion as the ban on paid circulators invalidated in meyer quoting meyer the court stated that the reduction in speech wa s irrefutable and the provisions limit the number of voices who will convey th initiativ proponents message and consequently cut down the size of th

regulation restricted political expression in manner which could not be justified18 in arguing for the validity of the provisions colorado maintained that despite the speech limitations the regulation was permissible due to the ease of registering to vote the supreme court gave this argument little weight however explaining19 that the ease of registration does not lessen the burden on speech at the time f circulation the court further noted that the choice n ot to register itself can be form of political expression in particular the court pointed to the statements of on circulator who maintained that his refus to register was form of private and public protest as well as evidence establishing that various circulators refuse to registe r because they believe that the political process is irresponsive to their needs given20 the political views of these individuals the court held that the ease of registratio n was irrelevant to its consideration of the issue21 the main inte rest asserted by colorado was its need to regulate illegal conduct by petition circulators colorado argued the regulation was necessary to ensure that all circulators would be subject to the subpoena power of the secretary of stat which does not extend beyond t he states borders however the court determined22 that this interest was met by less intrusive means such as the requirement that l circulators submit affida vits disclosing their full addresses according to the court23 this affidavit requirement would act to serve colorados interests more readily than the registration requirement in that it is submitted at the time petition section i s submitted whereas registration record may lack such currency furthermore the court emphasized the tenth circuits determination that the asserted interests could be more precisely achieved by requirement that all petition circulators b residents in response to colorados argument that registration is easier to track than residency the court noted that the submitted affidavits would assuage any suc h difficulty24 in light f the aforementioned factors the court concluded that assuming residence requirement would be upheld as valid regulation of the initiative referendum process the registration provision constituted an impermissibl restriction b reducing the number of circulators eligible to participate in petitioning activity dissenting opinions by justice oconnor and chief justice rehnquis t25 found great fault with this holding however according to their view th registration requirement constituted necessary and valid exercise of state powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs5 id at 1926 id at 2027 id at 2028 id at 2129 id at 2630 id at 2631 id at 2732 id at 2733specifically justice oconnor an alogized the registration requirement to earlier supreme court decisions valid ating such qualifications placed on individuals wishing to vote in primary elections and candidates for public office according to justic oconnor the registration requirement was akin to these cases and served merel as neutral q ualification for participating in the petitioning process as neutral26 requirement justice oconnor maintained that the registration provision was n incidental and indirect burden on the communicative aspects of petition circulatio n which did not prohibit otherwise qualified initiative petition circulators fro m circulating petitions furthermore the dissent argued that the registration provision was readily distinguishable from meyer in that the requirement did not effect ban on an identifiable body of circulators or stifle the political activity of individual s capable of circulating petitions 27 in justice oconnors view the indirect burdens of the registration provisions required colorado to show only that the regulation advanced legitimate stat interest in support of the proposition that the registration requirement wa s28 necessary to advance the state interest in controlling fraudulent petitioning activity justice oconnor pointed to evidence that colorado had experienced difficulty in the past controlling such behavior due to the fact that the offending circulators often fled the state given the utility of the registration requirement in aiding the asserted state interests and the ease of registering she maintained that the provision was reasonable regulation of the initiative process29 chief justice rehnquist raised many of the same points in his dissent focusing heavily on the comparative ease of voter registration he also dismissed th e30 associated firs t amendment concerns addressed by the majority declaring that only very few individuals employ nonregistration as tool to convey political thought and expression apart from these statements chief justice rehnquist argued that31 enforcement methods short of registration requirement would be ineffective an d unduly burdensome on the state in the chief justices view state ballot initiative s exist as matter of state cern and as such states should be permitted to limit the ability to circulate to those individuals who will ultimately vote on the initiatives32 he went on to declare that if eligible voters make the conscious decision not t register to vote on the grounds that they reject the democratic process they should have right to complain that they c annot circulate initiative petitions to people who are registered voters33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs6 id at 2034 id at 2735 id at 636 id at 2637 id at 7 for instance respondent bill orr argued before the district court that non 38 registration was form ofprivate and public protest id id at 739while the dissenting opinions point to factors which support the right of state to regulate its initiative process via registration requirement neither justic oconnor or chief justice rehnquist ef fectively address the majoritys determination that the registration requirement effects an unconstitutional restriction of politica l expression whereas the majority points to testimony indicating that certai n individuals choose nonregistration as form of political protest the dissentin g opinions argue that this is characteristic of small minority of circulators and is n insuffic ient basis for finding of invalidity justice oconnor for instance maintained tha t the registration provision was an indirect and therefore permissible restriction in support of this proposition she state d that unlike paid circulators non registered voters were not vital to the success of petition drive the chief justice34 echoed this unfavorable view of unregistered voters referring to them as politica l dropouts 35 neither of these viewpoints however provides complete refutation of th majoritys determination as the court held the registration requirement does stifle the political ctivity of class of persons akin to the prohibition at issue in meyer 36 while the dissent does make valid point regarding the indirect nature of th registration requirement as opposed to the outright ban in meyer it was evident to the court that the effect of both laws was to restrict political expression while the dissenting opinions essentially declare that unregistered voters do not constitute class deserving protection they offer substantive reasons why this chosen for m of expression is invalid in the first amendment context for instance chief justice rehnquist maintains that there is utility in this form of expression but provide s constitutional analysis as to why this is so testimony adduced at the distric t37 court level established that certain individuals clearly view nonregistration as n avenue by which they may make political statement while chief justic e38 rehnquist and justice oconnor obviously disagree with the validity of suc h expression the majority recognized this form of expression as constitutionally valid and deserving of protection from the majoritys determination it is evident that the court is concerned with reaching an adequate balance between s tate regulatory interests and the protection of political expression for instance the court without explicitly ruling on the issue discussed the scope of appropriate regulation the c ourt noted that either provision requiring that circulators be residents or eligibl to register would be more narrowly tailored regulation of the initiative process while the dissenters assert that th e39 invalidati on of the registration provision would result in the inability of states t constitutionally require that circulators be residents or eligible voters the cour thttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs7 id at 7840 american constitutional law foundation inc et v meyer 120 f3d at 110541 buckley 1999 wl 7723 at 1242 buckley v valeo 424 us 1 197643 id at 744 id at 6445intimated that such regulations would survive scrutiny furthermore the arguments40 of the dissenting opinions regarding the inadequacy of residency requirement were mitigated in the courts view by the affidavit requirements which should enable an effective method by which to enforce any such regulation given these factors it is clear that the courts decision places somewhat higher burden on state wishin g to exercise regulatory control over the initiative process however there are other avenues which may be employed to accomplish such goal thereby preserving the balance between regulation of the process and the right to political expression financial disclosure provisions another key issue before the supreme court in buckley v america n constitutional law foundation inc et pertained to whether state coul d compel disclosure of the names and addresses of individuals paid to circulat petition s and the amounts disbursed specifically col rev stat 14012 1 required the filing of monthly and final reports including the names of pai d circulators their business and residential addresses and the amount of mone disbursed to these individuals monthly and in total in its determination of the issue the tenth circuit invalida ted the regulation to the extent it required the disclosure of information regarding paid circulators in its subsequent analysis the suprem e41 court affirmed the reasoning of the tenth circuit deciding the issue based upon its prior holding in buckley v valeo 42 in buckley v valeo the supreme court analyzed the constitutionality of various provisions of the federal election campaign act of 1971 the act which limite d individual contribut ions to political campaigns and required that contributions above threshold amount be reported and publicly disclosed specifically the ac t43 prohibited individuals from making annual contributions in excess 1000 to particular candidate and imposed an overall annual contribution limit of 2500044 furthermore the reporting and disclosure provisions required that records f contributions be made public opponents of the act argued that these limitation s violated first amendment rights regarding speech and political expression in reviewing the act the supreme court acknowledged that such compelle d disclosure intruded upon first amend ment freedoms and significant encroachments on first amendment rightscannot be justified by mere showing of som legitimate governmental interest accordingly the court applied exacting scrutiny45 in its review in conducting its analysis however the court identified thre interests sufficiently important to outweigh the infringement on the privacy an dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs8 120 f3d at 1104 quoting buckley v valeo 424 us at 6446 buckley

which the candidat is most likely to address furthermore the court determined that the disclosur requirements served to deter corruption and to dispel the appearance of corruption stemming from financial contributions finally the court explained that th disclosures were necessary for the collection of data needed to detect violations f contribution limitations in light of these factors the court held that th e47 governmental interest in public disclosure outweighed the potential harm to firs t amendment freedoms in comparing the disclosure requirements enacted by colorado with thos upheld in buckley the supre court agreed with the tenth circuits determination that certain provisions of 140121 were unconstitutional the supreme cour t invalidated the requirement that the names and addresses of as well as the amounts disbursed to each paid circulator be disclosed key factor in this decision was the48 courts determination that the factors warranting mandated disclosure in buckle were not present in the petitioning environment specifically the court adopted the tenth circuits reasoning that unlike the situation in buckley 140121 imposed monetary threshold requiri ng the identification of paid circulators irrespective of the amount of money they received for their efforts also buckley targeted candidate49 elections whereas 1 40121 was geared only toward the regulation of the initiative process due to this fundamental difference concerns which the court foun d50 dispositive in buckley such as the need to alert the public to candidates financial ties and to provide mechanism for the detection of contribution violations wer deemed inapplicable 51 furthermore the court determined that the deterrence of actual or apparen t corruption was not justifiable governmental interest given the nature of th initiativ process specifically the court explained that ballot initiatives do t involve the risk of quid pro quo corruption present when money is paid to or for candidates in explaining this point the supreme court referred to its prio r52 decisions in mcintyre v ohio elections commn and meyer v grant in mcintyre 53 the court s truck down ohios ban on

than at the time of balloting due55 the tangential relation of the buckley decision and the lower likelihood of improper influence in the petition process the supreme court agreed with the tenth circuits reasoning that the disclosure provisions were invalid 56 in light of these factors the court determined that the asserted governmenta l interests were insuffi cient to justify such broad disclosure requirements specifically colorad argued that the disclosure provisions were necessary to inform th electorate as to whether particular measure possessed grass roots support and t discourage fraud the tenth circuit add ressed these arguments specifically finding57 them to be of little merit regarding the grass roots argument the circuit cour t explained that this interest was protected by the requirement that each initiative r referendum contain signatures signed by registered electors in an amount equal to at least five percent of the votes cast for the office of secretary of state at the previous election the tenth circuit also found that body of more narrowly tailore d regulations met the states interest in preventing fraud in particular other provisions of the regulatory scheme allowed for the prosecution of certain misconduct durin g circulation the invalidation of tainted petitions and written protest the supreme58 court agreed wit h the tenth circuits determination that there was evidence that these measures were inadequate in protecting the states regulatory interests59 in making these determinations the court explained that compelled disclosure under 120141 would chill the constitutionally protected activity of pai d circulators furthermore the court found it significant that listing paid circulator s and their resulting income would deprive them of the anonymity afforded t volunteer circulators based upon the aforementioned analysis the supreme court60 ultimately concluded that the disclosure requirements were only tangentially related to colorados asserted interests and held that the regulations could not survive the exacting scrutiny test61 while the courts determination of this issue clarifies the scope of permissible regulation in the financial disclosure context significant questions remain regarding the scope of permis sible state regulation the supreme courts acknowledgment of fraud in petition

referred to the majoritys opinion as most disturbing62 the crux of justic oconnors dissent centered on the assertion that contrary to the determination of the majority the disclosure provisions at issue did t impinge upon the direct communicative activities of petition circulators rather she contended that the disclosure provisions burdened speech in an incidental manner63 specifically the dissent stated that akin to the mandatory affidavits the disclosur reports revealed the names of paid circulators and existed as public record but were removed from the moment of speech thus according to justice oconnor th disclosure requirement should have been upheld so long as it was found to advance legitimate state interest accordingly she argued that colorados interest i n64 combating fr aud and informing the electorate would be sufficient to justify this level of review justice oconnor explained that in order to combat fraud and infor m65 signatories in timely man ner disclosure must be made contemporaneously with the circulation of petition according to the dissent the need for deterrence is at it s greatest during this phase of the initiative process and as such the monthl disclosure reports w ould be able to uniquely advance the asserted state interests66 justice oconnors dissent also mai ntained contrary to the majoritys determination that the required disclosures while targe ted only at paid circulators were permissible in that there was evidence pointing to higher likelihood of fraudulent behavior on the part of such individuals67 in closing justice oconnor argued that the legitimate state interests asserted by colorado would be advanced by t he disclosure provision and accordingly should have been upheld in light of the incidental and indirect burdens of the provisions on free speech furthermore justice oconnor declared that even if exacting scrutin were the appropriate standard the provisions should have been affirmed under th buckley standard 68 chief justice rehnquist also dissented on the disclosure issue maintaining that the disclosure requirements were an acceptable outgrowth of the affidavi t requirement which was deemed valid the chief

invalidate the regulations70 while the dissenting views of justice oconnor and chief justice rehnquis t possess degree of merit in light of states st rong interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process their arguments do not address directly the majority s concern regarding the chilling effect of the disclosure provisions both dissentin g opinions focus on the need for the reporting provisions without acknowledging that the primacy of the disclosure would strip circulator of his or her anonymity at the time of circulation furthermore the type of fraud targeted is unclear from th dissenting opinions both justice oconnor and chief justice rehnquist stat generally that disclosure will prevent fraud in that paid circulators are more likely to commit such behavior however the court disagreed with this notion stating tha t it was unclear how the disclosures would prevent fraud specifically the majority71 explained that the reports c ontaining the names of the paid circulators would be filed with the secretary of state and would not be available at the moment of speech72 finally while justice oconnor argues that buckley justifies the disclosur provisions her dissent does not refute the majoritys analysis concerning buckleys nonapplicability to payees instead justice oc onnor focuses on the indirect nature73 of the provision as basis for its constitutionality74 the opposing viewpoints of the majority and dissent while illuminating th extremes of the issue do not give rise to clear consensus on the degree of disclosure which might be permissible short of the conditions deemed invalid in 140121 the supreme court for instance affirmed the tenth circuits acknowledgment that the burden of the regulation was lessened by the fact that disclosure would be made t the time of filing however in light of the other mechanisms capable of achievin g the asserted state interests the chilling effect was nonetheless deeme d unconstitutional this concern reg arding any chilling effect on speech coupled with75 the courts refusal to apply buckley to payees in addition to payors would seem to suggest that irrespective of the dissents protestations any disclosure of pai d circulators would be prohibited while such stringent ruling has weight implications regarding the scope of states p ower to regulate its electoral processes the courts ruling gives c lear examples of other less intrusive measures which would protect regulatory interests76httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs12 col rev stat 140132 col rev stat 140130277 120 f3d at

federalist papers were originally published under pseudonyms related to the concerns regarding majoritaria n85 persecutio n the court stated that the right to anonymous speech was crucial due to the

anonymous speech stressing that the right to remain anonymous wa s particularly important in the political context the court also determined that the95 presence of anonymous information in the

asserted in favor of mandatory disclosure outweighed any negative first amendmen t implications in reaching this conclusion the court found that the disclosur e99 provisions of the act provided information to the public regarding campaign money and its sources deterred corruption by revealing large c ontributions and expenditures and provided an essential m eans of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of contribut ion limitations in light of these benefits the court held that th e100 public interest in disclosure outweighed any potential negative effect on firs t amendment rights101 the court has also recognized t hat while significant first amendment interest exists regarding the right to anonymous political speech state also possesses substantial interest in regulating the election process particularly in an effort t combat instances of fraud or libel as noted above the court in mcintyre extended102 the holding i n talley to establish right to anonymous political speech pertaining to the electioncampaign process however the court also distinguished its rulin g103 from buckley indicating that in light of the special weight to be afforded stat regulator interests in the campaign context states enforcement interest migh t justify more limited identification requirement based upon this diverse body104 of law the supreme court analyzed the arguments f orwarded by colorado in support of the badge requirement specifically colorados main argument regarding the badge requiremen t centered on the assertion that 140112 furthered compelling state interests i n fostering an informed electorate and aiding in the prevention of fraud and libel105 whereas the court has acknowledged the potential validity of identificatio n requiremen ts as tool to combat fraud and libel it has been unwilling to give an weight to the informed electorate argument the supreme court dealt with n identical argument in mcintyre finding it unpersuasive

electorate entails only the provision of additiona l information that may either buttress or undermine the argument in document the identity of speaker is different from other components of the document s content that the author is free to include or exclude the court elaborated tha t106 while the identity of an information source is helpful in evaluating ideas the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accept ed in the competition of the market furthermore the court affirmed its prior holding that the average citizen107 has the right to read an anonymous message and reach his or her own conclusio n regarding what is responsible what is valuable and what is truth from these108 principles the court in mcintyre concluding that simple interest in providin g voters with additional relevant information does not justify state requirement that writer make statements or disclosures she would otherwise omit ruled that such an informatio nal interest is plainly insufficient to survive constitutional scrutiny109 regarding the second prong of colorados argument while stronge r justificat ions were asserted for the badge requirement on fraud and libel grounds mcintyre and earlier cases again raised significant free speech concerns at th appellate level the tenth ci rcuit ruled that while the badge requirement might enable the state to combat fraud and libel more effectively the first amendment does not permit the state to sacrifice speech for efficiency the tenth circuit went on to110 explain that under meyer the risk of fraud or corruption is comparatively remote at the petitioning level and as such state can only take regulatory action agains t circulators through measures which are narrowly tailored 111 based upon these precedents the supreme court rejected colora dos argument deeming the states asserted interest in providing relevant information to th electorat insufficient to warrant such broad first amendment intrusion i n discussing the particulars of the badge requirement the supreme court largel adopted the reasoning of the tenth circuit noting that the circulation of petitio n is analogous to the distribution of handbill an action which constitutes protecte d anonymous political speech the court observed that in both instances n112 individual identifies himself or herself with specific viewpoint by personall disseminating it as such the court held that circulators possess the same interes t in anonymity as do handbill distributors in its brief to the supreme court colorado argued that this determination was incorrect maintaining that petition circulatio n differs substantially in character from handbill distribution thereby precluding th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs17 brief for petitioner at 38

generally113 that the critical role of circulators in the initiative process mutes their status s advocates wit h an interest in anonymity furthermore colorado maintained that the badge requirement discloses nothing more personal than the name of circulator who acts as representative for the electors who sign the petition as such colorado argued that signer of petition should be informed of the name of th person who is acting on his or her behalf in making these arguments colorado focused on states right to regulate the electoral process without acknowledging the first amendment consideration s involved the assertion that petition circulation is fundamentally different from the handbills involved in mcintyre evidences this analytical omission relying on it s arguments concerning the importance of circulators and their representative role to distinguish the activity in mcint yre colorado downplayed the confrontational nature of the activity involved in both scenarios indeed while petition circulation i s obviously more closely tied with the electoral process than handbill distribution the activities are identical in the sense that they require person to identify him or herself with particular viewpoint at the moment of speech the supreme court recognized the right to anonymity in such situations noting that the name badge requiremen t forces circulators to reveal their identities at the same time they deliver their political message significantly the supreme court went on to declare that the injury t petition circulators under the colorado law was even more severe than that at issue in mcintyre specifically the court explained that petition circulation is the s fleeting encounter for the circulator must endeavor to persuade electors to sign the petition in light of these factors the supreme court held that as the badg e114 requirement would compel identification at the precise moment when th circulators interest in anonymity is greatest the regulation could not qualify fo r inclusion among the more limited election process identificatio n requirements115 one of the key factors giving rise to the decision regarding the badg requirement was th courts determination that other less intrusive avenues existed by which colorado could achieve its asserted inte rests of informing the electorate and combating fraud and libel specifically circulators are already apprised of th importance of their actions through the affidavit requirement of 1401112 which allows for comparatively simple analysis of records in order to identify n offending circulator the strength of the courts decision regarding the badg requirement on the aforementioned grounds is buttressed by the fact that both justice oconnor and chief justice rehnquist who argued in opposition to the courts ruling on the disclosure and registration requirements both agreed readily that the badg requirement was unconstitutional httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs18 120 f3d at 1097116 mcintyre 514 us at 348 117 1999 wl 7723 at 8 118 id at 8119while the courts dispo sition of the badge issue arguably was definitive certain questions remain as to whether state may implement restrictions falling in th middle of the spectrum comprised of the permissible affidavit requirement and th unconstit utional identification provision in its decision the court focused on th immediate nature of petitioning activity downp laying the importance of states right to regulate the electoral process however as noted above cases such as timmons and storer established that states possess the power to regulate election activity i n order to assure fairness and reduce confusion and disorder surrounding th process thus while any attempt to distinguish petition circulation from th e116 standard established in meyer will be unsuccessful to the extent regulation compels personal identification it is apparent that other identification measures might b upheld striking balance between the right to anonymity and the need for efficient state regulation of the process 117 for instance it seems clear from the courts ruling regarding the affidavi t requirement that the main deficiency in the badge provision was the fact that i t compell ed the personal identification of circulator at the time he or she wa s engaged in petitioning activity as such it would seem that given state s118 legitimate concerns regarding the delayed effect of the affidavit requirements i n identifyi ng fraud more immediate tracking technique could be employed so lon g as personal anonymi ty were not compromised thus it is possible that the supreme court would deem reasonable an intermediate measure such as assigning n identification number to each circulator which upon complaint could be cross referenced with information supplied to the secretary of state akin to the affidavit requireme nt such compromise seems logical in light of the fact that this cross referencing method would be separated from the moment the circulator speaks and would not expose the circulator to the risk of heat of the moment harassment which were major factors in the cour ts acceptance of the affidavit provision this119 approach would arguably result in more efficient enforcement of the states fraud and libel laws while maintaining the first amendment right to anonymous politica l expression conclusion from the holdings discussed above it is apparent that the supreme court s placed great emphasis on the preservation of first amendment rights regardin g political expression indeed with this decision regarding colorados regulation of the initiativereferendum process the court has established solid preference for fre and unfettered first amendment activity clarifying and limiting the steps which may be taken to proscribe such political expression this ruling does not however preclude any effective state regulation of the petition pr ocess as noted it is clear that the court has reco gnized the importance of state regulation of the electoral processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30067crs19 and has left open the possibility of less onerous but more extensive identificatio n provisions than those attempted by colorado
