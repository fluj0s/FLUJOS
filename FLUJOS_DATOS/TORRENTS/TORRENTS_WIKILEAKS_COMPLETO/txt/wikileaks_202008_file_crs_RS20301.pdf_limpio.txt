campaign to prevent teen pregnancy estimated that in 2004 adolescent childbearing cost us taxpayers about 9 billion per year in child welfare benefits 23 billion in health care expenses 19 billion in spending on incarceration for the sons of women who had children as adolescents 21 billion in lost tax revenue because of lower earnings of the mothers fathers and children when they were adults 63 billion and in offsetting public assistance savings younger teens receive less annually over 15year period than those who give birth at age 2021 36 billi on research indicates that teens who give birth are less likely to complete high school and go on to college thereby reducing their potential for economic selfsufficiency the research also indicates that the children of teens are more likely

poverty the 2006 report contends that if the teen birth rate had not declined between 1991 and 2004 the annual costs associated with teen childbearing would have been almost 16 billion instead of 9

attributed to liberal view of sexual activity8 some analysts also contend that contraceptive advancements have afforded women false sense of security thereby contributing to increased sexual activity and more pregnancies the academic and professional communities also maintain that teen parenthood is one of the negative consequences of growing up without father9 moreover policymakers suggest that prior to reform welfare was seen as guaranteed source of income for unmarried teenage mothers with grim marriage and job prospects the president of the alan guttmacher institute commenting on study about adolescent pregnancy and childbearing in developed countries stated in the united states poverty and inequity clearly are behind much of our high rates of pregnancy birth and abortion but lack of sensitive confidential lowcost contraceptive services and the denial of accurate and frank information about sex are equally to blame 10

and births is that sexually active female teenagers have significantly increased their use of contraceptives particularly condoms the more effective and consistent use of contraception has been facilitated by longlasting injectable depo provera and implanted norplant devices that are readily available to female teens abstinence campaigns aimed at younger teens are also seen as having positive effect on pregnancy prevention moreover casual sex which may increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases stds and may prove to be fatal given the presence of hivaids is viewed in an increasingly negative light by many teenagers 7 the national campaign to prevent teen pregnancy by the numbers the public cost of teen childbearing by saul d hoffman october 2006 8 us congress house
