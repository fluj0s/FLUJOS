many states have adopted domestic laws to prevent the export of illicitlyobtained cultural property and there has been some movement towards building an international regime to better prevent the illicit trade of such items still there is little international consensus on how best to protect cultural property the issue of protecting cultural property has not been high on the congressional agenda in recent years however the issue has been gaining attention in many contexts especially with respect to the war in iraq and its aftermath international conventions on cultural property cultural property receives special protecti on under treaties pertaining to the laws of armed conflict in add ition there are major internati onal conventions that address illicit trade however despite continued losses of cultural treasures through war and illicit trade there is generally accep ted enforcement regime meaning that individual states generally termine what if any sanctions

the world of knowledge of its past as the main consideration necessitating the cpia23 it also noted that the united states status as principal market for stolen cultural goods was straining its relations with other nations like the 1970 unesco convention the cpia distinguishes between stolen property and property that has been exported contrary to the laws of source country the cpia flatly bars the import of any article of cultural property that is stolen from museum religious or secular public m onument or similar cultural institution the regulation of illegally expor ted cultural property is so mewhat knottier the cpia does not automatically attach legal consequences to all imports alleged to be in violation of the export laws of source c ountry rather source country that is party to the 1970 convention may request that the president enter into an agreement with it for the imposition of us import restrictions on cultural property exported illegally from it the requirements for such requests are stringent the party must state that its cultural patrimony is in jeopardy that import restrictions by importing countries would serve substantially to overc ome serious danger of pillage and that less drastic remedies are not available even after such an agreement has been concluded and us im port restrictions imposed those restrictions may be suspended if they prove ineffective or if other importing countries do not implement similar restrictions cultural property may be excepted from regulation if it can be shown that the property has been in the united st ates for specified period this period may be as brief as three years in the cas of good faith well publicized purchases by museums and similar institutions or as long as 20 years in the case
