violated because the presiding judge of the florida probate court that had ordered the withholding of nutrition and hydration d become terris health care surrogate18 while also purporting to act as

parents19 absent showing that the florida guardianship court was biase d the federal district court found nothing to indicate that the florida statutory scheme turned the j udicial role of fact finding and decision making into one of advocacy the parents also argued that the florida probate court had violated theresas schiavos procedural due process rights by failing to appoint guardian ad litem or an independent attorney to represent theres schiavos interest or to have met with theresa schiavo personally the federal district court noted that three guardians ad litem had been appointed during period of the litigation that the case had been extensively litigated and that there wa s precedent requiring judge to meet personally with patient in this situat ion the court found that the case had been adequately litigated below and that it was unlikely that the litigants would prevail on an argument of lack of due process the parents further argued that ther schiavos rights under the religious land use and institutionalized persons act20 had been violated as removal of the feeding tube was governmental burden on theresas schiavo s religious freedom the court held however that michael schiavo and the hospice where theresa schiavo resides were not stat actors and thus allega tion of governmental burden could be made21 final argument regarding equa l protection was also

dist rict court found that th ere was substantial likelihood of success on the merits tem porary restraining order was denied the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit then considered the district courts opinion22 review of the district court opinion however was performed under an abuse of discretion st andard under this standard district courts decision will lead to reversal only if the court used an incorrect legal standard applied improper procedur or relied on clearly erroneous factfinding23 the court presumed for purposes of the motion that the schiavo law was constitutional and considered its application to the schiavo case the court found that desp ite the requirement of novo review provided for in the schiavo law the congress had not changed the standard for novo review this finding was based in part on the legi slative history of the schiavo law which indicated that provision addressing the i ssuance of stay had been deleted from the final version24 the court also noted that issues related to standing and abstention had been modified by the congress but that the standard for injunctive relief had not consequently the court found that congre ss had intended for existing law regarding injunctive relief to be applied in this case the court also considered an argument that the appeals court could itself issue writ for emergency injunctive relied under the all writs act25 the all writs act provides that all federa l courts may issue writs to prot ect their jurisdiction the court found that the all writs act is intended to provide the power to issue writs only when other writs are not generally availabl however when the relief sought under the act is in the nature of preliminar injunction and the authority to issue preliminary injunction already exists then the all writs act is not available26 based on the preceding the appeals court declined to overturn the district court rulings subsequently the 11th circuit refused to reconsider the case banc27 and the supreme court declined to grant writ of certiorari if feeding and nutrition were begun again in this case the district court would still have pending motions regarding preliminary or permanent injunctive relief in considering these issues there appear to be number of constitutional issues that might be considered httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32830crs6 28 us

nixon v administrator of general services the congress passed the presidential recordings and materials preserva tion act which directed that the general services administration take custody of th presidential papers of named individual richard m nixon the court held that if th ere is rational basis for legislative classification and punitive intent then the cong ress may go so far as to legislate against one named individual 433 us at 472a bill of attainder there is concern that the specificity of this bill may raise constitutional concerns article i of the constitution pr ohibits passage of bills of attainder28 under this provision congress is prohi bited from passing legislation which applies either to named individual or to easily ascertainable members of group in such way as to inflict punishment on them without judicial trial29 generally the prohibition on bills of attainder is intended to prevent the congress from assuming judicial functi ons and conducting trials30 the two main criteria that the courts will look to in order to determine whether legislati on is bill of attainder are 1 whether specific individuals are affected by the statute and 2 whether the legislation inflicts punish ment on those individuals31 an argument might be made that the schiavo law is bill of attainder but the precedent for this is very limited althoug h the bill itself specifically addresses providing benefit to the parents of theres schiavo it could theo retically affect the reputation of michael schiavo nd could be seen as interferi ng with his role as legal guardian of his wife although michael schiavo is not named in this bill the supreme court has held that legislation meets the criteria of specificity if it applies to person or group of people w ho are described by past conduct32 by specifying theresa schiavos parents limiting the bill to facts that related to pending case and providing that the suit must be filed within 30 days the bill seems to establish criteria that apply only to the case regarding theresa schiavo however the supreme court has found that piece of legislation which is narrowly focused is not bill of atta inder merely because the stat ute might have been set at higher level of generality33 in order to find that legislation is bill of attainder court would have to establish that the legislation was intende d to inflict punishment on this individual or individuals 1 punitive legislation while it is true that the proposed legi slation has the potential to alter the proceedings in the particular state court case this does not necessarily establish thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32830crs7 34 433 us at 47475 35 433 us at 475 36 kennedy v mendozamartinez 372 us 144 16869 1963 nixon v administrator of general

schiavo or others the mere fact that focused legislation imposes burdensome consequences does not require that court find such legislation to be an unconstitutional of bill of attainder rather the court has identified three types of punitive legislation that are barred by the ban on bills of attainder 1 where the burden is such as has traditionally been f ound to be punitive 2 where the type and severity of burdens impos ed cannot reasonably be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes and 3 where the legislative record evinces congressional intent to punish thus questions may arise as to whether the potential burdens on michael schiavos right to act as her guardian fit into one of these three categories 2 the scope of trad itional punishment the supreme court has identified vari ous types of punishments which have historically been associated with bills of attainder these traditionally have included capital punishment imprisonment fines ba nishment confiscati on of property and more recently the barring of individuals or groups from participation in specified employment or vocations34 there are indications by the court that harming persons reputation or interven ing in guardianship rights is type of punishment traditionally engaged in by legislatures as means of punishing individuals for wrongdoing 3 type and severity of punishment the supreme court has indicated that so legislative burdens not traditionally associated with bills of attainder might nevertheless functionally serve as punishment35 the court has stated however th at the type and severity of legislatively imposed burden should be exa mined to see whether it could reasonably be said to further non punitive legislation purpose36 intervening in guardianship rights does not appear to have been ddressed but there s been legislation regarding affecting pers ons position of responsibility various supreme court decisions have invalidated as bills of attainder legislation barring specified persons or groups from pursuing various professions where the employment bans were im posed as brand of disloyalty37 for instance in cummings v missouri 38 the supreme court noted that disqualification from the pursuits of lawful avocation or from pos itions of trust or from the privilege of appearing in the courts or acting as an executor administrator or guardian may also and often has been im posed as punishment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32830crs8 39 351 f3d 1198 dc cir 2003 40 the act provided in any pending case involving custody over minor child or the visitation rights

transportation and related agencies appropriati ons act of 1997 pl 104205 350 codified at dc code 11925 2001 an opinion by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia has specifically addressed the issue of whether congressional bill limiting custodial rights was bill of attainder in foretich v united states 39 the court considered legislative rider to the 1997 department of transportation appropriations act entitled the elizabeth morgan act this act provided for specific procedures to be followed in resolving child custody cases in the district of columbia superior court but was written so narrowly as to apply to just one case40 this case involved protracted custody battle where allegations of sexual abuse by the husband had been made because the child in the case was longer minor the issue of removal of custodianship was declared by the court to be moot however the court found that the act imposes punishment under the functi onal test because it harmed the fathers reputation and because it coul d not be said to further nonpunitive purpose to the extent that the proposed bill would rm michael schiavos reputation these arguments might be applicable b due process due process argument could be made that the bill requires that theresa schiavo comply with an additional set of procedural requirements in order to effectuate constitutional rights the bill would appear to require named individual to comply with set of procedural rules th at are not required of any other individuals this may raise issues of whether subs tantive due process right the right to terminate medical treatment can be specifically burdened further it may raise the issue of equal protection as seen in the c ontext of the substantive due process right to terminate medical treatmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32830crs9 41 844 f2d 800 814 dc cir 1988 42 id at 804 43 id at 815for instance in news america publishing inc v fcc 41 the united states court of

although cases such as the one invol ving theresa schiavo are generally resolved at the state level recent events show an increased interest in the congress in this issue while intervention regarding
