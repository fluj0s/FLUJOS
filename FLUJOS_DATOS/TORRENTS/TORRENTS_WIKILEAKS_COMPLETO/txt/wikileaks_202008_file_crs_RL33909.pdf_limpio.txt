discussed in subsequent section of this report 6 series of hearings on abuses in federal student aid programs were held by the senate from february 1990 through october 1990be deemed eligible and certified to participate in federal student aid programs by ed4 of the three components of this tria d state licensing accreditation and eligibility and certification the first two were developed independently to serve purposes related to quality assurance nd consumer protecti on but not necessarily from federal perspective to avoid gene rating concerns about federal interference in educational decisionmaking the fede ral government ed specifically relies on accrediting agencies and state licensing to determine st andards of program quality the federal governments only direct i nvolvement in deter mining institutional eligibility for title iv programs is throug h the third arm of the triad which focuses on protecting the administrative capacity and fiscal integrity of its funding programs through certification by ed5 in the 1992 reauthorization of the hea central goal of the congress was to reform the triad structure to addre ss reported problems of fraud and abuse6 growing default costs in the guaranteed student loan program as well as media and other reports of exploitation of the student ai d programs especially by proprietary institutions focused attention on the need to improve the triad structure used to approve institutions for prog ram participation the hi gher education amendments of 1992 pl 102325 made numerous change s to the hea intended to strengthen program integrity including revision of the definitions of eligible institutions and inclusion of provisions to reform the process by which institutions become eligible to participate in title iv student aid programs instead of singling out the proprietary school sector for special screening and ove rsight the 1992 amendments reformed the institutional eligibility rules for all posts econdary institutions the amendments however have had the greates t impact on proprietary schools the higher education act amendments of 1998 pl 105244 were signed into law by president clinton on oc tober 7 1998 among the key provisions affecting institutional eligibility were modification of the requirement that proprietary institutions of higher education derive at l east 15 of their revenues from non title iv sources to require proprietary institutions to derive at least 10 of their revenues fro m nontitle iv sources elimination of the requirement fo r accrediting agencies to conduct

hereafter referred to as crs report rl32182 9010 rule eligible institutions the hea includes two definitions of ihes the first definition contained in section 101 applies to institu tional participation in non title iv programs the second definition contained in section 102 pplies only to institu tions participating in title iv programs the use of these definitions is one legislative technique used to screen out institutions with certain characteristics associated with fraud and abuse without denying eligibility to other ins titutions all 6441 in stitutions that were identified as title iv postsecondary in stitutions during the 20052006 academic year met the section 102 definition of an ihe section 101 section 101 recognizes ihes as those that are legally authorized by the state are accredited or preaccredited by an agency or association recognized by ed are nonprofit institutions award bach elors degree or provide at least two year program that is accepted as credit towa rd the completion of bachelors degree and enroll as regular students only indivi duals who have gra duated from secondary institution or hold the equivalent of high school diploma the statute also recognizes institutions offering not ss than oneyear program of training in preparation for employment and institu tions admitting students beyond the age of compulsory secondary school attendance section 102 section 102 includes all institutions recognized as ihes under section 101 and expands the definition of ihes for title iv purposes to include proprietary institutions postsec ondary vocational institutions and institutions outside of the united states ie foreign institutions proprietary institutions are defined as those institutions that provide training in preparation for gainful employment in recognized occupation are legally author ized by the state are accredited by an agency or association recognized by ed and admit as regular students only individuals who have gradua ted from secondary institu tion or hold the equivalent of high school diploma or who are past the age of compulsory attendance in the state in which the institution is located9 in addition proprietary institutions must have been in existence for at least tw years and derive at least 10 of school revenue from nontitle iv funds the latter requirement is commonly referred to as the 9010 rule10 postsecondary vocational institutions must meet criteria similar to those applicable to proprietary institutions with two exceptions first these institutions must be nonprofit institutions second they do not have to derive at least 10 of their revenue from nontitle iv fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs5 11 there are exceptions to these rules incl uding participation in the distance

institution has federal state or local government agency contracts that result in the institution serving significant numbers of students lacking secondary school credentialall title iv eligible institutions must also meet requirements with respect to the course of study offered and student enrollment11 the first set of requirements focus on courses offered by correspondence or telecommunications federal regulations define correspondence course as home st udy course offered by an ihe in which the ihe provides the student with instructional materials12 upon completing section of the instructional materials the student take s correspondent examination provided by the ihe and returns it to the ihe for grading in contrast telecommunications course is defined as course that is offered via the application of technology including via the internet13 in general institutions offering over 50 of their courses by correspondence excluding courses offered by telecommunications are not title iv eligib section 102a3a an institution is also not considered eligible for the pur poses of title iv if 50 or more of its students are enrolled in correspondence cour ses excluding courses offered by telecommunications section 102a3b14 more detailed discussion about the 50 rules and recent changes to these rules appears in the section on distance education two other requirements regarding enrollment also apply to all eligible institutions the institution must not have student enrollment in which more than 25 of its students are incar cerated section 102a3c15 second an institution will not be granted eligibility for title iv programs if more than 50 of its students do not possess high school di ploma or its equivalent and the institution does not provide twoyear or fouryear course of study or both leading to an associates or bachelors degree respec tively section 102a3d16 foreign institutions generally foreign institutions are eligible to participate in the

institutions must have their students complete their clinical traini ng at an approved veterinary school located in the united states additional requirements in addition to meeting the definitions discussed in sections 101 and 102 institutions mu st comply with several additional requirements to be eligible for title iv programs for example an institution must certify to ed that it has adopted and imple mented program to prevent the use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse by students an institution failing to provide this certification is not eligible to receive funds or any other form of financial assistance under any federal program section 120 an institution must meet specific management requirements shall not be considered an ihe for title iv purposes if the institution the

instructional time to 26 weeks of instructional time on casebycase basis for ihes providing 2year or 4year program of instruction for which it awards associates or bachelors degrees the hera modified the minimum weeks of instructional time for programs measuring program length in clock hours while programs measuring instructional time in credit hours must tinue to provide minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time programs measuring in structional time in clock hours are required to provide minimum of 26 weeks of instructional time it should be noted that the provision allowing the secretary to waive the requirement of minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time at ihes providing 2year or 4year program of instruction leading to an associates or bachelors degree was retained 12hour and oneday rules the higher education amendments of 1992 defined the academic year that an eligible institution must provide as including both minimum number of credit hours for underg raduate students nd minimum length of instructional time for all students section 481 d ccording to the statute an academic year must contain at least 30 w eeks of instructional time this 30week requirement may be met

program is not organized in terms nd may or may not have prees tablished beginning and end dates ed addressed the implementation of the statutory requirement that the academic year contain at least 30 weeks of instruc tion through regulatory action initially this involved defining what constituted week of instructional time in the april 1994 interim final regulations21 for programs using standard terms or clock hours week of instructional time was defined as any week that included at least one day of regularly scheduled instruction examin ation or preparation for examination 22 for programs measured in cred it hours without standard terms23 week of instructional time was defined as any week in which at least five days of regularlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs8 24 ed 12hour rule p 8 25 ibid p 9 26 instructional time was defined to include internships cooperative education programs independent study and other forms of regularl scheduled instruction previous regulations had already clarified that hom ework could not be counted toward the instructional time requirement in addition in order for preparation for examination to be c ounted as instructional time the preparation had to occur after the last day of scheduled classes for given payment period 27 federal register nov 1 2002 vol 67 212 availa ble online at h ttp wwwedgov legislationfedregisterfinrule20024 110102ahtml hereafter cited as federal register nov 2002 see also federal register aug 8 2002 vol 67 153 available online at httpwwwedgovlegislationfedregisterproprule20023080802ahtml 28 federal register nov 2002scheduled instruction examination or preparation for examination occurs24 the former was known as the one day rule the november 1994 final regula tions retained the one day rule but modified the requirement for programs measured in cr edit hours without standard terms to provide greater flexibility to these institutions there were concerns however that programs without standard terms may alter their program struct ures to meet the 30week requirement without providing an adequate level of instru ction to fulltime student under these circumstances student could be receiving more financial aid than was merited eg receiving fu lltime student aid when pa rttime student aid was appropriate ed was also concerned that the workload in these programs was not properly distributed through the period25 thus programs without standard terms were required to provide 12 hours instead of five days of regularly scheduled instruction examination or preparation for examination in order for it to be considered week of instructional time26 this became known as the 12hour rule implementation of the 12hour rule how ever resulted in several unintended consequences27 for example many programs offer rolling starting times and overlapping terms which provide student s with increased flexibility and access to higher education these nonstandard or nonterm educati onal programs were experiencing difficulty complying with th 12hour rule the 12hour rule was also difficult for distance education programs to implement for several reasons including the difficulty in determining the number of hours of instruction in which students were participating weekly in addition the 12hour rule re sulted in inequities in title iv funding r eceived by students completing the same amount of academic credit based on whether an individual student was enrolled in an institution using standard or nonstandard academic terms in reco gnition of the difficulties created by the 12 hour rule ed revised its regu latory guidance and stated that all title iv program eligibility will be determined using the oneday rule regardless of whether standard terms are used or not28 this new regulation went into effect on july 1 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs9 29 not all programs at an institution must meet the eligible program requirements but at least one program must meet these requirements students in noneligible programs may not receive title iv funds 30 while distinction between institutions of higher educati on proprietary institutions of higher education and postsecondary vocational education institutions can be made based on program type all three types of institutions are considered institutions of higher education for the purpose of title iv eligibilityeligible programs in order to qualify as an eligible ins titution for the purpose of title iv school must offer at least one eligible program29 the ihe must ensure that program qualifies as title iv eligib program prior to awarding title iv funds to students in that program ihes are also res ponsible for ensuring that individual t itle iv eligible programs are included on the ins titutions accreditation notice and that the institution is authorized by the state to provide the programs there are several provisions that specify the criteria for program eligibility these program definitions classify school as an ihe proprietary ins titution of higher education or postsec ondary vocational institution school is considered an ihe if it offers program leading to an associates bachelors professional or graduate degree or offers program of two or more academic years that is acceptablefor full credit toward bachelors degree or offers training program of at least one academic year leading to acertificate degree or other recognized credential and prepares students for gainful employment in recognized occupation there are three types of programs th at classify school as proprietary institution or postsec ondary vocational education institution 30 each program type requires specific number of weeks of in struction and must prepare students for gainful employment in recognized occupation the first type of eligible pr ogram must provide undergraduate instruction for at least 600 cloc k hours 16 semester or trimester hours or 24 quarter hours offere d during minimum of 15 weeks of instruction the program ma admit students who have not completed the equivalent of an associates degree as students the second type of eligible pr ogram must be graduate or

programs must also meet veral additional criteria in order to be considered eligible first the program mu st have verified student completion and job placement rates of at least 70 second the program may not be more than 50 longer than the minimum training period re quired by the state or federal agency if any for the occupation for which the progra m prepares students last the program must have been in existence for at least one year the hera expanded the definition of an eligible program to include instructional programs that use the direct assessment of student learning or recognize the direct assessment of student learning by others rather than measuring student learning in credit hours or clock hours33 the assessment used to determine student learning must be consistent with the institutions or progra ms accreditation the secretary of education secretary is required to determine whether program that proposes to use direct assessment rather than credit hours or clock hours to measure student learning qualifies as an eligible program finally the hera added definition of an eligible program offered through distance education this new definition is discussed in the distance education section of this report reauthorizat ion issues there are several issues related to institutional eligibility that may be considered by congress examples of th issues are summarized below definition of an institution of higher education congress may consider whether it is necessary to have separate definitions of an ihe for title iv and nontitle iv purposes one issue that may be focused on in this debate is whether congress wants to allow proprietary institutions to participate in other titles of the hea under current law their participation in limited to title ivhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs11 34 for more information see crs report rl32182 9010 rule regular students under the secti on 101 definition of an ihe ihes may only admit students who have high school diploma or its equivalent or are beyond the age of compulsory attendance as regular students congress may consider extending the definition of regular student to include student s who are dually enrolled in high school and college c ourses and students w ho were home schooled 9010 rule as previously discusse d the 9010 currently applies only to proprietary institutions congress may consider eliminating the 9010 requirement or applying th 9010 requirement to all ihes congress may also consider conti nuing to apply the 9010 rule only to proprietary institutions but eliminating the 9010 rule as requirement for institutional eligibility so that proprietary institutions that violate the rule do not necessarily lose their title iv eligibility34 college costs and prices congre ss may require ihes to provide additional information about their co sts and prices to aid consumers in selecting an ihe to attend c ongress may also consider offering incentives to ihes that are able to reduce their costs and pass these savings on to students or may consider penaliz ing or publicly identifying ihes whose prices are rising faster than particular benchmark eg the consumer pr ice indexall urban consumers program integrity triad part h of title iv specifies the roles and responsibilities for the three aspects of the program integrity triad state au thorization accreditation by an accrediting organization recognized by the secret ary of education and eligibility and certification by ed the triad is intende d to provide balance in assuring the eligibility of institutions for title iv th state role is primarily one of consumer protection while the accrediting agencies are intended to function as quality assurance mechanism these two legs of the triad were devel oped independently of the federal government th federal government has hi storically relied on them to avoid generating concerns bout federal interference in educational decisionmaking ed is responsible for oversight of complian ce the third leg of the triad that is protecting the administrative and fiscal integrity of the federal student aid programs state authorization the state role in the triad is to provide legal authority for postsecondary institutions to operate in the state in which they are located the state provides legal authorization to an institution through charter license or other written document issued by the appropriate state agency or state official for example the document may be provided by licensing board or state educational agency an institution is required to provide ed with evidence that it has received the authority to operate in particular state when it applies to participate in the federal student aid programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs12 35 for more

institutional and program accreditation was included in the tria d as quality control mechanism background information on the accreditation process accreditation has always been and continues to be volunt ary process it started in the late 1800s with the formation of associations to distinguish institutions of higher education that merited the designation of college or uni versity from those that did not but called themselves colleges beginning in 1952 th federal government began to formally recognize accrediting agencies36 accreditation was s ubsequently linked to institutional eligibility for title iv aid as an indicator of the institutions educational qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs13 37 there is overlap among the regions accredited by these commissions two

it may also consider requiring ihes to publicly release their transfer of credit policies and requiring that ihes do not deny the transfer of credit solely on the accreditation held by the sending institution congress may also require accreditin g organizations to ensure that ihes are in compliance with any transfer of credit policies included in statutory language63 accountability there is increased interest in knowing whether the federal investment in postsecondar education primarily through the title iv programs and whether the investment made by students and their families in postsecondary education is worthwhile investment that is there is inte rest in knowing the outcomes of the educational process such as student learning job placement rates graduation rates and gr

the student the process is briefly discussed in this section73 percentage of title iv aid earned institutions in itially determine how much title iv aid was received by the student74 ihes then calculate the percentage of title iv aid earned by the student by determining the date of the students withdrawal75 this is determined differently depending on whether the institution is required to take attendance76 at institutions required to take attendance the students withdrawal date is determined based on attendance records at institutions not required to take attendance different procedures exist to determine the students date of withdrawal dependi ng upon whether the student pr ovided official notification of hisher withdrawal the withdrawal date is used to determine the point at which the student withdrew so that the percentage of the period of enrollment or payment period completed can then be calculated the calculation of the percentage of the period of enrollment or payment period completed differs depending of whether the student withdrew from program using credithours or clockhourshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs27 credit hour programs if student withdraws from credithour program the percentage of title iv aid earned is equal to the percentage of the enrollment or payment period completed the percentage of the period completed is determined by dividing the number of calendar days in the payment or enrollment period that the student completed by the total number of calendar days in the payment or enrollment period if the student completed over 60 of the payment or enrollment period heshe has earned 100 of hi sher title iv aid and repayment of funds by the school or student is required if the student withdrew at or prior to the 60 point in the payment or enrollment period the percenta ge of title iv aid earned is prorated for example if the student withdrew at the 50 point heshe has earned 50 of hisher title iv aid clock hour programs the percentage of title iv aid earned by student who withdrew from clockhour program is based on the percentage of scheduled hours the student completed prior to withdr awing student who withdraws after the point at which heshe was scheduled to complete 60 of the scheduled hours in the payment period or period of enrollment has earned 100 of hisher aid the percentage of payment period of period of enrollment completed is calculated by dividing the total number of clock hours scheduled to be co mpleted as of the date the student withdrew by the total number of hours included in the payment period or period of enrollment amount of title iv aid earned by the student the percentage of title iv aid earned is then multiplied by the sum of the title iv aid disbursed plus the title iv aid that could have been disbursed to the student or on the students behalf to determine the amount of title iv aid earne d by the student if the student received less title iv aid than the amount earned the institution may make postwithdrawal disbursement if the student received more title iv aid than the amount earned the school the student or both must return th unearned funds the amount of aid that must be returned is based only on th amount of aid that was disbursed funds to be returned by the institution if it is determined that funds must be returned the institution first calcu lates how much it must return the school must return the lesser of 1 the amount of title iv funds awarded to the student that the student did not earn or 2 the amount of institutional charges incurred by the student

distributed77 the ihe has up to 45 days afte r the date it determines student has withdrawn to return its portion of the unearned funds78 funds to be returned by the student the student is responsible for all unearned title iv funds that the school is not required to return the initial amount owed by the student is the balance of unearned funds after the school returns its portion of unearned funds this is referre d to as the initial amount due because student does not have to make grant repayments in full so it is possible that the student may be responsible for returnin g smaller amount of funds than initially calculated the initial title iv grant ove rpayment is reduced by 50 the amount owed by the student is then recalculated and the student repays the required funds this last provision in the calculation of t itle iv funds to be returned regarding the reduction of the grant amount had been so mewhat controversial the statute had been interpreted to mean that the 50 reduc tion in grant funds referred to 50 of the amount due for grant repayment rather than 50 of the total grant for example assume student had received only 1650 pe ll grant but has 825 in unearned title iv aid also assume the institu tion had to return 250 leaving 575 as the initial amount to be repaid by the stude nt the 575 would have been multiplied by 50 reducing the amount owed to 28750 the hera clarified the interpretation of this provision s ection 484bb2 was amended to limit the amount of grant overpayme nt to be repaid by student to the amount by which the original grant overp ayment exceeds 50 of the total title iv grant funds received by the student thus in the previous example instead of multiplying 575 by 50 the total gran t amount of 1650 would be multiplied by 50 to determine the amount of grant aid that would not have to be repaid the result of this calculation is 825 since the amount by which any grant repayment would be reduced 825 is greater than the amount owed 575 the student would not have to repay an of the pell grant79 this statutory change provides greater benefit to the student postwithdrawal disbursement counseling in some cases students who have

distance education refers to instructi onal modes where there is separation in time andor place between the instructor and the student the term distance education refers to both correspondence courses and telecommunications courseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs30 86 it should be noted that under the hea the term distance education is used only in conjunction with the distance education demonstration program title iv law and regulations use the terms correspondence and telecommunications 87 ed volume 2 fsa handbook p 2133 88 34 cfr 6002 89 this limitation does not apply to an institu tion that mainly provides vocational adult continuedoffered by television audio or comput er transmission or over the internet86 historically distance education courses have been used as means to increase student access to postsecondary education by providing alternatives to the traditional mode of oncampus instruction recently th ere has been substantial growth in the number and types of courses being offered by institutions due to the availability of new technology such as the internet title iv program requirements especially those related to the disbursement of funds are based on student participation in termbased oncampus instruction existing requirements may rest rict funding to students participating in distance education and may not be easily app lied to distance education programs87 this issue was partially addre ssed by the higher education amendments of 1998 with the creation of the distance education monstration progra m discussed below definitions of correspondence and telecommunications courses as previously discussed the regulations governing the administration of title iv programs provide specific definitions for correspondence nd telecommunications courses88 correspondence course is home st udy course offered by an institution the institution provides the student with instructional materials including examinations upon the completion of sec tion of the instructional materials the student takes the corresponding examinations and returns the examinations to the institution for grading telecommunications course is course that is offered via the application of technology this incl udes courses offered by television audio or computer transmission or over the internet if correspondence course also includes telecommunications technology the course is classified based on the predominant mode of instruction 50 rules during the 1992 reauthorization to combat cases of fraud and abuse in institutions that primarily deliver ed instruction through printbased media congress established severa l requirements that are collectively known as the 50 rules these requirements affected both institutional eligibility and student eligibility for title iv aid and were substantially revised by th hera the 1992 requirements are summarized below if the sum of the telecommunica tions courses and correspondence courses equals or exceeds 50 of the total number of courses offered during that award year telecommunications courses are considered correspondence courses an institution loses its title iv eligibility if more than 50 of itscourses are offered by corre spondence section 102 a3a 89httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs31 89 continued education or job training 90 this limitation may be waived for twoyear or fouryear institution offering associates degrees or bachelors degrees respectivel if the students participating in the correspondence courses do not receive more than 5 of the title iv funds received by all students in the school 91 this rule also does not apply to technica l institute or vocational school used exclusively or principally for the provision of vocational education to individuals who have completed or left high school and who are available fo r study in preparation for entering the labor market pl 101392 section 5214c 92 it should also be noted that the third requi rement regarding the percentage of students enrolled in correspondence courses may be waived for school offering twoyear associates degree or fouryear bachelors degr ee if the school demonstrates to ed that in that award year the students enrolled in its correspondence courses received more than 5 of the total title iv funds received by students for that award yearan institution loses its title iv eligibility if 50 or more of its students are enrolled in corre spondence courses section 102 a3b90 the first 50 rule discussed above had implications for an institutions eligibility to participate in title iv programs if the sum of an institutions telecommunications course s and correspondence course s equaled or exceeded 50 of all courses offered by an institution all teleco mmunications courses were considered correspondence courses th hera eliminated the requirement that courses offered by teleco mmunications be considered correspondence courses based on the second 50 rule if an in stitution offered more than 50 of its courses by correspondence then it would lose its eligibility to par ticipate in title iv programs while this requirement continues to apply to institutions offering courses by correspondence courses offered by telecommunications were specifically excluded from this requirement by the hera91 under the third 50 rule an institution w ould lose its title iv eligibility if 50 or more of its students were enrolled in correspondence cour ses as with the second 50 rule this rule conti nues to apply to student enrollment in correspondence courses but courses offere d by telecommunications were specifically excluded from this requirement by the hera92 student eligibility for federal student aid the previous distinction between correspondence courses and teleco mmunications courses and the 50 rule that resulted in telecommunications c ourses being considered correspondence courses directly affected st udent eligibility for title iv funds for example prior to the hera students enrolled in telecommunica tions courses were eligible to receive title iv funds if they were enrolled in degree program or certificate program that was at least one year long for certificate programs of less than one year telecommunications students were c onsidered correspondence students and therefore were not eligible to receive title iv funds as correspondence students had to be enrolled in degreegranting program to receive title iv aid httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs32 93 section 484l 94 section 484k 95 ed volume 2fsa handbook p 2142 96 this provision only applies to programs for which over 50 of

the hera eliminated the rule that required telecommunications courses to be considered corresponden ce courses and as part of this change eliminated the requirement that telecommunications course had to be part of program of study of one year or longer93 thus students enrolled in distance education courses rather th an correspondence courses ar eligible to receive title iv aid if they are enrolled in degreegranting programs or certificate programs of any length provided the program meets the program eligibility requirements for distance education programs student s enrolled in correspondence courses however are only eligible for title iv aid if they are enrolled in degreegranting program94 another distinction between students enro lled in distance education courses and correspondence courses also remains student enrolled sole ly in correspondence courses cannot be considered more than halftime student for the purposes of title iv aid regardless of the number of credits the student is taking95 students enrolled solely in telecommunications courses however can be considered fulltime students for the purposes of title iv aid distance education eligible program as previously

available to distance education students several program requirements for institutions participating in title iv programs were waived for the demonstration program for example the 50 rules that applied to the percentage of correspondence cour ses offered by the institution and the percentage of students enrolled in corre spondence courses were waived for many program participants in addition under certain circ umstances the provision that defines telecommunications course as correspondence course was also waived other institutions received waiver s of the definition of full time student to allow correspondence students to be considered fulltime students an initial group of 15 particip ants were selected to pa rticipate in the program beginning july 1 199998 nine participants were invited to join the program at the beginning of its third year five add itional participants joined the program in december 2003 there are currently 24 partic ipants in the programnine proprietary institutions seven private nonprofit ins titutions four public universities three consortia and one public system99 generally institutions were considered eligible to apply for the program if they were located in the united states and participated in title iv programs or provided twoy ear or fouryear program leading to an associates degree or bachelors degree respectively but were ineligible to participate in title iv programs because of limitations on the number of correspondence courses or the number of students participatin g in correspondence courses100 in april 2005 ed submitted third repor t to congress on the demonstration program101 enrollment in distance education programs offered by the eight program participants that reported data for eight years indicated that enrollment had increased from 7930 in 19981999 to 63350 in 20032004nearly 700 increase in enrollment among the seven institutions in the second cohort of participants that provided data for all four ears of their participation rollment grew by 400 the greatest growth occurred at institutions primarily serving adult students students served by institutions participating in the dedp tend to be female enrolled parttime and older than traditional college age ed concluded that granting waivers to program participants including waivers of the 50 rules had not led to increases in fraud and abuse they determined thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs34 102 see for example hr 609 and s 1614 the pr imary vehicles for hea reauthorization in the 109th congress both bills proposed several changes related to distance education also see the reports on the dedp submitted to congress by ed for additional proposed changes related to distance education 103 ed third report on the dedp p iii 104 this issue may already be addressed in pa rt with regard to ffel and dl loans by allowing ihes to use either the scheduled academic year say traditional academic year or the borrowerbased academic year bbay which can be adjusted to match continuedthe administrative capability and financial viability of an institution posed greater risk to the integrity of federal student ai d programs than the mode through which an institution provided instruction ed also found that while distance education may enable institutions to be innovative with respect to student access and flexibility this innovation may be hampered by the adminis trative requirements of title iv student financial aid programs for example so dedp participants have experienced difficulties administering fe deral student aid programs for nontraditional academic structures as the federal student aid sy stem was developed in an environment in which most institutions enrolled traditional students offered programs on semester or quarter basis and students took summers off issues for reauthorization while hera made changes to the 50 rules and program eligibility requirements additional issues related to distance education may be discussed during hea reauthorization examples of these topics are outlined below102 given the tremendous growth in distance education programs congress may consider whethe r accrediting agencies should be required to have specific standards for evaluating the quality and quantity of distance education programs in order to be recognized as an accrediting agency by ed or whether accrediting organizations should review distance education s imilarly as they review traditional education programs in addition congress may consider adding safeguards to ensure that student who registers for distance education course is th same student who co mpletes the coursework and receives the credit the congress may consider addi ng specific definition of telecommunications course to replace the existing definition of telecommunications included in section 484l4 ed has suggested that the definition should specify that there be regular and substantive interaction betw een students and the instructor103 the current definition does not address this interaction an increasing number of institutions are offering multiple start dates for courses shorter c ourses and overlapping terms this makes student aid calculation and dis bursement complicated the congress may consider switching to an alternative model for aid calculation and disbursement ba sed on an individual students program of instruction which could potentially alleviate some of this difficulty104httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33909crs35 104 continued students attendance and program progression to monitor annual loan limits for
