that traffic control points tcps play in ongoing operations in iraq today tcps are critical control measure supporting units overall force protection movement control and information operations all established tcps must meet stringent force protection requirements accomplish the mission and minimize chances for collateral damage against other coalition forces and friendly iraqi citizens soldiers must balance these requirements while simultaneously maintaining an ability to effectively communicate and interact with the sheer volume of traffic the iraqi operational environment is complex and often ambiguous reports from theater clearly validate that leader decisions and soldier actions at tcps can have both short and long term effects they may also have strategic and international repercussions this handbook will discuss theater proven tactics techniques and procedures ttp to mitigate these challenges in order to conduct successful tcp operations and provides examples of current battle drills and recommended equipment checklists these ttp battle drills and checklists are based on lessons learned by units in theater as they establish and equip tcps and react to tcp incidents throughout iraq the purpose of this handbook is to provide soldiers and leaders guide to employing effective and timely escalation of force policies within the rules of engagement while limiting collateral damage and maintaining force protection lawrence h saul col fa director center for army lessons learnedtraffic control point handbook table of contents foreword introduction 1

tcps you must shape situations to minimize the tough calls and train our leaders on how to reactthis will reduce the number of iraqi civilian injuries and deaths ltg petraeus commanding general combined arms center december 2005 in the iraqi theater of operations tcp is defined as any position established to control movements into and out of an area where coalition forces cf will be in direct contact with vehicles and passengers to include the local populace for the purposes of this article the terms traffic control point and vehicle checkpoint will be used interchangeably tcp effects are synchronized across the lines of operations with units higher headquarters and are differentiated by both placement techniques and duration tcps are normally part of an inner andor outer security ring and are established to facilitate conducting vehicle searches focusing on weapons explosives and other contraband personnel manning tcps make positive identification pid checks to discover apprehend and kill as necessary targeted insurgents tcps also serve as an information collection gathering post for cf and the civilian population soldiers conducting tcp operations in iraq today are routinely required to make splitsecond lifeanddeath decisions tcp personnel must decide whether vehicles or pedestrians pose significant force protection threat soldiers manning numerous tcps across iraq face tough and dangerous mission and perform their duties admirably 247 commanders at all levels know they must provide the required resources to empower soldiers to do their best and make the appropriate decisions reports from the field verify that iraqi responses vary widely at tcps the circumstances on the ground can initially appear ambiguous and confusing vehicles may approach tcp at high rate of speed or drive in an erratic or unpredictable manner to conduct an effective tcp in iraq today soldiers must understand the person they are attempting to control most iraqis entering tcp have hostile intent and will be compliant but they may also be confused and in hurry iraqis fitting this category usually recognize that security is important for their future and acknowledge that soldiers simply have job to do properly trained and patient soldiers can keep interactions with the local populace calm and eliminate confusion at the tcp with clear consistent and repeated instructions some iraqis may approach your location with hostile intent but will be defiant they simply may not want to pull over for variety of reasons they may not for official use only 1traffic control point handbookrespond well to directions from nonmuslims and in particular to cf who they may perceive as occupiers in their country iraqis fitting this category see this stop as an unreasonable request and waste of time because they have hostile intent and only want to proceed with their business they may initially be compliant but they may also grow angry and that anger can quickly escalate to evasiveness or hostility they may decide not to stop or may attempt to bypass or even turn around to avoid tcp they may not understand or may pretend to not understand posted and verbal instructions and warnings this type of driver is the most difficult to assess when determining potential hostile intent and the corresponding escalation of force eof response properly trained and patient soldiers can normally diffuse defiant but nonhostile vehicle occupants with clear consistent and repeated instructions however if the driver refuses to obey instructions and warnings but has not yet displayed overt hostile intent soldiers must begin to consider appropriate eof measures leaders at all levels should teach and reinforce the use of this tactical pause to all soldiers operating tcp driver approaching tcp with hostile intent creates serious and dangerous situation this event usually develops rapidly and cf have limited reaction time this scenario often develops into actions on contact smart and inventive enemy will use myriad of personnel vehicle borne improvised explosive devices vbieds and small arms fire in an attempt to inflict casualties at tcps properly trained and equipped soldiers manning tcps constructed to standard that provide maximum force protection and response times are the keys to success establish tcps to control traffic where and when you want it in order to shape the conditions for success you must make it the iraqis decision to comply or not comply and give the soldier more time to react you must put the decision to comply squarely on the shoulders of the driver of the vehicle through series of control measures patterns picked up from theater clearly indicate that successful tcp designs accomplish the following provide iraqis with an earlier warning slow down traffic at the earliest opportunity firmly control the traffic flow establish distinct vehicle search area with blast protection establish clear warning line where soldiers have an opportunity to regain compliance from vehicles and assess eof actions integrate latest available eod capability have combat life savers and be able to quickly conduct medical

duration and are either static or mobile permanent tcps are deliberately established static positions determined to be an ongoing fixed site requirement to control or monitor specified location for long duration they are normally established along main supply routes or at critical intersections and are large manpower intensive hardened well equipped and advertised to the local population snap also referred to as flash or hasty tcps can be part of predetermined plan or established as an impact operation they are often hastily erected and require less manpower because of the quick set up time they are not as hardened or wellequipped as permanent tcp depending on mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc they may or may not be advertised in advance to the local population snap tcps are designed to control movements for short duration normally 30 minutes or less and are established in reaction to actionable intelligence or as part of displaying an impact security presence in an area staying too long at given location tends to draw the enemy to the snap tcp therefore their effectiveness degrades over time rolling tcps are set up in response to conditions on the roadway andor enemy activity or to facilitate unimpeded cf movements duration is metttc dependent temporary halt tcps are established due to exigent circumstances and collapse as soon as the problem is fixed eg combat logistics patrol maintenance stop all control movements have the potential to interact with the local population personnel conducting reconnaissance for potential tcps must pick locations which best balance force protection and traffic circulation control always anticipate second and third order effects of the site location when establishing tcps leverage available road space with available resources to include nonlethal weaponammunition and barrier equipment sets tcps are always employed with the inherent capability to conduct lethal fire and should be oriented to defend in depth if penetrated all tcps operate under the same rules of engagement roe for official use only 3traffic control point

operations eof considerations graduated response measures are used to protect both cf and iraqi citizens eof procedures are fundamental considerations during any tcp incident eof must be an integral part of all training scenarios and cannot be treated as stand alone event eof vignettes addressing ambiguous conditions are powerful teaching tool see chapter 3 lessons learned from oif reveal that the more control measures and barrier equipment at tcp the more time soldier has to make an eof decision more time often results in enhanced situational awareness which may lessen the requirement to escalate to higher levels of force applying the right response at the right time is vital to all operations in iraq remember the unnecessary use of deadly force by cf on iraqi civilians diminishes iraqi support for the coalition and its objectives inappropriate use of lethal force destroys the lives of innocent iraqis and their families who could otherwise have played vital role in the future of iraq lethal force incident at tcps also potentially fuel future insurgent activity and provide negative propaganda message the antiiraqi forces can use to delay progress in iraq 4 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedchapter 1 leadership challenges of preparing soldiers for traffic control point tcp operations this chapter addresses the significant leadership challenges of preparing soldiers for tcp operations as recognized by experienced commanders currently serving in iraq the information in this chapter is intended to help soldiers properly execute their duties by providing them with the tools they need for success including tcp tactics techniques and procedures ttp recommended equipment lists and escalation of force eof procedures within defined rules of engagement roe reports from commanders in operation iraqi freedom oif verify that there are too many deadly force incidents at tcps both static and rolling that could be prevented or handled with less than lethal force reducing the number of deadly force incidents at tcps is both leadership challenge and training issue leaders naturally and rightfully tell their soldiers to use caution and assess each and every situation however successful leaders in oif today realize they must shape the situation at tcp by using control measures and preparing soldiers to respond leaders understand that successful tcp operations begin with the soldiers ability to better communicate and more effectively interact with the iraqi people they know if soldiers do this they are in better position to respond with measured eof to control the situation and execute their mission leaders at all levels understand that soldiers must use combination of techniques to communicate and control iraqi drivers including verbal commands hand and arm signals signs light sets and barriers they also know these techniques are not an inherent ability but trained skills the soldier must develop as he attains situational awareness sa positive control at tcps is difficult to obtain and must be both planned and trained standard battle drill rehearsals must transform behavior into instinct trained soldiers can more easily differentiate between vehicle that is simply ignoring their warning and vehicle that is displaying willful disobedience or hostile intent trained units who rehearse their anticipated responses are better prepared to deal with all types of tcp incidents trained leaders and soldiers know they must exhaust all measures before using deadly force tcp operations are team effort soldiers monitoring vehicle traffic at tcp must quickly establish sa and effectively communicate with one another soldiers must be aware of the current situation and be able to predict future events based on their battle drill training rushed and inappropriate response of single soldier cannot become the teams response setting the conditions and controlling the situation remain chain of command issue and leadership challenge in situation where events can happen or develop quickly rehearsed battle drills early warning and for official use only 5traffic control point handbookbarrier placement help to shape the environment for both optimum force protection and traffic control leaders must be clear on how to train conduct and equip soldiers to properly set up and execute tcp operations the consequences of soldier making the wrong decision and incorrectly applying eof procedures within the defined roe could be death or injury to noncombatantscivilians on the battlefield coalition forces cf iraqi army iairaqi police services ips andor fellow soldiers collectively wrong tactical decision or at least public perception of wrongdoing can also have potentially longterm strategic consequences as evidenced by the recent shooting of bodyguard for reporter at us army checkpoint this type of unnecessary application of force endangers our efforts to win the hearts and minds of the iraqi people and sustain the coalition leaders are challenged to have their units always at the ready yet able to practice tactical patience in order to let the situation develop before acting decisively at the other end of the spectrum the failure or refusal of soldier to shoot at enemy targets could result in death or injury to the soldier and others manning the checkpoint leaders know that battle drill training requires their personal involvement and that training must be tailored to specific tcp incident oif after action reviews aars and checkpoint operations and battle stressrelated information extracted from call initial impression report 0535 cultural awareness impact upon battle command provide the following training tips soldiers must know that there is complex and often ambiguous environment out there when establishing and conducting tcp operations ºgive yourself early warning ºbalance force protection and movement control ºdo not telegraph your position unless that is your intent ºknow how to employ hand and arm signals signs flares lasers and other control measures such as tcp equipment sets and nonlethal weapons and ammunition human intelligence humint collection remains the largest producer of actionable intelligence more local iraqi engagement normally leads to more preventable tcp interdiction cultural awareness is not merely customs training you must know how iraqi honor shapes behavior deploy with baseline of iraqi command and control phrases and be able to communicate with or without an interpreter 6 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedknow how to influence the person you are dealing with using an interpreter is deliberate process and must be rehearsed soldiers and interpreters must be team effective interpreter teams are better able to diffuse potential problems at tcps apply the right response at the right time both roe and eof protect you and others while minimizing collateral damage know and quickly use the explosive ordnance disposal eod 9line report leverage iraqi security forces isf both the ia and ips knowledge of the area to mitigate potential threats to tcp location to communicate your message to other iraqis and to make positive identifications pids of insurgents lack of pid and inadequate evidence collection procedures can lead to the release of potential insurgent from an iraqi court leverage humint ttp barrier equipment sets and available technology to counter the improvised explosive devise threat maintain operational security leaks about any operation help the enemy when permitted let the local iraqis know you are conducting tcps for their security and safety getting them to buy into and support the process is fundamental to winning the perceptions war you must be able to treat your own casualties and call for help if care is beyond your capability at many checkpoints iraqis failed to understand the hand signals commonly used by us military personnel and soldiers must draw their weapons to force driver to stop people at checkpoints roadblocks and entry control points react differently to pistol than they do to rifle in the saddam regime the pistol was the preferred method of execution whenever soldier drew hisher pistol in situation the iraqis would react in very obedient or cowering manner the pistol represented authority and iraqis treated the bearer accordingly remove sunglasses when appropriate iraqis feel that the eyes are the windows into the soul and they do not really trust someone if they cannot see their eyes to decrease the possible loss of life at checkpoints and vehicular contact locations be familiar with iraqi body language and commonly used iraqspecific hand signals cultural awareness is force protection issue leaders must be aware of the potentially adverse effect that stress might have on their soldiers internalization and application of cultural awareness values during long and violent deployment for official use only 7traffic control point handbooksoldiers in units participating in heavy fighting and suffering many casualties may tend to become culturally insensitive at higher rates than other soldiers soldiers who have participated in multiple oif deployments may share the same tendencies tcps on the asymmetrical battlefield are combat operations leaders at all levels understand that tcps are critical missions reactions from the local populace at tcps are often confrontational and potentially hostile and can be militarily and politically sensitive operations although only limited number of soldiers conduct tcp operations they are often the most exposed to hostile fire outside the units forward operating base tcp personnel are the ones responsible for controlling the congested traffic interacting with the local population assessing potential threats and defeating an often faceless enemy all while applying the appropriate measured response leaders have learned and are stressing to young soldiers that they will often operate checkpoints in congested areas under ambiguous circumstances numerous unit aars state that nothing should be treated as routine when conducting checkpoint operations soldiers and junior leaders manning tcps must remain vigilant and suspicious treat each vehicle as if it were the most important one coming through the checkpoint soldiers are at the tip of the spear during these operations and their actions support shaping the overall tactical situation use the following guidelines during tcp operations bring vehicles into your area when and where you want them balance telegraphing location with surprise and force protection when you must defend defend in depth design well equipped erected and positioned checkpoints to make the vehicle going through the barrier plan display nonhostile or hostile intent welldesigned checkpoints facilitate early warning and enable soldiers to be more active than reactive and consequently they have more time to make eof decisions anticipate consequence management of all decisions against the information operations and media public affairs campaign synchronize tcps as part of the overall security and movement control plans see chapter 3 escalation of force figure 32 example checkpoint with us eof procedures 8 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedoif observations the following tcp operation observations comments and vignettes from soldiers and junior leaders in the field offer ttp to help mitigate risks associated with setting up and engaging enemy targets at tcps tcp observations from oif observation 1 the setup time for tcp often alerts individuals of an impending tcp diminishing its effectiveness discussion setting up the tcp is unfortunately one of the indicators of an impending tcp and hostile individuals have learned many different techniques to avoid cf tcps as soon as cars start seeing the setup they begin to warn oncoming traffic of the tcp technique to counter this problem is the rolling or traffic jam tcp the sequence is as follows the patrol picks location for the tcp that is on welltraveled road instead of traveling to that location immediately and establishing the tcp the patrol drives towards the tcp location and has the trail vehicle pull off to the side of the road approximately 500 meters prior to the inspection area the lead three vehicles travel in staggered column formation in order to block traffic from passing them and begin to slow as they approach the inspection area the intent is to have local vehicles trailing the three cf vehicles until the tcp is set when the lead vehicles get to the inspection area they are already in tcp formation and immediately begin tcp operations the trail vehicle that had pulled off the side of the road moves to the rear of the column of vehicles and blocks them in the tcp subsequently inspects the vehicles caught in the traffic jam the patrol then has the option of allowing additional vehicles into the tcp or moving to an alternate location lesson units include this variation of the tcp in their patrols this technique is intended for very short duration to surprise cars following behind military vehicles it will not substitute for the more deliberate tcp techniques that patrols use but can add an extra measure of unpredictability that will limit the enemys ability to counter tcps observation 2 the unit conducted map reconnaissance for possible vehicle checkpoint vcptcp locations based on the template from the battalion order discussion the technique used for selecting vcptcp was to find wadi or other terrain feature in the templated area and use it for cover and concealment for support vehicles the hide site was close to the checkpoint the unit wanted to use this ttp because of increased observation in desert environment and wanted to increase survivability for vehicles not used in the vcptcp the unit also placed ops manned by the scout platoon at higher elevations to provide overwatch prior to establishing vcptcp the unit modified the ttp based on the terrain available they were not always able to use the terrain to hide the vehicles for official use only 9traffic control point handbooklesson map reconnaissance is invaluable in selecting likely positions for conducting vcpstcps once at the location leaders must make adjustments based on mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc observercontroller observations from combat training centers ctcs rotational units do not conduct enough checkpoint operations this situation may stem from the rotational training unit not getting good intelligence read to drive initiation of tcp operations the amount of focus on checkpoint operations is dependent on the rotational units training objectives most units will train this task during cordon and searches or snap checkpoints however execution of this task is dependent on the rotational training units plan over the past year many fixed site and checkpoint security requirements have transitioned to host nation forces as result less of these types of missions are incorporated into current rotational scenarios the search and attack and combat patrol lanes create an excellent opportunity for units to train this task still it depends on the units read to incorporate tcps into the plan when tcps are conducted ocs provide ongoing coaching and feedback during aar discussions units are coached to employ snap tcps that are driven by the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr process two benefits from this approach are that the snap tcp is active and does not inherently create pattern units are also coached to continue their analysis to ensure that they are not establishing patterns see chapter 4 for information on establishing snap tcp riskmitigation ttp recommendations the following analysisrecommendations for training

faculties when under extreme duress in often ambiguous combat situations summary soldiers and junior leaders at tcps face multiple potentially violent situations with every vehicle encountered they

unit was on the outer cordon for cordon and search when civilian vehicle approached and ignored shouts vehicle horn and flashing lights the unit fired one shotgun round as warning shot the vehicle ignored the warning and continued the unit fired 1315 rounds of 762mm into the vehicle resulting in two civilians killed and two civilians injured cf were injured or killed example 2 screen mission the patrol while posted at an intersection observed vehicle traveling at an unusually slow speed coming toward the cordon from the north because of for official use only 21traffic control point handbooksustained enemy contact over the preceding 30 minutes and the unusually slow speed of the vehicle the unit suspected it to be possible vehicle borne improvised explosive device vbied at 327 meters marines shouted and used hand and arm signals in an attempt to stop the vehicle at 260 meters the gunner fired three 50 caliber rounds at the deck marine term for ground in front of the vehicle at 175 meters the gunner fired ten 50 caliber round disabling shots into the vehicle the vehicle was struck collided into parked vehicles and came to stop the driver jumped out of the vehicle and ran to the west out of sight within seconds of this engagement second vehicle heading from the same direction approached the cordon in the same manner as the first vehicle again the unit believed it to be possible vbied and initiated verbal commands as well as hand and arm signals to stop the vehicle at 250 meters the vehicle did not stop and the gunner fired three disabling shots into the vehicle when the second round impacted the vehicle it immediately ignited and the vehicle was almost instantly consumed by flames from the ensuing fire the driver exited prior to the vehicle being completely engulfed by flames and ran away from the vehicle and out of sight this incident resulted in two civilians insurgents killed and cf casualties example 3 convoy 1 the unit reported an eof incident on supply route the patrol reported that while moving south on the route vehicle approached their patrol at high rate of speed from the rear the patrol began using hand and arm signals to wave the vehicle off but the vehicle kept approaching the patrol the patrol fired warning shot into the ground but the vehicle did not stop or slow the patrol then fired into the vehicles engine compartment and the vehicle stopped the patrol reported that the two civilians in the vehicle suffered life threatening wounds the civilians were transported to medical hospital by local emergency services example 4 convoy 2 the unit reported an eof incident while securing an intersection vehicle was approaching eastbound on the road the vehicle ignored spotlight the unit fired 556mm round when the vehicle was approximately 100 meters away the vehicle continued to approach and another shot was fired from approximately 50 meters away the vehicle then stopped and the convoy continued on its mission without further incident injuries or damage to civilians or cf resulted from this incident the following figures provide an example of traffic control point and guidance for training the eof

damage and disrupt movement these insurgent tactics are used both for their immediate destructive effects and for longterm anticoalition force propaganda efforts tcps should never be established without the capability of being immediately reinforced tcp personnel screen clear document and detain pedestrians and vehicles and their passengers after vehicles are validated drivers are allowed to continue down the roadway snap tcps are quickly erected operate for short duration and achieve specific purpose snap tcps are often conducted under timecompressed military decisionmaking process mdmp and serve as both security and movement control check because of their mobility snap tcps can cover multiple locations in relatively short amount of time units have learned to position snap tcps leveraging the naturalmanmade terrain and existing roadway features to canalize traffic and prevent the ability of insurgents to seek bypass coalition forces cf also integrate observation posts for overwatch and sniper positions for both added security and to defeat anticipated targets attempting to interdict tcps along the main supply routes more stringent force protection measures may be required for checkpoint operations of longer duration purpose of snap tcp quickly controls traffic and maintains the ability to search for enemy contraband or individuals insurgents provides commanders with an ability to immediately have security presence and influence an area of operations enhances force protection and establishes an engagement area for the application of graduated
