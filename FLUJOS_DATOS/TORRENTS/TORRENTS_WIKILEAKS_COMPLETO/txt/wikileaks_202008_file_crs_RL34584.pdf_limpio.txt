of the national human genome research institute described the potential that the information generated by the hgp holds fo r medicine and public health3 he stated that the human genome sequence provides f oundational information that now will allow development of comprehensive catalog of all of the genomes components determination of the functi on of all human genes and deciphering of how genes and proteins work together in pathways and networks completion of the human genome sequence offers unique opportunity to understand the role of genetic factors in health and disease and to apply that understanding rapidly to prevention diagnosis and treatment this opportunity will be realized through such genomicsbased approaches as identification of genes and pathways and determining how they interact with environmental factors in health and disease more precise prediction of disease susceptibility and drug response early detection of illness and development of entirely new therapeutic approaches4 as dr collins stated with completion of the human genome sequence scientists will now focus on understanding th clinical and public health implications of the sequence information all diseas has genetic component and therefore genomic research has the potential to substantially reduce the collective burden of disease in the general populati on clinical genetic tests are becoming available at rapid rate with 1271 clinical ge netic tests currently available5 in addition private insurers are beginning to include some clinical genetic tests in their health insurance benefits packages as evidence of the tests clinical validity accumulates6 concerns about the use of genetic information these scientific advances in genetics while promisin g are not without potential

scientific knowledge about genetics becomes increas ingly widespread numerous researchers and commentators including dr francis collins have expressed concerns about how this information will be used8 in congressional testimony dr collins stated while genetic information and genetic technology hold great promise for improving human heath they can also be used in ways that are fundamentally unjust genetic information can be used as the basis for insidious discriminationthe misuse of genetic information has the potential to be very serious problem both in terms of peopl access to employment and health insurance and the continued ability to undertake important genetic research9 legal cases of genetic discrimination have been few10 however studies have shown that public fear of discrimination is substantial and negatively influences the uptake of genetic testing and the use of ge netic information by consumers and health professionals the secretarys advisory committee on genetics health and society sacghs learned that 68 of american s are concerned about who would have access to their personal genetic information 31 state this concern would prevent them from having genetic test and

discrimination based on that information many stated that fear of genetic discrimination would dissuade them from undergoing genetic test or participating in genetic research studies others stated that they would pay out of pocket for genetic test to prevent the results from being placed in their medical record such concerns are deterrent to advances in the field of genetic testing and may limit the realization of the benefits of genetic testing14 joint report by the department of labor the department of health and human services the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the department of justice summarized the various studies on discrimination based on genetic information and argued for the enac tment of federal legi slation the report stated that genetic predisposition or conditions can lead to workplace discrimination even in cases where work ers are healthy and unlikely to develop disease or where the genetic condition has effect on the ability to perform work and

legislation the national council on disability ncd an independent federal agency that advises the president and congress on issues affecting individuals with disabilities published position paper on march 4 2002 ar guing for the enactment of federal legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination the ncd argued that recent advances in genetic research have brought an increasing potential for genetic discrimination that genetic discrimination is historical and current reality that genetic discrimination undermines the purposes of genetic research and testing that genetic test information has little value for purposes of making employment decisions and insurance decisions and that existing laws are insufficient to pr otect individuals from genetic discrimination16 federal law relating to genetic discrimination prior to gina health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa title i of gina extends the current hipaa protections against discrimination by group health plans and issuers of health insurance in both the group and individual markets hipaa prohibits group health pl an or issuer of group health plan from using genetic information to establish rules for eligibility or continued eligibility and provides that genetic information shall not be treated as preexisting condition in the absence of the diagnosis of the condition related to such information it also prohibits group health plan or issuer of group health plan from using genetic information in setting premium contributi on these protections apply to individuals within the group plans howev er they do not apply to the acceptance of the whole group or to the premiums set for the group thus hipaa prohibits group health plans or issuers of group health plans from charging an individual higher premium than similarly situated individual however the law does not prevent an entire group from being charged more the hipaa nondiscrimination provisions do not apply to individual health insurance policies and genetic information may be used to set premiums for individual policies although hipaa establishes both guaranteed issue for individuals who lose group coverage and guaranteed renewal for those with existing individual coverage hipaa would not prohibit group health plan s or issuers of plans ie insurers from requiring or requesting genetic inform ation or testing and does not prevent them from excluding coverage for particular condition or imposing lifetime caps on all benefits or on specific bene fits finally hipaa does not address the use of genetic information in contexts other than h ealth insurance such as employment under the hipaa privacy rule health pl ans and insurers may use or disclose health information for payment and other health care operations

before the senate committee on he alth education labor and pensions july 20 2000 the eeoc in its guidance to the definition of disability for its compliance manual in this guidance the eeoc examined the definition of disability under the ada noting that the definition was composed of three prongs disability means 1 physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual 2 record of such an impairment or 3 being regarded as having such an impairment23 it was under the third prong that the eeoc determined that discrimination based on genetic information relating to illness disease or other disorders was prohibited although this eeoc interpreta tion was widely heralded as significant step for the protection of rights for individua ls whose genes indicate an increased susceptibility to illness disease or other disorders it is limited in its application and may be even more limited after the recent supreme court decisions on the definition of disability24 however the eeoc has not withdr awn this guidance and at senate hearings eeoc commissioner paul miller st ated that the ada can be interpreted to prohibit employment disc rimination based on genetic information however the ada does not explicitly address the issue and its protections are limited and uncertain in addition commissioner m iller observed that even if the ada were found to cover genetic disc rimination the requirements of the ada may not protect workers from all types of ge netic discrimination he stated for example the ada does not protect workers from requireme nts or requests to provide genetic information to their employers in ddition once the applicant is hired the employer may request that the employee take medical exam such as genetic test if the employer can demonstrate that the information from that test is job related and consistent with business necessity25 although the combination of the adas legislative history and the eeocs guidance has led some commentators to argue that the ada would cover genetic discrimination the mer it of these arguments has been uncertain since there have been reported cases holding that the ada

andrew j imparato the president and ceo of the american asso ciation of people with disabilities testified that t he ada as drafted doe s provide some protections against genetic discrimination in

genetic discriminati on they emphasize an individualized approach to the determination of whethe r an individual has disability under the ada although an argument could be ma that the ada would cover individuals with genetic defects in certain cases the courts decisions particularly sutton and murphy use reasoning that would make it likely that most ada claims based on genetic discrimination would be successful27 in addition even assuming the ada was found to apply it may not protect employees from having their employers have access to their genetic information although the ada prohibits an employer fro m making medical inquiries prior to job offer the employer may obtain medical information in certain cases after the offer of employment has been made assuming that the prohibitions against discrimination in the ada would apply it is difficult to prove that genetic information was the reason for discrimination executive order on february 8 2000 president clinton issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination against federal employees based on protected genetic information the executive order defines p rotected genetic information as information about an indivi

title based on the use acquisition or disclosure of medical info rmation that is not genetic information about manifested disease disorder or pathological cond ition of an employee or member including manifested diseas disorder or pathological condition that has or may have genetic basis this difference in the definition of gene tic test implies that employers who use genetic information about ma nifested disease to discr iminate may be in violation of this act while health insurers who use genetic information about manifested disease to discriminate will not be in violation of this act

because of genetic informa tion and with certain exceptions prohibits an employer from requesting requiring or purchasing genetic information the law prohibits the use of genetic information in employment decisions including hiring firing job assignments and promotions by employers unions employment agencies and labormanagement training programs definition of employee and employer gina defines employees and employers as those defined in section 701b and f of t itle vii of the civil rights act of 196439 state employee or employer as defined in section 304a of the government employee rights act of 199140 and covered employee or employing office as defined in section 101 of the congressional accountability act41 generally this includes employ ees and applicants working in the private sector for an employer who employs 15 or more empl oyees federal and state governments as well as congressional employees the corres ponding employers of these individuals as well as employment agencies labor orga nizations and training programs also are covered by the law prohibited employment practices as noted previously gina prohibits the use of genetic information in employme nt decisions including hiring firing job assignments and promotions by employ ers unions employment agencies and labormanagement training programs in ddition an employer employment agency labor union or training pr ogram may not request re quire or purchase genetic information with respect to the employee individual union member or family member there are exceptions to this prohibition on employers employment agencies labor unions and training programs the first exception applies when one of these entities inadvertently requests or requires family medical history of the employee individual union member or family member the house education and labor report noted that this exception addresses the socalled water cooler problem in which an employer unwittingly receives othe rwise protected genetic information in the form of family medical history thr ough casual conversations with worker42 the second exception is for health or genetic services offered by the entity as part of wellness program to qualify for the exemptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34584crs15 43 id at 38 44 id the employee individual or uni on member must provide prior knowing voluntary and written authorization only the employee individual union member or family member and the licensed health care profe ssion or board certified genetic counselor involved in providing such services can receive individually identifiable informati on concerning the results of the services and any individually identifiable genetic information is only available for such services and shall not be disclosed to the employer except in aggregate terms that do not identify individuals the third exception is for information necessary for certification procedures under federal and state family and medical leave laws th is exception was described as eliminating the potential for conflict with existing laws43 the fourth exception like the first concerns the ina dvertent acquisition of genetic information by the purchase of documents such as newspapers that are commercially and publicly available and that include family medical history this exception was intended to address the concern that gina c ould be violated by such actions as the purchase of newspaper containing the ob ituary of an employees parent who died of breast cancer44 the fifth exception applies when the information involved is to be used for genetic monitoring of the biological effects of toxic substances in the workplace however in order for this exception to apply the employer employment agency labor union or training program must provide written notice of the genetic monitoring to the employee the employee individual or uni on member must provide prior knowing voluntary and written au thorization or the genetic monitoring is required by federal or state law the employee individual or uni on member must be informed of individual monitoring results the monitoring must be in compliance with federal geneticmonitoring regulations or state genetic monitoring regulations and the employer employment agency labor union or training program excluding any licensed health care professional or board certified genetic counselor must receive th results only in aggregate terms that do not disclose the identity of specific employees there is sixth exception for employer s and training programs but not for employment agencies or labor unions this exception which was changed by hconres 340 would allow employers nd training programs that conduct dna analysis for law enforcement purposes as forensic laboratory or for

that violates nondiscrimination or confidentiality requirements confidentiality of genetic information generally gina requires that genetic information shall be maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and be treated as confidential medical record and prohibits employers employment agencies labor unions and joint labormanagement committees from disclosing genetic information these tities are considered to be in compliance with the maintenance of information requirements if the genetic information is treated as confidential record unde r 102d3b of the americans with disabilities act45 however the general prohibition on disclosure is subject to six exceptions genetic inform ation may be disclosed to the employee or member of labor union or family member receiving genetic services at th written request of the employee or member to an occupational or other health researcher if the research isconducted in compliance with 45 cf r part 46 which provides for protection of human research subjects in response to court order except that only the genetic information expressly authorized by the order shall be disclosed if the court order was obtained without the knowledge of the employee or member to whom the informati on refers the employee or member shall be informed of the court order and the information may be disclosed to government officials who are investigating compliance with titleii of gina if the information is relevant where such disclosure is made in connection with the certificationprovisions of the family and medical leave act or state

date of enactment to review the science of genetics and make recommendations to c ongress regarding whether to provide disparate impact cause of action under gina construction section 209 of gina contains several rules of construction including provision concerning the relationship between title i and title ii of the act gina provides that nothing in title ii is to be construed to limit the rights or protections of an individual under any federa l or state statute that provides equal or greater protection in addition nothing in title ii is to limit the rights or protections of an individual to bring an action or pr ovide for enforcement of or penalties for any violation under title i of gina certain sections of erisa the public health services act and the internal revenue c ode this provision has been referred to as firewall between titles i and ii and has been described as clarifying that employers are not liable for health insuran ce violations under civ il rights laws unless the employer has separately violated provision of title ii governing employers48 gina also states that it does not apply to the armed forces repository of specimen samples for the

unconstitutional the remainder of the act is not to be affected section 16e of the fa ir labor standards act49 regarding child labor protections is amended issues for consideration the enactment of gina raises some i ssues for consideration educating the public and health care providers about the scope and applicati on of gina will be an important part of the implementation phase this is particularly the case because there are very relevant limitations to th law of which the public and practitioners should be made aware in order to avoid confusion or misunderstanding first the scope of the law is limited to the settings of health insurance and employment it does not cover the following long term ca re insurance life insurance shortterm disability insurance or longterm disability insurance moving forward this distinction may need to be presented clearly to the public so there is not an expectation of blanket protection from genetic discrimination in all settings where genetic information may be disclosed requeste d required or used second gina does not extend protections against discrimination in health insurance and employment to individuals with manifested diseases or disordershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34584crs19 genetic or otherwise specific provisions in titles i and ii clarify that health insurers and employers will not be in violation of gina if they utilize other medical information about or knowledge of manife sted disease or disorder to establish premiums set enrollment eligibility or preexisting exclusion requirements or make employment decisions again educational efforts may be us eful in ensuring that the public is aware of the scope of the law
