labonte government and finance division july 25 2005 abstract recurring question in the debate on adding individual accounts ias to social security is how large the typical account would be upon retirement making this calculation requires assumptions about the contribution rate length of time the account was held and rate of return earned on the account net any administrative fees and taxes because of the power of compound interest changing the rate of return on the account leads to greatly diﬀerent outcomes for example 1 invested every month for 40 years accumulates to 1526 if earning 5 2625 if earning 7 and 4681 if earning 9 rate of return many estimates of how large the ias would be have assumed that assets in the account would earn rate of return equal to the historical average for example in the oﬃcial actuarial estimates of various ia plans the social security administration actuaries assume that equities will average rate of return of 65 and government bonds will earn 3 some proposals assume that the accounts would hold equities stocks others bonds and others some combination of the two since stocks historically have higher rate of return than bonds on average the rate of return earned by the ias would increase as the fraction held in equities increased but is the assumption that future rates of return will mirror historical rates of return valid one or are there ways in which the future may diﬀer from the past that will have predictable eﬀect on the rate of return this report analyzes demographic economic and ﬁnancial reasons why the assumption might or might not be validhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl33007 individual accounts what

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007individual accounts what rate of return would they earn summary it has been proposed to add individual accounts to social security in which investors could hold private securities calculations that project the earnings of individual accounts typically presume that th ey will earn rate of return equal or close to the historical rate of return but is there evidence that future rates of return will differ from history in predictable ways since the mid1990s equity stock prices have been consistently above the historical norm in relation to corporate earnings and dividends this implies that future rates of return woul d be below the historical av erage unless future earnings and dividends grow more quickly than they have been one reason why current stock prices may be higher and future rates of re turn might be lower is because of decline in the equity premium which is the difference in rates of return between stocks and bonds that investors require to be willing to bear the additional risk of equities increasing rates of stock ownership and accessibility for the average investor have suggested to some that the equity premium may have fallen the projected decline in the growth of the labor force would reduce the economic growth rate all equal slower growth in the economy is likely to mean slower growth in corporate earnings which could lower the rate of return ultimately rates of return are determined by the equilibrium between saving and investment many have predicted that the saving rate will decline as the baby boomers begin to draw down their savings to finance their retirement but at the same time investment demand is likely to grow more slowly because of the decline in the growth rate of the labor force if the growth in saving declines more quickly than the growth in investment rates of re turn would rise but the opposite is equally plausible and would lead to lower rates of return under current policy budget deficits woul d become much larger in the future and this would be expected to increase rates of return as deficits crowd out private investment individual accounts could also in fluence the national saving rate if they are deficitfinanced then public saving would fall and private saving would rise leaving public saving and hence rates of return unchanged if they are financed through higher taxes or lower sp ending today then national saving would rise and rates of return would fall however even if individual accounts left national saving and ove rall rates of return unchange d they could push up the demand for stocks thereby lowering their rate of return while increasing the supply of us treasuries thereby raising their rate of return comparing the rates of return of equities and other securities directly is analogous to comparing apples to oranges standard risk adjustment techniques would set the rate of return on equities equal to us treasuries this is the only way that risky return can be directly compared to the riskfree social security benefit offsets that accompany the individual accounts this report will not be

differ from the past that will have predictable effect on the rate of return this report will analyze demographic economic and financial reasons why the assumption might or might not be valid what is the historical rate of return before exploring factors that might influence the future rate of return it is useful to discuss what the rate of return has b een historically and how much confidence we can have that the past is useful guide to the future2 as can be seen in table 1 the historical real rate of re turn is sensitive to the time period under consideration the average rate of return over the past 20 years was quite bit higher than over the past 50 years so even periods of time as long as decade can be unrepresentative forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs2 3 the meaning of long run depends on the context in some cases it may simply refer to events that are independent of the fluctuations of the business cycle in the case of capital stock adjustments the longrun may be as long as 30 years with respect to technological progress it may be even longer in this report the long run is defined by the 75year projections of the soci security trustees 4 for examples of how much ia performance would have varied historically see crs report rl31324 social security reform the effect of economic variability on individual accounts and their annuities by geoffrey kollman dawn nuschler and patrick purcellcalculating an average return3 for example in the 1990s the real rate of return on equities averaged an impressive 148 but in the 1970s it averaged only 14 not only are rates of return highly volatile but they can be highly persistent gains or losses can persist for several years and take several years longer to be reversed this implies that the retirement income of an individual whose ia was invested in equities could change significantly based on the markets performance in the period before retirement for example worker w ho invested 1 in 1959 and w ithdrew it upon retirement in 1999 would have had balance of 1655 while worker who invested 1 in 1962 and retired in 2002 would have had balance of 805 in other words average rates of return mask the wide ra nge of returns that actual individual accounts holding the same assets would earn over time4 table 1 real rates of return for equities over different historical periods period average annual real rate of

to december for each year while basing projections on 50 years of historical data or more may seem to imply high degree of certainty this ev idence is actually less robust than one might expect because of the significant volatility in the annual data the standard error associated with the data is very large for example cochrane estimates that from 1946 to 1996 the 95 percent confidence interval for the average annual return would be between 3 and 13 over longer holding periods the volatility diminishes but then there are fewer observations from which to make statistical inference whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs3 5 john cochrane where is the market going uncertain facts and novel theories economic perspectives federal reserve bank of chicago novdec 1997 p 3 6 jeremy siegel the shrinking equity premium journal of portfolio management fall 1999 p 12 the rise in the later period was largely because bond returns fell over that period while equity returns remained stable the expost equity premium is measured by comparing actual equity returns to actual bond re turns ideally we would like to measure the exante equity premium the premium that invest ors expected before the fact when they made their investment rather than the expost premium but that is impossibleincreases uncertainty for example for the rate of return over 20year holding periods there are only five statistically independent observa tions over 100 years of data5 cochrane points out two other problem s with extrapolations made from historical data first economic outcomes were much better here than abroad longterm average return based on number of countries would be much lower than the average for the united states in this sense investors in us stocks were lucky because us stocks turned out to be less risky than in most other countries that does not guarantee that the us stocks will be luckier than foreign stocks in the future second the data suffer from non normality over the past 50 years during that time the united states has not experi enced any rare calamities such as economic depression natural disaster or government breakdown that would bring down the average returns on equities these rare events may not occur in the future either but basing future projections on historical experience that is not comprehensive of the entire range of possible experiences may not be suitably representative of the full range of possible outcomes that ia holders could face effects of changing equity premium there may be reasons to believe that the rate of return on equities relative to other assets could be different in the future than it has been in the past for discussion of relative rates of return see the text box on the next page the equity premium refers to the difference in average rate of return between equities and other assets siegel calculates that between 1802 and 1998 the expost equity premium averaged 35 percentage points using data for equities and longterm government bonds and between 1946 and 1998 the premiu m rose to 65 percentage points6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs4 comparing asset returns through risk adjustment the fact that equities have higher ra of return than bonds on average begs the question of why if an ia held in equities would grow faster than an ia held in bonds then why would anyone hold bonds for that matter why wouldnt investors holding bonds realize this nd trade all of their bonds for equities tomorrow if market participants are rational as economists believe some factor other than rate of return must be hol ding investors back from converting all of their bonds into equities economists explain the different rates of return offered by different financial instruments in terms of riskreturn tradeoff equities are more risky than corporate bonds because bondholder is pro mised specific rate of return and bondholders are paid off before equity holders if firm enters bankruptcy investors are willing to hold the securities of wellestablished firms at lower rates of return than flybynight firms because investors are more certain that well established firms will meet the financial targets that they set investors will hold bonds of the federal government us treas uries at lower rate of return than corporate bonds because only the federal g overnment can levy compulsory taxes or print money to service its debt thus comparing the rate of return on di fferent financial instruments such as equities and bonds is like comparing apples and oranges since rates of return alone tell us nothing about risk to make an apples to apples comparison rates of return must somehow be adjusted to cancel out differences in risk between different financial instruments this leads to an important insight if individuals are rational then the higher rate of re turn on equities than bonds is exactly equal to the loss in utility happiness that the average investor suffers from taking on the additional risk of holding equities rather than debt if that is true then all financial instruments earn the same rate of return on average after adjusting for risk in other words the average stoc kholder is better off than the average bondholder even though the former can expect to receive higher rate of return than the latter if it were not true and the utility enjoyed from earning higher rate of return on equities exceeded the u tility lost from the higher risk of holding equities then investors w ould sell bonds pushing their rate of return up and buy equities pushing their rate of return down until the discrepancy longer existed for that reason in its analysis of individual accounts the congressional budget office cbo has assumed that individual accounts regardless of what types of assets they hold earn rate of return equal to government bonds this is the only way that the earnings on the account which are uncertain can be meaningfully compared to the benefit ffsets proposed by the administration and others which are always the same matter what the ia earns the administration has proposed that social s ecurity benefits be offset by the amount of taxable payroll diverted to individua l accounts compounded at rate of 3 yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs5 7 for survey see narayana kocherlakota the equity premium its still puzzle journal of economic literature vol 34 1 mar 1996 p 42 8 as cochrane explains if the economic mode ls are calibrated to so that people are risk averse enough to generate the historical equity premium then other variables in the model such as interest rates would fluctuate wild ly contrary to historical experience john cochrane where is the market going uncertain facts and novel theories economic perspectives federal reserve bank of chicago novdec 1997 p 3 9 it also implies that the government could im prove economic efficiency if the current share of wealth held in equities is inefficiently low at present and individual accounts increase that share this outcome is not given how ever since current proposal requires that proportion of individual accounts be held in equitie s individuals may prefer to continue to hold the same share of their ia wealth in equities as they currently hold privately 10 some economists have argued that once transaction costs are netted out the equity premium is lower than it first appears if tr ansaction costs have fallen then gross returns relative to bonds would also fallthere is vast literature in financia l economics on an equity premium puzzle7 this literature finds that the difference in average rate of return between equities and bonds is too great to be explained by any theoretical representa tion of risk aversion in other words the increased riskiness of equities compared to bonds is simply not great enough to merit the return premium on equities compared to bonds of course economists use highly simplified models to quantify human behavior which nobody knows how to properly quantify so the pr oblem could be with the model and not with human behavior8 but if these models are correct it suggests that investors fear of equities is irrationally high and by extensi on standard riskadjustment techniques are undercounting the gains to be had from holding equities if the rate of return on those equities is adjusted to equal the government bond rate9 regardless of what gains could be had from holding equities compared to bonds historically investors have been indifferent betw een the two at prevailing interest rates as irrational as that decisi on may have been if they continue to be indifferent between the two in the future it is difficult to see how the government can claim to know better than the individual about his investment decisions and eschew standard riskadjustment tec hniques on the grounds that investors are irrational but again this line of reasoning assumes that financial markets will operate the same in the future as they have in the past what would be the implications for rates of return if the equity premium were smaller in the future or had already become smaller than it had been in the past using historical rates of return in proj ections of ia earnings assumes that the historical equity premium w ill remain constant in the future yet it is well known that ownership of equities has changed markedly in past decades equities have become more attractive to small investors through innovations such as discount brokers and mutual funds and the rise of finedcontribution pensions all of these innovations have reduced the transaction costs associated with buying and selling equities for the average investor10 in addition there is at least superficial evidence from popular culture that the average invest ors fears of equitie s may have lessened at least before the stock market cr ash of 2000 in 1989 316 of households owned equities by 2001 the figure had risen to 519 equities increased

to lower equity pr emium rates of return would be expected to temporarily be unusually high because prices would rise prices w ould rise because less cautious investors would now be willing to pay more for share of the same future earnings and dividends at the time many financial anal ysts argued that this could explain why rates of return were unusually high in the 1990s if this transition period were included in the historical average then the difference between the historical average and future returns would be even greater in the presence of lower equity premium 13 nicholas barberis

since then do not base their decisions on first hand knowledge of that experience if equities have become relativel more attractive to investors this could imply lowe r equity premium moving forward if the equity premium has fallen then the absolute rate of return on equities can be expected to fall and the absolute rate of return on less risky assets to rise all else equal12 were the equity premium to disappear entirely the fall in equity returns at the extreme would be significant th average annual return on equities from 1871 to 1993 was 39 percentage points higher th an shortterm comme rcial paper form of corporate debt and in the absence of an equity premium it has been predicted that it would be only 01 percentage points higher13 is there any empirical evid ence that the equity premium has fallen looking at average rates of return in recent years is not particularly useful because the stock market has gone through sharp fall followed by relatively smaller but still large rebound these shortterm fluctuations pr obably give little evidence of longer term trends what is needed is some reliable estimate of future expected returns one possibility would be to see what professi onal forecasters are predicting for future returns although few forecasts extend more than few years recent wall street journal article reported that survey of 10 financial economists predicted that the average real return on equities from now to 2050 would decline to 4814 global insight private forecasting firm provide s 25year projection of equities and predicts that they will rise 64 annually in real terms15 the other possibility is to look at cu rrent valuations and attempt to timate what they imply about investors views on future valuations this strategy will be explored in the next sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs7 16 this assumption would be unreasonable in recession since earnings are typically below average when aggregate demand is low but since the economy has been growing robustly since 2003 it may be reasonable assumption now 17 corporation can transfer ear nings to an investor through either dividend payment or by buying back stock and the effect on the inve stors rate of return should be exactly the same therefore some analysts have argu ed that the pd ratio will be incomplete if buybacks are not taken into account if buyba cks are constant over time it would not be problematic to make historical comparisons us ing the pd ratio but many analysts argued that buybacks increased in the late 1990s and this was one reason why the pd ratio was rising unfortunately historical data on the pd ratio that controls for buybacks are difficult to findthe pe ratio pd ratio and future rates of return standard financial theory fines current equity prices as equal to the present discounted value of future price appreciati on and dividend payments in other words someone purchasing stock today is purchasing the expected future capital gains and dividend payments associated with that st ock discounted to the present therefore todays prices should reflect investors expectations of future rates of return an important measure in determining future rates of return is future corporate earnings since earnings can be used by the firm to either pay dividends buy back its stock reduce its debt or increase the firm s capital stock any of which could cause its stock price to rise unfortunately there is way to accurately predict the path of future dividends or future earnings the higher one believed them to be the higher the expected rate of return would be for given stock price for analytical purposes many financial analysts assume that future dividends and earnings will be equal to current dividends and earnings16 by dividing share price by earnings per share they calculate priceearnings pe ratio and by dividing share price by divi dends per share they calcula pricedividends pd ratio17 if the pe ratio or pd ratio rises today and earnings or dividends remain constant in the future then future rates of return will be lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs8 18 the federal reserve estimates ratio of the ma rket value of equities to firms net worth assets less liabilities this is similar to the economic concept known as tobins q high value of the ratio would be associated with an overvalued market and imply low future rates of return and vice versa this ratio follows the same pattern over time as the pe ratio and prices are still relatively high by this measure as well although long data series is not available from 1986 to 1990 the ratio equaled between 441 and 525 in the 1990s it rose rapidly reaching 1851 in 1999 in the last quarter of 2004 it stood at 964source crs calculations based on data from haver analytics notes ratios are calculated for standard poors 500 index stocks earnings are measured as fourquarter trailing earnings as can be seen in figure 1 during the late 1990s the pe and pd ratios were extremely high by historical standards at the time some skeptics argued that this meant that the stock market was experiencing bubble where stock prices could not be justified by any reasonable expecta tion of future dividends and earnings and were unlikely to persist in fact the stock market fell 46 from peak to trough and strong case can be made that the skeptics were correct however as can be seen from the chart although the pe and pd ratio s are lower than they were in the late 1990s they are still high compar ed to historical averages18 since the pd ratio is also affected by firms decisions whether to pay out their earnings as dividends and dividend payouts have fallen over time the analysis will focus on the implications of high pe ratio there are number of possible explanations for the currently high pe ratio future earnings will be higher than current earnings perhaps because productivity growth is now higher than it was in the past this implies that equity returns could continue to match historical levels despite the higher pe ratio there is still bubble in stock pri ces and prices will have to fall further or stay flat for time before prices reflect

and pe ratios have not been accurate predictors of the moveme nt of prices over short time periods in the pastperiod until the pe ratio returns to historical levels followed by equity returns equal to historical averages investors require lower risk premiu m than they did in the past and will therefore pay more for share of unchanged earnings if so future equity returns would be lower than historical returns19 clearly these three possibilities have very different implications for the future earnings of individual accounts the fi rst possibility implies that the common assumption that individual accounts will earn th historical rate of return is the appropriate one what this ar gument fails to explain is why current earnings are not already as high as the pr esent discounted value of fu ture earnings since productivity growth accelerated nearly decade ago unl ess one assumes that it will accelerate even further in the future if current ear nings are already growing as fast as future earnings will grow then the pe ratio should not be higher than its historical average from 2001420051 real earnings per sh are have grown by 45 per quarter roughly three times the 19882005 average it is difficult to see why earnings would grow even more rapidly in the future the second possibility suggests that while stock returns may equal the historical averages in the more distant future in the short term returns could be well below average although it is impossible to pred ict accurately how and when those below average returns will manifest themselves campbell and shiller present evidence that when the pe and pd ratios have been high historically it has typically been falling prices the second scenario not rising earnings or divide nds the first scenario that has brought the ratios back to their historic average over the longer run20 this implies that early generations of ia holders may experience low or negative rates of return while ias would do well in the more distant future the third assumption suggests the historical average rate of return is higher than should be expected in the future because attitudes toward ri sk are fundamentally different now than they were historically it is possible to derive rough estimate of what the higher pe ratio implies for future earnings from 1950 to 1999 stocks av eraged real rate of return of 1033 reichenstein breaks this re turn down into three parts dividend yield of 384 earnings growth of 304 and an increase in the pe ratio of 341 this implies that if the pe ratio remains constant in the future and divide nds and earnings equal their levels from 1950 to 1999 the rate of re turn would equal 692 this is similar to the social security actuaries assumpti on that the rate of return will equal 65 but dividend yields have been significantly lower than 384 in recent years unless earnings growth exceeds the historical average then reichenstein argues that athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs10 21

progressive personal account plan memorandum social security administration dec 1 2003current dividend yields the rate of return will fall to 478 whic h he finds consistent with the view that there is now lower equity premium if the pe ratio is to return to level more in line with historical experience however the rate of return would be even lower for example if the pe ratio were to fall from its recent average of approximately 20 to its 60year average of approximately 16 over the next 10 years it would reduce rates of return by 22 based on reichens teins calculation21 the social security administration has explicitly linked the currently high pe ratio and lower equity premium to their decision to assume rate of return in projections that is little lower than the historical average the longterm ultimate average annual real yield assumed for equities is 65 percent this is somewhat wer than the historical real equity yield over the last several decades consensus is forming among economists that equity pricing as indicated by pricetoearnings ratios may average somewhat higher in the longterm future than in the longterm past this is consistent with broader access to equity markets and the belief that quities may be viewed as somewhat less risky in the future than in the past quity pricing will vary in the future as in the past pricetoearnings ratios were very high through 1999 and are now lower the average ultimate real equity yield assumed for estimates in this memorandum is consistent with an average ultimate level of equity pricing somewhat above the average level of the past22 using the pe and pd ratios to project future returns depends crucially on the relationship between present and future ear nings and dividends future earnings and dividends and hence returns will depend directly on futu re economic growth the possibility of predictable changes in future growth is discussed in the next section economic growth and rates of return capital income growth is unlikely to exceed gdp growth the future longrun rate of return on equity may be affected in part by the longrun rate of economic growth slower growth in na tional income would lead to slower growth in income from capital unless capitals share of income rises which is equivalent to corresponding decline in labors share of income the historical record suggests that is unlikely estimates of income shares accruing to labor and capital vary slightly because of the ways in which income is attributed to human capital but remain relatively stable over long time periods most mathematical models designed to explain economic growth assume that labors and capitals income shares do not vary much over time the functional distribution of income describes how income is shared

since the late 1940s although there has been substan tial variation and the share has risen from relatively low levels in the mid1970s24 but capitals share of income has always been between 20 and 25 this suggests that the effect of any lower gdp growth on capital income is unlikely to be offset by rise in capitals share of income the rate of economic grow th is expected to fall over the long run economic growth can be accounted for by grow th in the labor force changes in the hours worked by each worker and the produc tivity output per hour of each worker over the very long run say more than 50 years into the future any economic projection might be characterized as specula tion in the nearer term however there is at least some basis for making an educated guess what the prospects are for economic growth25 in the first place the growth rate of the labor force can be estimated based on population growth trends and trends in labor force participation for the next 20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs13 years or so short of any dramatic change in immigration rates or in average retirement age labor force growth can be predicted based on the current population and its age distribu tion bey ond that labor force growth will depend not just on current numbers of youth but also on birth rates mortality rates and the chances that there will be other changes in immigration rates and retirement age increase historically variations in the growth rate of the labor force have been substantial for example from 1950 to 1960 the labor force grew at an annual rate of 11 between 1970 and 1980 it grew at an annual rate of 26 the large increase was due both to the influx of ba by boomers into the labor market and also to large rise in the labor force participation rate of women since then labor force growth has slowed to 08 rate between 2000 and 2004 for the foreseeable future labor force grow th is expected to continue to decline in large part because of the aging and re tirement of the babyboom generation the intermediate projections of the social secu rity trustees show the labor force growth rate falling to 05 by 2015 in the very long run the labor force is expected to grow at 02 rate between 2050 and 2080 othe r things being equal that would mean decline of 06 of percentage point in the rate of economic growth if workers worked more hours that woul d offset some of the effects of slower growth in the labor force but that is not likely to happen average weekly hours vary by much less than the size of the labor force and have much smaller effect on variations in output growth between 1950 and 1980 average weekly hours fell at an average annual rate of 04 after 1980 hours fell at an average annual rate of 01 there is less basis for reliably proj ecting average hours than is the case with the labor force but the social security tr ustees intermediate projection assumes that average hours do not change and have effect on projected economic growth the third factor accounting for economic growth is average labor productivity simply put average labor productivity is the quantity of output divided by the number of hours required to produce it output per hour higher productivity growth could potentially offset the lower growth rate of the labor force and keep gdp growth from slowing in order to make longrun projections of output forecasters must make some estimate of what pr oductivity growth is likely to be over the period being for ecast but the study of productivity has not advanced to the poi nt where it can be projected based on what is known now about econo mic conditions most forecasts project productivity to continue at its current trend rate of grow th as discussed below the social security trustees are notable exception the trend rate of productivity growth at any given time can be difficult to discern because it is influenced in the short run by the business cycle this makes it difficult to tell whether change in the rate of productivity gr owth is temporary or indicative of change in the longrun tre nd analysis of longterm trends indicates that in 1973 productivity growth slowed nd that in 1995 it

in 1995 it was some time before this was thought to be part of potentially durable shift in the longrun rate of productivity growth most economic forecasters including the congressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb underpredicted real economic growth by an average of about 2 percentage points in each of the four years after 199526 now that the acceleration in productivity has survived the end of the last expansion and seems to be continuing into the present one there is growing confidence that it will persist whether or not that confidence is misplaced only time will tell this is arguably the most important question for longterm growth projections higher productivity growth means higher real incomes which in combination with progressive income tax rates yields higher federal revenues as long as social security operates on pay asyougo basis higher productivity growth also extends the date of reckoning as fa r as the trust fund balances are concerned because the incomes of those paying social security taxes would grow more rapidly than the benefits for example if real wage growth increased from 11 to 16 it would delay trust fund insolvency for six years27 whether or not productivity growth continues at the rate it has since 1995 is critical element in the trustees projections of economic grow th over the next 75 years28 the

be even if we have 80 years of very reliable returns data on equity markets in the united states we do not really have 80 observations on demography and stock returns we have one big baby boom that has made its way through the financial markets so the effective amount of information in this case is much less than standard statistical procedures would suggest james poterba impact of population aging on financial ma rkets in developed countries federal reserve bank of kansas city economic review 20044 p 50from theoretical standpoint two co mmon presumptions might support that conclusion first at the center of most economic models of personal saving is the assumption that individuals seek to avoid substantial fluctuations in their living standards over the course of their lifetimes second is th observation that individual incomes tend to rise during the course of their working lives and then decline after retirement taken together these two considerations lead to the prediction that most people will tend to save relatively less when they are young and when they are retired and save more when they are in their peak earning years in this simple model as baby boom ers reach their peak earning and peak saving years it might be reasonable to expect an increase in the demand for financial assets but on retirement they would gra dually draw down their holdings of assets to finance consumption in order to mainta in their standard of living thus when retirements surge as the babyboom generati on ages the increased sales of financial assets might be expected to driv down their prices substantially31 figure 3 plots the proportion of the overa ll population aged 45 to 64 since 1950 also shown is the standard and poors index of 500 stock prices adjusted for inflation the

saving behavior or asset prices there are however other factors that may affect saving in addition to the desire to smooth consumption over the course of ones lifetime some may save for precautionary reasons for example in order to insure against events less predictable than the drop in income experienced at retirement to the extent that people accumulate precautionary savings if they have run of bad luck or are faced with unexpected outofpocket medical expenses those expenses need not force cut in consumption those with children may ve the additional motive of leaving bequest if these two

current levels however the growth rate of income per capita still fa lls in their projection between now and 2040 because of the decline in the workerdependent ratioas with any survey there are errors associated with these estimates the more so because of size of the age cohorts in the sample nonetheless the figures show that both net financia l assets and total net worth ri up through the group aged 55 to 59 and then drop off somewhat what may be more significant though is that the dropoff in wealth for those groups that have largely retired is not as large as might have been expected there is siza ble drop between the 60to64 and 65to69 cohorts but the increase in net worth in creases for the 70to74 age group suggests that some of that apparent dr op may be due to sampling errors these data lend support to the idea that re tirees finance their retirement in part by drawing down their wealth but the more remarkable characteristic of these data may be that the decline in wealth of the very elderly is not as great as might be expected that suggests that bequests nd precautionary saving may be as important motives to save as retirement that would make it less likely that there would be massive selloff of assets as the babyboom generation retires34 on the contrary rogers et show that the decline in the share of people under age 34 who have the highest dissaving rates more than offsets the effect on saving of the increase in the share of people over the age of 64 between now and 2040 therefore demographic factors alone assuming that future age cohor ts had the same savi ng rate as todays age cohorts would suggest that the nationa l saving rate will ri between now and 204035 the data in table 6 also hint at wealth distribution that is significantly unequal the ratio of mean to median is an indication of the degree of inequality in given distribution an increase in the sh are of total wealth held by the richest households in the distribution will increase th ratio of the mean to the median in the case of net financial assets the ratio is 6 or 7 for most of the age classes while for total net worth it is 3 or 4 that indicates that the distribution of net financial assets is more unequal than the distribution of to tal net worth part of the reason for that difference is the equalizing eff ect of including home equity wealth is more unequally distributed than income table 7 presents data from the 2001 scf showing the degree to which the distribution of wealth is concentrated the data show that those households in th top 1 of the wealth distribution account

reserve system it would seem plausible that households at the top of the distribution might not have to sell significant fraction of their assets in order to maintain their standards of living upon retirement and are motivated to save largely by factors other than the lifecycle factor the more that is the case the less reason there would be to expect large increase in sales of assets as the baby boom generation begins to retire likewise there is significant minority of households without s ubstantial financial asset holdings who would have little effect on financial markets when they retire thus far only crosssecti on data have been presente d those data indicate how saving and wealth vary by age group at single point in time but they may not be sufficient to project how individuals will behave as they move up the age distribution there may be important reasons other than age that determine how individuals approach the decision of how much to save and how much wealth to accumulate and hold over the course of their lives for example it may be that those who grew up during the great depression beginning in 1929 developed different attitude about the importance of thrift from those who make up the babyboom generation if that is true it would be unr easonable to use the behavior of the current elderly population to predict the fu ture behavior of baby boomers there is at least one reason to expect at least some asset sales as retirements increase that does not require predictions of individual behavior substantial number of workers are covered by defined be nefit pension plans defined benefit plan is one under which pension payments ar determined by such variables as age at retirement and length of employment firms that manage these pensions must maintain fund from which to pay future pension benefits as the babyboom population entered the work force and the num ber of workers covered by these plans grew the funds accumulated more and more assets as those baby

that the labor force will gr ow less rapidly slowing the growth in output as well this means that the us economy would not require the capital stock to grow as rapidly as it had previously but it is difficult to speculate what will happen to investment gr owth relative to growth in the labor supply if firms want to keep the capitallabor ratio unchanged then the growth in investment spending would

predictions about what happens to saving and investment rate s when labor force growth declines in literature survey bosworth et conclude at this stage in the research conclusions about th relative magnitude of the changes in rates of saving and investment remain very sensitive to modest changes in the research design and the data employed39 higgins for example suggests that the aging of the baby boom could cause the rate of investment to fall by more than the saving rate40 higgins argues that investment demand has cycle much like the life cycle plays role in determining saving rates but while the peak ages for saving may be in the late 40s and early 50s the peak effect on investment demand is in the 20s when workers first enter the labor force if that is the case the decline in

world demographic change federal reserve bank of kansas city economic review 20041 p 39that the optimal re sponse to demographic change is to lower rather than raise the national saving rate41 interest rates interest rates the return on financial assets will depend on the equilibrium between saving and investment42 if saving falls more than investment demand then intere st rates would rise and vice versa thus even if one were relatively certain that saving would fall as the baby boomers enter retirement one cannot say which directi on interest rates would move based on that information alone if investment stayed constant as share of gdp then saving would fall more than investment and interest rates would rise in the simple solow model where saving is constant in terest rates would fall the effect on interest rates will also depend on international capital flows in an open economy with international fl ows of both goods and capital it is not necessary that any decline in domestic saving be exactly matched by decline in domestic investment by importing savi ngs from abroad domestic investment can exceed domestic saving when the nation is net importer of saving from abroad there is corresponding gap between imports and exports of goods and services the extent to which domestic investment exceeds domestic saving determines by how much imports of goods and services exceed exports in other words when investment demand is greater than domes tic saving there is current account or trade deficit since both saving and investment demand ma fall when the baby boomers retire it is not clear whether demogr aphic change would lead to larger or smaller trade deficit international capital flows do not depend on the united states alone at the same time that the united states will be experiencing the retirement of the baby boomers other industrialized nations will be experiencing more drastic demographic shift the other g8 countri are projected to experience larger decline in the workerdependency ratio th an the united states moreover germany japan and italy are projected to experien ce an absolute decline in their populations over the next 50 years43 thus assuming foreigners respond to the lifecycle model in the same way as americans the changes in saving and investment caused by demographic change would be global in nature and not limited to the united states this means that the effects of demographic change on our interest rates and investment spending are unlikely to be canceled out by an unlimited source of international capital flows from the rest of the industrialized world it is harder to predict how much capital will flow to or from the developing world in the distant futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs24 44 for detailed

diminishing returns t hus when interest rates rise firms will reduce their capital investment until the point wh investment becomes profitable againinterest rates and thus the return on i ndividual accounts will be affected by the savingsinvestment balance but it is uncertain what effect the aging of the baby boom generation will have on saving or investment if there is decline in domestic saving it might prompt an increase in the inflow of foreign capital leaving domestic interest rates unchanged this section has considered the effects of demographic change on private saving and investment but national saving consists of both pub lic and private saving and demographic change is projected to affect public saving as well the next section explores how effect of future government budget deficits on rates of return under current policy spending on soci security medicare and medicaid is projected to rise rapidly and there is not projected to be any corresponding rise in revenues as result budget deficits are forecast to rise very rapidly to unprecedently high levels44 unless health care spending grows faster than gdp and other spending falls as share of gdp the low cost scenario cbo projects that deficits will reach 61123 of gdp by 2030 and 143345 of gdp by 205045 standard economic theory suggests that ficits this large would push up interest rates significantly until they ultimately became unsustainable and led to debt default or accelerating inflation that is because when the government borrows it must compete with private companies trying to finance capital investment out of the pool of national saving government borrowi ng increases the demand for that pool of saving and interest rates ri as result if the nation borrows from abroad in response to the budget deficits that woul d take some upward pr essure off interest rates by reducing the demands put on national saving however it is unlikely that deficits of the magnitude being discussed could be financed solely out of greater foreign borrowing in that case at least some of the effect of the deficit would be manifested in higher interest rates when interest rates rise firms cut back on capital investment because it becomes more expensive to finance they cut back to the point where the marginal product of capital ma tches the higher interest rate46 this means that the rate of return on future capital investments would be higher than it would have been if interest rates had not risen the rate of return on equities must also rise if they are to continue to be attractive to investors now that alternative investments such as bonds and physical capital are more attractive because of higher interest rates orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs25 47 in the worst case scenario where current policy was pursued until the point where the government defaulted on its debt economic c onditions would likely deteriorate to the point where equities would be expected to fall in value precipitously 48 see crs report rl30708 social security saving and the economy by brian w cashellmore directly equity returns rise because sh areholders are owners of the firm and the firm is now enjoying higher rate of re turn on its capital investments thus the longterm rate of return on equities and hence indivi dual accounts would likely rise as budget deficits rise but in the s hort run the result would be the opposite higher budget deficits would cause equity prices to fall in theoretical terms this would be because future earnings are now di scounted at higher rate and therefore discounted more heavily the shortterm d ecline in equity prices allows the firms equity to earn higher rate of return when it makes additions to the capital stock in the future this means that people holdi ng individual accounts wh interest rates rise and equity prices fall would be worse off but people who begin contributing to individual accounts after the rise in interest rates would be better off than if interest rates had not risen the social security administrations pr ojections do not allow feedback between budgetary effects and the macroeconomy and thus do not adjust for these possibilities moreover it is highly likely that policy would be changed before the worstcase scenario occurred47 in that case the effects on rates of return that current policy implies would not come to pass nevertheless it may be useful to keep the implications of current policy in mind when forecasting rates of return for two reasons first analyses of social security are based on current policy and that is the baseline by which proposed modifi cations to the program are compared if current policy is the baseline for policy analyses then an argument can be made that the implications of current policy should be incorporated in macroeconomic baseline projections second reducing future budget ary shortfalls woul d require someone to be made worse off compared to current policy either progra m beneficiaries would be made worse off by large benefit cuts or taxpayers would be made worse off by large tax increases this suggests that reducing the future fiscal imbalance would be politically difficult therefore it is not unreasonable to assume for political economy reasons that there is very real possib ility that even after policy changes budget deficits would be larger than they have been historically if so this would affect the rate of return on all assets effect of individual accounts on national saving and rates of return the previous section considered the eff ect of current policy on national saving and hence rates of return but the indi vidual accounts themselves may also affect rates of return through th same channels proponents of individual accounts claim that the existence of ias that individuals can invest in us private securities will boost economic growth and the stock market if true this would increase the resources available to the nation as whole making it easier to finance entitlement benefits for the baby boomers48 opponents point to the effects of the transition costs of setting up the ias on the budget deficit nd claim that ias w ill be detrimental tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs26 49 these positive effects on the economy are not unique to the creation of ias any policy option that reduced the budget deficit would be expected to have the same results 50 in the long run national saving would increase because all else equal the benefit offsets continuedeconomic growth and investment rates which view is accurate the method for financing the transition costs turns out to be crucial in determining the effects on the economy and the rate of return the creation of socalled carve out i ndividual accounts increases private saving by diverting part of the payr oll tax into accounts that indi viduals are required to save but that is not the end of the story the payroll taxes that would be diverted to the ias are currently financing social security and other government spending and that spending would still need to be financed after the accounts are created this is the essence of the transition costs thus i ndividual accounts can be financed in three ways by reducing government spending raising taxes or borrowing increasing the budget deficit if the transition costs are financed thr ough higher taxes or lower spending the creation of the ias would not affect the budg et deficit government saving since private saving would rise and government saving would remain the same national saving would rise and interest rates would fall as result either private investment would rise or borrowing abroad the trade deficit would fall if private investment rises economic growth and futu re living standards would rise49 the future profits of corporations would rise since national saving would ri interest rates would fall and investment would rise in that case stock prices would immediately rise to reflect that change causing the rate of return on equities to initially rise assuming firms did not respond by issuing more equity however the rate of return would eventually decline below the original level to match the decline in the user cost of capital interest rates that results from higher national saving rate from the firms perspective when the saving rate increases the cost of capital declines and the firm responds by increasing its capital investment as result its output rises the rate of return from that investment falls becau there are diminishing marginal returns to investment for the firm if the rise in national saving is in stead matched by decline in borrowing abroad then there would be change in interest rates with change in interest rates the rate of return on equities and ia holdings would not be expected to change whether higher national savi ng results in lower interest rates or lower borrowing abroad depends on how sensitive capital flows are to changes in interest rates as opposed to other factors th at determine capital flows if the transition costs are instead finan ced through borrowing the budget deficit would rise for example figure 4 illustrates the increase in the deficit decline in the surplus caused by individual accounts in the presidents commission plan 2 with 67 participation to isolate the effects of the ias it does not include the effects of unrelated benefit cuts on the deficit the rise in private saving would be completely offset by the decline in gove rnment saving and na tional saving would remain constant50 there is reason to think that the rise in private saving wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs27 50 continued would increase public saving but these offset s would be negligible as share of public saving for the first few decades after the individual accounts were created 51 this assumes private individuals react to the creation of individual accounts by not altering their private saving behavior ce the individual accounts are offset by lower social security benefits and therefore do not in crease net wealth if individuals instead react by saving less outside of social security either because they incorrectly believe their net wealth has increased or because they belie ve they will receive higher lifetime benefits because the reform package reduces social secu ritys insolvency then national saving could fallexceed the fall in government saving si nce under current proposals the ias cannot be topped up by extra voluntary c ontributions from the account owners51 in that case private investment foreign borrowi ng interest rates and economic growth would be unaffected by the creation of i ndividual accounts usu ally budget deficits reduce national saving because they finance consumption the result is different here because they are financing private saving because interest rates are not changing the rate of return on equities and earned by ias would not be expected to change source chief actuaries

same addon accounts would be financed from general revenues rather th an by diverting payroll taxe s if the general revenues used to finance the accounts were raised through higher taxes or lower government spending then national saving would rise because private saving would rise and government saving would rema in the same this would cause interest rates and the return on equities to fall if the general revenues were instead raised by increasing the budget deficit the increase in private saving would be offset by the decrease in government saving this would leave inte rest rates and rates of return unchanged effect of individual accounts on relative rates of return although borrowing to finance indivi dual accounts would have effect on aggregate saving and investment and theref ore overall interest rates it is likely to affect relative rates of return within financial markets higher government borrowing would increase the supply of us treasury securities on the market unless the demand for treasuries is infinitely elastic higher interest rate would be required for investors to be willing to hold more treasur ies as investors shift into treasuries and out of other assets the ra of return on other assets would fall leaving aggregate rates of return the same just as the greater supply of treasuries w ould affect their relative rates of return the creation of individual accounts would be expected to change relative rates of return on any private assets that could be purchased by accountholders such as equities and corporate bonds for example if the demand for equities rose stock market prices would rise th effect of higher equity pr ices on future rates of return would depend on whether or not the accounts we re deficit financed if they were then saving would simply shift from the public to the private sector and investment and economic growth would remain unchanged in that case the future profitability of corporations and their ability to pay dividends would likely remain unchanged given an increase in equity prices and an unchanged future stream of dividends the rate of return on equities would be lower this is what one would expect in any market if demand ri ses and conditions on the supply side of the market remained unc hanged again these results assume that the demand for private securities is not perfectly elastic meaning that the overall change in demand for equities does not fa ll in proportion to the increase in their price otherwise investors outside of ias could offset any change in relative rates of return by selling private securities and buying treasuries in which case current asset prices would not be aff ected by the creation of ias the social security administration does not adjust its projections to take these effects into account although they ac knowledge that the effects may not be negligible it should be noted that the precise ffects on implementing plan that would result in large demand for equities and corporate bonds on the yields of these securities is not clear this demand would likely be at least partially offset by reductions in demand for other investment mechanisms for the purpose of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs29 52 stephen goss chief actuary estimated fi nancial effects of the progressive personal account plan memorandum social security administration dec 1 2003estimates it is assumed that there will be net dynamic feedback effects on the economy or on the financial markets52 conclusion estimates of how much individual account s would earn typically assume that financial securities will earn rate of return equal to the historical average behind this assumption lies the implicit belief that the future is likely to be similar to the past this report concludes that there are economic variables that are likely to be different in the future from the past and it reports that changes in those variables would have predictable effect on rates of return it finds todays high priceearnings and pr icedividends ratio suggest that future rates of return will likely be lower dividends and earnings would have to grow unusually rapi dly in the future to avoid this outcome historically the equity premiu m that investors demand to hold equities rather than bonds has been inexplicably high this premium may be smaller in the future par ticularly since equity ownership is much more widespread and transaction fees lower than in the past this would reduce equity returns lower future economic growth rate as result of slower labor supply growth is likely to re duce corporate earnings unless capitals share of income rises continually this could reduce the rate of return on equities lower saving rate as the baby boomers finance their retirement would raise the rate of return asset prices would likely decline initially in order to achieve higher rates of return in the future this effect is likely to be smaller than popularly imagined because of precautionary and bequest motives for saving the unequal distribution of wealth and fewer young dissavers in the future at the same time saving is falling slower growing labor force would reduce investment demand loweri ng the rate of return it is uncertain which of these two eff ects would dominate or how much both could be offset by international capital flows public policy directly alters the national saving rate through the budget deficit larger budget defic its lead to higher rates of return across all assets under current policy budget deficits would become unsustainably large for that reason current policy may not be good predictor of the future however the budgetary pressureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33007crs30 facing policymakers in the future are large enough that an increase in budget deficits seems predictable outcome deficitfinanced individual accounts would leave the national saving rate unchanged while individual accounts financed through higher taxes or lower spending would rais the national saving rate the current political debate is lean ing toward individual accounts that would be deficit financed at least initially in any case the increase in national saving that could resu lt from ias would at best be small compared to future budget deficits while deficitfinanced ias would not change overall rates of return it could change relative rates of return the issuance of large additions to the public debt in order to purchase equities could alter the relative demand for those two assets raising the rate of return on us treasuries and lowering the rate of return on equities none of these results is certain on ba lance they probably point to lower rate of return in the future but some factors point in the opposite direction such as the effect of potentially higher budget deficits on the national saving rate at the least the results suggest that estimates of the earnings of ias should be presented as range of estimates rather than point estimates and the range of plausible scenarios should be wide even if timates were only base d on historical data the statistical certainty surrounding that data is much ss robust than is typi cally realized and so the range of plausible out comes is relatively wide estimates of individual account earnings can be misused to suggest that there is free lunch if they stress the high returns of equities w ithout acknowledging that ownership comes at the cost of higher ris k although investors appetite for the risk associated with equities seem s irrationally low to many economists their beliefs are notable in some contexts risk adjustment that eliminates differences in rates of return between different types of securities is the only way to make meaningful comparisons for example in social security reform proposals in which individual accounts are offset by social security benefit reductions the earnings of ias can be meaningfully compared to the benefit offsets only if the rate of return on the ia is set to the riskfree rate of return since the benefit offset is in essence risk free
