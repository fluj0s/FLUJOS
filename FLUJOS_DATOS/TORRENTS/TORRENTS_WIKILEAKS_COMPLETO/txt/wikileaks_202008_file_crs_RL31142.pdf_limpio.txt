divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31142stem cell research and patents an introduction to the issues summary the announcement by president george w bush permitting federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research on existing stem cell lines has raised several patentrelated issues both specific to this situation and part of the general formulation of patent policy the grant of patent provides the inventor exclusive rights on its practice for 20 years this is intended to encourage the additional investment necessary to further develop an idea into marketable technology concurrently patent places the concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to specific applications of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent thus the patent can and often does stimulate others to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or to meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace as with many other biotechnologies inventions pertaining to stem cells may be subject to patent protection to be afforded patent rights particular stem cell invention must be judged to consist of patentable subject matter possess utility and to be novel and nonobvious in addition an inventor must file patent application at the uspatent and trademark office that application must fully disclose and distinctly claim the stem cell invention for which protection is sought if allowed to issue the patent grants its owner the ability to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the us the patented invention the bush administration policy decision limits federal research funding to discrete number of human embryonic stem cell lines at least some of these cell lines are subject to patent protectio n scientists who wish to use federal financing to explore certain research possibilities may have few alternative s but to employ patented cell line with federal policy having arguably limited research options some attention might be paid to how patents on exploitable stem cell inventions are used by their proprietors the arrangements worked out between the public health service and the university of wisconsin through its licensing agent wicell may be instructive these and other licensing policies and practices may be especially appropriate for consideration although the original embryonic stem cell patents owned by the university of wisconsin were not developed with government support future intellectual property may arise as result of federallyfunded rd under the bush plan ownership of patents originating from research performed by institutions outside the federal research establishment but financed by the government is prescribed by pl 96517 commonly referred to as the bayhdole act the law provides small businesses and nonprofit organizations title to inventions made under federal funding grants or contracts within certain limitations if new stem cell patents are generated subject to the bayhdole act the way the provision s of the statute are applied may be of interest given the specific parameters of the bush plan it remains to be seen if the research limitations associated with stem cells will influence the government to exercise the rights conferred in ways distinct from current

situation and part of broader concerns over intellectual property this report examines the rationale behind the patent system established in the us constitution and its role in promoting innovation in all sectors of the economy the application of patent law in the area of stem cell research is also discussed however the parameters of the bush administration plan may generate additional intellectual property considerations with respect to both the private sector and the federal government to date research in this area has proceeded without federal financing thus any resulting patents reside in

economic growth and is one principal driving force for increases in our standard of living2 the patent system was created by article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution to promote new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation the grant of patent provides the inventor with means to capture returns to his invention through exclusive rights on its practice for 20 years from date of filing this is intended to encourage those often substantial investments necessary to further develop an idea and generate marketable technology at the same time the process of obtaining patent places the concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to specific applications of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace innovation typically is knowledgedriven based on the application of knowledge whether scientific technical experiential or intuitive innovation also produces new knowledge one characteristic of knowledge that underlies the patent system is that it is public good good not consumed when used patents permit novel concepts or discoveries typically costly and resource intensive to develop to become property when reduced to practice and therefore allow for control over their use patent ownership creates incentives that maximize the difference between the value of the intellectual property that is created and used and the social cost of its creation3 the patent process is designed to resolve the problem of appropriability those factors excluding firm and market structure that govern an innovators ability to capture the profits generated by an innovation4 studies demonstrate that the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in rd is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the person or organizat ion financing the work it has been estimated that the social rate of return on rd spending is over twice that of the rate of return to the inventor5 without the protection provided by patents ideas may be easily imitated the knowledge associated with an

scope columbia law review may 1990 908dispersed and adapted to other products and processes that in turn stimulate growth in the economy the difficulty in securing sufficient returns to spending on research and development has been associated with underinvestment in such activities if discoveries were universally available without the means for the inventor to realize return on investments there would result much lower and indeed suboptimal level of innovation6 while research is often important to innovation studies have shown that it often constitutes only 25 of the cost of commercializing new technology or technique thus requiring the expenditure of substantial amount of additional resources to bring most products or processes to the marketplace the grant of patent provides the inventor with means to capture the returns to his invention through exclusive rights on its practice that is intended to encourage those investments necessary to further develop an idea and generate marketable technology the patent system thus has dual policy goals providing incentives for inventors to invent and encouraging inventors to disclose technical information7 disclosure requirements are factors in achieving balance between current and future innovation through the patent process as are limitations on scope novelty mandates and nonobviousness considerati ons as discussed below8 they give rise to an environment of competitiveness with multiple sources of innovation viewed by some experts as the basis for technological progress this is important because as robert merges boston university and richard nelson columbia university found in their studies when only few organizations controlled the development of technology technical advance appeared sluggish9 not everyone agrees that the patent system is particularly effective means to stimulate innovation it has been argued that patents do not work in reality as well as in theory because they do not confer perfect appropriability in other words they allow the inventor to obtain larger portion of the returns on his investment but do not permit him to capture all the benefits patents can be circumvented and infringement cannot always be proven thus patents are not the only way nor necessarily the most efficient means for the inventor to protect the benefits generated by his efforts study by yale universitys richard levin and his colleagues concluded that lead time learning curve advantages eg familiarity with the science and technology under consideration and salesservice activities were typically more important in exploiting appropriability than were patents that was true for both products and processes however patents were found to be better at protecting the former than the latter

is more difficult to identify the procedures related to process other means of appropriation are seen as preferable to patents with their attendant disclosure requirements10 the utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemical industries that may reflect the nature of rd performed in these sectors where the resulting patents are more detailed in their claims and therefore easier to defend11 in contrast one study found that in the aircraft and semiconductor industries patents are not the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments instead lead time and the strength of the learning curve were determined to be more important12 the degree to which industry perceives patents as effective has been characterized as positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents13 in certain industries patents significantly raise the costs incurred by nonpatent holders wishing to use the idea or invent around the patent an estimated 40 in the pharmaceutical sector 30 for major new chemical products and 25 for typical chemical goods and are thus viewed as important however in other industries patents have much smaller impact on the costs associated with imitation eg in the 715 range for electronics and may be considered less successful in protecting resource investments14 despite questions as to their efficacy firms continue to patent their inventions in the united states the number of filed patent applications and issued patents continues to

technolo gies may indicate the value that companies assign to such protection even in industries when the life cycle of the invention is short17 according to suzanne scotchmer university of california berkeley the innovators incentives to patent depend on i the profitability of marketing the first technology prior to the development of second generation products ii the extent of disclosure that patenting entails iii the ease with which the technology could be reverseengineered if marketed but not patented and iv the breadth of patent protection18 patent law pertaining to stem cell lines as with many other biotechnologies inventions pertaining to stem cells may be subject to patent protection19 to be afforded patent rights particular stem cell invention must be judged to consist of patentable subject matter possess utility and to be novel and nonobvious in addition an inventor must file patent application at the united states patent and trademark office uspto that application must fully disclose and distinctly claim the stem cell invention for which protection is sought this report reviews each of these requirements in turn many stem cell inventions may be judged patentable subject matter under us law under the patent act of 1952 patents may be granted for any process machine manufacture or composition of matter20 stem cell inventions would typically be classified as either composition of matter such as purified suspension of stem cells or as process such as method of preparing or using stem cell products that stem cell inventions are derived from living beings does not necessarily bar their patentability although patent will not be granted for inventions that merely duplicate materials found in nature an inventor may obtain patent for an artificially modified biotechnological product21 inventions that require the isolation and purification of stem cell line have been judged to involve sufficient transformation of raw materials to be

differ from public domain knowledge26 to fulfill the nonobviousness requirement the invention can not be within the capabilities of person of ordinary skill in the art27 because particular stem cell inventions may not precisely duplicate what exists in nature or had been artificially generated by earlier biotechnicians stem cell inventions may fulfill the novelty requirement similarly the identification isolation and purification of stem cell inventions often involves the exercise of considerable skill by highly trained scientists28 as result particular stem cell inventions may also meet the nonobviousness requirement finally the utility requirement mandates that inventors patent tangible products capable of providing an immediate benefit29 according to the united states supreme court the utility requirement enforces the principal that patents are granted for downstream applied technology rather than more abstract upstream knowledge30 otherwise the court explained patents would impede rather than advance subsequent technological progress31 whether stem cell inventions should be considered to possess utility within the meaning of the patent law has been subject to some debate stem cell lines potentially possess widespread laboratory uses and have sometimes been labeled research tools32 some commentators believe that scientists who wish to use certain research tools

research tools similar to other sorts of inventions34 under guidelines issued by the uspto so long as single utility is identified for an invention for which patent is sought the utility requirement will be considered satisfied patent applicants must disclose specific substantial and credible utility for their inventions unless such utility is already wellestablished35 to fulfill the standard set out by the ustpo guidelines an inventor must identify particular real world use to which the subject matter claimed can be put as compared to general statement of the use of the invention or mere statement that the invention can be used to conduct further scientific investigation in the context of stem cell inventions inventors have sometimes asserted that particular stem cell lines have

must commence litigation in the federal courts in addition to arguing that they do not practice the patented invention accused infringers may defend on the ground that the patent was improvidently granted by the uspto and is therefore invalid issued patents are presumed to be valid however and the burden lies upon the accused infringer to demonstrate that the patented invention lacks utility would have been obvious or another ground for defeating the patent42 the maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed43 patentee may license others to practice the patented invention patent license essentially consists of promise by the patentee not to sue the licensee for infringement44 in addition to the payment of royalties licensees often make additional promises in exchange for the license one such promise is sometimes referred to as reachthrough agreement under reachthrough agreement the licensee promises to provide the patentee with rights in future discoveries made by the licensee these rights range from the payment of royalties the grant of license back to the original patentee or even the requirement that licensees obtain approval of the patentee before passing on or commercializing new discoveries45 some commentators believe that reachthrough agreements do not serve valid social policies particularly when the licensed patent concerns research tool46 according to these accounts reachthrough agreements lessen the incentive to complete downstream research and may discourage the very innovation that intellectual property is intended to promote47 in addition reachthrough agreements may allow patentees to leverage their proprietary positions in upstream research tools into broad veto right over downstream research and product development48 other observers suggest that reachthrough agreements present an effective price discrimination and metering tool allowing the patentee to charge low base price while charging higher prices only to licensees whose research is successful49 number of issued us patents concern stem cell inventions through august 28 2001 total of 168 us patents with the

appear to associated with adult or cord blood stem cell inventions rather than the embryonic stem cells covered by the bush administration plan because the uspto maintains many pending patent applications in secret until they are issued as granted patents50 the number of filed patent applications concerning stem cell inventions is uncertain the correspondence between these patents and patent applicat ions on one hand and stem cell lines for which federal research grants for embryonic stem cell research may be obtained on the other has not been determined several patents pertaining to an embryonic stem cell invention on research performed by dr james thomson have been the subject of discussion in both the lay and scientific press51 these patents held by foundation associated with the university of wisconsin claim both method of isolating stem cells and the resulting stem cell line some observers reportedly believe that the wisconsin patents have an extremely broad scope in that they cover basic tools and techniques of embryonic stem cell research under this view even those who obtain patents on subsequent improvements may be subject to the dominating wisconsin patent in assessing this argument it is important to understand that an inventor who obtains patent remains subject to other laws and property rights including the patents of others to use simple example suppose that inventor invents and obtains patent on chair inventor b later invents and obtains patent on rocking chair because rocking chair incorporates an ordinary chair into its design inventor b would be unable to manufacture rocking chairs without infringing inventor as patent in these circumstances the chair patent is often termed basic or dominant patent while the rocking chair patent is termed an improvement or subordinate patent similarly according to some observers the wisconsin patent covers such fundamental stem cell tools and methods that it would dominate subsequent improvement patents52 when considering the scope of protection offered by basic or dominant patent it is important to note that the proprietary rights associated with particular patent are generally speaking only as broad as the technical information disclosed within that patent instrument even though particular patent may be worded broadly the patent is effective to the extent that its claims are supported by technical disclosure that enables others to practice the patented invention applying this principle to the present circumstances some observers have noted that the wisconsin patents appear to have broadly worded claims to fundamental inventions such as the process of isolating stem cells and the resulting stem cell lines however if other scientists invented new methods of isolating stem cell lines that are sufficientlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31142crs10 53the memorandum of understanding is available at the nih office of technology transfer web site at httpwwwnihgov different from those

health and human services signed memorandum of understanding mou with wicell research institute inc the licensing agent of the university of wisconsin regarding the use of certain technologies and materials covered by the wisconsin patents53 the mou generally parallels the standard uniform biological material transfer agreement used by nih since 1995 it permits public health service employees particularly nih scientists to utilize the university of wisconsin embryonic stem cell materials covered by the universitys patents for research purposes that meet the relevant criteria for such work any new intellectual property arising from this intramural research is to be the property of the public health servicenih while there is expressed statement regarding retention of patent rights the contract does not negate federal patent law that provides the inventor in this case the nih the rights to any intellectual property generated the memorandum does not deny the nih publication rights so therefore by implication the phs is free to publish the results of research using wisconsin materials covered by the universitys patent the memorandum of understanding makes it clear that the use of university of wisconsin materials are for research purposes only any future commercial activity is not covered by this document however it acknowledges that the results of federallyfunded research may lead to products for the marketplace separate contract with wicell must be entered into regarding use of any wisconsin materials for commercial purposes the parties anticipate that any future agreement for commercial activities will be similar to existing commercial licenses with wicell it should be noted that commercial licenses often use reachthrough provisions although this has not been verified in the case of of wicell while the memorandum covers research performed by nih scientists it also indicates that wicell agrees to make parallel agreements containing the same provisions with other research institutions receiving federal funding while these have not been executed to date it may be presumed that the university or other nonprofit research organization would keep any new intellectual property rights as the public health service does under the current mou however any activities to commercialize these patents are expected to require separate commercialization agreement

research performed by institutions outside the federal research establishment but financed by the government is prescribed by pl 96517 amendments to the patent and trademark act this law commonly referred to as the bayhdole act after its two main sponsors former senators birch bayh and robert dole provides small businesses and nonprofit organizations title to inventions made under federal funding grants or contracts within certain limitations55 the bayhdole act evolved out of congressional interest in developing uniform federal patent policy to promote the utilization of inventions made with the support of the federal research establishment56 such action was deemed necessary because at the time the legislation was under consideration only 5 of federally owned patents were being used while there were possibly several reasons for such low level of utilization including market applications this was thought by many to be one consequence of the practice by most agencies of taking title to all inventions made with government funding while only permitting the nonexclusive licensing of contractor inventions57 without title to inventions or at least exclusive licenses companies may be less likely to engage in and fund the additional rd necessary to bring an idea to the marketplace the legislation by providing universities nonprofit institutions and small businesse s with ownership of patents arising from federally funded rd offers an incentive for cooperative work and commercial application royalties derived from intellectual property rights provides the academic community an alternative way to support further research and the business sector means to obtain return on their financial contribution to the endeavor in enacting pl 96517 the congress accepted the proposition that vesting title in contractor will encourage commercialization and that this should be used to foster innovation in specific segments of the economy as stated in the law it is the policy and objective of the congress to use the patent system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federallysupported research and development to promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations including universities to promote the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the united states by united states industry and

economic growth were seen by congress as balance for the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantage to any recipient each nonprofit organization including universities or small business is permitted to elect within reasonable time frame to retain title to any subject invention made as result of rd funded by the federal government except under exceptional circumstances when it is determined by the agency that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of this chapter59 the owner of the intellectual property must commit to commercialization of the patent within predetermined time frame agreed to by the supporting agency and the performing organization as stated in the house report to accompany the bill hr 6933 the legislation establishes presumption emphasis added that ownership of all patent rights in government funded research will vest in any contractor who is nonprofit research institution or small business certain rights are reserved for the government to protect the public interest the government retains nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world the government also retains marchin rights that enable the federal agency to require the contractor whether he owns title or has an exclusive license to grant nonexclusive partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to responsible applican t or applicants with due compensation or to grant license itself under certain circumstances the special situation necessary to trigger marchin rights involves determination that the contractor has not made efforts to commercialize within an agreed upon time frame or that the action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs that are not being met by the contractor 15 usc 203 the bayhdole act also addresses the licensing of inventions to which the government retained title typically because of past agency practices or because of public interest title 35 usc 209 proscribes the licensing of this type of invention except under certain conditions the law permits federal departments to offer nonexclusive exclusive or partially exclusive licenses under certain conditions and with specific rights retained by the government these include the right to terminate the license if commercialization is not pursued as provided in the business plan or if the government needs the license for public use the agencies are required to inform the public about the availability of patent for licensing in providing licenses small businesses are given preferences and licensees must agree that any

237issues and observations the policy articulated by the bush administration limits federal research funding to discrete number of human embryonic stem cell lines at least some of these cell lines are subject to patent protection scientists who wish to use federal financing to explore certain research possibilities thus may have few alternatives but to employ patented cell line with federal policy arguably limiting research options some attention might be paid to how patents on exploitable stem cell inventions are used by their proprietors licensing policies and practices may be especially appropriate for consideration one possible option is an examination of the propriety of reachthrough agreements according to opponents of reachthrough agreements owners of patents on fundamental biotechnological research tools could use their proprietary position to influence or hold back competing innovations resulting from stem cell research the persistence of this commentary suggests that the use of reachthrough agreements in the biotechnology industry might be subject to review if reachthrough agreements were viewed unfavorably legislative options include declaring such agreements unenforceable or calling for their scrutiny by the relevant antitrust and competition authorities another approach would be to consider the possibility of an award of compulsory license on patents for embryonic stem cell inventions compulsory license allows competitor of the patent owner to use the patented invention without the patent owners permission60 although compulsory licenses have played only minor role in the united states patent system61 many foreign patent statutes include such provisions62 these statutes typically require an interested party formally to request the compulsory license from the foreign government competent authorities then decide whether to grant the license as well as the terms of any granted license grounds for granting compulsory license include the abusive exercise of patent rights lack of domestic manufacture of the patented product commercialization of the patented good that does not satisfy the needs of the local market and national emergencies63 while some accounts suggest that formal compulsory licensing proceedings are commenced only infrequently the mere existence of compulsory licensing statute may do much to encourage bargaining between patentees and wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31142crs14 64sarah boseley opinion pharmaceuticals move their battleground to brazil to stem the tide of cheaper drugs irish times 20

noted that world trade organization agreement s to which the united states has acceded to some degree restrict the ability of signatories to enact laws authorizing compulsory license awards65 from broader perspective the issue of whether living organisms are merely unpatentable products of nature or whether ethical or policy considerations should bar their patenting continues to command public attention two principal issues have arisen regarding biotechnology patenting first observers have fundamentally questioned whether patents should be granted for living inventions genetic materials and other biotechnologies ethical issues and concerns over genetic diversity animate many of these objections supporters of biotechnology patenting counter that trade secret protection is less attractive social alternative observe that patents have long been granted for biotechnologies and question whether the patent law is the appropriate vehicle for technology assessment commentators have also differed over the extent to which an inventor must show specific practical use for biotechnology in order to be awarded patent some observers favor strict view of the utility requirement due to concerns over overlapping upstream patents that discourage research and commercialization others believe that the utility requirement should be applied leniently stating that strict view of utility will only lead to industry concentration and that biotechnology research tools cannot be meaningfully distinguished from other sorts of inventions at this point it is unclear if federal research will generate new embryonic stem cell patents subject to the bayhdole act if so the way the provisions of the statute are applied may be of interest given the specific parameters of the bush plan under these research limitations might the government exercise the rights conferred in way different from current practice will the government use its license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world to expand access for scientists might the research constraints create situation where the government utilizes marchin rights although to date they have not been invoked the bayhdole act is intended to provide ownership of intellectual property derived from government funding in return for the commercialization of the results of this work however as the environment within which rd and innovation are performed changes and given the specifics of the bush plan relating to embryonic stem cell research new issues may have to be addressed disputes have arisen over competing claims to intellectual property developed under governmentindustry ventures concerns have been expressed regarding the rights of companies to set prices on pharmaceuticals and therapeutics that were developed in part with federal funding or in collaboration with federal agencies problems have been encountered in obtaining technologies for research use by federal laboratories because ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31142crs15 apprehensions over diminished effectiveness of intellectual property if new applications are discovered as these and other related
