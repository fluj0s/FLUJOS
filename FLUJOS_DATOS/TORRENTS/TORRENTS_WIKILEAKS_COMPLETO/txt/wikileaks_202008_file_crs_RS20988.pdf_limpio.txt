refundability of the credit is calculated finally the 2001 act allows the child tax cr edit to be taken in full against both an individuals regular and alternative minimum tax the egtrra tax cuts are scheduled to expire at the end of calendar year 2010 in the 107th congress the house passed several bills that would have extended the egtrra tax cuts beyond 2010 th senate did not adopt these bills it is likely that the 108th congress will revisit the issue of making the egtrra tax cuts permanent additionally in response to continued sl uggish economic performance president bush unveiled new tax stimulus plan in early january 2003 as part of his stimulus plan president bush has proposed accelera ting the phasein of some of the egtrra tax cut provisions the presidents proposal includes increasing the child tax credit to 1000 effective in 2003 the treasury depar tment estimates that the 10year revenue cost of these change would be 91 billion this report will be updated as legislation action warrants background the child tax credit was initially enacted as part of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 congress passed the credit because it believed that the tax structure did not adequately reflect familys reduced ability to pay taxes as family size increased the decline in the real value of the personal exemption over time was cited as evidence of the tax systems failure to reflect familys abilitytopay congress believed that the child tax credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20988crs2 1 us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of ta x legislation enacted in 1997 december 1997 2 refundable tax credit means that even if you do not owe any federal income taxes you are still entitled to the credit within certain limits for example in tax year 2000 taxpayer with three qualifying children 26350 of income and filing joint return would have had federal income tax liability before any tax credits of 750 the taxpayer would have been entitled to an earned income tax credit of 1011 and child tax credits of 1500 if the taxpayer paid 2016 of social security taxes then the taxpayers social secu rity taxes and income taxes combined would have equaled 2766 and would have exceeded the taxpayers earned income tax credit by 1755 hence the 1500 in child tax credits would have been fully refundable for this taxpayer even though he would have paid income taxes would reduce families tax liab ilities would better recognize the financial responsibilities of child rearing and would promote family values1 for tax year 1998 families with qualifying children were allowed credit against their federal income tax of 400 for each qua lifying child for tax years after 1998 the credit increased to 500 per qualifying child when first enacted the child tax credit was refundable only fo r families with three or more qualifying children the maximum refundable child tax cr edit was limited to the extent that the taxpayers social security taxes and income taxes exceeded the taxpayers earned income tax credit2 the 2001 act the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation ac t of 2001 hr 1836 was approved by both chambers of congress on may 26 2001 and signed by president george w bush on june 7 2001 pl 10716 the ac t made three major changes to the child tax credit first the act gradually increases th child tax credit to 1000 between 2001 and 2010 for calendar years 2001 through 2004 the credit will be 600 for calendar years 2005 through 2008 the credit will be 700 for calendar year 2009 the credit will be 800 and for calendar year 2010 the credit will be 1000 second the 2001 act makes the credit ref undable for all familie s under prior law the credit was refundable only for families with three or mo re children and changes how the refundability of the credit is calculated under the 2001 act for families with less than three qualifying children the maximum refundable credit cannot exceed 10 of taxpayers earned income in excess of 10000 for instance in 2001 if taxp ayer had 17000 of earned income and one qualifying child then the taxpayer would r eceive refund of the full amount of the child tax credit of 600 this is because the ta xpayers earned income in excess of 10000 is 7000 and 10 of this amount is 700 which is equal to or greater than the 600 credit for families with three or more children the maximum refundable child tax credit is limited to the extent that the taxpayers social security taxes and income taxes exceedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20988crs3 the taxpayers earned income tax credit the same rules as prior law or to the extent of 10 of their earned income in excess of 10000 in these cases the taxpayer can use whichever method results in the largest re fundable credit for which the taxpayer is eligible for calendar years 2005 and later the applicable pe rcentage is raised to 15 the 10000 threshold is indexed for inflation starting in 2002 the acts third major change would permanently allow the child tax credit to offset taxpayers alternative minimum tax amt liability the interaction of the child tax credit and the individual amt has b een an area of growing concern usually personal tax credits ar limited in that they cannot be used to reduce regular income tax liability below an individuals amt for example consider the case where taxpayer has regular inco tax liability before credits of 600 is eligible for 600 child tax credit and has an amt liability of 350 under prior fede ral income tax rules the taxpayer would be allowed to use only 250 of the child tax credit to reduce his regular income tax to 350 the sa but lower than the amt under the 2001 act the taxpayer will be allowed to apply the full amount of the child tax credit against both his regular inco tax and his amt using the example above the taxpayer would ta ke the full 600 child tax cr edit and hence eliminate all of his income tax liability the joint committee on taxation has estimated that these changes to the child tax credit will reduce federal re venue by 614 billion over the fiscal year period 2001 through 2006 and 171 billion over the fiscal year period 2001 through 2011 the total cost of the child tax credit including the 2001 act modifications will approach 173 billion over the fiscal year period 2001 through 2006 however all of the changes in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001including the increase in the child tax credit will expire sunset after 2010 congress included the sunset in egtrra to void byrd rule violation in the senate the byrd rule prohibits extraneous matter in reconciliation legisla tion under the rule extraneous matter includes among other thin gs language that would cause an increase the budget deficit or reduce budget surpluses in fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation legislation as result of the byrd rule egtrra contained language providing for the expiration of all of its provisions at the end of calendar year 2010 other child tax credit provisions the 2001 act did not change the prior law provision regarding who qualifies for the child tax credit or the provision that phase s out the credit for upperincome taxpayers to qualify for the credit the child must be an individual for whom the taxpayer can claim dependency exemption that mean s the child must be the daughter grandson granddaughter stepson stepdaughter or an eligible foster child of the taxpayer the child must be under the age of 17 at th close of the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins
