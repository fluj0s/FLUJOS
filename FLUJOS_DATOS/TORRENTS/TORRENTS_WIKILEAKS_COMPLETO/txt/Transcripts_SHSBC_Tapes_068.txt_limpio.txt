shsbc 68 problems intensive lecture given on 10 october 1961 what is the date here the 10th of audience tenth of october tenth of october 1961 special briefing course saint hill now supposing supposing just for fun supposing that dianetics and scientology did everything they were supposed to do supposing dianetics and scientology did everything they were supposed to do supposing that was fact and supposing this was all perfectly true and when you got processed why all of these problems would resolve everything would straighten out and there was vast difficulty of any kind and this was the answer and man hadnt had the answer before but now weve got the answer now supposing all that were absolutely true now just moment now supposing that were all true completely true and that was totally factual and that was it got that now just supposing that were all perfectly true what would your problem have been before you came into it what would your problem have been before you came into it just before you came into dianetics and scientology what would have been your personal problem in existence can you answer that question hmhm is this new look have you just suddenly realized something hm have you have you just suddenly realized that there was problem there immediately before you came into dianetics and scientology do you get somatic at the same time all right now lets sort it out again was that really the problem you had was that really the problem you had has that problem been carrying along since audience yes all right now ive just been giving you the approach you should use on pe that is the approach you should use on pe supposing dianetics and scientology were everything that they were supposed to be and you can go on of course ad infinitum and add it all up and theres one old bulletin i wrote about year ago or something like that that give all of its firsts what is scientology and that gives tremendous number of firsts that scientology had for the first time this for the first time that supposing all this were true and then you ask the people after you had carried on this way for about half an hour and described scientology to them completely and give them the broadest possible description of it then ask them what would their problem be that would make them come to this now of course youre oldtimers youve been processed long time most of these things are dead and gone and long buried but not with group youll get on pe it will take their heads off and that should be the first lecture given on pe course i got that taped take it from that is piece of technology not piece of propaganda nor administration why what exactly are you doing what exactly are you doing you re giving them stable datum youre punching it in youre making conditional stable datum and then if you carried it on that this was very desirable stable datum if it were true and if it existed you keep adding that in this is very desirable stable datum you of course have restimulated that basic problem of continued longtime worry and agony up to point where its ready to blow their heads off and then you ask them what was your problem why did you come to scientology what problem do you have that has driven you to this now every other group in the history of man would at once conceal this tremendous mechanism because it would hold group together endlessly just because theyre pressured in if they never gave them the answer if they never had anything out of it they would be pushed together by the duress they would be told all the time that this was it and this was the exact thing and so forth and there they were and it would restimulate that problem if processing or something of that sort was not adequate to relieve it but we are rich in technology and we have little more nerve than that so you could actually ask them the first crack out of the box lot of them there for the first time you could ask them just bang what is the problem that would cause you to accept this what problem do you have in your personal life that would bring you to us well of course youve keyed it in only they havent noticed it being keyed in and when you ask them of course the problem is just staring them in the face and on certain percentage of these people you will produce fundamental and startling change in case just like that bang youll turn on somatics on them in many instances but they will be happy to have them because theyll say oh is that what that is oh is that what this is all about and they will have personal recognition now you can go on and describe to them what processing is how problems are relieved that sort of thing and go ahead just from that point of view you could send them into coaudit or into the hgc and it would be better actually to send them to the hgc than into coaudit its always better in spite of the fact that they can fool around for long time in coaudit unless youve got coaudit running that is going to do something about problems and if were going to use that kind of an approach then we had better doctor up the coaudit so it takes care of that exact situation were not dealing with what the coaudit would do about this were dealing actually with what class ii auditor would do about this class ii auditor we have new series of classifications class i auditor is simply an auditor who runs anything and that class i exists for just two purposes first and foremost it lets an oldtimer who has stable datum that process will work actually do auditing for you without training so as to give him an opportunity to get trained while he audits that is an administrative problem in hgcs and is an administrative problem in any clinic or any center you have that basic administrative problem you have people around and instead of training them for nineteen weeks or something like this before they do speck of auditing for you you give them something on which they have reality and let them go ahead because they will win with it and they will get some wins and itll be passable show and this gives you an opportunity at the same time to train these auditors up to class ii and were talking now about really class ii ive just given you the key question disguised as pe question that will take apart any case providing you go at it right and there is new rundown which you will see very shortly its just like preclear assessment sheet and it has two new sections on the end of the preclear assessment sheet now you know that anybody can do preclear assessment sheet anybody can do preclear assessment sheet you can sit there and ask these questions and fill out these forms and you can get the data from the pc and there it is do you agree with that thats fairly easy thing to do audience hmmm yeah all right now what if you had process which added section on top of that which asked them simply some more similar questions and got you list of things and then you had new section on top of that which you just filled in as you process the exact processes given in that new section that would be very easy thing to handle theres your section and that asks certain series of things and asks for certain series of circumstances and you get you just write down this new series of circumstances from the pc and then when youve got those you read them off to the pc and notice the needle reaction of the emeter for each one and you take your steepest or most reactive needle reaction you dont do it by elimination you just read it off and you say well it fell off the pin or wobbled more than otherwise you just take that one and then with that datum which youve gotten out of the section we move over into the p section and in that section we take that one datum and we just do this and then we write down we have done that and we do this and we have written down we do that and then we process this exact process for while and then we write down that the tone arm isnt moving anymore on this process and then we do this and then we do the next and we write down each time weve done one of these things and we come down to the end of it now that is one p section and the p sections are interchangeable i mean theyre additional so we take the same form that weve got now including the section and we do this assessment again down through the section and we get the biggest read we get this time and we move over and do whole new p section and we finish that whole new p section and so forth we lay that aside we go back to the section and we go down the whole list of the section and then we write down what was the steepest reaction now we take that one and we move over into the p section and we do it down the same form of the p section we just keep doing this that is class ii action and that is very easy one to do it includes the rudiments problems process and it includes security check on the people in the prior confusion now ill give you the modus operandi by which this is done section simply asks for changes in the persons life it asks for them specifically times their life changed and it makes list of each one of these things whether that life changed because of death or graduation or anything else we dont care we just write down this particular point of change and now because the pc has not noticed the most significant points of change if he has its all right but if he hasnt its all right weve got series of new questions when did you take up certain diet when did you join certain religious group when did you decide you had better go back to church and go back to church you get all this type of question we fill out whole bunch of these questions and theyre all what theyre all major change points in persons life heres the sleeper each one of these change points must be eventually taken up in the p section because the p section asks after the assessment is done for the problem which they had immediately before the change and you knock their heads off that is the prior problem combined with the prior confusion and the two things are deadly you find each time they had problem just before that change and that the change was solution to the problem and therefore the problem has been hung up ever since because they solved it that is the sleeper and of course just before that problem there was hell of confusion so youre going to take up the problem now lets see how this would be done section we ask them this long list of changes its just very simple its when did your life change you see and well they say well life changed pretty much after i got out of that prep school good prep school when was that well i guess that was in uh oh well that was in 1942 that was in 1932 that was in 1952 uh that was in urn its sometime in the past well you dont ask the auditor to date it particularly all you want is an approximate date thats why im giving you this lecture is to give you the gen on how to run one of these forms and ill tell you why in minute the date can be very very approximate it can be ten years ago or anything we dont care see and well say all right when was another change in your life well when my mother uh ran off with the iceman that that was big change in my life or whatever it was see well so we write down you know mother ran off with the iceman about when was that well i guess that must have been about fifteen twenty thirty forty i dont know twentyfive six eight fifteen i was small child at the time uh i was small child at the time and im soandso now and so on and i must have been about i was either five or fifteen or something like that because all of these things youre asking for stuff that is floating on the time track so you dont care about the accurate date you just get him to make statement on it you just get him to make statement you put down well it was twenty years ago something like that see and you keep getting these changes now these other changes have missed him usually but every time he took up diet fad changed his clothes all of sudden changed his methods of living in some fashion you get all those as changes in his life too and you actually will have by the time you finish an section most of the changes in the life now of course its going to occur later on hes going to remember new changes in his life and its moot question whether you bother to add those onto the section of this particular questionnaire or not we dont care whether you add these new changes on or not youll wind up with lot of changes and theyll be the most significant changes in the fellows life and youll hit it this you see is not very precision activity is it you got to ask questions and you got to get the answers to the questions the truth of the matter is pc is going to kick the bucket because you miss in other words this is very safe activity so this is safe activity and that would be very happy day for the director of processing in any organization to have safe activity see that compares tremendously different than routine 3 routine 3 is not safe activity at all you get the wrong goal and the wrong terminal and you run it and youve had it oh you can patch the case up and hang it back together again with sticky plaster but this is very precision activity routine 3 well were talking about routine 2 so weve got an imprecise activity what i have discovered actually just as side comment here is an imprecise activity that will change the living daylights out of case im not exaggerating now you run this and youll see and it can be done rather imprecisely and it can be done rather skimpily and they can forget to flatten things and they can do other goofs and they can have the rudiments out and other things can happen you see and theyre still going to get results so thats good thing to have around isnt it all right you see youve defeated down here now anyway heres this long list of changes now just reading off these changes all right your mother ran away with the iceman and so forth and later on and you joined the holy rollers of god help us and this and that and you just read each one of these changes youve written down and youve written it down in his language and he can spot it thats the thing its just communication that he can spot and you read your needle reaction you put your needle reaction down but youre doing the p section you see by the time you do this and you get the needle reaction and then its number so and youll find all these changes are all numbered over here its easy so its number soandso and you write that down in the p section and you put descriptive note on it if you want to to make it very plain and now we spring the big question and its written right there in the p section on about the third line something like that and it says now say to the pc what problem did you have immediately before that change now you think im being sarcastic but i am not being sarcastic im showing you that this is an easy one to get across and im trying to ease your mind because you will be administering people doing this one you see and im trying to give you an easy mind on doing it and theyre going to have worries and im just telling you now dont have these worries ill tell you the only about the only two things they can do wrong in the test we will take those things up and theyre rather minor all right so we say now what was your problem and we get him to state the problem now this is the first thing that can go wrong is that he states fact and the auditor writes it down as problem hes got to state problem so youve got to keep him stating it if he persists in stating facts instead of problems now the difference between fact and problem is simply this problem has how or what or which it has question it has mystery connected with it it is not fait accompli fait accompli fact is this my head hurt see thats not problem its fact so you ask now you ask that change and you say what problem did you have immediately before this and he says my head hurt good you say all right now how would you state that as problem and he says well my head hurt pretty bad and you say well did you have problem about it you see and he said well also my head uh sometimes didnt hurt and you say yes well good but did you have problem around this and it finally drives home to him that youre asking for problem and he says well yes sometimes it hurt and sometimes it oh well problem yes well its when my head was going to hurt yeah and you actually have to work at this point until you get the person to state the problem as problem not as fact and youre going to find some auditors that are under training in class ii that will have rough time doing this because youll get the slips back and they will be saying on them my head hurt what is the problem and then the fellow has run an hour and half of processing on this fact you see and he couldnt fit it in because it isnt so on and its very all very complicated and he couldnt run the right process he didnt do anybody any harm but he didnt get very far either you want problem not fact all right now having gotten that it says right on the next line that what you ask is simply your problem process it gives you the wording of the rudiment for problems of course youre running what youre running present time problem of long duration naturally youre into it with crash now your next point is that youre just going to run that till the tone arm quiets down now that doesnt say how long supposing they leave it unflat oh it doesnt matter itd be nice to get nice neat workmanlike job done on it where unknown was run against the problem until the tone arm longer moved for twenty minutes that would be nice but it is not vital now it ceases to be vital after the somatic that turns up with it has disappeared it ceases to be vital but if person just backed off of it while the somatic was in high gear there possibly might be little repercussion when we first gave oh i dont know lets see is this withhold from scientologists or is it an overt to say so you know you come against that all the time would it be an overt to say it or is it withhold if you dont we gave mike pernetta the gen on how you flattened level and we said you ran it until the tone arm didnt move you see he got the tone arm into motion and then left it and that was his interpretation of it and he did that on three consecutive levels on pc im looking at right this minute i had his head and dried his ears but it didnt do any good this is what he had done so you see that can be badly interpreted even by relatively good auditor that tone arm motion on just an old point like that you know everybody knows well you run it till the motion goes out of the tone arm and it finished and so forth and youll get somebody thatll turn it square around and say oh you get the tone arm so its moving and then you knock it off i know this sounds utter idiocy but im telling you something that has happened so you have to do little police work on that point and that is the other point you have to be little bit shy about just make sure that the problem gets flattened the tone arm motion disappears on that rudiment command now youre not running that rudiment against the needle as you ordinarily would because this has directed us to do what this has found for us the present time problem of long duration which will produce hidden standards and ive just shortcut the route into hidden standards here with large wide knife so its present time problem of long duration that youre running so therefore youd better run it by the tone arm so you run the tone arm motion out of that now how long is that going to take well at conservative estimate i would say that it was two to five hours of auditing i would say it was something on that order two to five hours of auditing now you say well what happens to model session while youre doing all this and so forth well we assume that some kind of session was set up at the time they started the assessment we assume this and we assume that the next day that they start auditing that theyre going to do model session and move into it but what if they hit present time problem well youre running present time problem so you are running rudiment so nice precise job of auditing would include running the pc on this particular rundown with model session in full play yes that would be nice neat job of auditing but let tell you something it doesnt much matter if the whole rudiments and model session are omitted thats nice sloppy process isnt it i designed real sloppy one here thats real good you can make lots of mistakes with it all right now what happens when hes got the tone arm motion off of this problem now he asks it says right there the sixtydollar question what was the confusion in your life immediately before that what confusion was in your life and it does an assessment of the people in the confusion you write down then all the names of the people connected with the confusion in his life see and the idea of listing and asking for another person in the confusion of the life will keep putting the person back into the confusion and stop him skidding forward and you will wind up with list of personnel and now you security check this personnel now this of course perhaps could require little bit of acumen and alertness because youve got to sort of make up security check but at the same time there are other security checks and so on and there will exist security check that matches up to almost any person you see you know the idea what have you done to him and what have you withheld from him is about all it is now you could put in at this point run overtwithhold on that person and get some result out of the thing you actually could do just that you could run 0w rather than security check but it is much slower and it doesnt get you anywhere near as far as it should and it is running against terminal for which they have not been assessed and so it has point of danger to it it is better to security check the terminals now that question is going to come up and youre going to be asked why you just dont run ow on each one of these terminals well its because youre using terminal process on terminal that has not been assessed on the goals line and if the terminal is not on the goals line it can beef up the case the only thing you can do is security check it that wont beef up the case and all you want to get off are the withholds and you dont want the overts at all simple huh all right this is the kind of list youve got now what was the confusion immediately before that oh my god id forgotten all about it but there was an automobile accident and this and that happened and so forth and uh my father was very upset and there was terrible confusion and uh uh actually i had to pay for the car and i borrowed some money from my uncle george and then they all oh thats just terrible you say all right thats fine thats the confusion area now who did you say now your father and you write that down you see the people in the confusion it provides long list there for the people in the confusion you write down well the people in the car these were soandso and soandso and theres your father and this was soandso and soandso and this was and your mother was part of this and your sister and oh yes he says and my my my boss he was part of this too yeah so you write down boss you see and you just take this list now if you were doing very workmanlike job of course you would assess that list but again it isnt important you could just take them in order of rotation and you just get the withholds off on each one of these people with this type of question what were you withholding from your father at that time you see good well now had you done something else that you didnt dare tell your father about you see what didnt your father find out about that you see what hasnt your father ever found out about that you know just keep plugging this type thing to get the withholds off now we get the withholds off of father and that seems pretty good and then we get the withholds off of the next person and that seems pretty good and we get the withholds off the next people and that seems pretty good and it isnt done thoroughly it doesnt have to be done thoroughly its going to resolve the confusion why you got the problem off the top of it already and you can just take sort of lick and promise at the thing now itd be nice if it were done thoroughly and it would produce much better case gain and all of this and you would for sure have this thing out of the road if it were well done well but you understand that if it were done at all why its successful youll have success on every hand just doing it at all dont you see so that could be kind of sloppy too you try to get them to do it well but they do it sloppy and they still win all right so you go down the end of this list and that is the end of that p section and you put that over here and that is that now you take up the next item assessed off of the section now you assess the major changes in the persons life youve got new p section form see you assess the major changes in the persons life from the old section that you had and you write down the one which you now find produces the biggest needle action and you go through the same routine on it find out the problem that preceded it run the rudiments process on that problem find the prior confusion to that thing get list of personnel involved in that prior confusion get the withholds off from those people this is kind of kind of different security check in that its withholds from those people specifically its the notknows actually that hes run on that personnel and you got that nicely cleaned up and then you of course thats the end of that p section and you get new p section form and you go back to the old section and you do new assessment and you just run the whole thing down till you cant get any needle motion anymore on that old section and at that point we could say at that point with considerable amount of truth when we have finished up this activity we could say that the person was release we could say it just like that and we could also say with some security that the person had hidden standards and would do auditing commands all right now you could go ahead with general security checks you could go ahead with checking against any lingering chronic somatics using model session getting the rudiments in and that sort of thing and you could finish up the activities that class ii auditor could do you could do all of them but you know these things are going to be fairly functional because youve gotten the hidden standards out of the road youve gotten the basic problems of lifetime the hidden standards have been swept away by this particular packaged activity then youd go ahead now and you would assess for goal you turn him over to class iii activity the pc would have to be turned over after all the security checks anybody could dream up or any security check published anyplace had been given why that would be as far as you could take him at class ii but youve gotten quite ways youve got security checks done youve got hidden standards off youve got chronic problems of long duration off the case and that seems to like that would really be setting one up wouldnt it and the case would have an enormous reality let tell you some enormous reality can greet this particular activity because this is sneak way of finding the present time problem of long duration which ive just dreamed up for you and squared around and youll find it very functional and very workable now case that had had this done to it coming into goals terminal assessment and goals terminal run of course would run like hot butter because the only thing thats getting in your road in clearing is the hidden standard and the withhold thats all the present time problems of long duration and the hidden standards let say that and the withholds that you get off in security checks those are the only things standing in the road of people going clear and if you could handle all of those why bang that would be very profitable and it isnt just turning somebody over to an auditor because you havent any auditors that can do anything else it actually is very profitable to set case up now this would be much more profitable way of running 1a and it supplants 1a in full this is how you get the problems off case you find out this is more workable and it will work on people who have not had their goals and terminals found even better than 1a short its very fast produces high level of reality in the pc produces tremendous amount of interest the interest goes way up on this particular activity well now just look at the assessment alone lets go back over the points of improvement now look at the assessment you mean to say that somebody is going to sit there and actually have spotted for him all the changes in his life without getting case gain hed cognite hed cognite on some things because these things will start turning up you know and after he thinks hes given you all the major changes you ask him when he went on diet or something screwball like that or when he started eating special food you know and he special food yes well you know uh well ive just been doing it for so many years actually im not any vegetarian or anything like that but the doctors put on diet and i actually havent ever much exceeded it since its salt and uh so on its very mild thing but come to think about it guess i am on diet and well good heavens when was that must have been about 50 or 1935 i wasnt born yet in 1935 and all of sudden new area of track opens up so this type of assessment just keeps opening up track in this lifetime you see opening up track in this lifetime just the assessment all by itself now youve already asked him earlier than this on the straight preclear assessment form for his operations and for everything and youve noticed that that sometimes opens up track on pcs well an assessment of the major changes of persons track that certainly does and now we take these things apart because every one of them sat on top of problem and dont be surprised now here are the limitations of all of this and things you shouldnt be surprised about in doing this particular rundown dont be surprised at all if it always turns out to be the same problem before each change and if it again turns out to be the same problem what do you do now you will be asked this you will be asked this pleadingly and burningly this is the second assessment we did weve already got the personnel all hidden confused out and we got the thing flat with the rudiments process and it was flat and we had an awful time because he kept going back into spaceopera engram and we kept him out of that knucklehead urn and we guided him as well as we could and all of sudden we find this left school left prep school and he comes up with the same problem and its still alive on the meter now how about that well your proper answer to that is what came up on form of the p section what came up on that form well this problem same problem uh he had the same problem just before he left prep school all right now what is the next line on the p form well oh well i see what you mean all right so he goes back and he runs the rudiments process on the same problem again of course it has changed aspect and shifted over into greater or lesser intensity of some kind or another and hell run that thing down hell find the area of prior confusion and of course the whole of the fellows schooling opens up this time and that had all been closed in and so on and he has win everybody has win you see but itll worry people because the same problem will turn up as it will often do and itll now turn up live all over again because its got new aspect of course the joke about this is is hes had this same problem for the last hundred trillion you see so it doesnt matter it doesnt matter you just get some more running on the same problem and then get the application of that problem to this life by getting off the area of prior confusion dont you see and youre just unbaling the case and unbaling it and naturally and so forth but itll worry people you mark my words now sometimes the person is dispersed off the main problem and nothing happens with this nothing will happen i guarantee you for the first four sections that you fill out the first four p sections that are filled out theres nothing nothing really happening the person is just plugging along and find the areas of prior confusion the problems are wildly different and on the fifth one you get the problem and it almost blows their head off you get the idea so that may happen in the first one you do and it may happen in the fourth one you do and it may happen in the tenth one you do its going to happen sooner or later he will move onto this because the other problems are simply baling off the centerline problem and hell recognize that all problems are this problem and so forth and he will run it well after youve addressed this problem for quite while this problem will move out into another perimeter and he will feel freer and more in communication in this lifetime and more important than that you will have keyed out his hidden standards now let warn you about something until you have the goal and terminal of the pc all you can do with case is key it out thats all you can do with case until you have his goal and his terminal and start running them you say well then its unfair to the case ah well but this is double sort of package you can have his goal and terminal without getting off his hidden standards and problems of long duration and they wont run so you could find his goal and terminal and then go back and do this problems straightenout ive been calling it problems intensives you could straighten out all of his problems and hidden standards and so forth and then go back and run the thing or you could do the problems intensive and then assess him and then go back and do all the thing but youre going to have to in any case thats going to hang up and that is something on the order of 90 percent of the cases youll audit youre going to have to do something like this to get the present time problems of long duration and the hidden standards off the case anyhow so it doesnt matter whether you do it before the goal and terminal are found you will certainly have to do it after the goal and terminal are found if you do that first you see so it doesnt matter which side of the thing you do it on it really doesnt matter very much except that the pc cognites faster if he knows what his goal and terminal are he gets little bit more zip out of this particular activity thats about all you can say about it if you havent got the pcs goal and terminal and you arent running prehav levels on the pc all youre doing is keying things out you are keying things out now the funny part of it is that when he gets his goal and when he moves over into his terminal and when you go on down the terminal line the prehav runs and he collides with engrams as he goes down the thing this headache that he thought desperately was turned on by having left prep school this difficulty he has had with women and all of that sort of thing are suddenly found to be resident when he was telegraph operator on the mason and dixon line there they sit and its there in full and the somatics come back on in full but this time they run out somatic is where it is on the track and its place else but youve put him in shape to be able to function without the somatic for while dont you see and then when he runs into it it runs out rather easily otherwise youre always running him in the engram when he was telegraph operator on the mason and dixon line see thats the silliness of it all you cant get anyplace if you dont key it out because hes in 7762 engrams various kinds and your goals preparation keys out the hidden standards and fixes these things up and gets this life so its functioning and so forth and then youve got pc who can stay insession and then you can run him on down the track and really find where they are otherwise youre only going to run into locks anyhow and youre going to do keyout and keyout and keyout as you run with the prehav scale and so forth see youre going to do keyouts keyouts keyouts then all of sudden he goes into the engram and on class iv proposition dont be too surprised to have somebody almost clear or actually reading clear that moves over then into class iv activity and the reason they came into dianetics and scientology is because they had terrible pains in their appendectomy the pain is not in their appendix its in their appendectomy and all of sudden they find out this has nothing whatsoever to do with an appendectomy actually it wasnt that type of thing but earlier on the track they used to install meters in people at about that period of time and so on and somebodys screwdriver slipped something real goofy and it comes of right where the somatic went in the somatic will come off somatics are where they are and they are place else so this is keyout activity so that you can run pc of course he gets very happy about all this and straightens out his life to remarkable degree and you are making case gains and they are stable case gains doubt about that because itd take him another lifetime to get him keyed in this nicely again see but if you just left him at this point that is what would happen next life why hed just stack them all in again because you havent got them out at source got the idea so this is the value of it it actually sets person up to be audited and incidentally makes them much happier with life and also gives them reality on scientology now the reason you are handling hidden standards should not be hidden from you you are handling hidden standard not because the individual has his attention stuck someplace you are not running hidden standard because the individual vias auditing commands through it although that is one of the things that it does you are running hidden standard only for this reason it is an oracle every hidden standard is an oracle the pc has got an oracle now it may look to you this way the pc every session takes off his glasses and looks around the room to see if his eyesight is better well you say to yourself well that is test he is making to find out whether or not his auditing is progressing and thats what you think is going on but that is not what is going on at all his eyesight somatic knows and its the only data there is that is all the data there is observation and experience have bearing on his knowingness airplane crashes in the front yard he sees if his eyesight is worse if his eyesight is worse he knows that the airplane crashed in the yard if his eyesight isnt worse he knows it isnt there the fact that the airplane crashed in the yard hasnt anything to do with his knowingness it does not much influence his knowingness this you have to get straight hidden standard is his present time problem of highly specialized import but is in highly specialized use and when you first collide with hidden standard when you first begin to study hidden standard you think of it rather loosely you think of it as well its just specialized present time problem of long duration of some kind or another and the pc is viaing his auditing commands through this thing and he hasnt therefore got his attention on the session and therefore anything that would disturb the pc during session would be hidden standard and actually then arent the pcs hidden standards all expressed in his goals for the session and therefore isnt it true that person who is trying to find out if he is brighter or not after session is over would be operating from hidden standard and therefore isnt it true that everything the pc ever gains is basically hidden standard and isnt it true then that everything every change the pc notices in his case would be because of hidden standard you see you can get the hidden standard is longer hidden man its any change is hidden standard well thats not its definition that is not what hidden standard is by long way and you at right this present instant are labeling things hidden standards which are simply oh little bit of present time problem of long duration or goal for the session or its something else and it hasnt any real influence on the auditing see hidden standard is pretty vicious proposition it is not tiny light proposition at p11 the fellow does it every command or every session and if he does it every command every session its constant then it knows then you must assume this about the hidden standard the hidden standard is it knows and he doesnt so he has to consult it to find out but because youre not auditing him out of session you dont notice that he does this all the time in life ear burns its not true ear doesnt burn true what way to adjudicate piece of music now most music critics are pretty badly spun in but hered be music critic all right he listens to the medulla oblongata in eflat minor and he listens to this i was listening to some music critics the other day on bbc they were criticizing jazz and i thought this was very amusing because they were all sitting there and every once in while theyd talk about being sent and so forth and it didnt do something one of the fellows said you know it didnt do something and he touches his chest you know and these people werent judging music at all they were reading their own somatics the poor composer if the composer knew this he would pay less attention well lets take music critic and actually he listens to symphony orchestra or something tearing off long chunk of the overture of 1812 and afterwards he says well actually it was not bad performance but it lacked impact what does he mean now you go back over his criticism and youll find out that every time things are pretty bad they lack impact and if you the auditor were to ask him what impact he would say well here of course and then if you searched little bit further you would find out that when he heard piece of music he knew it was good if he got pressure on his chest and if it was bad he didnt get pressure on his chest so therefore he knew it was bad and this tells us hideous thing that this person actually never really hears the music he is paying attention to circuit which gives him pressure or doesnt give him pressure on his chest now youre going to teach this person all the composers in the world could hire all the symphony orchestras in the world to play all kinds of music to him loud and soft and so forth he would not notice any of this music something else is listening to the music and reacting and if it doesnt react he knows the music is good thats why you get these wild criticisms on art you know some kid has stumbled over paint pot in kindergarten and spilled it on piece of canvas and somebody has come along and put it up in an exhibition and you have number of critics then all of sudden raving about the beauty of form and rhythm and impact of this particular painting dont you see it was when they walked by it did it restimulate an engram or didnt it had nothing to do with the painting and so you get off into wild schools of bad draftsmanship bad music you get sudden popularity of somebody who goes flat on every note you know she always wears green dresses when she sings and this adds up to certain producers getting restimulation from green dresses you know and so heres this great singer and then they put her on tv you see and the eggs pour out of the television screen like mad and she gets hooper rating and they say what happened well you see her impact wasnt singing it was green dress and television is in black and white you see its as screwy as this just as crazy as that its just as far offbeat all im trying to punch home is that the persons knowingness is not result of experience the persons knowingness is as result of circuit and now youre going to prove to him that scientology works and mamie glutz is going to get well and everybody is going to get happy and everybody is going to live better lives and theyre going to make more money and that sort of thing and this character goes on and he knows it isnt working why well you see it lacks impact well what impact the impact that moves in and out against his chest of course you see how this could work now im not berating anybody who has hidden standard particularly because its too easy to knock these things out but recognize what they are theyre consultation mediums with which one knows and i think itd be highly risky thing if flying an airplane you knew you were on the right course if you had pain in your right hip and didnt have to pay bit of attention to the instruments i would say that this is the lower mockery of the great pilot who has homing in pigeon built in and actually can fly straight course and wind up in the with tremendous accuracy and so forth but he does that because hes great pilot not because hes got circuit you see anything circuit can do thetan can do and do better any knowingness which can be imparted to the person is the mechanism of throgmagog which was handed out in dianetics evolution of science you can set up an independent intelligence alongside of you that tells you right from wrong now most criminals are the product of circuits it isnt true that people who have circuits are criminals but criminal is specialized part of this now lets look at what criminal does criminal knows right from wrong because circuit is active or inactive in other words because something is restimulated or not restimulated he knows right from wrong and therefore he knows the cops are crazy because they dont agree with his circuit they say you shouldnt have stolen the car well hes got little green light that lights up and when hes doing right why the green light lights up and when hes doing wrong why the red light lights up and it happens inside of his skull and when he passed this car the green light lit up so he knew he should get in the car and drive off and that that was right and proper action and the cops pick him up and the cops tell him that wasnt right and proper action well man theyre crazy if theyre observed at all and he is very puzzled as to why hes in court you never saw more baffled people than criminals ive studied this breed of cat and found it very interesting breed of cat because its type of intelligence which isnt generally credited with being insane but it isnt there and they are very baffled they say people pretend that you can tell right from wrong talk about silly nobody can tell thats the extreme one see or yes of course i can tell right from wrong when im doing right i feel well and when im doing wrong i get terror sensation in my stomach and as long as i only do things that make feel well that is right such as murder babies and steal jewelry and if i do those things thats fine but if i become if i get job this terror sensation turns on so its wrong to work and if you went into it closely with one of these characters and had conversation of that depth and that searching type of questioning you would learn some of the most fantastic things you ever heard of well to some slight degree anybody with hidden standard you see is blood brother to this criminal thats just lie but hes doing this to some degree so the auditor says are you insession and the pc looks inside to find out if the little white bulb is burning and the white bulb is burning so he says yes im insession now did you get any result from the processing now he looks at the little white bulb and its not on so he didnt get any result from processing but what during the auditing did he do he would do the command on sort of via itd come from the auditor and then he put the command over here and something over here gives him the command and then he follows the command hes on selfaudit it knows he doesnt now this is the way people get that way first theyre thetan as themselves actually and then they become so invalidated or they invalidate people so much that they get overwhelmed with their own invalidations and they pick up valence now everybodys got valence everybodys got one of these things even people with hidden standards have valences and you can find them but the steps are two more than this there are two more steps of overwhelm the next step to the valence overwhelm is the somatic overwhelm while being the valence he got hell of somatic now an impact is easily substituted for knowingness impact knowingness these can integrate in mind as the same thing impact and punishment can also integrate they dont necessarily integrate as knowingness they sometimes only integrate as punishment so the fellow is walking down the street and something is thrown out of an airplane and wrench hits him on side of the head and after he gets out of the hospital he has definite sensation that he must have done something well the only thing he was doing was walking down the street but he got definite sensation he must have done something now the truth of the matter is he doesnt even have to go back and pick up his own overts but he must have had them to make the thing hit him but he doesnt even have to go back and pick up the overts to feel that he must have done something the fact that he was hit meant that he was being punished so the punishment must have had crime that goes with it and hes got terrible problem what has he done what has he done that caused him to be punished and he doesnt know well of course the answer is very often he hasnt done anything but he cant separate this thing out now an impact then can go into that category and people with guilt complexes which is small section by the way of mind you say everybody has guilt complex its like saying everybody has an inferiority complex it hasnt any level of truth you know at all its just taking small class of cases there are small class of cases have guilt complex there are small class of cases have inferiority complex theres small class of cases that have superiority complex theres small class of cases that have complexes that tell them they can never do anything wrong theres you know theres classes of cases but this is not broad generality at all that everybody is guilty or that aberrations comes from guilt thats hangover from old psychotherapies sometimes they ride along and youve given them credence at sometime or another and it takes shake of the head to get rid of them well now an impact can interpret as knowingness because the persons been hit he feels he now knows something youll sometimes have person coming out of an operation telling you he knows something well the odd part of it is two things can happen he can come out of an operation knowing something or he can come out of an operation feeling that he knows something in the second case he doesnt know anything for instance if you take thetan you operate on his body and he blows out of his head and during the operation he finds himself outside he will wind up later on knowing that he can exteriorize thats perfectly valid piece of information because this other thing happens so often that gets invalidated lots of patients wake up out of the ether and then now they know something only they dont know what they know see and the more they search for it the less they find out they dont know what they know but they know they know something got the idea well circuitry can get set up in more or less that fashion the person himself has been invalidated his own knowingness as valence is invalidated and so hes got an impact knowingness that he keeps around which is part of an engram the engram is actually on his goalsterminal chain thats where it comes from but it is not reachable or attainable because its right in the middle and you cant audit him down to the goalsterminal chain because hes got this thing in the road but its on the chain and you cant audit him through it or past it but you cant audit him because of it and yet unless you audit him hes not going to get rid of it this is the kind of problem one of these circuits sets up so here he is here he is with this thing and it actually his own knowingness has been terribly invalidated as circuit then he can go on being validated in his knowingness but he has to be careful because this thing knows more than he does and its somatic of some kind its pressure ridge its sensation it can be almost any one of these things its difference of light its an occlusion its singing in the head its bubbling in the beer you know doesnt matter what it is it just is and hes going to have bad luck tomorrow well actually all of roman superstition and everything else stem out of this circuitry rome had circuit called the auguries and they used to shoot down birds and gut them and theyd examine the entrails and then theyd know whether or not tomorrow was going to be lucky day well thats circuit youll find in superstitious peoples that have very little and have been knocked around very badly you have just absolute huge catalogs of superstitions youve got some superstitions yourself and so forth well this is just hangover on the third dynamic thats sort of third dynamic circuit they were looking at the moon one night on some planet way back when and it was halffull and they get restim on the thing every time they look at the moon halffull and it was halffull this particular night and couple of spaceships came in and blew up the planet so they know that halffull moon is dangerous and this kind of gets established somehow or another so you have to be careful when the moon is halffull what are you saying well the moon knows more than you do because you couldnt find out what happened but the moon obviously knows what happened because its symbol of what is happening so now the moon knows and you can set up whole moon circuit quite interesting the circuit knows the pc doesnt the circuit can observe the pc doesnt the circuit can give auditing commands and the auditor cant all kinds of these things happen now this moves out into secondary state which is the fourth state up the line and it becomes an audible dictational circuit its worst off its where the ideas come from it dictates to person it speaks it gives him his orders aloud all kinds of wild things go on with regard to it but the person never does anything unless hes told by this particular mechanism well what is this this is the total final result of valence that has been overwhelmed by somatic which has been overwhelmed in itself by some other thinkingness and youve got just continuous consecutive overwhelms now of course there can be many cases after this where these conditions are consecutively and continuously overwhelmed but they will all be of the same character they will not be more personalities they will be circuits from the acceptance of the first valence on out and thats something to know you havent got an endless number of valences on the pc but you can have nearendless number it will seem to you sometimes you can have nearendless number of hidden standards you can have lot of them on case if theyre real hidden standards now what is the test of real hidden standard its whether or not the pc consults with something each command or each session consults is the clue now you see he could look around to find out if his eyes changed but does he always look around to find if his eyes changed now the change in his eyes is not particularly the hidden standard the hidden standard lurks in the vicinity of that and it moves on and off his eyes the day is bright the day is dull this is the way life goes its going to be good day because the day is bright its going to be bad day because the light is dull theres going to be something going on like that to make that real hidden standard and then it becomes consultational circuit now that is rather mild form of one that is not particularly very bad hidden standard possibly person could even be audited through it without much trouble but now lets take this one this is how bad hidden standard can get pc sits down in the auditing chair and the hidden standard says to him says to him uh well that auditor is going to do you in today so he relays all the commands through the hidden standard because the hidden standard will give him the safe commands so he can do some commands and he cant do other commands because the hidden standard will only relay the safe commands and oh wow you havent got pc under control you havent got pc there youre not auditing pc see this is all vastly removed from the thing but these hidden standards key in with problems and areas of prior confusion and that is what kicks in hidden standard it comes in because of problem of magnitude or an area of prior confusion now ive put in the or there just in case sometime or another the guy got problem without prior confusion but the usual course of human events is that the individual went through lot of trouble and lot of confusion and he couldnt quite figure any part of it out and it left him hung with problem now hes an active cuss any thetan is fairly active thetan and he will up and solve it every time he solves that problem by changing his life in some way now this can get so bad that the effect i talked to you about the other day the effect whereby because something happened the individual felt and ive mentioned in this lecture because something occurred then the individual must have done something he didnt do anything but something occurred so some of these changes in his life are going to be red herrings that is to say there was change in his life so he figured he must have had problem ahead of it person could have change in his life without having problem before it hes got couple of very active parents that go flying around to every place and so on and they change his location rather continuously but one day they stopped moving around and he finally finds himself sitting someplace and it was change in his life because he was now in one place and you ask him for problem before this and hell almost beat his brains out trying to dream up what problem he had that caused this to occur well actually he didnt do anything to cause it at all in other words the change in that particular case is otherdetermined than by the person so there can be otherdetermined changes and they however do not assess by an emeter reaction so therefore assessment becomes necessary in doing the section of this type of problems intensive i was telling you about necessary to assess because it eliminates those changes which occurred without problem having preceded them all right so theres the one two three of the hidden standard the hidden standard develops out of problems of long duration individual solves the problem with hidden standard has solved the problem at some time or another with hidden standard and says well i just wont think anymore i will let this think for now i should say just one brief note on where does circuit come from well frankly youll find circuits first mentioned in dianetics modern science of mental health so theyre not very hard to find theyre quite obvious theyre quite visible you could go around looking and asking people about circuits youll find plenty of circuits youll find talking circuits and pressing circuits and color circuits and all kinds of things theyre howdoyouknow things this is circuitry as different than valences valence answers the question who to be or how to be right with beingness how can you be right with beingness circuit answers it entirely differently that is without changing the beingness how do you know whether youre right or not they are two different aspects circuit furnishes information valence furnishes beingness now circuit from furnishing information can step upstairs to furnishing orders and then it can step upstairs to furnishing orders and commands which are below the level of consciousness but they always express themselves to some slight degree in terms of somatic one knows theyre there if the somatic occurs most people live in haunted houses there are lot of people around will tell you there are other thetans inhabiting their body these are just circuits you will occasionally run into somebody that after he got bad shock why just thousands of voices turned in on his body in all directions or dozen or six or something and they all spoke to him and so forth and so on youll run into an experience of that character in somebody else all right circuit can be is very easy to set up and you actually think and use circuits all the time circuit isnt bad thing its only when it goes out of persons selfdeterminism is longer in the individuals control that circuit becomes bad thing person is totally knocked in the head as far as circuit is concerned he has longer any life or reason of his own only the circuit has life and reason and when circuit is in this particular condition or state of ascendancy it of course furnishes hidden standard its right or wrong according to the appearance of the circuit or according to its behavior it tells the individual right from wrong and the individual himself never differentiates never experiences has criteria and so on that is circuit in operation and this circuitry is set up by thetan very easily and is set up by him every time he turns around and is one of the easiest things that he does and there is reason he should stop doing it were only talking about the obsessive outofcontrol circuit circuits are very often completely reasonable that person sets up but hes still totally in control of the circuit he set it up and he knows it see and its gone he doesnt set it up forever well you look at look at motorcycle and you say to yourself whats wrong with the motorcycle you see and you sort of set up computer that is like motorcycle engine or something you see and you say gosh there it is and it goes this way and you kind of mock it all up and it goes this way and so on you go to bed that night you longer got the motorcycle engine in front of you you see and tesla this great character nikola tesla who invented alternating current and tremendous numbers of other things set up the alternating current motor and let it run in his head it wasnt in his head of course he probably had it out somewhere i wouldnt want an alternating current in my head motor in my head see because if he set it up right of course it was greasy but anyhow he set up an alternating current motor and he let it run for two years just to find what parts of it would wear thats right so that was kind of long time to let circuit run wasnt it well it was to tell him something wasnt it so he set up mockup in order to find out from it and theres nothing wrong with this this does not mean that nikola tesla as result had hidden standard he didnt have any hidden standard he knew he set it up and he knew he took it down and he knew when he set it up and he knew when he took it down but youll find circuits are not in this degree of control when theyre obsessive you see now the person doesnt know when he set them up he doesnt know why he set them up he doesnt know why hes listening to them he doesnt know where they came from all he knows is that he has total slavish obedience to them see that is the difference you can set up circuits thatll answer mathematical problems for you you can do all kinds of wild things with your mind you see theres nothing wrong with doing this you see as long as youre doing it if youre doing them why you cant hurt yourself any but when you start burying them and when you say im longer responsible for that thing and when you say this thing will now from hereinafter and aforesaid tell which side of all electrical circuits will go this way and that way the individual looks at house and he hears buzzbuzzbuzz this is eight lifetimes later see buzzbuzzbuzz he hears in this house and he knows theres something wrong with its currents you get an electrician sometime and you say well how did you know the house was old well i get this sensation or something i knew the wiring was off or something like this and you talk with him well how did you know that well i dont know but i always get this sensation right under my left rib you see and so on and i can kind of hear buzzbuzz and so forth its very easy to tell thats knowingness circuitry on the subject of electricity you see which he doesnt know anything about he just told you so thetan you see is totally capable of this operation of permeating the whole house and finding every short circuit in it and says zzzzzzit well that was one zzzzzzit theres another one zzzzzzzit theres another one see oh well guess well have to rewire that thetan is totally capable of doing this so therefore its one of his skills the basic on this is setting something up on automatic and taking responsibility for it at all and out of that you get trouble you always will get some trouble and it becomes hidden standard and so on but to have set one up and put it on total irresponsibility and let it run totally automatically the individual had one godawful problem just before he did it and just before he had that awful problem he was in fantastic amount of confusion and just before he got into that fantastic amount of confusion he had plenty of withholds from all of the people connected with the confusion and those conditions must have occurred and all of those conditions need to be present to unravel circuit to have circuit set up this way and youve got to pay attention to all of those things to unravel circuit all right so how would an individual get into this sort of state all right life would be pretty active and he would start withholding from everybody he was in contact with about everything or about some special thing or something like that he isnt free to communicate in any way hes withholding from here and hes withholding from there and he does an overt here and hes got withhold there and he does another overt someplace else and things start running little bit wrong naturally hes out of communication with it youre answering the first requisite of circuit going out of communication you see the individual who has circuit that tells him about house wiring never has to permeate the house well he never has to communicate with the house all he has to do is communicate with the circuit the circuit does all the communicating for him you see and he doesnt have to do anything about it all right so he had all these withholds and all these overts against all these people and life became pretty confused and it got more and more confused and it finally wound up to where this confusion added up to distinct problem whether he could state it or not is beside the point whether hes aware of it analytically at that stage of the game or not but it got to be one awful problem and its statable problem blang it went and then he had problem on his hand and then of course he solved the problem now if you got enough withholds and overts youll blow you get enough overts and withholds against any one person or any one thing or any one area youll blow out of that area or off that course of existence if theres enough all right so the individual had this awful problem and he blew he blew that particular life channel that he was on and of course this brought about change and the only tag that is uniformly left in view for the problem the confusion the people and the withholds and the lot is the change when did your life change so of course by tracking that back you can find the problem you get the problem more or less handled you find the people you get the people security checked out this individual security checked out about the people he comes off of the nervousness of the confusion which was after all yesteryear but his withholds have got him pinned in that area of time hes stopping and not communicating in that area of time so nothing asises in that area of time so hes stuck there and this of course tends to turn on circuit because its withdrawal now the point of change of course is withdrawal the point of change of life is withdrawal from his former change of life so the whole story is out of communication out of communication out of communication and then out of communication now if he wants to remain out of communication safely he has to have periscope up so that the periscope is very dangerous to approach the eyepiece of so he has to have periscope that not only looks but tells him and that is hidden standard and when an individual has gone through that cycle violently he comes up at the other end looking at life through circuit he never looks at life the circuit looks at life he never gets audited the circuit gets audited that is an experience experience must not approach this individual and remember auditing is an experience so if the individual is living life on via called circuit then of course your auditing is only part of the via and of course never reaches the person and you are trying to audit the person you are not trying to audit the via and when auditing takes godawful long time it is just because you are not auditing pc you are auditing circuit you havent got an operating thetan youve got an operating ge or an operating circuit and so all experience is filtered through the circuit and it is true of auditing too auditing also filters through the circuit now the trick in supervising auditors is to give them some type of rundown that hits all this and knocks all this out of the road and they can do it rather sloppily and they dont have to finish it up in any terrific way and theyll still knock the circuitry out of the road so the person can be audited and that is what this problems intensive is all about and this thing is tailormade for class ii activity and people can be trained to do this much more easily than they can be trained to locate goals and terminals why because goal and terminal operation and prehav scale running requires precision of auditing which is very very high hardly won precision and you know that because right this moment you are struggling up the line toward that precision but it requires terrific precision theres only one goal you must never get the wrong goal theres only one terminal you must never get the wrong terminal there is only one level of the prehav scale live you must never audit the wrong level the auditing commands have to be exactly the right auditing commands the individual going up and down the track has to be run precisely against the emeter precisely when it is flat it is flat and when it is not flat it is not flat and furthermore the individual cannot be run with rudiments out much less assessed when the rudiments are out so that is highly precise level of auditing dont you see you have another level of auditing now in class ii which is imprecise and will get the job done now this has an additional advantage where you are shy about an individual coming in off the street this has to solve this problem the individual is coming in off the street he doesnt know very much about scientology without giving him broad general education you cannot easily sit down and open up form 3 on him you wont find auditors doing it very glibly and the individual not knowing what its targeted at is going to feel that hes being suspected and hes going to get some kind of an arc break with the people who are doing this to him ah well on such person very simply you run this problems intensive it is what it basically goes back and makes the most fundamental security checks that can be made on the individual without getting very personal about the individual now when hes opened up and is expressing himself little bit better and youve got the hidden standards out of the road you can of course uncork form 3 now the individual knows what its all about now hell go for this now hell stay insession with this now and hell get it off and hell know where hes going because he has subjective reality of what hes been doing to himself with withholds he got that out of this rundown so this gets you over the bridge of how do you take raw meat and audit it directly and actually you could get somebody up here that just was walking down the road say have you ever had any changes in your life and what has your life been all about have you ever had any operations have you ever had this have you ever had that it doesnt matter itd be any of the data you could ask this individual any of the data on any part of this form right up to and the individual will be pitching right straight with you and now of course part why hell be happy to tell you all about the changes in his life everybody is very happy to talk about all of their troubles and difficulties and changes theyre very happy to tell you their problems thats for sure and of course the security check is not between you and the person it is between the person and people who arent there and hes perfectly willing to give you withholds from people who arent there so this is the answer to raw meat and you take this particular rundown which will be released to you shortly and you will find out that an individual is then processable practically any level of case becomes processable if you approach it that way requires specialized address of any kind whatsoever and the most selfconscious auditor would be happy to sit there and do that i developed this from this reason and this way i found out that auditors will fill out forms that is not sarcastic thing that happens to be common denominator of all auditors they will all do it and they will do it very well all right lets build on that cornerstone and lets move it on up and run some processes up along the level and youve got it made how could you miss okay well its taken quite bit of thinking to get this squared around and quite bit of looking and so forth i hope you make good use of it thank you
