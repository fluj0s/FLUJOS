kosovos new cons titution which went into effect on june 15 2008 the status settlement calls for kosovo to become an independent country supervised by the international community1 under the plan kosovo has the right to conclude interna tional agreements and join international organizations it has the right to set up its own security force and intelligence agency however kosovo is not per mitted to merge with another c ountry or part of another country the document contains provisions aimed at safeguarding the rights of ethnic serbs who currently make up an estimated 53 of kosovos popul ation and other minorities about 27 of the population it is planned that six serb ianmajority m unicipalities will be given expanded powers over their own affairs they will have the right to form associations with each other and receive tran sparent funding from belgrade local police will be part of the kosovo police service but their composition would have to correspond to the local ethnic mix and the local police commander would be chosen by the municipality central government bodies nd the judiciary will also have to reflect kosovos ethnic composition kosovos constitu tion and laws will ve to guarantee minority rights laws of special interest to ethnic minorities can only be approved if majority of the minority representatives in the parliament votes for them the plan includes measures for the protection of serbian religious and cultural sites and communities in kosovo an international civilian representative icr heading an in ternationa l civilian office ico

ability to assume limited executive powers to ensure that these institutions work effectively as well as to intervene in specific criminal cases including by referring them to international judges and prosecutors httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21721crs3 2 for the text of the reconfiguration plan see the security council website at httpwwwunorgdocsscsgrep08htminternational role in kosovo in transition one key concern is how the euled missions detailed in the ahtisaari plan will relate to the existing mission in kosovo unmik unmik has administered kosovo since 1999 under the terms of security council resolution 1244 it has gradually ceded many competencies to the kosovo government but currently retains key powers over the police judiciary customs and other areas the ahtisaari plan foresees the withdrawal of unmik however as the pl an was not adopted by the security council due to russian objections unmik appears to have legal basis for withdrawing let alone recogn izing kosovos independence to deal with this problem secr etary general ban kimoon announced to the security council on june 12 2008 that he will reconfigure the mission reducing its size and tasks unmik will be l imited largely to monitoring reporting and facilitating communication between the various parties ban notes that the eu will play larger operational role in kosovo particularly in th area of the rule of law nevertheless the secretary ge neral did not lay out specific formula for the relationship between unmik and the euled institutions saying merely that they would take place under the umbrella of the united nations2 eulex will operate nominally under the authority of the but will report to the eu not to headquarters in new york the issue of relations between unmik and eulex has contributed to delays in the deployment of the eu mission eulex wh ich was supposed to deploy its 3000person mission by june 15 will not be fully deployed until this fall kfor the natoled peacekeeping force in kosovo has about 16000 troops in the country of which about 1600 are us soldie rs as it did before independence kfor retains the role of ensuring the overall security of kosovo kfor will also play the leading role in overseeing the creation of the kosovo security force called for by the ahtisaari plan eu officials in kosovo have expressed concern that lack of clarity on the roles of unmik and eulex coupled with kfors longstanding rejection of police role for itself may creat security gap in kosovo serbian opposition to independence serbia and kosovo serbs have sharply rejected kosovos independence as illegitimate after kosovos declaration of independence belgrade downgraded diplomatic relations with th united states and other count ries that recognized kosovo serbian officials walked out of internationa l meetings at which ko sovar delegations have been seated serbia has tried to strengthen its control over areas in which serbs are majority leading many analysts to believe facto partition of the province is being attempted in the weeks afte r independence serbian mobs in northern kosovo attacked eu and kosovo government property nd personnel in the worst incident on march 17 2008 rioters in the northern town of mitrovica attacked police with rocks molotov cocktails and grenades one policeman was killed more than 60 police and about 30 kfor troops were hurt as were 70 rioters officials said they have proof that the serbian government played key role in instigating the violencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21721crs4 in the weeks after kosovos declaration of serbia warned kosovo serbs against cooperating with the euled missions in kos ovo or otherwise helping to implement the ahtisaari plan hundreds of serbian police in the kosovo police service resigned at the demand of the serbian government in march 2008 serbian government officials proposed to unmik that kosovo be temporar ily divided along ethnic lines with serbia taking responsibility for police judiciary customs and other issues in serbmajority areas after serbias may 11 2008 parliamentary and local elections in which serbs in kosovo participated despite unmiks objec tions kosovo serb leaders in northern kosovo began to set up their own local instituti ons including parliament many of the members of these bodies are members of nati onalist or ultranationa list parties the serbian government condemned s ecretary general ban kimoons plan to reconfigure unmik kosovo government lead ers are concerned about serbian efforts to divide kosovo they want to see kosovo government authority extended to northern kosovo at least formally new serbian government was elected by the serbian parlia ment on july 7 2008 it is led by the prowestern democratic party but also includes the socialist party once led by indicted war criminal slobodan milose vic it is unclear whether the new government will significantly reduce serbian efforts to pa rtition kosovo and obstruct the implementation of the ahtisaari plan although us and other international officials in kosovo appear to hope that this will be th case the new government has made clear that it will continue to use diplomatic m eans to oppose kosovos independence serbia plans to seek an advisory opinion from the in ternational court of justice that would rule that kosovos independence is illegal under intern ational law the minority rights provisions of the ah tisaari plan may be moot if serbs are unwilling to cooperate with th government of an indepe ndent kosovo or the euled bodies created to support it serbian leader s in northern kosovo may feel that they can do without such cooperation as they can count on continued s upport from neighboring serbia however well over lf of serbs in kosovo are s cattered in enclaves throughout the rest of the country surrounded by ethn ic albanian communities they are more vulnerable and their security could be in doubt without some fo rm of cooperation with kosovo authorities and eulex some observers have called fo r kosovo to be formally pa rtitioned part of it joining serbia and the rest an inde pendent kosovo serbia has not yet openly called for partition as it still claims that all of kosovo belong s to it but some observers speculate that belgrades current policy is aimed at prep aring the ground for such proposal in the future kosovars strongly oppose any partition international leaders fear that partition of kosovo could also revive other efforts to redraw borders in the balkans however even if jure partition is unlikely in the foreseeable future serb ia will try to continue to strengthen its control of areas of serb majority regions par ticularly in northern kosovo creating an indefinite facto partition serbian ko sovar albanian and international observers have warned that kosovo is frozen conflict in the making the term was coined to describe territorial conflicts mainly in the former soviet union where violence has stopped or is sporadic but little or movement toward negotiated resolution has occurred for many yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21721crs5 3 text of the donor conference press release from the euworld bank website httpwwwseereconorgkosovos other challenges kosovo faces daunting challenges as an i ndependent state in addition to those posed by the status of its ethnic minorities ko sovo suffers from the same problems as other countries in the region but is in some re spects worse off than many of them all countries of the region suffer from weak ins titutions including law enforcement and the judiciary however kosovos problem is especially severe as it has had little recent experience in selfrule having been controlle d by serbia in the 1990s and then by the international community since

and other nonserb ethnic minorities unemployment in kosovo is estimated at about 40 according to the european commission small and inefficient farms are the largest employers in kosovo the country has little largescale industry and few exports resulting in trade deficit of close to 65 of gdp in 2007 however kos ovo does have significan t deposits of metals and lignite which could lead to revival of the mining sector since 1999 kosovo has been heavily pendent on international aid and expenditures by international staff in kosovo these sources of income are declining posing significant challenge to kosovo s economy kosovo is also dependent on remittances from the large number of kos ovars abroad accounting for about 30 of gross domestic product the european commission hosted an inte rnational
