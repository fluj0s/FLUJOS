legislation hr 1400 iran counterproliferation act and s 970 iran counter proliferation act of 2007 would cut future us funding to the world bank if the bank makes new loans to iran this repor t will be updated as events warrant world bank and iran before the 1979 iranian revolution iran was an active borrower from the world bank after the revol ution lending stopped and did not resume until 1991 between 1991 and 1993 seven world bank projects were approved despite the united states voting against these proj ects the united states has 165 share of the world banks vote majority vote is needed to approve loans unless it is joined by other likeminded countries the united states is unable to block the approval of world bank loans to iran the current portfolio of approved loans for iran which total approximately 8474 million are for projects such as primary health earthquake recovery assistance drainage and irrigati on projects and power sector improvements between 1993 and 2000 the united states was able to sustain coalition of g7 countries that voted against world bank lending to iran in may 2000 however the united states proved unsuccessful in keeping the coalition together and lending resumed as the other g7 countries voted to approve 232 million in loans for health and sewerage projects twentyone of the banks twentyfour executive directors voted in favor of the loan france and canada abst ained reportedly the othe r g7 countries decided in changing their position in 2000 that more pr ogress might be possible in dissuading iran from continuing its nuclear program throug

testified that while the united states had been unable to prevent the passage of new loans it has been successful in dela ying disbursements to iran he said if i were going to be aggressive i could tr to assert that the united states has been successful behind the scenes in order to stop the disbursement or slow it down substantially there are 390 million or so of undisbursed resources out of the then 432 million that has been approved i think if you were to ask that question of bank management they would tell you that iran is particularly difficult place to do business in and they are having trouble getting started and starting up programs3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22704crs3 it appears however that disburse ments have increased since 2003 figure 1 in 2007 the world bank has already disbursed close to 200 million to iran the largest disbursement over the past ten years th world bank disbursed 49 million to iran in 2005 and 166 million in 2006 figure 1 world bank disbursements to iran as of june 30 2007 source world bank us policy on world bank lending to iran several laws restrict us support for world bank lending to iran the most relevant legislation is the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 title iii b sec 327 this act instructs the treasury department to oppose any loan to or other use of in ternational financial institution ifi funds for country that the secretary of state has identified as supporting international terrorism under the provisions of section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 50 usc app 2405j or sec tion 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 22 usc 2371 the terrorism determination does not apply to voting at the international finance corporation ifc the private sector arm of the world bank since it lends to private sector firms not fore ign governments nonetheless the treasury department opposed recent if c investments in iran in addition to the terrorism determination the international financial institutions act of 1977 pl 95118 sec 701 requires the tr easury department to oppose loans to countries whose governments engage in patte rn of gross violati ons of internationally recognized human rights there is offici state department list of countries that violate or do not viol ate human rights rather this information is derived from the departments annual human rights country reports httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22704crs4 current legislation two current pieces of legislation may impact world bank lending to iran hr 1400 iran counterproliferation act and s 970 iran counterproliferation act of 2007 which includes similar language as originally introduced the language of hr 1400 sec 404 reads as follows sec 404 reducing contributions to the world bank the president of the united states shall reduce the total amount otherwise payable on behalf of the united states to the international bank for reconstruction and development for each fiscal year by the percentage represented by 1 the total of the amounts provided by the bank to entities in iran or for projects and activities in iran in the then preceding fiscal year divided by 2 the total of the amounts provided by the ba nk to all entities or for all projects and activities in the then preceding fiscal year under sec 404 if the ibrd were to lend 150 million to iran in one fiscal year and if the ibrd lent 15 billion to all borrowers that year the us payment to the ibrd would be reduced by 1 from the vel it would have been otherwise s 970 the iran counter proliferation act of 2007 is more comprehensive it applies to all world bank entities not only the ibrd the relevant sections of s 970 is as follows sec 10 world bank loans to iran report not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this act and every 180 days thereafter the secretary of the treasury shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees report on 1 the number of loans provided by the world bank to iran 2 the dollar amount of such loans and 3 the voting record of each member of the world bank on such loans b reduction of contribution of the unite d states the president shall reduce the total amount otherwise payable on behalf of the united states to the world bank for fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereaf ter by an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount otherwise payable as 1 the total of the amounts provided by th bank to entities in iran and for projects and activities in iran in the preceding fiscal year bears to 2 the total of the amounts provided by th bank to all entities and for all projects and activities in the preceding fiscal year c allocation of amounts not contributed to the world bank there is authorized to be appropriated to the united states agency for international development for fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year therea fter an amount equal to the revenues made available as result of the application of subsection b funds appropriated pursuant to this subsection shall be made available for the child survival and health programs fund to carry out programs relating to mate rnal and child health vulnerable children and infectious diseases other than hivaids under the provisions of sec 10 if the ib rd lent iran 150 million in one year and if the world bank provided 30 billion in aid from the ibrd ida and the internationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22704crs5 4 for example representative sherman said p 5 in support of his legislation during the hearings cited above that money is fungible the government in teheran must make some domestic expenditures and then they can spend our money instead of theirs they can use their money for terrorism he also mentioned irans nuclear development program finance corporation ifc to all countries us payments to the world bank group would be cut by 05 onehalf percen t from the level they be otherwise analysis effects on world bank lending to iran sec 404 of hr 1400 and sec 10 of s 970 resemble legislation proposed by representative brad sherman in 2003 hr 2466 which sought to reduce us paymen ts to the world banks concessional aid facility ida in pr oportion to the amount the world banks market loan window the ibrd lent to iran others have made similar proposal s from time to time fungibility or the interchangeability of various financial assets appears to be the underlying concept behind these proposals to cut off world bank assistance to iran4 in this context if the ibrd lends money to help finance primary health program or an irrigation project according to the concept of fungibility the government of iran can use the money it would have otherwise spent on these activities to fund other activities such as nuclear development or terrorist groups that iran is known to sponsor the concept assumes that iran attaches more priority to the former activities than it does to the latter and consequently if it did not get loan from the world bank to finance humanitarian or economic development programs it would reduce its expenditures on nuclear development in order to undertake the needed development projects on the other hand if nuclear development is more important to iran than are particular development projects iran may go ahead with its nuclear progra m regardless leaving the other projects undone termination in world bank lending to iran might be form of retribution however to punish the iranians for their c hoice in priorities given irans expressed priorities however it might not impact the development of irans nuclear program were lending continued in any case it would be hard to siphon money from world bank projects to illicitly fund nuclear activities or terrorism th world bank maintains tight oversight of its projects as they are impleme nted which would likely be redoubled in this case the bank does not release money as lu mp sum rather it is disbursed to pay suppliers or contractors only after specific work has been completed and the bills are checked against plans effects of sec 404 on us contributions to the world bank in the case of sec 404 of hr 1400 the proposal to redu ce us contributions to the ibrd may be more symbolic than substantive the united states has made payments to the ibrd since 1996 and none are anticipated in the future the ibrds capital base determines how much it can borrow in capital markets to fund its lending operations according to th articles of agreemen ts total outstanding loans cannot exceed the ibrds total subscribed capital base it is unlikely that the ibrd will need to increase its capital base fo r the foreseeable future in 1988 the ibrdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22704crs6 5 for more information see crs report rl33969 the world banks international development association ida by martin weissapproved general capital increase gci which substantially increased the banks capital base together with other countries the united states agreed to expand its financial support for the bank by contributi ng new callable and pa idin capital the last us payments were made in fy1996 in 1988 the ibrd made loan commitments totaling 149 billion and it was ssumed that after the capital increase took effect the volume of ibrd lending would increase substa ntially in the past 20 years however the environment for ibrd lending has changed and there appears to be little demand for the anticipated high volume of lending the ibrds total lending in 2007 was slightly smaller 141 billion than it was in 1988 the ibrd could continue lending at its present annual rate or even much larger annual rate without risk that it would need to curtail its loan program because its capital base could longer support its volume of lending effects of sec 10 on us cont ributions to the world bank the likely impact of sec 10 of s 970 would be greater than that of hr 1400 since s 970 would rescind funds for all world bank assistance us contributions to ida or the ifc in years when the united states is making contributions could be impacted the bush administration pledged 285 billion to the most recent round of ida funding ida14 to be split into three payments of 950 million for each of fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 table 2 includes us budget requests and appropriations for ida14 and total arrears if us contributions to ida were rescinded due to world bank ibrd loans to iran they would add to us arrears to ida currently us arrears to ida are 3779 million these arrears have had bandwagon effect unpaid us contributions have triggered prorata withholding of cont ributions during ida12 and ida13 by three other ida donors totaling about 72 million tinued us arrears would also likely constrain the us negotiating as it pursues its negotiating objectives at the next round of ida funding ida 15 which provides funding for 200920115 finally it is unclear whether restrictions would be applied to disbursements on earlier loans or only to new loans table 2 ida14 appropriations in millions fy2006 fy2007 fy2008total arrears includes arrears from ida13request approp request pprop request approp 9500 90915 9500 9405 10600
