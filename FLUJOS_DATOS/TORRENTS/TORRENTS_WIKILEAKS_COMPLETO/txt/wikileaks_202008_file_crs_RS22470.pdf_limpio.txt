products along with related supplies nd services in the new york boroughs of queens and the bronx ideal alleged that national failed to charge its cash customers new york sales tax thereby enabling national to reduce its prices to ideals competitive disadvantage national allege dly submitted fraudulent sales ta x reports to the state tax department via wire nd mail to conceal the tax evasion which ideal asserted constituted mail fraud and wire fraud6 as these are forms of racketeering activity under rico7 ideal claimed that national engaged in pattern of racketeering activity because thefraudulent returns were submitted on an ongoing and regular basis 8 ideal also filed claim against the anzas and national alle ging that they violated section 1962a9 by using funds generated by their fraudul ent tax scheme to open their bronx location causing ideal to lose business and market share procedural history national moved to dismiss the case arguing that ideal did not have standing because it had not adequately alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by nationals alleged rico violations the us district court for the southern district of new york granted nationals motion holding that ideal had not pled transaction causation which in complaints predicated on mail or wire fra ud requires plaintiff to demonstrate that he or she relied on the defenda nts misrepresentations10 the court of appeals for the second circ uit vacated the district courts ruling finding that where pattern of racketeerin g activity was intended to and did give the defendant

steel supply corp the supreme court disagreed13 justice kennedy wrote the majority opinion and was joined by chief justice roberts as well as justices stevens scalia ginsburg and alito justice scalia wrote short concurrence and justices thomas and breyer filed opinions concurring in part and dissenting in part in the words of justice kennedy the cour ts analysis begins andlargely ends with holmes 14 in holmes 15 the securities investor protection corporation sipc16 claimed that petitioner robert holmes conspired with others to manipulate stock prices share prices dropped when the fraud was detected causing two brokerdealers great financial difficulty which led to their liquida tion sipc thus had to advance nearly 13 million to cover the brokerdealers customer claims sipc sued holmes claiming that he participated in the conduct of an enterprises affairs th rough pattern of racketeering activity in violation of sec tion 1962c and conspired to do so in violation of section 1962d the court looked to legislative hist ory to interpret sec tion 1964cs provision of civil cause of action for people injured by reason of defendants rico violation the court recognized that congress modeled section 1964c on section 4 of the clayton act 15 uscs 15 which provides for civil action under the fe deral antitrust laws the supreme court noted that in associated general contractors of california inc v carpenters 17 it held that to have cause of ac tion under section 4 plaintiff must show that the defendants violation was not only but for cause of the injury but also proximate cause the court looked to the commonlaw foundations of proximate cause which demands some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged18 based upon these interpretations the court held that sipcs rico claims did not satisfy the directness re quirement the link between the stock manipulation and the customers harm was too remote where the brokerdealers insolvency was the only connection between the conspirators acts and the customers losses19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22470crs4 20 126 s ct at 1998 21 id at 1997998 22 id at 1999based upon the holmes standard the court held that in this case ideal could not maintain its section 1962c claim the di rect victim of nationa ls mail and wire fraud was the state of new york not ideal while the court recognized ideal may have been harmed by nationals lower prices this harm was caused by actions entirely distinct from the alleged actions constituting the rico viola tion the fraudulent tax reports the court also noted that although the attenuation be tween ideals harms and the claimed rico violation arose from di fferent source than in holmes where the alleged violations were linked to the plaintiffs alleged harm only th rough third party the absence of proximate causation was equally clear in both cases the court explained that the proximate cause requirement could not be avoided by claiming the defendant intended to and did harm the plaintiff when court evaluates ri co claim for proximate causation the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiffs injuries20 the supreme court held here the answer was the court buttressed its termination based upon the unde rlying premises of the directness requirement first the court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions for example in this case national could have lowered its prices for numerous reasons unrelated to the asserted fraud c onversely ideals lost sales could have resulted from factors other than nationals alleged rico violation secondly the dir ect causal connection requirement is especially warranted where the direct vi ctims of the rico violation can pursue their own claim here the state of new york coul d file suit and in that situation it would be much easier for court to calculate new yorks damages based on the foregoing reasons the court reversed th second circuits holding th at ideal had satisfied the proximate cause requirement under its section 1962c claim21 in approaching ideals second claim that national had violated section 1962a by using illegitimate funds to purchase its sec ond store the court explained that both section 1962c and 1962a cla ims must be asserted under section 1964c invoking the requirement that the plaintiffs injury be proximately caused by the defendants rico violation however where sections 1962c and 1962a establish two distinct prohibitions the court said it is debata ble whether ideals 1962a claim should be analyzed in the same way as its 1962c cla im in regards to prox imate cause however the supreme court declined to consider th issue because the second circuit failed to address proximate causa tion in relation to ideals 1962a claim thus the court vacated and remanded the second circuit s judgment with the instruc tions that the second circuit confront this issue22 the court ultimately did not address the question posed in the grant of certiorari whether company seeking damages under ri co for alleged mail or wire fraud must prove

to address this issue23 separate opinions justice scalia concurred with the majority but wrote separately to note that ideals alleged 1962c injury was not within the zone of interests protected by the rico cause of action and so ideal did not have standing to bring suit24 justice thomas concurred only with the ma joritys holding in regards to ideals section 1962a cause of acti on while he supported limiting th use of the civil provision of rico he felt that the majoritys strict proximate causation requirement eliminated recovery for plaintiffs whose injuries are exactly those that congress intended to remedy25 thomas argued that the courts determination in this case was actually based on theory of directness di stinct from that adopted in holmes thomas emphasized that it was nationals conduct that enabled the company to undercut ideals prices and thereby put ideal at compe titive disadvantage therefore thomas argued that because nationals tax fraud directly caused ideals injury holmes did not bar recovery26 thomas also asserted that the majoritys reliance on the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of ideals damages in holding that th injuries were indirect was misguided as it is within the district courts expertise to evaluate evidence and determine what portion of ideals lost sales were due to nationals lower prices27 justice breyer concurred with the majo ritys outcome but not its reasoning28 he distinguished this case from holmes stating that the causal links here were more direct however for justice breyer rico does not provide private right of action based upon harm induced by normal business practices such as offering lower prices in breyers view national cut prices by the amount of th sales tax and kept th money this source of nationals savings was irre levant because the price cut itself was legitimate and thus ideal could not prove direct casual link29 implications of anza v ideal steel supply corp rico was enacted to combat the effects of organized crime on the nations business economy however because of section 1964c majority of rico cases are brought against legitimate individuals or businesses rather than criminal organizations30

question presented was whether corporations working with third party contractors satisfy the definition of enterprise under section 19614 37 this is violation of section 274 of the immigration and nationality act 38 126 s ct 2016 2006courts and the legislature have attempted to limit the scope of rico in civil causes of action31 the courts decision in ideal apparently does so by imposing higher burden on plaintiffs to establish direct link betw een their injury and the defendants alleged racketeering activity32 failure to do so under this ne w precedent could provide grounds for dismissal of civil rico case33 this limitation could also make it easier for businesses to harm their competitors and avoid liability where third party is the direct victim of their scheme34 congress could choose to nullify the cour ts decision via legislation however congress has not yet introduced any bills relating to ideals holding mohawk industries v williams on december 12 2005 the supreme court granted certiorari in mohawk industries inc v williams 35 another civil suit brought under section 1964c of rico36 in this case employees alleged that their employer moha wk industries mohawk violated rico by knowingly employing illegal immigrants with the help of third party employment agencies37 the larger job pool enabled mohawk to lower the wages of its legal employees and thereby reduce its labor costs the supreme court on the same day as its decision in ideal issued brief order stating that certiorari had been granted improvidently and remanded the case to the u s appeals court for the eleventh circuit for consideration in light of its decision in nza v ideal steel supply corp38 under the ideal rationale it would appear that the direct victim of mohawks rico violations was the federal government not moha wks employees therefore ideal may pose problem to the plaintiffs case in mohawk
