energy and water to consolidate jurisdiction over doe1 at the same time jurisdiction over the epa and several smaller entities was moved to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering interior and related agencies2 this change resulted from the abolition of the house andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34011crs2 2 continued agencies 3 in addition final fy2007 enacted leve ls are not

fy2008 appropriations cyclesenate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs housing and urban development and independent agencies which previously had jurisdiction over epa since fy2006 appropriations laws for in terior environmen t and related agencies have contained three primary titles providing funding this report is organized along these lines accordingly the first section title

discusses crosscutting topics that encompass more than one agency entries in this report are for major agencies eg the national park service and crosscutting issues eg everglades restora tion that receive funding in the interior environment and related agencies appropr iations bill for each such agency or issue we discuss some of the key fundi ng changes proposed or enacted for fy2008 that are likely to be of interest to congress we also address related policy issues that occurred in the context of considering ppropriations legislation presenting such information in summary form is challe nge given that budget submissions for some agencies number several hundred page s and contain innumerable funding programmatic and legisla tive changes for congressional consideration s imilarly funding bills and accompanying reports c ontain numerous line items and discussions of programs and issues this report contains final fy2007 enacted levels for agencies programs and activities the administration did not use these figures as the basis of comparison in agency budget submissions for fy2008 because agencies were being funded under shortterm continuing resoluti on at the time of those submissions accordingly the fy2007 figures used th roughout this report will differ in many cases from those contained in the fy2008 agency budget submissions further difference is that fy2007 figures in th is report include supplemental funding3 final fy2007 funding levels as containe d in this report were determined by the agencies under the provisions of pl 1105 the revised continuing appropriations resolution for fy2007 tinuing funding was needed to fund agency operations and activities because congress did not enact regular fy2007 appropriations bill for interi or environment and rela ted agencies pl 1105 provided funds though september 30 2007 which was the rest of the fiscal year it continued funds at the fy2006 account level except where otherwise specified the law required

varying levels of interest in the fy 2008 debate about the adequacy of funding for individual prog rams and activities ad ministered by epa much of the attention focused on funding for water infrastructure projects the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under th superfund and brownfields programs scientific research on human health ffects upon which pollution control standards are based and grants to assist state and local governments in administering air quality programs there also was rising interest in the adequacy of funding and staffing of epas office of inspector general to audit

tribal assistance grants stag account most of these funds ar devoted to grants that support state revolving funds srfs these grant funds provide seed monies for states to issue loans to communities for wastewater and drinking water infrastru cture projects the fy2008 law provided 6891 million for the clean water srf sligh tly more than the presidents request of 6876 million but far less than the 108 billion appropriated for fy2007 the fy2008 enacted appropriation also is much less than the 113 billion that the house had proposed and the 8870 million that th senate appropria tions committee had recommended the fy2008 law provided another 8290 million for the drinking water srf the president had reque sted 8422 million which the house and the senate appropriations committee initia lly had approved the fy2008 enacted appropriation for the drinking water srf also was below the prior year appropriation of 8375 million the adequacy of federal funding to assist states in capitalizing their clean water srfs has been an ongoing issue the clean water act authorized epa to award grants to help states capitalize these loan funds although appropriations for these grants have declined in recent years c ongress still had been providing significantly more funding than the president requested each year this trend was due to differing views on the extent of the role of the federal government in capitalizing these state loan funds departing from this trend the fy2008 enacted appropriation is closer to the presidents request than the higher amounts that congress had been providing over the years there has been less disagreement between congress and the administration in regard to the adequacy of funding for drinking water srf grants however some members conti nue to assert that more federal funds are needed to help capitalize these loan funds especially in light of more stringent drinking water standards with which communities must comply although grants to help states capitaliz their srfs represent the bulk of epa funding for water infrastructure congre ss also has supported these needs through targeted funding for speci project grants within epas stag account these grants fund variety of wastewater drinki ng water and storm water infrastructure projects they are awarded on nonc ompetitive basis to specific communities although communities must repay the loan funds that they borrow from the srfs special project grants do not require repayment however each recipient of these grants must provide 45 of projects co st in matching funds unless epa approves waiver due to fi nancial hardship the fy2008 law provi ded 1329 milli on within the stag account for 280 special project grants for fy2008 and iden tified the intended recipients in

the disbursed amount of each grant also will pend on the amount of matching funds from the recipientexplanatory statement accompanying the law44 as in past years the administration did not request funding for these congressi onally designated projects total funding for special project grants has declined in the past few years congress provided 1971 million for fy2006 however congress did not provide any funding for special project grants in fy2007 as the revised continuing appropriations resolution for fy2007 pl 1105 specifically prohibited the funding of these types of grants superfund the fy2008 law provided 122 billion for the hazardous substance superfund account to fund the cl eanup of hazardous substances under the superfund program this funding level is the net amount available for the program after combined transfer of 372 million to the st account and the office of the inspector general account the president had requested slightly lower net amount of 121 billion for the superfund account n early the same as enacted for fy2007 the house and the senate appropriations committee initially had recommended greater net amount of 124 billion funding for the superfund account has remained relatively close to these amount s over the past decade the adequacy of funding for the superfund program to clean up the nations most contaminated and threatening sites has been longstanding issue the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla established the superfund progra m to fund the cleanup of contamination when responsible parties cannot be f ound or cannot pay some members of congress and the bush administration continue to assert that steady level of federal funding is sufficient to maintain cons tant pace of cleanup considering the costs borne by responsible partie s that supplem ent these funds other members states environmental organizations and communities counter that more federal funds are necessary to expedite the pace of cleanup to address human health and environmental risks more quickly and that the effect of inflation over time has reduced available resources the availability of funds within th superfund account fo r physical cleanup of sites has been perennial issue in light of public concerns about health risks from potential exposure to contamination alt hough the primary purpose of the superfund program is to clean up contaminated sites the program does fund many indirect activities that support cleanup such as enfor cement against responsible parties and research of more effective cleanup met hods with funds transferred to the st account in recent years about 23 of nnual funding has been devoted to physical cleanup of sites including both shortte rm removal actions to address immediate risks and longterm remedial actions inte nded to provide more permanent means to prevent exposure the fy2008 law provided total of 8275 million for activities related to the physical cleanup of sites an increase bove the presidents request of 8245 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34011crs51 and the fy2007 appropria tion of 8169 million funding for longterm remedial actions accounted for most of the increase the fy2008 enacted appropriation is less than the 8397 million that the house had proposed and the 8432 million that the senate appropriations committee had recomme nded with the difference again being primarily due to funding for longterm remediation in the funding debate concerns about the sufficiency of cleanup actions to protect human health and the environment also motivated questions about program performance staffing and funding of epa s office of inspector general to audit and evaluate the superfund program were particularly controversial as discussed in the office of inspector general section below brownfields in addition to the superfund program amendments to cercla in 2002 established separate program to clean up contamin ated brownfields the fy2008 appropriations law provided co mbined total of 1658 million for epas brownfields program the house initia lly had proposed higher amount of 1729 million the senate ppropriations committee d recommended 1625 million closer to the presidents request of 1622 million and the fy2007 appropriation of 1630 million total funding for the brownf ields program consists of three amounts the stag account funds brownfie lds infrastructure grants to assist communities with cleanup at individual site s and brownfields categorical grants to assist states with their own brownfie lds programs the environmental programs and management account funds the adminis trative expenses of the brownfields program typically brownfields are abandoned idled or underutilized commercial and industrial properties w ith levels of cont amination less hazar dous than superfund site but that still warrant cl eanup before the land can be sa fe for reuse the desire to redevelop these propertie s for economic benefit has generated interest in the adequacy of funding for brownfields clea nup grants to states and local areas in response to these needs the fy2008 enacted appropriation included an increase for brownfields infrastructure grants to assist communities with the cleanup of individual sites but not as much as the house initially had approved the enacted amounts for brownfields categorical grants and administrative expenses of the program are roughly similar to the recommendations of the house the senate appropriations committee the presid ent and the fy2007 appropriation office of inspector general oig the office of inspector general oig is an independent office within epa that conducts and supervises audits evaluations inspections and investigations of the ag encys programs and operations the oig also performs audits and eval uations specifically requested by congress the office is funded by base appropriation and transfer of appropriations from the superfund account historically congress has transferred these funds to the oig because significant portion of its funding and staffing has been devoted to oversight of epas cleanup efforts under the superfund program including the transfer from superfund the fy2008 law provided 526 million for the oig an increase above the presidents request of 451 million and the fy2007 appropriation of 505 million the house had proposed 535 million for fy2008 and the senate appropriations committee had recommended 533 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34011crs52 in the funding debate some member s had expressed concern that the presidents request would not have been sufficient to support adequate staffing to audit and evaluate supe rfund cleanup activities th explanatory statement accompanying the fy2008 law indicated that the increase in enacted funding above the request and the fy2007 appr opriation was intended to sure consistent staffing levels within the oig and was not to be used for buyouts associated with reductions in staff epa had reported that the pres idents proposed decrease in funding for the oig would have resulted in reduction of 30 workyears full time equivalent employees or ftes and reassignment of 20 ftes from the oversight of superfund cleanups to oversight of broa der array of agency activities scientific research most of epas scientific research activities are funded within the science and technology st account including the agencys laboratories and research grants s imilar to the oig account the st account is funded by base appropriation and tran sfer from superfund these transferred funds are dedicated to research of more effective methods to clean up contaminated sites including the transfer from the superfund account the fy2008 law provided 7858 million for the st account an increas above the presidents request of 7806 million and the fy2007 appropriati on of 7636 million the house had proposed 8094 million for this account in fy2008 and the sena appropriations committee had recommended 7986 million most of the st account funds actual research activities but the operational and administrative expenses of agency research facilities such as rent utilities and security are also funded within this account the increase bove fy 2007 was mostly due to continued shift in f unds from the environmental programs and management account to pay these opera tional and administrative expenses consequently funding enacted for fy 2008 for many of epas research areas decreased or remained relatively flat relative to fy2007 however funding for certain areas rose above the presiden ts request for fy2008 and the prior year appropriation such as climate protection and global change research areas but not to the level that the house or the sena appropriations committee had proposed for fy2008 in some cases the funding debate for fy2008 took place within the context of larger discussion about the adequacy of federal f unding for many core scientific research activities administered by multiple federal agencies including epa some members of congress scientists nd environmental organizations have expressed concern about the downward trend in fe deral resources for scientif ic research over time the debate continues to center around the question of whether the regulatory actions of federal agencies are based on sound science and how scientific re search is applied in developing federal policy state and local air quality management grants the fy2008 law provided 2168 million for state and local air quality management categorical grants within epas stag account an increase above the presidents request of 1852 million and the fy2007 appropriation of 1998 million some members and state and local air pollution control officials have continued to express that even greater funds are needed for these grants as result of increasing clean air act responsibilities imposed upon state and local governments to regulate air pollutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34011crs53 the fy2008 enacted appropriation for these grants was less than the 2202 million that the house had proposed and the 2203 million that the nate appropriations committee had recommended according to epa the presidents reque sted decrease for state and local air quality management grants wa s primarily because of the agencys use of different authorities in the clean air act to adminis ter these grants epa originally proposed this change in authorities in its fy2007 budg et justification th different grant authorities require matching funds from recipients rather than the federal government bearing the full cost epa ba sed this proposed shift in authorities on its assertion that the monitoring networ k for particulate matter is beyond the demonstration phase and that the network should now be considered an operational system in the implementation phase authorities for demonstration grants do not require matching funds but those for implementation do require match thereby reducing the federal role in funding these activities in its initial report on the fy2008 interi or appropriations bill the senate appropriations committee had strongly di sagreed with the presidents proposed shift in grant authorities to require matching funds of recipients srept 11091 p 69 the fy2008 law and the explanatory statement accompanying the law did not explicitly address this issue however the statement did specify that house or senate report language that was not changed by the explanatory statement should be treated as approved when administe ring the appropriations explanatory statement h16122 presumably epa woul d be subject to the language in the original senate report expressing the intention of the committee not to require matching funds for these air quality grants proposed commission on climate change the fy2008 law did not include new account or funding in any other existing account to establish new commission on climate change adaptati on and mitigation the house had proposed 500 million for new account for this purpose the commission would have been temporary and w ould have served for two ears neither the senate appropriations committee nor the presid ent recommended funding for such commission of the 500 million that the house had proposed 50 million was to have been used to establish and operate the commissi on analyze scientific questions related to climate change adaptati on and mitigation and recomme nd research priorities to better understand climate change the remaining 450 million was to have been distributed to various fede ral agencies to conduct this research based on the commissions recommended priorities the ag encies that would have received this funding would not

nearing completion onhir has backlog of relocatees who are approved for replacement homes but have not yet received them most families subject to relocation were navajo originally an estimated 3600 eligible navajo families re sided on land part itioned or judicially confirmed to the hopi while only 26 eligible hopi families lived on navajo partitioned land according to onhir data by the end of fy2005 according to onhir 98 of the currently eligible na vajo families and 100 of the hopi families had completed relocation in addition however onhir timates that about half of roughly 250 navajo families not all of them eligible fa milies who live on hopi land and signed accommodation agreements under pl 104301 that allow them to stay on hopi land under hopi law may wish to opt out of these agreements and relocate using onhir benefits onhir estimated that as of the end of fy2 005 83 eligib navajo families were awaiting relocation eight of thes 83 families still reside d on hopi partitioned land one of these families was seeking relocation home and the other seven refused to relocate or sign an accommodation ag reement onhir and the us department of justice were negotiating with the hopi tribe to allow the seven families to stay on hopi land as autonomous families in retu rn for onhirs relocating off hopi landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34011crs66 45 the number of families is estimated altogether at around 75 they overlap to an unpredicted extent with the 83 eligible navajo families 46 smithsonian instituti on illumination annual report 2006 this and earlier annual

onhir had estimated that relocation moves for currently eligible familie s would be completed by the end of fy2006 however the addition of navajo fa milies who opt out of accommodation agreements and of navajo families who f iled late applications or ppeals but whom onhir proposes to accommodate to avoid litigation45 would mean that all relocation moves would not be completed until the end of fy2008 according to onhir this schedule for completion of relocations would depend on infrastructure needs and relocatees decisions in addition required postmove assistance to relocatees would necessitate another two years of expend itures after the last reloca tion move whether in fy2006 or fy2008 congress has been concerned at times bout the speed of the relocation process and about avoiding forced reloca tions or evictions in the 109th congress legislation passed the senate but not the house to sunset onhir in 2008 and transfer any remaining duties to the secretary of the inte rior further longstanding proviso in onhir appropriations lang uage retained for fy2008 prohibits onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi pa rtitioned lands unless replacement home were provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating navajo families because of onhirs b acklog of approved relocatees awaiting replacement homes as the backlog is reduced however forced eviction may become an issue if any remaining navajo families were to refuse relocation and if the hopi tribe were to exercise ri ght under pl 104301 to begin legal action against the united states for failure to give the hopi tribe quiet possession of all hopi partitioned lands the purpose of th negotiations among onhir the justice department and the hopi tribe ntioned above was to avoid

the level of commitment by the federal government to implement restoration activities in the everglades some observers measure commitment by the frequency and number of projects authorized under cerp

assert that the federal commitment will be measurable by the amount of federal funding for construction expected when the first proj ects break ground in the next few years some state and federal officials contend that federal funding will increase compared to state funding as cerp projects move beyond design into construction still othe rs question whether the federal government shoul d maintain the current leve l of funding or increase its commitment because of escalatin g costs and project delays concerns over phosphorus mitigation since fy2004 interior appropriations laws have conditioned funding for the modified water deliveries project based on meeting state water quality standards f unds appropriated in the laws and any prior laws for mod waters would be provided unless
