identified by the office for domestic preparedness excess radiological detection and related equipment obtained mainly from department of energy sites likely future issue is the appropriate size and role of such program should congress expand it to foreign recipients permit it to accept excess equipment from nongovernmental sources or specify the types of equipment it should provide order code rs21491 updated december 19 2003 crs report for congress received through the crs web first responder resources the homeland defense equipment reuse program description and issues jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21491 summary there has been general support for providing additional equipment to state and local first responders to help them deal with potential terrorist attacks the homeland defense equipment reuse hder program is small program operated jointly by the department of energy doe and the office for domestic preparedness odp of the department of homeland security dhs hder gives first responders identified by odp excess radiological detection and related equipment obtained mainly from doe sites and the navy1 it was established in 2002 as pilot project for large metropolitan areas to determine if there was sufficient supply and demand based on their experience doe and dhs decided to continue hder as program for first responders nationwide beginning june 1 2003 likely future issue is the appropriate size and role of such program should congress expand it to foreign recipients permit it to accept excess equipment from nongovernmental sources or specify the types of equipment it should provide this report will be updated as appropriate description states and communities are expressing with increasing urgency concern that they need more resources to prepare for terrorist attacks in their view the threat is increasing their resources are shrinking and the federal government is imposing requirements on 1 see u s department of homeland security office for domestic preparedness homeland defense equipment reuse program hder program fact sheet june 2003

programs summary by shawn reese congressional research service the library of congress crs2 them while not providing sufficient resources to meet these requirements many members of congress and president bush have echoed their concern hder is small program that meets some needs for equipment by first responders it was established by an interagency agreement effective june 5 2002 between odp at the time part of the department of justice and the office of assets utilization national center of excellence for materials recycle aunmr of does oak ridge tn operations office2 odp moved from justice to dhs on march 1 2003 it is operated jointly by odp which links to the user community and training and aunmr which links to equipment providers it was operated as pilot program until march 31 2003 followed by twomonth period to complete orders taken under the pilot program hder began as national program with equipment available to all states territories and the district of columbia on june 1 2003 the program obtains excess equipment for radiation monitoring laboratory analysis personal safety and facility security from doe sites and to lesser extent from other federal agencies the equipment typically older but serviceable became excess in several ways some was replaced by newer equipment some was longer needed when httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21491 doe nuclear weapons production sites or facilities shut down because of the smaller post cold war workload and some that was purchased to decontaminate specific facility became excess when that task ended one source of equipment was does brookhaven ny national laboratory which operated graphite research reactor from 1950 to 1968 decommissioning still underway as of december 2003 began in 2000 as it proceeded some geiger counters and other radiation detection equipment were longer needed and were provided to hder another source was the environmental protection agencys environmental radiation laboratory in montgomery which provided hder with several dozen instruments third source is the navy which in august 2003 agreed to provide radiation detectors that it is replacing with newer models the units some new in the box have retail value of about 1400 apiece the navy delivered 1950 units to aunmr from yorktown and san diego in september 2003 aunmr expects the navy ultimately to provide over 7000 of these units the potential exists for the navy to provide large quantities of additional equipment to hder equipment available through hder includes radiation monitoring geiger counters handheld dose rate meters count rate meters for contamination surveys field gas monitoring systems laboratory equipment benchtop laboratory analytical equipment gloveboxes airtight boxes with rubber gloves sealed onto ports to permit work with hazardous materials personal safety gas masks pocket dosimeters for measuring the radiation dose an individual receives and respirators and 2 interagency agreement between the us

and inventories acceptable pieces odp lists its inventory at the beginning of each calendar quarter on secure internet site available to each states point of contact odp authorizes the distribution of equipment mainly on firstcome firstserved basis but works with requesters to make sure that requests are consistent with their needs au nmr then ships the equipment to first responders paperwork is minimal jurisdictions need only complete property transfer form to receive equipment all other transfer information is electronic odp provides training for recipients in cooperation with the us armys pine bluff arsenal3 for fy2002 odp awarded grant of 40000 to the health physics society hps professional organization focusing on radiation safety hps members support hder at the local level by maintaining and calibrating equipment providing refresher training for first responders in the use of equipment and responding to questions from users4 hps established this partnership with odp because its members had expertise in this area httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21491 and wanted to offer their services on behalf of preparedness against terrorism hps members provide services on voluntary basis the funds are for equipmentrelated and incidental expenses as pilot program hder focused on providing instruments to the ten largest us metropolitan areas recipients included suburbs transit systems etc as well as the major cities by may 31 2003 it had distributed all equipment ordered 1601 pieces to the boston detroit angeles new york philadelphia san francisco washington chicago dallas and houston metro areas program managers placed the value of this equipment at 929651 training requested by the recipients for using the equipment was completed by the end of 2003 the cost of the pilot program was minimal aunmr spent 72800 of its own funds by march 31 2003 to receive the units and ensure that they were operable odp provided 60000 to aunmr of which the latter had spent 21790 through may 31 2003 to handle and ship the units also as of that date hps had spent 5500 of the 40000 grant as national program hder transferred 4291 units between june 1 and december 15 2003 with an estimated value of 113 million the equipment went to ten states and 3 us department of justice office of justice programs office for domestic preparedness homeland defense equipment reuse program hder

odp allocated 510390 for fy2003 to hder of which it provided 328300 to aunmr and 182090 to hps from the start of the pilot program aunmr has spent some 42000 of odp funds on hder as of september 30 2003 aunmr funds are to be available until expended hps funds are to be available for 24 months aunmr funds derive from the defense environmental restoration and waste management account fy2003 odp funds come from that organizations technical assistance budget like odp aunmr maintains that the program is economical doe had several choices for the disposition of excess or obsolete equipment disposal sale or reuse disposal would have cost about 40 unit because much of the equipment contains radioactive material or other hazardous waste such as lead silver and mercury that would have to be disposed of in specified ways at that rate disposing of the 1601 units distributed would have cost some 64000 the cost of administering sales to the public through auction would doe estimates have exceeded the proceeds in similar program aunmr distributed 28 instruments internationally through the international atomic energy agency iaea for use in responding to industrial httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21491 accidents as well as terrorist threats5 specifically aunmr provided instruments to iaea at the request of the state department to help locate abandoned radioactive sources in the republic of georgia in another program related to hder odp provided radiation detection instruments to the us public health services noble hospital training center at ft mcclellan in anniston to assist in training hospital personnel to deal with casualties from weapons of mass destruction6 issues for congress should the program be halted kept at low level or expanded once doe has distributed excess equipment currently at doe sites there might not be enough additional equipment available to support continued hder activity alternatively small but continuing flow of equipment may become obsolete or unneeded in that case maintaining hder at low level might be possible finally nondoe sources such as other government agencies and corporations have excess equipment for example the navys nuclear program discussed providing hder some 7000 instruments it plans to replace and mgp instruments corporation offered to provide old instruments such as for radiation monitoring being returned for replacement by its nuclear power industry customers if hder were to become able to accept this equipment an issue discussed below the program might be expanded should hder provide equipment to foreign requesters given the terrorist threat and the resources currently available to first responders hder equipment is available only to domestic users congress might elect to use hder to provide equipment to foreign nations as well on grounds that the shortage of equipment abroad especially in less developed countries is more severe than in the united states and that supporting foreign efforts to respond to terrorist threats such as by securing radioactive 5 doe homeland defense equipment reuse program 6 for information on the center see odp fact sheet center for domestic preparedness in anniston alabama httpwwwojpusdojgovodpdocsfscdphtm crs5 materials could reduce the risk of terrorist attack on the united states and its allies at the same time it may well prove desirable to reserve most equipment for us users to satisfy both goals equipment might be made available overseas only 1 on an urgent ad hoc basis at the request of us government agency as in the case of the republic of georgia discussed above or 2 if the pieces are unlikely to be used at home because more recent equipment for given task is available or because the program has large stocks of particular item how should the program handle equipment donated by organizations outside the federal government corporations universities hospitals and other organizations have excess equipment that could be of use to first responders some have already offered equipment to hder such donations would benefit corporations by saving them the expense of disposal and perhaps providing tax deductions the program however is unable to accept such equipment based on an interpretation of federal appropriations law according to the general accounting office while gifts to the united states do not require statutory authority gifts to an individual federal agency stand on different footing the rule is that government httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21491 agency may not accept for its own use ie for retention by the agency or credit to its own appropriations gifts of money or other property in the absence of specific statutory authority7 while the equipment received by hder is transferred to nonfederal agencies and so is not intended for retention by the agency or credit to its own appropriation the office of the chief counsel of does oak ridge operations office interprets the language cited above to apply on grounds that 1 doe does not have statutory authority to accept gifts and 2 doe by using its own funds to check out the instruments converts the instruments to its own use because it cannot accept such equipment hder has link with the health physics society hps whereby hps accepts and checks out equipment from nonfederal sources and distributes it to first responders as noted hps partnered with hder to support preparedness efforts it accepts nonfederal equipment as an augmentation of not the reason for the partnership this approach complies with the foregoing interpretation of law on the other hand hder program officers argue that hders inability to accept donations of instruments from nonfederal sources reduces the effectiveness of the program if aunmr could accept all offerings then odp could select from larger inventory and wider variety of equipment to meet first responders needs options include maintaining the current arrangement with hps granting doe explicit statutory authority to accept gifts of this sort or asking for additional analysis of does current statutory limitations should hder attempt to fill gaps in its coverage supplydriven program can only provide equipment made available to it hder increases the utility of this equipment by assembling individual pieces into kits and by using odps expertise 7 us general accounting office office of the general counsel principles of federal appropriations law second edition volume ii chapter 6 section e3 p 6141 gaoogc92 13 available at httpwwwcfodoegovbudgetgao crs6 to help match equipment to needs of the requester8 on the other hand hder is not intended to provide comprehensive suite of equipment for nuclear or radiological incidents if such goal proved desirable there would be several options hder could seek donations from other government agencies or if permissible from other organizations of equipment needed to complement what it already has perhaps becoming national clearinghouse for excess wmd preparedness and response equipment for first responders if provided the funds it could purchase such equipment in bulk to complement items in its inventory as distinct from odps equipment grant program which provides funds directly to states and localities9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21491 8 hder offers three radiological instrument kits one for the nontechnical user performing screening activities another for emergency responders controlling the scene of radiological incident and third for the health physics practitioner to assist in
