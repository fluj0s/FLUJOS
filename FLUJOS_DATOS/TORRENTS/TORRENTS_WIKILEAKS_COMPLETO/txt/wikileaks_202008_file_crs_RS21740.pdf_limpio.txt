termination tadlock cowan analyst in natural resources and rural development policy resources science and industry division summary the 2008 farm bill rminates authority for the conservation security program except for existing contract holders and authorizes new cons ervation stewardship program the conservation security progra m csp authorized in the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 is voluntary program providing financial and technical assistance for conservation and improve ment of natural resources on tr ibal and private working lands within selected watersheds csp is administered by usdas natural resource conservation service nrcs and funded th rough the commodity credit corporation financial assistance is based on three tiers of participati on with each tier representing higher degree of resource management sta ndards contracts extend from 5 to 10 years the first enrollment for csp was in july 2004 covering 18 watersheds in 22 states second enrollment in november 2005 was implemented in 220 watersheds nationwide these two enrollments resulted in 15000 contracts with landowners on 121 million acres of working agricultural lands third enrollment period was announced in february 2006 for 60 watershe ds including ones in guam and the caribbean in that year 4323 contracts were accepted adding more than 36 million acres new contracts were signed in fy2007 fourth and final csp signup for eligible farms and ra nches in 51 new watersheds peri od ended in may 2008 this report will not be updated background new conservation stewardship program the 2008 farm bill pl 110 246 terminates authority for the conservation security program to make any new contracts and reauthorizes th program at 23 billion in funding only for payments under the contracts made during 2004 2005 2006 and 2008 the farm bill authorizes new conservation stewardship program throug h fy2017 section 2301 similar aspects of the original csp will continue in the ne w stewardship program although there are significant changes as well rather than the threetier payment system payments for new csp contracts will be base d on meeting or exceeding stewardship threshold payments area based on the actual costs of installing conservation measures any forgonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21740crs2 1 map of the 51 new participating watershe ds may be found at httpwwwnrcsusdagov programscspcsp_20082008_csp_wshtml 2 federal register vol73 60 pp 1624616259 march 27 2008income and the value of the expected envi ronmental outcomes rather than 10year contracts new stewardship contracts will be for 5 years with the option of an extension for an additional 5 years the new csp also reserves 5 of the funds each for beginning farmers and ranchers and disadvantaged farmer s and ranchers mon itoring and evaluation of the stewardship plan to assess environmenta l effectiveness is also an element of the new csp the enacted farm bill sets target of enrolling 128 million acres annually under the new csp individual producer payments are limited to 200000 in any 5year period per entity rather than annual signups for th program csp enrollment will be done on continuous basis technical ssistance is also be provided to specialty crop and organic producers along with pilot testing of producers who engage in innovative new technologies or participate in onsite conservation researc h producers may also receive supplemental payments for resourceconservi ng crop rotations that provide specific environmental benefits such as improving soil fertility and reducing the need for irrigation the remainder of this report discusses the conser vation security program as authorized in the 2002 farm bill 2008 csp signup nrcs announced final csp signup to run from april 18 2008 to may 17 2008 in 51 new watersheds1 the federal register notice stated that nrcs intends to deliver technically enhanced streamlined version of csp for the signup2 the signup will pilot several new eligibility tools for soil and water grazing lands and wildlife habitat payments will be made uniformly over the fiveyear contract period rather than declining over the contr act period as they do for current contracts there will be contract imp rovement modification opportun ities or payments for new practices as with previous csp contracts as was the case with the 2006 signup priority will be given to tier ii and tier iii applications csp in the 2002 farm bill the conservation security program csp is an agricultural conservation program authorized by the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 2001 csp is administered by the us department of agricultures natural resource conservation service nrcs it provides incentives for farmers to pursue conservation and helps pay for conservati on practices unlike some othe r agricultural conservation programs csp provides payments for conser vation on land that remains in production and makes eligible wide ra nge of farmland cropland past ureland rangeland grassland prairie land tribal lands and forested lands incidental to an agricultural operation by statute csp payments to farmers are based on three levels or tiers of participation with each successive tier obligating the producer to meet higher standards of environmental management for tier i the producer must have addressed soil qua lity and water quality to the described minimum level of treatment for eligible land useshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21740crs3 3 the ccc wholly owned government corporati on is essentially the financing institution for the usdas farm price and income support progra ms and

contracts for tier i last for five years and are capped at 20000 annually for tier ii the producer must have addressed soil quality and water quality to the described minimum level of treatment on all eligible land uses on the entire agricultural operation prior to acceptance and must agree to address one add itional resource by the end of the contract period contracts for tier ii last for 510

guide standard s on all eligible land uses on the entire agricultural operation before acceptance into the program and have riparian zones adequately treated contracts for tier iii last for 510 years and are capped at 45000 annually the 2002 farm bill placed acreage or funding limits on the csp and stated that in entering into conservation security contr acts nrcs shall not use competitive bidding or any similar procedure at the time of enactment the congressional budget office cbo estimated that csp would cost 20 b illion over ten years later projections increased the cost see below csp is funded by mandatory spending through the borrowing authority of the commodity credit corporation3 csp appropriations fy2002fy2008 during the 2002 fa rm bill debate some raised concerns about the potential costs of csp and the wisdom of devoting unlimited funding to new unproven pr ogram but pressures to complete action on the farm bill overcame those concerns csp received funding in fy2002 in 2003 cbo revised its estimate of csp costs to 68 billion ove r ten years and th fy2003 c onsolidated appropriations resolution limited spending for csp to 37 billion through fy2013 to offset the cost of farm disaster assistance4 the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act eliminated this 10year cap but estab lished an fy2004 csp oneyear funding limit of 414 million5 in march 2004 cbo revised its

previous years implementation of csp on january 2 2004 nrcs published proposed rule describing how it would prioritize the limite d fy2004 funding it proposed to implement csp in certain watersheds on rotating basis to require producers to meet strict eligibility criteria to sort producers applications into enrollment categories and to reduce certain csp payments 69 federal register 194 this proved controve rsial since the farm bill included broad eligibility criteria and did not include pr ioritizing funds nrcs received over 20000 specific comments on the proposed rule on may 4 nrcs published notice stating it would proceed with its pr oposed approach for the 2004 csp signup and detailed how it would lect watersheds 69 federal register 24560 on june 21 2004 nrcs published an interim final rule 69 federal register 34502 finalizing its prioritization process for the 2004 csp sig nup nrcs accepted comments on the interim final rule through october 5 2004 and published an amended interim final rule on march 25 2005 final rule has not been issued nd is unlikely to be issued before the 2008 farm bill is enacted an dditional 202 watersheds nationw ide were selected for the second csp enrollment in 2005 for 2006 60 more watersheds were selected including ones in the caribbean and guam for the 2008 signup 51 new wate r sheds were added bringing the total number of pa rticipating wate rsheds to 3318 eligibility criteria for the fy2004fy2008 enrollments the csp enrollment process is currently guided by the interim final rule issued on march 25 2005 enrollment requi rements include strict elig ibility criteria and prioritize csp funding by watershed area and by enrollme nt categories nrcs calls this approach rewarding the best nd motivating the rest producer eligibility requirements the 2002 farm bill set fairly general guidelines for eligibility in the csp pr oducers must share in the risk of production contribute to farm operations in manner commensurate with revenues received develop an approved conservation security plan that details conservation activities to be implemented and sign conservation security contract the interim rule mandates the following further steps producers must inventory natural resources the interim rule 14697a requires producers to complete selfassessment including benchmark condition inventory prior to applying to csp this details the type of agricultural operation land uses existing conservation practices resource concerns and the producers willingnesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21740crs5 9 according to the nrcs determining soil qua lity involves evaluating the amount of organic matter in the soil its fitness as seedbed and other factors assessing water quality involves evaluating the level of pesticides nutrients turbidity or other contaminants in water 10 the federal register announcement for the fy2006 enrollmen t provides detailed information on the criteria of different enrollment categories see 71 federal register 62506263 february 7 2006 to do additional conservation in the future nrcs uses this to determine the producers eligibility place the producer in an enrollment category see below and determine the appropriate csp tie r of participation pr oducers must submit two years of documentation to show past stewardship including fertilizer pesticide and nutrient application schedules and tilling and grazing schedules producers must treat both soil and water while the farm bill required producers to treat at least one resource unde r csp the interim final rule requires producers to treat two resources soil and water quality before applying to the program9 additional eligibility criteria were included in the 2005 and 2006 enrollment notices csp applications prioritized the interim final rule established two methods of prioritizing applications neither of which was mentioned in the farm bill statute the first includes ranking watershe ds nationwide by various crite ria and selecting certain of those watersheds to be eligib for csp the second invol ves placing applications into various enrollment categories based on the applicants current conservation efforts and willingness to do add itional conservation criteria for selecting eligible watersheds for the 2004 signup nrcs ranked over 2000 watershe ds nationwide through nati onal resources i nventory data nrcs ranked watersheds base d on concentrations of eligible land uses intensity of pesticide fertilizer and manure use and prevalence of historic and recent conservation efforts once watersheds were ranked nrcs prioritized them further by selecting those it considered to be improving according to these criteria nrcs estimated in 2004 that by 2012 csp could rotate th rough all 2264 watersheds nrcs places applications in enrollment categories for the fy2006 enrollment there were five categories ae and five groups 15 within each tier acreage is enrolled based on the ranking of grazing and cropping systems on various soil water and wildlife habitat quality indicators and performancemanagement levels categories were funded nationa lly in priority order beginning with category until funding was exhausted the fy2006 notice also specified that if subcategories cannot be fully funded applicants would be ffered the fy2006 csp contract payment on prorated basis10 stewardship or base payment this is payment tied to the number of acres enrolled in csp the stewardship component is calculated separa tely for each land use by multiplying the number of acres times the tier factor 515 times the stewardship payment rate established for the watershed based on land rental rates times the tier reduction factor 2575 this reduction factor was not authorized in the original legislation and reduces this part of the csp payment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21740crs6 11 see crs report rl34010 wto compliance status of the conservation security program csp and the conservation reserve program crp payments for new and existing practices the farm bill restricts payments for new and existing practices to not more than 75 of the practice cost this rises to 90 for beginning farmers and ranchers fo r fy2006 contracts existing practice payments were calculated as flat rate of 25 of the stewardship payment and new practice payments were made at not more than 50 costshare rate fo r fy2006 all new practice payments were limited to 10000 cumu lative total for the contract enhancement payments the farm bill lists five activities participant can carry out that qualify for enhancement payments including implementing multiple conservation practices addressing local conservation priorities participating in onfarm research participating in watershed or regional conservation pl an and assessing and evaluating conservation activities the interim final rule specified only two types of enhancement components as available in the fy2004 signup for fy2006 the enhancement payment was calculated at variable payment rate for activities that were part of the benchmark inventor the total of all enhancem ent payments to an individual producer in any one year ranges from 13750 to 28125 depending on the tier issues for congress with termination of csp further implementation issues may be minimal some existing tier ii and tier iii contracts could run til fy2018 but the new stewardship contracts are likely to involve greater acreage currently 154 llion acres are under csp contracts from the 20042006 signups the new stewardship program authorizes up to 12769000 acres annually for fy2009fy 2017 while implementation of the stewardship program may raise new issues th experience with csp could attenuate other concerns with csp congressional authorizers crafted an entitlement program with unlimited funding but congressional appropria tors limited that funding authorizers specified broad eligibility criteria in the farm bill but due to funding limits nrcs created strict procedures that applicants had to follow in order to qualify nrcs argues that because the farm bill placed statutory 15 limit on csp technical assistance csp implementation will be constrained the newly authorized conservation stewardship program could avoid similar cerns although technical assi stance concerns may persist under the potentially greater acreage enrollment csps potential status as green box program under the world trade organization wto structure is an issue although the pr ogram is comparatively small while csps green box status is arguably possible advant age to the program others have raised the concern that current csp base and enhancement payments might be considered trade distorting under wto guidelines11 in wto parlance green box programs which pay producers for environmental services are not subject to reductions under the wto csp payments through 2005 have been notified to the wto as green box some csp spending however may not conform to wto criteria although the program has not been formally challenged given that the prog rams authority to make new contracts is now terminated the chance of potential challenges may have been minimized the new payment structure of the stewardship program was designed to minimize similar challenges under wto regulations
