departments and agencies even though these may have been cr eated by statute in part to coordinate broad policy area and combine related agencies the study also excludes informal organizational arrangements such as the presidents cabinet 2there is authoritative comprehensive count of interagency mechanisms in part because of the difficulty in locating them throughout th government and in part because of changes in their number especially for working groups nd task forces over time nonetheless the total is likely is be high largely because of the sheer magnitude of crosscutting and overlapping programs and the contemporary reliance on such coordinative devices especially at the operational and working group level along these lines the comptroller general head of the general accounting office gao has noted that virtually all of the results that the federal government strives to achieve require the concerted and coordinated efforts of two or more agencies even though he

establishing au thority that provide coordination in policy areas involving number of parate independent agencies1 the devices and arrangements which have proliferated and gained prominence recently range from the office of homeland security ohs to the national security council nsc the drug czar and multiplicity of joint operational task forces these entities numbering in the hundreds2 can be categorized among seven different types which vary in significant ways they raise competing rationales and objections have been established and have evolved for different reasons and in different time

6conditions in the past of course also br ought about realignment efforts to improve interagency coordination either through merger s and consolidations of units or through various coordinative devices most ambitious along these lines was the creation of new national security establishment in the afterm ath of wwii and early phase of the cold war this occurred with passage of the national security act of 1947 50 usc 401 et seq resulting in several new or reconstituted agen cies the department of defense which consolidated the existing military services along with the new air force the national security council the central intelligence agen cy and the director of central intelligence other interagency coordinative concerns both ma jor and minor have been addressed in the past by congress and the executive as well as by private organizations see for example us congress senate committee on government operations subcommittee on reorganization and international organizations

relevant responsibilitieshave been on the drawing board since october 2001 even if such new establishment replacing the office of homeland security were constructed various devices and powers would be necessary to ensure c oordination between the new department and continuing agencies with rela ted responsibilities and jurisdicti ons proposals along this line are discussed belowseparate federal tities involved in policymaking and policy impleme ntation the resulting overlap of jurisd iction sharing of responsibilities and fragmentation of policymaking among agencies and the establishment of new policy priorities that cross older policy lines and institutional boundaries7 the support for new coordinative mechanisms also results from the inability to achieve or delay in achieving more fundamental changes such as major reorganizations8 consequently interagency entities are at least possible if not ideal alternative to such other transformations and because creating interagency coordinative mechanisms is less difficult than completing major reorganizations the coordinative devices could be modified replaced or abo lished more easily than new departments or agencies if policy pr iorities political demands and societal conditions change the development and impleme ntation of public policies arguably are expected to benefit from formalized coordination mechanisms both to eliminate or limit dysfunctions and to provide support structur for enhanced effectiveness ideally these coordinating devices should help minimize or mitigate the impact of rivalry among the entities duplication of effort avoidance of responsibility and working at crosspurposes they should also help imp rove policy effectiv eness in number of ways these include increases or suggest ed improvements in various areas the availability and concentrati on of resources for priority policies cooperation among the involved units which would be work ing on behalf of common purpose and at the behest of common leader integration of distinct but reinforcing responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions among rela tively autonomous agencies recognition of responsibility and credit or blame for particular activities and operations and accountability of the various components by consolidating re view and reporting requirements objections objections to such devices might also be raised in several areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31357crs5 first interagency coordinative entities might be seen as adding another layer of bureaucracy to policy area thereby increasing costs and introducing new inefficiencies and organizational riva lries rather than reducing them the genesis of some inte ragency coordinative devices is the establishment of new policy priorities yet these new mandates might have only temporary appeal while the new mechanisms could survive indefinitely as corollary the coordinative device may itself become an entrenched entity thereby increasing future costs and difficulties in realigning rele vant functions dutie s and responsibilities interagency coordinative mechanisms might also be criticized from two competing viewpoints as being too weak or too strong some entities might be faulted for not being given enough power to accomplish their purposes their extent of author ity range of jurisdiction and breadth of responsibilities may not be sufficient to provide meaningful coordination and forced cooperation among number of separa agencies because of the devices establishment expectations are raised but because of its weaknesses the expectations may remain unmet this in turn could result in loss of credibility for the interagency operation and support for the policy along these same lines critics might contend that new inte ragency coordinative devices might function only as half measures what is needed opponents might say is more complete wideranging reorganization this could include for in stance transferring related components from various departments or agencies into an existing agency or merging these interrelated entities into an entirely new agency which would consolidate responsibility for carrying out policy by contrast other intera gency entities might be accuse d of possessing too much power thereby interfering with the respons ibilities of depa rtment and agency heads for instance an interagency office with formal or informal power over the budgets and spending plans of outside units coul d conceivably undercut the priorities and operations of these constituent agencies an d their parent agencies this action in turn could erode the effec tiveness of the parent agen cy and reduce its responsibility for carrying out its other missions variations interagency coordinative entities lack standardization and uniformity consequently particul ar device is an identical match for another they differ from each other in number of ways location l eadership and membership characteristics enabling authority and permanency and pow ers responsibilities and jurisdictions location leadersh ip and membership significant variations exist among these units in their location leadership and membership characteristics for instance while several of these mechanisms are integral parts of an agency heads offi ce and powers others exist independentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31357crs6 consisting of representatives from number of agencies and headed by chairperson designated in the establishing authority the positions and level of officials that make up the memberships also differ three entities ie the nsc hsc and us freedom corps council consist of the president and vice president along with sp ecified agency heads while others are made up of department and agency heads along with officials from the executive office of the president in some cases ot hers by comparison are composed of sub cabinet officials such as deputy directors deputy or assistant secretaries and senior officials from various agenci and the eop still others especially working groups and operational task forces consist of personnel from rele vant agencies selected by higher echelon agency official or an in teragency unit seve ral officers including the director of central intelligence dci and the director of the secret service moreover possess authority to direct the activities and operations of other agencies and one ie the dci has express author ity to review approve and change their budgets and spending plans by contrast other coordinative devices lack these explicit substantial powers instead relying on their authority to review and reportto the president congress ot her agencies and the publicon relevant activities and operations or in the case of working groups and task forces carrying out the policies and projects assi gned by higher level officers enabling authority and permanency the devices also differ in enabling authority and permanency some are permanent entities created by public law or executive order while others such as those set up by presidential directive ve been subject to change abolition or replacement still others are intended to be ad hoc temporary structures such as interagency working groups brought togeth er by supervising unit or official through administrative directives or orders or jointly by memoranda of agreement moas or memoranda of understanding mous powers responsibiliti and jurisdictions the extent of powers breadth of res ponsibilities and range of jurisdictions of these organizations and arrangementsde rived from public laws executive orders presidential directives administrative or ders or mousalso differ for some entities responsibilities are specialized aff ecting narrow scope of activities powers are few and qualified and juri sdictions are circumscribed for others by contrast responsibilities are expansive powers ar many and jurisdictions are wide creation and evolution finally such coordinative mechanisms have been established modified over time abolished outright or merged with other units these actions have occurred in response to changes in societal conditions political needs and demands elected and appointed officials and public policy priorities as well as perceptions of the mechanisms effectivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31357crs7 types of coordinative devices the combination of these

arrangement task forces and working groups are designed to meet operational needs in executing policies or to provide suppor t to other offices in carrying out their responsibilities this involves transferring personnel from different agencies that have shared responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions for example organized crime drug enforcement task forces were established to deal with

authority final set of examples of arrangements that involve inte ragency coordination are crossdesignating agents and putizing personnel to hold certain law enforcement powers crossdesignation crossdesignating agents involves the transfer of authority from one agency to personnel in nother crossdesignation allows agents of one unit to perform the duties and us the authority of another agency with overlapping jurisdiction or responsibilitie s one illustration involves the us customs service in the treasury department and the immigration and naturalization service border patrol in the justice department each of whose agents may be authorized to carry out the duties and use th powers of the other this transfer of authority can result in inspections at ts of entry being conducted by single agency rather than both or at least in llowing one to be the primary inspector and the other the secondary it can also re sult in initial searches for contraband in between such ports being conducted by the border patrol instead of being shared with customs which could be called to the scene if the situation warranted for followup operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31357crs32 89justice

federal departments or agenci and from state and local governments as well as the private sector89 this power has been used historically to expand the capacity and capabilities of us marshals deputizing personnel from other federal agencies or elsewhere allows marshal to use these r ecruits to assist in the performance of his or her law enforcement duties on an ad hoc temporary basis nd under the marshals supervision different reason for special deputation also exists to grant police powers to other federal agencies which lack them so that they can enforce laws under their jurisdiction independently for specific ope ration or for specified duration this design permits personnel outsi the justice department criminal investigators in offices of inspector general for instance to carry firearms make arrests and execute warrants90 with these powers the recipi ents can conduct law enforcement operations on their own rather than relying on other federal stat or local officers to do so while this kind of special deput ation allows the receiving entity to operate in the field alone the recipients must ve the approval of th marshals service to acquire the police powers in th first place and again later on if they want to renew the authority as an outgrowth of this the initial grant along with its use and renewal gives the marshals service oppor tunity to track the operations of the deputized personnel coordina them with its own projects if they overlap and assess the performance and results concluding observations federal interagency coor dinative mechanisms have become prevalent and prominent recently as means of fo stering cooperation and support among government agencies they range from such wellestablished entities as the national security council to the office of homeland security and from such highly visible devices as the drug czar to nearly anony mous joint task forces and field working groups now numbering in the hundreds the devices can be categorized among seven distinct types these differ in rms of their location and membership powers and responsibilities enabling authority nd permanency and establishment and evolution their contemporary growth in quantity and importance has occurred for variety of reasons among these are the expansion of federal responsibilities both foreign and domestic additions in the numbe r and types of government organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31357crs33 implementing policy increases in the complexity and interrelated nature of public policies and changes in policy priorities these developments have resulted in higher incidence of shared responsibilities overlapping jurisdictions crosscutting programs and fragmentation of polic implementation among agencies interagency devices are viewed as way of overcoming these obstacles to cooperation and coordina tion among entities and thereby improving the effectiveness and efficiency of policy implementation this can be accomplished moreover in relatively quick and straig htforward fashion by comparison to broad scale reorganizations such as mergers and transfers of separate agencies different coordinative models moreove r can be adopted or ad apted for different purposes and under different circumstances noneth eless some coordinative devices have aroused concerns about their impact and implications certain devices have been viewed as setting up another bureaucratic layer and potentially rival organization as being too weak to meet their mandates or alternately as being too strong thus interfering with other responsib ilities of agencies under the coordinators jurisdiction finally in cases where executive orders and presidential directives govern the devices their creation and cont rol can circumvent the legislative process and present problems for congressional oversight
