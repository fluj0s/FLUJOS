connection summary even at times when the inflation rate shows little indication that it is about to rise significantly many economists feel that there is some risk of that happening as unemployment rate falls to near 5 there are those who consider an unemployment rate below 5 to be unsustainable or at least incompatible with continued low rates of inflation it might seem strange th at an economy with both low unemployment and low inflation could be considered source of concern but many economists believe that it may not be possible to keep them both low for very long the experience of the united states in the 1960s suggested that there was tradeoff between the unemployment rate and th rate of inflation this tradeoff was known as the phillips curve and was based on the fact that unexpected increases in prices reduced real wages increas ing the demand for labor and reducing unemployment but any tradeoff that may have existe d in the 1960s disappeared in subsequent years moreover that the failure of the tradeoff to persist had been predicted contributed to the wide acceptance of what is now known as the natural rate hypothesis the tradeoff along the phillips curve was based on errors in inflation expectations but as the price level rises workers eventually realize that real wages are falling and adjust their nominal or money wage demands to reflect the higher level of prices and so preserve their real incomes the increase in real wage demands tends to reverse the drop in the unemployment rate in the long run the unemployment rate tends toward level that is consistent with stable rate of inflation this has been dubbed the natural rate most current point estimates of the natural rate of unemployment fall between 5 and 6 during the 1990s the unemploym ent rate was at or below those levels for some time which led many economists to expect signs of an accelerating in the rate of inflation but the expected rise in inflation failed to materialize in fact perhaps to the surprise of many the inflation rate fell although the inflation rate failed to increase at time when the actual unemployment rate was well below most estimates of the natural rate not all adherents of the natural rate model have rejected it it may be that number of temporary factors including an accele ration in productivity growth which was not yet reflected in wage demands or

crs report rl32274 changing natural rate of unemployment policy issues by marc labonteinflation and unemployment what is the connection the relation between unemployment and inflation has long held the attention of economists for some time it was believed that there was tradeoff between the two that policymakers could exploit in other words lower unemployment rate could be had by tolerating hi gher rate of inflation th at notion is longer widely held at least as regards the long run while minimal unemployment might seem desirable policy goal few economists woul d define full employment as employment for everyone who wants job instead ma ny would argue that full employment is the lowest rate of unemploymen t consistent with stable ra of inflation this rate is known as the natural rate of unemployment some idea of what that rate of unemployment is could be extremely useful to economic policymakers inflation tends to be slow to respond to those changes in policy which affect it the effects of an expansionary monetary policy on inflation for example might not become apparent for some time similarly at times when the inflation rate is relatively high it is likel to respond only slowly to policies designed to bring it down in part because of this characteristic and because policies aimed at reducing inflation may have shortterm economic costs it seems to be the prevalent view that it would be better to avoid increases in inflation altogether perhaps the key characteristic of the natural rate is that it is the lowest rate of unemployment that is sustainable if the natural rate model is correct policymakers seeking to maintain the actual unemployment below the natural rate would eventually have to contend with an accelerating rate of inflation because inflation tends only gradually to respond to changes in underlying economic conditions way of predicting it or of identifying the conditions that are likely to lead to an increase in the inflation rate would be extremely useful to policymakers the natural rate of unemployment has been viewed by many economists as means of measuring tightne ss in the labor market and thus the risk of future increases in the inflation rate1 from the middle of 1997 through september 2001 the civilian unemployment rate was below 5 over that time the inflation rate remained modest continued low inflation in the face of what appeared to be tight labor markets led to some skepticism about the merits of the natural rate theory ltogether but many who still see it as meaningful way of looking at the world are unsure whether

between unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in the united king dom 18621957 further analysis economica feb 1960 pp131factors may have helped to restrain inflation or if the natural rate itself may have fallen so that an unemployment rate below 5 is realistic longrun policy goal this report discusses the volution of the notion of full employment as well as those factors that are believed to determine the level of the natural rate of unemployment recent estimates of it are pres ented as well as an examination of the current uncertainties this report w ill be updated as ec onomic developments warrant the phillips curve in 1958 article that was to become frequently cited reference in the economics literature economist aw phillips reported evidence of an inverse relationship between the rate of increase in wages and the rate of unemployment comparing rates of increase in wages with unemployment rates in britain between 1861 and 1957 ph illips found that as the labor market tightened and the unemployment rate fell money wages tended to rise more rapidly because wage increases are closely correlated with price increases that relationship was widely interpreted as tradeoff between inflation and unemployment2 the implication was that given tradeoff between inflati on and unemployment policymakers could buy lower rate of unemployment at th cost of higher rate of inflation the curve describing this tradeoff b ecame known as the phillips curve stable phillips curve would mean that po licymakers might choos one among several combinations of inflation and unemployment rates that seemed to be most palatable and set that as the goal of macroeconomic policy the us experience of the 1960s did little to disprove that view figure 1 plots annual us unemploymen t rates and consumer price inflation together for the 1960s these data suggested that there was tradeoff for the united states similar to the one found by phillips in britain and that policymakers could target among several combinations of une mployment and infla tion rates depending on their relative distastes for those two economic evils the theoretical explanation for the downwardsloping line describing the trade off between unemployment and inflation depends on the notion of excess demand as long as aggregate demand exceeds economic capacity the unemployment rate will tend to fall and vice versa similarly demand in excess of supply will tend to push up both wages and prices so that rising prices tend to be correlated with falling unemployment3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs3 4 see milton friedman the role of monetary policy the american economic review vol lvii 1 mar 1968 pp 117 also edmund phelps phillips curve expectations

hypothesis in the late 1960s in spite of the sta tistical correlation two economists suggested that there was more to the phillips curve than met the eye they predicted breakdown of the phillips curve they argued that monetary and fiscal policy could be manipulated in such way as to realize particular combination of unemployment and inflation in the short run but that it would only be temporary accomplishment4 this view contended that the tradeoff along the phillips curve was based on the fact that unexpected increases in prices reduced real wages reduction in real wages induces an increase in the demand for labor and the unemployment rate falls as result rise in prices would be ssociated with lower unemployment than under price stability but only til workers caught on to their loss in buying power consequently there is not just single phillips curve but phillips curve for every different possible exp ectation of inflationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs4 5 the term natural rate was originally applied in similar way to interest rates by turnof thecentury economist knut wicksell see m blaug economic theory in retrospect richard d irwin inc homewood illinois 1962 pp 562563similarly an unexpected increase in the rate of inflation would temporarily reduce the rate of increase in real wages and contribute to decrease in the unemployment rate again as long as workers fail to notice the effects of rising prices on their money wages there is likel to be drop in unemployment due to fall in real wages but eventually they will adjust their wage demands to reflect the higher price level or the higher rate of inflation this increase in real wage demands will tend to reverse the drop in the unemp loyment rate in the long run the unemployment rate tends toward level that represents an equilibrium between the supply of labor and demand for it this level was dubbed the n atural rate and is the rate of unemployment consistent with stable rate of inflation5 it is the level to which the unemployment rate tends when the public is not fooled by inflation some economists prefer more clini cal term the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment or nairu at times the natural rate is more loosely referred to as the fullemployment rate of unemployment the term structural unemployment is also used to distinguish longterm effects from business cycle and normal turnover variations in the unemployment rate with efforts to manage demand thr ough fiscal or monetary policy wage adjustments would always be working to move the economy to its natural rate of unemployment either from higher rate or lower one if policy of managing demand is pursued however the adjustment to the natural rate can either be assisted or hindered depending on whet her or not the policy is synchronized with those wage adjustments fiscal or monetary policies may shif t the economy from one point to another along the original phillips curve only as long as workers fail to appreciate changes in the price level or the rate of inflation higher rate of inflation would not mean permanent decline in the unemployment rate eventually other things being equal expectations would adjust and the unemployment rate would tend to return to its natural rate if policy were to push unemployment below the natural rate the rate of inflation would wind up permanently higher after worker s raised their expectation of inflation and there would be new phillips curve describing the tradeoff consistent with that higher expected rate of inflation any shortterm tradeoff between inflation and unemployment would now involve higher rates of inflation th an before this process of shifting the tradeoff could continue as long as policymakers keep trying to push the unemployment rate below its natural level the implication of constantly shifting phillips curve is that in the long run there is tradeoff and that the longrun phillips curve is vertical at the natural rate policymakers cannot expect to choose point on any one phillips curve above or below the natural rate of unemployment and stay therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs5 figure 2 inflation expectations and the phillips curvefigure 2 illustrates this point each phillips curve pe1 pe3 is associated with rate of expected inflation unexpect ed increases in inflation can result in movement along any one of the phillips curves but unless workers can be perpetually fooled an increase in expected inflation will result in an upward shift of the entire curve describing the shortterm tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in the long run the phillips curve pl is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment the only unemployment rate consistent with stable rate of inflation if errors in inflation exp ectations are random and not systematic then there will be tradeoff the longrun phillips curve the vertical line indicates the unemployment rate when inflation expectations turn out to have been correct to the left of the vertical line workers underes timate the inflation rate and the decline in the real wage demanded will tend to reduce unemployment to the right of the vertical line inflation expectations turn out to be too high and the rise in real wage demands will tend to increase unemployment only if workers persistently underpredi ct inflation can the unemployment rate be held below the natural rate but if inflation simply rises to higher rate and stays there it is hard to believe that wage demands would not eventually come to accurately reflect that new rate most economic models incorporating the natural rate hypothesis assume some form of adaptive expectations in other words when expectations of inflation turn out to have been too low then they will be revised upwards and vice versa as longhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs6 6 see adrian throop an evaluation of alternative models of expected inflation federal reserve bank of san francisco economic review summer 1988 adaptive expectations are not the only wa of explaining shortrun tr adeoff between inflation and the unemployment rate see stanley fischer on activist monetary policy with rational expectations in rational expectations and economic policy edited by stanley fischer national bureau of econom ic research 1980 pp 211235 7 evidence from hyperinflations suggests that eventually even everincreasing inflation ceases to fool workersas the inflation rate is steadily rising expectations of inflation will tend to be too low adaptive expectations tend to be characterized by systematic errors if expectations are formed adaptively they adjust to fluctuations in the rate of inflation only after some time has passed an everacceler ating rate of inflation would imply that inflation would be tinually underpredicted in that case real wage demands would tend to fall below levels consistent with the natural rate of unemployment and the actual rate of unemplo yment could be held below the natural rate6 according to this view there is way for policymakers to keep the unemployment rate below the natural rate in the long run but it would require pursuing policy of everaccelerating inflati on in this way assuming that workers are not able to anticipate increases in th rate of inflation increased demand for money wages would always lag slightly behind increases in prices and the real wage would tend to remain below the average level consistent with the natural rate but policy of constantly acceler ating inflation would seem to be prohibitively costly because of this aspect of the model th natural rate hypothe sis is sometimes also referred to as accelerationist7 this view has become widely accepted and is presented in most macroeconomics textbooks one reason for its success is that the argument was made when the original phillips curve id ea still appeared valid but nonetheless it correctly predicted the breakdow n of the apparent tradeoff the 1970s are now well known for the onset of stagflation the simultaneous increase in inflation and unemployment it became evident that policymakers did not have the option of settling for higher rate of inflation in order to reach lower rate of unemployment despite widespread public and press perceptions that stagflation was unexplainable and unexpect ed it had in fact been pr edicted by the natural rate hypothesis several year s before it occurred figure 3 shows what happened to the relationship between the civilian unemployment rate and consumer price infla tion what seems clear is that any trade off that may have existed during the 1960s did not persist there is unique rate of unemployment associated with an particular rate of inflationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs7 figure 3 inflation and unemployment 1970 2003 source department of labor bureau of labor statistics note that in shifting the tradeoff has moved in distinct clockwise pattern the clockwise cycling of unemployment and inflation is believed to be due to the combination of expectations adjustments and policy changes unemployment falls and inflation rises when policymakers attempt to exploit the tradeoff then as inflation expectations rise unemployment tends to rise as wages adjust and inflation continues to increase contractionary policy designed to combat higher inflation causes unemployment to rise further but causes price increases to moderate finally as contractionary policy comes to an end and unemployment begins to fall inflation continues to fall as expectations adjust downward one implication of the absence of any durable tradeoff is that fiscal and monetary policy are limited in their ability to reduce unemployment if unemployment cannot be pushed below the natural rate for very long without generating continuing increases in the rate of inflation that suggests that policymakers might as well aim to keep inflation rates low and find ways to reduce the natural rate itself what determines the natural rate if the rate of inflation does not aff ect the longrun unemployment rate the question naturally arises as to what does the short answer is that unemployment ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs8 8 see robert j gordon macroeconomics scott foresman and company 1990 pp 331 334 also edmund phelps inflation policy and unemployment theory macmillan 1972determined the same way the use of all other commodities is by the interaction of supply and demand the answer is complicat ed by the fact that the aggregate labor market consists of many different labor markets that are differentiated by among other things the nature of skills the level of skills and by geography there are number of factors that re gularly put people out of work anti inflationary monetary policy or an oil price shock may result in substantial increase in joblessness in dynamic economy ch anges in tastes will affect the desired composition of output of goods and services as the mix of goods and services being produced changes demand for labor will decline in some sectors and rise in others naturally it takes time fo r labor to shift from industries th at are in decline into those that are growing similarly changes in technology will raise productivity in some sectors more than in others those fi rms experiencing relatively more rapid productivity growth will have relatively less need for bor which can be better employed in firms experi encing slower productivity growth and requiring more workers per unit of output just as these forces are eliminating some jobs others jobs are opening up in those sectors that experi ence increasing demand the ease with which displaced workers are able to find new employme nt depends on variety of factors if the new jobs being created require substantially different skills from those jobs that have disappeared then it may be difficult for displaced workers to get rehired some of those jobseekers may have skills that are easily transferred from one job to another and thus may not ex perience longterm unemployment those with skills that have become outmoded or are less applicable in those industries that are expanding may have more difficulty finding new work if the general trend is for decline in demand for lessskilled labor and an increase in demand for highly skilled labor then this is more likely to be the case the more of mismatch in skills there is between available jobs and jobseekers the longer it will take for displaced workers to find new jobs and the higher the natural unemployment rate will tend to be8 the longer it takes to overcome any mismatch in the labor market the higher the natural rate will tend to be the extent of retraining regulations or physical relocation required will all affect the time it takes to f ill job vacancies as they occur there are number of factors that may cause the mismatch between skills demanded and those available to persist training for some jobs may only be available within individual firms but employers may limit the amount of time and money they are willing to spend on training because of the risk that having spent those resources on training the employee will not remain with the firm if firms are reluctant to train new employees that is likely to perpetuate any mismatch in the supply of and demand for sk ills in the labor markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs9 educational institutions may be slow to keep up with trends in the firms requirements for skilled labor limited access to educationa l programs may represent another constraint to developing better match between those skills that are required and those that are available some pr ospective students may find it difficult or impossible to acquire financing to pay for college education legal requirements faced by employers may make firms reluctant to hire someone until they are reasonably sure that the employee will be needed for some time and is likely to stay similarly some employers may be reluctant to hire women during their childbearing years for fear that they will not remain long with the firm because these tendencies re strict the supply of labor from which employers are willing to hire they push wages higher and tend to increase unemployment above what it would otherwise be limits to geographical mobility may also account for some of the mismatches in the labor market there are costs both monetary and emotional associated with pulling up stakes and moving to another part of the country in order to get new job it may also be the case that the further re moved job prospect is geographically the less likely it is that jobseeker will even hear about it the increased prevalence of twoearner households in recent years ma have reduced the geographical mobility of the labor force some of the mismatch may be deliberate individuals may remain unemployed for some time not because job is unavailable or because they lack training but because they believe that they can find better job than any that have been offered so far as long as jobseekers believe th at they can do better than any wage offered so far they will continue to search and remain unemployed it may also be that some unemployment is due to individuals in an irregular line of work who remain idle so as to be available when particular j ob begins or person may know particular position is expected to become available nd wait for that opportunity some of this type of unemployment is inevitable race wage or other forms of discrimination in hiring would also tend to exacerbate any existing mismatches in the labor market if an employer shrinks the pool of labor from which he is willing to hi re that reduces the chances that he will find someone with the appropriate skills while some unemployment is attributab to mismatches between the supply of and the demand for labor there is also chronic component to the level of unemployment some individuals skills are so low that what firm might be willing to pay them is not enough to make it worth their while to work some argue that this problem is exacerbated by the minimum wage standard which may prevent some from accepting work at very low wage rates even if they wanted to those who are characterized by chronic unemployment may also be influenced by the availability of welf are benefits which enables them to pass up opportunities for work the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits as well as their longevity might also have an effect on the natural ra employers may find it easier to lay offhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs10 9 see anthony b atkinson and john mick lewright unemployment compensation and labor market transitions critical review journal of economic literature vol

labor market imperfecti ons affect some groups of the labor force more than others then it might be expected that ch anges in the demographic composition of the labor force would be factor explaining variations in the natural rate over time two major demographic shifts affected the labor force during the 1970s one was the large increase in the labor force particip ation rate of women the second was the entrance into the labor force of the babyboom generation why should demographic shifts have any effect on the natural rate some groups have historically expe rienced higher than average rates of unemployment an increase in the labor force share of any one of these groups would tend other things being equal to increase the overall unemployment rate the rising labor force participation rate of women does not ppear to have had much effect on the increase in the natura l rate during the 1970s study published by the labor department reported that between 1959 and 1989 women aged 25 and over actually experienced belowaverage rates of unemployment suggesting that an increase in their participation rates woul d have been an unlikely reason for any increase in overall unemployment instead most of the change in unemployment attributable to demographi c factors was found to be due to the increased share of young people in the labor force10 the effect these factors have on the leve l of the natural rate of unemployment varies over time figure 4 shows the natural rate as estimated by the congressional budget office cbo since 1949 as we ll as the actual rate of civilian unemployment11

bureau of labor statistics although the natural rate ma be insensitive to fiscal and monetary policy shifts there are other policies that may have some effect since public policy is unlikely to have

employment or training subsidies reducing or eliminating the minimum wage or establishing youth subminimum wage loans for vocational training nd youth apprenticeships critics of the natural rate hypothesis although the natural rate hypothesis is today widely accepted in the economics profession some remain skeptical these ec onomists maintain that there is still tradeoff between unemployment and inflation that persists in the long run although not on as favorable terms as the shortrun tradeoff13 this view relies on evidence that nomin wages tend to be sticky downward that is they do not readily respond to changes in the relation between supply and demand ideally the alloca tion of labor across differe nt sectors of the economy depends on relative wages wages in d eclining sectors of the economy would tendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs12 14 for evidence concerning thestickiness of wages and prices see robert j gordon century of evidence on wage and price stic kiness in the

to rise changes in relative wages encourage labor to shift from declin ing industries into those that are more prosperous but if nominal or money wages tend to be unresponsive to changes in the composition of demand then just because an industry is in decline wages may not fall if this is the case it might be argued that little bit of inflation could be good thing if money wages are slow to decline in the face of falling demand in particular sector of the economy rising pr ices may nonetheless effect decline in real wages which may enable declining firms to avoid the alternative to falling real wages reducing employment if inflation offsets inertia in money wages then employment might be maintained at higher level and the unemployment rate might be sustained below the na tural rate without experi encing accelerating rates of inflation if there is any longrun tradeo ff that can be exploited in this way it is much less favorable than the shor trun trade off described above such an outcome depends on the phenomenon known as money illusion that for some reason workers fail to fully appreciate the effects of inflation on their money wages however there is evidence to the contrary one study found that money wages were substantially responsive to changes in the price level14 second study which focused on financial markets found some evidence of money illusion in that nominal rates of return did not fully refl ect inflation that tendency however was found to have d iminished over time15 the 1990s an empirical challe nge to the natural rate seemingly in the second half of the 1990s the us economy enjoyed the best of both worlds between 1992 and 2000 th civilian unemployment rate fell from as high as 78 to as low as 38 for much of the time since the mid1990s the unemployment rate was at or below many estimates of the natural rate which led many economists to expect signs of an acceler ating in the rate of inflation but the expected rise in inflation failed to materialize in fact perhaps to the surprise of many in some of those years the inflation rate fell to skeptics the simultaneous low rates of inflation and unemployment confirmed their suspicions that the natural rate model was flawed to adherents it begged two questions first is the natural rate now lower than most estimates had suggested second are there some other factors which are temporarily

cleveland economic review 3rd quarter 1998 pp 16 24 17 bharat trehan unemployment and productivity federal reserve bank of san francisco economic letter 200128 oct 12 2001one argument that has been made is that the economy has been performing so well with low rates of both inflation and unemployment because the us has been enjoying surge in productivity growth due perhaps to increased investment in computers whether or not the trend rate of produc tivity growth has picked up there are reasons to doubt that an increase in productivity would have the effect of permanently reducing the natural rate of unemployment16 firms set wages on the basis of the produc tivity of their employees an increase in productivity would tend to increase the wages offered by employers since the contribution of each worker to total pr oduction would be greater one might also presume that jobseekers would be aware of their increased value to employers and so demand higher wage for given job17 but suppose that jobseeker s at least initially do not fully appreciate the increase in their productivity in that case they would not be expected to increase the wage at which they would be willing to accept employment given that there is wide distribution of skill levels among t hose looking for work that would tend to increase the pool of jobseekers that would be willing to accept given job offer and would increase the number of job offers an unemployed individual might be willing to accept making it more likely that firms would be able to find new hires and tending to shorten the time it takes to fill positions in other words the number of mismatches in the job market would tend to fall and thus so might the natural rate but this asymmetry between employers and jobseekers concerning improved productivity may not last it might be unreasonable to presume that jobseekers would remain ignorant of an improvement in productivity of which employers were fully aware once jobseekers learn of their increased value to employers their wage demands would likely adjust to reflect the new information as result any decline in the natural rate of unemployment due to an increase in productivity would be likely to prove temporary some of the improvement in productivity however might be in the labor market itself if for example the time it takes for job seekers and employers to find matches were reduced because of the internet that might yield slight permanent reduction in the proportion of the labor for ce that was unemployed at any given time and thus also yield slight decline in the natural rate another factor that has been suggested as possible constraint on inflation is the fact that number of ot her countries have not been enjoying the same vigorous economic growth as has occurred in the us over the past few years as result or so the argument goes excess capacity has held down the prices of foreign goods lowerpriced foreignproduced goods are th said to have held down

onomy s upply shocks and the timevarying nairu feb 3 1999 revision of the paper presented at the brookings panel on economic activity washington dc september 4 1998 52 ppinflation rate both directly through lowpri ced imports and indirectly because of the threat that if domestic producers raised th prices of their goods they would lose market share to foreign competition the direct effect of lowpriced impor ts on domestic inflation is necessarily limited because of the small share of to tal us consumption accounted for by imported goods and services to the extent that imports are cheaper than domestically produced substitutes consumers may spend more on those cheaper substitutes that increase in spending on imported goods and services however will translate into an increased supply of do llars in foreign exchange markets and an increase in demand for foreign currencies with which to buy those imports the result is that the value of the dollar will tend to fall and that will tend to increase the price of imported goods and services to dom estic consumers thus the direct effect of lower priced imports on domestic inflation is limited with regard to the indirect effects it has been argued that increased sensitivity to competition from abroad combined with excess capacity in foreign economies has made it difficult for domestic producers to raise prices in the face of high levels of domestic demand there are reasons to doubt that this is the case in the case of small firms exporting to the us they are not likely to be dominant factor in setting prices in the market for close substitutes for the goods they are selling more likely their price setting behavior will be determined by domestic us market conditions in the case of larger firms that may have greater influence in the market there is evidence that the prices charged to us consumers tend to vary less than does the foreign exchange value of the dollar this suggests that foreign firms only pass on part of their fluctuations in costs to their export customers in fact there is evidence that suggests that there is very little in the way of consequences for us inflation due to slack demand or excess capacity in foreign countries18 economist robert gordon atte mpted to estimate the exte nt to which temporary factors might have accounted for the nonaccel eration of inflati on in the late1990s19 he identified two supplyside factors wh ich may have tended to hold prices down declining food and energy prices mainly oil prices and the fall in prices of imports due largely to the appreciation of the dolla r in addition gordon identified three other temporary factors whic h may have helped offset any tendency of inflation to rise in the face of booming economy th were the rapid decline in computer prices drop in the rate of increase in medical care prices and finally change in the way the inflation statistics themselves were calculated gordon found that the combined effect of these five factors was to

below 6 consumer price inflation which had fallen to 11 for the 12 mont hs ended in december 1986 accelerated to 44 rate in 1987 in early 1988 the fede ral reserve decided on change to slightly more restrictive monetary polic in order to cool down an economy that showed signs of overheating betw een march 1988 and march 1989 shortterm interest rates rose by over three percen tage points after 1988 the pace of economic growth slowed and in july 1990 the econom began contraction which lasted until march 1991 again beginning in early 1994 and tinuing into 1995 the federal reserve engineered 3 percentage point rise in s hortterm interest rates this apparent tightening of monetary policy began at time when the actual civilian unemployment rate was above 6 more recent economic experience suggest s that the natural rate is at least below 6 in september 1994 the civilia n unemployment rate fell below 6 and from june 1997 until september 2001 it wa s below 5 for all of the 1990s consumer price inflation remained under 35 and in the middle of the long economic expansion with unemployment rate s falling the rate of inflation fell as well that the unemployment rate has been so low for so long with significant rise in the inflation rate has led some to suggest that the natural rate has fallen in recent years and that unemployment rates below 6 might be compatible with longrun stable rate of inflation one difficulty with the concept of the natural rate of unemployment is that it is not number that can be specified with great accuracy for example one statistical analysis recently found that there was 95 probability that th natural rate fell somewhere between 39 and 76 in the first quarter of 199421 major source of uncertainty is the stion of how to account for factors that may briefly change the way in which unemployment and inflation are related for example it has been suggested that dur ing the 1990s there may have been supply side factors that kept the inflation rate from accelerating at time when it might have been expected to do so the equations used by economists to estimate the value of the natural rate yield different answers depending upon whether they

the inflation rate that might otherwise have obtained at any given level of unemployment thus in sense the unemployment rate consistent with stable rate of inflation may have fallen if only temporarily however natural rate that tends to vary significantly over short periods of time even pres uming it is known with some accuracy might not be especially useful as guide to economic policy joseph stiglitz former chairman of th council of economic advisors argued that while the natural rate is subject to considerable uncertainty given economic history since 1960 it is unlikely that the natu ral rate had ever been either much above 7 or below 522 he goes on to say that there is evidence that the natural rate has probably fallen by as much as 15 percentage points since the early 1980s that would put it higher than about 55 stiglitz argues that three factors account for the 15 percentage point decline in roughly equal proportions fi rst demographic changes have affected the natural rate most important has been the aging of th babyboom generation the second reason is that in the 1970s when productivity growth slowed workers were slow to moderate their wage demands and so that tended to pus h up the natural rate once workers recognized the slowdown in productivity their expectations for wage increases have adjusted and the natural rate has come back down third stiglitz argues is that product and labor market s have become increasingly competitive another economist robert gordon has also published evidence that the natural rate may have fallen in recent years23 gordons earlier estimate s of the natural rate published in his popular economics textbook were based on demographic changes in the labor force for example an incr ease in the share of the labor force accounted for by teenagers and women who typically experience higher unemployment rates would cause gordons estimated nairu to rise in the late 1980s however gordon found that this demographicbased nairu did not do as well predicting inflation base d rather on its statis tical relationship with inflation gordon estimated the nairu to be about 6 for the entire decade most simple estimates of the nairu rely on an analysis of the relationship between the unemployment rate and the infl ation rate for any given time period single value of the nairu is calculated more recently gordon estimates have been based on an equation that allows the nairu to vary from year to year depending on the particular price index used to derive the estimate gordon put the nairu between 57 and 6 in 1998 after

calculated24 similarly economist roger brinner afte r accounting for the temporary effects of import energy and medical care prices argues that inflation will eventually accelerate unless the unemployment rate rises to between 55 and 6625 rather than trying to make single point estimate barnes and olivei suggest that it may be more useful to think of the natural rate as range26 they find that the short run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation depends on whether actual unemployment is inside or outside an estimated range variations in the actual unemployment rate within the range have appreciable effects on the inflation rate if actual unemployment falls below the range then inflation starts to accelerate and if actual unemployment rises above the estimated range th the inflation rate will tend to fall barnes and olivei estima the range to be from 40 to 75 if this view is correct any unemployment rate within the range would be consistent with stable rate of inflation but presumably the lower end of the range would be preferable to the higher end given the uncertainty of the estimates the range presents policymakers with many of the same problems associated with point estimate of the natural rate ball and mankiw examine the potential effects on the natural rate of variations in productivity growth27 they show that changes in the growth rate of productivity can cause the shortterm tradeoff between unemployment and inflation to shift in effect an acceleration in productivity that is unmatched by rise in wage demands can lead to temporary decline in the natural rate similarly slowdown in productivity growth can temporarily push up th natural rate by taking variations in productivity into account and specifically the increase in productivity growth that began in 1995 ball and mankiw estimate that th natural rate may have been as low as 4 in 2000 the natural rate model predicts that an unemployment rate cannot remain below the natural rate

new england economic review janfeb 1999 pp 3749characterized by significant inertia28 that is the inflation rate has strong tendency to stay where it is so that it is slow to respond to changes in economic conditions this works in both directions the inflati on rate may seem slow to rise when the economy is operating at more than full empl oyment but it may also take long periods of significant underemployment to bring about appreciable reductions in the inflation rate there are number of quantitative estimates of the effect on inflation of maintaining the actual unemplo yment rate below the natura l rate stiglitz found that if the actual rate remains below the natural rate for one year he does not specify how much the inflation rate would rise by somewhere between 03 and 06 percentage points29 gordon f ound that other things being equal that if the actual unemployment rate is held one percentage point below the natural rate that measured inflation would rise by 03 percentage points per year30 brinner estimates the inflation response to one percentage point drop in unemployment to be about 0531 these estimates imply that the rate of acceleration is slow view which some might dispute but if the estimates ar at least valid for the very short run they suggest that small policy mistake might not be immediately cata strophic at the same time even gradually rising rate of inflation would presumably eventually reach unacceptable levels and the cost of reducing it in terms of lost output and high unemployment could be substantial conclusions policy goal which can only be temporarily realized is only likely to satisfy those who have relatively s hort timehorizons in isol ation an unemployment rate of 4 might seem like good thing but if it can only be had at the cost of spiraling inflation it may not seem like much of bargain the natural rate model may not be the last word on the interaction between unemployment and inflation nd it has its share of weakne sses but although the recent performance of the economy has generated some doubts as to whether it remains useful policy guide it remains an important part of most economists conception of how the economy works most current estimates of the natural rate continue to suggest that unemployment rates below 5 will eventually lead to rising rate of inflation the factors that prevented it from happening in the late 1990s are believed by many to have been temporaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30391crs19 moreover just because rapid inflation fails to materialize as soon as the unemployment rate falls below the estimated natural rate may be little reason to remain unconcerned inflati on may be slow to pick up in response to labor market tightness once the inflation rate rises si gnificantly it can also take time to respond to any labor market slack making disinfla tion costly process that might better be avoided altogether thus any indicator that helped policymakers avoid higher inflation in the first place would be extremely useful
