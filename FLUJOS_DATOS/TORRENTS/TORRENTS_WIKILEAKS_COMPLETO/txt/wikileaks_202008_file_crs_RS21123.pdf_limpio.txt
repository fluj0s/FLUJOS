and permanent ntr under title iv of the trade act of 1974 which includes the socalle d jacksonvanik amendment this report examines this legislative issue in the context of usrussian economic ties what are ntr status and the jacksonvanik amendment normal trade relations ntr or most favorednation mfn trade status is used to denote nondiscriminatory tr eatment of trading partner compared to that of otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21123crs2 1 mfn has been used in international agreements and until recently in us law to denote the fundamental trade principle of nondiscriminatory treatment however mfn was replaced in us law on july 22 1998 by the term normal trade relations pl 105206 mfn is still used in international trade agreements the terms are used interchangeably in this report 2 for more information on the jacksonvanik amendment see crs report 98545 the jackson vanik amendment survey by vladimir n pregelj countries1 only few countries do not have ntr status in trade with the united states in practice duties on the imports from count ry which has been granted ntr status are set at lower concessional rates than those from countries that do not receive such treatment thus imports from nonntr count ry can be at large price disadvantage compared with imports from ntrstatus countries section 401 of title iv of the trade act of 1974 requires the president to continue to deny ntr status to any country that was not receiving such treatment at the time of the laws enactment on january 3 1975 in effect this meant all communist countries except poland and yugoslavia section 402 of title iv the socalled jacksonvanik amendment denies the countries eligibility for ntr status as well as access to us government credit facilities such as the exportimport ba nk as long as the country denies its citizens the right of freedomofemig ration these restric tions can be removed if the president determines that the country is in full compliance with the freedomof emigration conditions set out under the jack sonvanik amendment for country to maintain that status the president must r econfirm his determination of full compliance in semiannual report by june 30 and december 31 to cong ress his determination can be overturned by the enactment of join t resolution of disapproval concerning the december 31st report the jacksonvanik amendment also permits the president to waive full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements if he determines that such waiver would promote the objectives of the am endment that is encourage freedom of emigration this waiver authority is subject to annual re newal by the presiden t and to congressional disapproval via joint resolution2 before country can receive ntr treatment under either the presidential determination of full compliance or the presidential waiver it must have concluded and enacted bilateral agreement that provi des for among other things reciprocal extension of ntr or mfn treatment the agreement and presidential proclamation extending ntr stat us cannot go into effect until joint resolution approving the agreement is enacted russias ntr status in 1990 the united states and the soviet ion signed bilateral trade agreement the agreement was subsequently applied to each of the former soviet states the united states extended ntr treatment to russi under the presidential waiver authority beginning in june 1992 since septembe r 1994 russia has received ntr status under the full compliance provision presidential exte nsions of ntr status to russia have met with virtually congressional oppositionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21123crs3 3 world trade atlas global trade information services incrussian leaders have continually pressed the united states to graduate russia from jacksonvanik coverage entirely they see the amendment as cold war relic that does not reflect russias new stature as fledgling democracy and market economy moreover russian leaders argue that russia has implemented freedomofemigration policies since the fall of the communist government making the jacksonvanik conditions inappropriate and unnecessary while russia remains subject to the jacks onvanik amendment some of the other former soviet republics have been gran ted permanent and unconditional ntr for example kyrgyzstan and georgia receive d pntr in 2000 and armenia received pntr in january 2005 perhaps what has irked russian leaders greatly is that the united states granted permanent and unconditiona l ntr status to ukraine in 2006 usrussian economic ties during the cold war ussoviet economic ties were very limited they were constrained by national secur ity and foreign policy restrictions including the jackson vanik amendment restrictions they were also limited by soviet economic policies of central planning that prohibited foreign inve stment and tightly controlled foreign trade with the collapse of the soviet uni on successive russian leaders have been dismantling the central economic planning syst em this has included the liberalization of foreign trade and investment usrussi an economic relations have expanded but the flow of trade and investment re mains very low as reflected in table 1 which contains data on us merchandise trade with russia since 1997 table 1 us trade with russia 19972006 billions of us dollars 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005

table indicates that usrussian trade at least us imports has grown appreciably us imports have more than quadrupled from 34 billion to 198 billion from 1997 to 2006 us exports surged somewhat but declined in 1999 because of the rapid depreciation of the ruble after the1998 russian financial crisis despite the increase in trade russia accounted for only 11 of us imports and 04 of us exports in 2006 us trade accounts for small portion of total russian trade although it is more significant than russia is to us trade in 2006 the united states accounted for 31 of russian exports and 44 of russian imports3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21123crs4 4 world trade atlas 5 tendentsii i perspectiva trends and outlook 2007 6 for example on may 11 2006 the chairmen and ranking members of the senate finance committee and house ways and means committee in letter to the white house expressed concerns regarding russian sanitary and phytosanitary regulations and the lack of ipr protection and urged the bush administration to pursue these issues in the wto accession talks united states senate committee on finan ce press release may 11 2006 us exports to and imports from russia are heavily concentrated in few commodity categories in 2006 the top five 2digit harmonized system hs categories of imports accounted for over 80 of total us imports from russia and consisted of precious stones and metals inor ganic chemicals mineral fuels aluminum iron and steel and fish and other seafood about 60 of u s exports to russia consisted of products in three 2digit hs categories aircraft machinery mostly parts for oil and gas production equipment and meat mostly poultry4 us investments especially direct investments have increased since the disintegration of the soviet ion although as with merchandise trade the levels are far below their expected potential the unite d states accounted for 46 billion in foreign direct investment in russia in 2006 the unite d states was technically the third largest source of foreign direct investment however the first two cyprus and luxembourg are considered to be largely sources of repatr iated russian capital rather than of original foreign capital5 issues in usrussian trade besides the lack of pntr from the united states that has been an irritant for russia number of issues have plagued the usru ssian bilateral relati onship and would likely be raised in congressional debate on pntr for russia us agricultural producers have viewed russia has potentially lucrative export market russia has been leading market for us poultry producers for example however russia has imposed restrictions on its meat imports that us producers consider unnece ssary and contrary to international standards for example russi had also imposed restrictions on imports of us pork arguing that us processing di d not adequately guard pork shipments from trichina parasitic wo rm despite us pork producers assu rances that its freezing of pork prevents trichina infestation and that us pork has not b een associated with trichina because of how us pigs are raised russia also imposed ban on beef imports in december 2003 after the discovery case of madcow in the united states russian officials had threatened to not abide by 2003 bilateral meat agreement that assigned quotas for russian imports of us poultry pork and beef under more general russian quota regime members of congress raised c oncerns about russian regulations of meat imports and stated they could not support pn tr if the concerns were not addressed6 another significant issue for the united states has been the perceived lack of enforcement intellectual property rights ipr protection and had been major stumbling block in the bilateral ne gotiations on russias accession to the wto producers ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21123crs5 7 members of congress also raised this issue in the context of russian pntr see for example oxley frank financial service offer may jeopardize russia pntr inside us trade september 22 2006 dvds cds and other products of intellectual property have consistently cited russia as leading source of pirated materials the office of the united states trade representative has also placed russia on its priority special 301 watch list indicating potential problems that need to be monito red and that may re quire further action russian economic policies and regulations have been source of concerns the united states and the us business community have asserted that structural problems and inefficient government regulations and policies have been major cause of the low levels of trade and investment with the united states russia maintains high tariffs on some goods that us manufacturers try to export for example tariffs on cars plus the excise tax that is prorated for engine displacement adds close to 70 on the price imported us passenger cars and sports utility vehicles russia also maintains 20 tariff on aircraft us exporters have also cited problems w ith russian customs regulations that are complicated and timeconsuming while they consider the investment climate to be improving us investors and potential investors still cite some barriers for example us financial services providers have criticized russian government restrictions on foreign investment in the banking and insurance sectors and prohibitions on the tablishment of branches of foreignowned insurance companies and banks7 investors have been also been wary of putin administration actions in reestablishing russi an government contro l over oil and natural gas operations and over ot her natural resources russias accession to the wto president putin has made russias entry into the world trade organization wto high priority the issue is closely tie d to pntr since unconditional nondiscriminatory treatment or mfn is funda mental principle of wto membership president putin and his government see wto membership as an important step in integrating the russian economy with the rest of the world and pr omoting economic reform it would also symbolize another break with russias soviet past as the soviet union had refused to join the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the predecessor of the wto chinas accession to the wto in december 2001 has probably intensified russias determination the united states has c ontinually supported russias accession to the wto as way of encouraging the developm ent of market economy in russia and to obtain greater access to russian markets on november 19 2006 russian and us offi cials signed bilateral agreement as part of the process for russias accession to the wto the united states raised many of the abovementioned issues during the negotia tions russia stated that it would uphold the 2003 bilateral agreement on quotas on imports of us meat would accept us methods of controlling trichina if those met hods are considered internationally acceptable and would allow imports of b eef from cattle younger than 30 months russia also agreed to strengthen enforcement of intellectual property rights and reduce restrictions onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21123crs6 foreign investment in financial services it is unclear whether the agreement will satisfy those most concerned about these issues implications and legislation granting russia permanent and unconditional ntr status will have little direct impact on usrussian trade russian imports have entered the united states on ntr or mfn basis since 1992 the initiative would be political symbol of russias treatment as normal country in us trade further dist ancing usrussian relations from the cold war it would also be step in the direction of russias accession to the wto for investors and other business peopl permanent ntr may mean more stable climate for doing business with the signing of bilateral agreement on wto accession with the united states on november 19 2006 russia completed major st ep towards joining the wto it still must compete negotiations with wto working party on conditions for its accession members of the working party including the united states have raised concerns about russias position on agriculture subsidies and the failure to enforce intellectual property rights among other issues if russias acce ssion to the wto to completion the issue of pntr for russia may emerge during the second session of 110th congress in possible debate on pntr for russia mbers of congress may very well consider whether their concerns regarding russian regulations on agricultural imports intellectual property rights protection or limitations on foreig n investment have been fficiently addressed in the bilateral agreement other issues regarding overall russian economic or foreign policies such as russias economic ties to iran could also emerge
