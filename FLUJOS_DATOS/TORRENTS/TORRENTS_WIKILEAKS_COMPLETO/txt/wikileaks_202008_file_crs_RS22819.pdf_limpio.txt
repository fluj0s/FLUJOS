usda announced that hallmarkwestland meat packing co of california was recalling 143 million pounds of fresh and frozen beef products dating to february 1 2006 about 50 million pounds were distributed to the school lunch and other federal nutrition programs in at least 45 states this largest us meat recall ever came after usda s food safety and inspection service fsis found that the facility did not always notify it about cattle that had become nonambulatory after they had been inspected but before slaughter for food fsis rules prohibit most nonambulatory cattle because they are more likely to have bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse the recall was socalled class ii indicating remote possibility that the products could cause adverse health effects but usda said the recall was necessary because its rules deem the animals unfit for human food most large recalls have been class i with reasonable probability of serious health consequences or death offici als asserted however that findings of bse are extremely rare in the united states and cited the effectiveness of other bse safeguards including ban on feeding most cattle parts back to cattle and the removal of potentially infectious material from all older animals they said most of the recalled beef likely had been consumed and that school and other domestic feeding sites had been instructed to hold and destroy all remaining products the agency suspended inspection at the plant which was not expected to reopen on february 4 2008 three days after it voluntarily ceased operations the matter came to light when the humane society of the united states hsus re leased videotapes of what it described as employees inhumanely handling downer cattle before slaughter 1 usda inspectors reportedly had failed to detect that these animals became nonambulatory after they received antemortem inspectioncausing some to question the use or effectiveness of recent increased appropriations from congress for more aggressive enforcement of the federal humane methods of slaughter act hmsa 7 usc 1901 et seq in early may 2008 hsus notified the secretary of agriculture that it had collected new evidence of abuse of nonambulatory cows and pigs at livestock auction markets in maryland pennsylvania new mexico and texas hsus assert ed that mistreatment of socalled downers is systemic and not limited to slaughterhouses 2 usda promised to address the allegations the livestock marketing association lma issued statement arguing that the overwhelming majority of its members humanely handle their animals out of both humane and economic necessity and cited its work with the industry to ensure proper handling but criticized hsus for promoting an antimeat agenda 3 1 hsus said it randomly selected the plant for its undercover operation several members of congress in turn criticized the society for waiting four months to reveal the problem information and updates on the hallmark situation were

throughout the marketing chain it also criticized usda for not fulfilling requirement in 10815 of pl 107171 the 2002 farm bill for report to congress on the scope causes and treatment of nonambulatory livestock and for humane handling regulations if the report deems them necessary usda noted that it had collected and published data on the number of such livestock and was completing work on causes and handling practices regarding dairy cattle to appear in peerreviewed journal in 2008 4 g11g151g156g153g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g4g138g156g146g140g156g561 federal law requires fsis inspectors to be present at all times meat and poultry slaughter plants are operating among other requirements an inspector must observe every live animal before slaughter both at rest and in motion to detect signs of any disease or health problems that might render the animal unfit for human food plants must notify fsis when animals first arrive and the antemortem inspection is to be conducted on the day of their slaughter although inspectors are not stationed in the antemortem areas for the entire day they are to return randomly after initial inspection to verify proper handling of the animals this contrasts with postmortem inspection where inspectors are stationed constantly along the processing lines inside the slaughter plants to examine each carcass and monitor other processing activities 5

nearly 34 million cattle in 2007 g16g152g151g138g150g139g158g149g138g157g152g155g162g561g6g146g156g138g139g149g142g141g561g5g138g157g157g149g142g561 until early 2004 fsis required that inspectors consider all seriously crippled livestock cattle and other species and those commonly known as downe rs to automatically be identified as us suspectsie possibly having disease or condition that would require their condemnation fsis required that an agency veterinarian examine them both before and after slaughter and that they be slaughtered separately before being cleared for food after cow imported from canada was found to have bse in late 2003 fsis issu ed number of rules aimed at keeping bse infected beef from entering the food supply including prohibition on the slaughter of any nonambulatory cattle regardless of the reason or of when they became disabled specifically an interim final rule on january 12 2004 69 federal register p 1873 stated nonambulatory disabled cattle shall be condemned and disposed of in accordance with other fsis regulations including that they be humanely euthanized the interim rule also for the first time explicitly defined nonambulatory disabled livestock to be those that cannot rise from recumbent position or that cannot walk including but not limited to those with broken appendages severed tendons or ligaments nerve paralysis fractured vertebral column or metabolic condition fsis based this rule change on findings in europe where bse was far more prevalent that nonambulatory cattle were much more likely to harbor the bse agent than ambulatory cattle and that typical clinical sign s associated with bse cannot always be observed in nonambulatory cattle infected with bse because the signs of bse often cannot be differentiated from the typical clinical signs of the many other diseases and conditions affecting nonambulatory cattle 69 federal register p 1870 on july 13 2007 fsis modified its rule to say that fsis inspection personnel will determine the disposition of cattle that become nonambulatory after they have passed antemortem inspection on casebycase basis 72 federal register p 38729 in the preamble to the rule the agency said notice to its personnelissued after the january 2004 interim rulealready was directing fsis veterinarians to permit such animals to be slaughtered so long as the veterinarian could verify that the animal had suffered an acute injury eg broken leg 7 however the agency also reaffirmed its earlier findings that bse clinical signs cannot always be observed in nonambulatory animal even though bse was much more prevalent in such animals thus its general ban on their use in foodwith this not eworthy exceptionwould be continued by the final rule in an effort they said could help to rebuild ma rket confidence the american meat institute the national meat association and the national milk producers federation petitioned fsis on april 22 2008 to again amend the rules to ban nonambulatory disabled cattle from the meat supply under any circumstances fsis published proposed rule to do so in the august 29 2008 federal register it had 30day public comment period the rule had not been published in final form as of late december 2008 7 notice 504 interim guidance for nonambulatory disabled cattle and age determination

g17g11g9g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561 usdas enforcement both of the ban on nonambulatory cattle and of the humane slaughter law has long been at issue january 2006 audit report by the usda office of inspector general oig was highly critical of number of fsis antemortem inspection procedures these included what oig said was the inconsistent application of procedures for example at 2 of 12 slaughter plants oig visited 20 of the 29 nonambulatory animals slaughtered were downers with documentation of any acute injury 8 oig also reported that from 1995 until july 2005 when the policy was discontinued fsis inspectors in some plants were examining only 510 of live cattle both at rest and in motion the remainder were observed only at rest the 33 plants subject to this alternative procedure were to be those with good compliance records that were killing primarily younger domestic animals not likely to be at risk for bse however due to inadequate enforcement and documentation some older cattle at these plants did not receive full inspection before slaughter according to oig since the report number of critics continue to assert that the agencys antemortem policies are inconsistently applied and enforced among slaughter plants and that such inspections often involve only cursory views of animals in large groups not individually 9 in november 2008 oig issued another audit report on what had occurred at hallmark whether the events were isolated or systemic and how effective fsiss controls were over several other bserelated safeguards required of plants10 in this audit oig determined that hallmark personnel had taken deliberate actions to bypass required inspections and that fsis inspectors did not comply with all inspection procedures however after looking at 10 other plants that also slaughter cull cows the oig concluded that nothing came to our attention to indicate that unsuitable animals were passed for slaughter or that systemic inhumane handling incidents were occurring at these plants thus the events at hallmark did not represent systemic failure of the inspection processessystem as designed by fsis but management controls can be strengthened to minimize such occurrences in the future these include the need for supportable riskbased methodology for assigning inspection staff reassessment of the effectiveness of the agencys supervisory processes improvements in inspection and supervisory staff training and strengthening of antemortem and related inspection procedures among other things 11 8 usda oig animal and plant

incomplete and inconsistent inspection records had made it difficult to determine the extent of humane handling and slaughter violations that fsis took inconsistent enforcement actions to address noncompliance and that it lacked data on numbers of inspectors and time devoted to hmsa enforcement12 g11g151g156g153g142g140g157g152g155g156g561g23g151g146g152g151g561g5g155g146g157g146g140g146g156g150g561 following release of the video showing inhumane treatment the meat inspectors union and consumer advocacy group charged that inspectors at hallmark were specifically instructed not to visit cattle pens before slaughter only the fsis veterinarianincharge could check the animals for humane handling and he was absent most of the time the letter argued that slaughter plants often have inspection vacancies requiring offline inspectors and even the fsis veterinarian to work online at essential postmortem inspection activities reducing oversight of holding pens the letter also charged among other things that fsis veterinary positions created specifically to monitor humane practices are not always filled and that such veterinarians are often redirected to perform other tasks not even remotely associated with humane handling issues 13 g17g157g145g142g155g561g24g146g142g160g156g561 the suitability of downers was discussed extensively at february 28 2008 hearing on hallmark before the senate appropriations subcommittee on agriculture secretary of agriculture edward t schafer argued that at times an animal can be injured in fall between antemortem inspection and the plants killing station and that veterinarian should be able to examine and approve it for food if it is not diseased humane society witness wayne pacelle countered that injuries and diseases are often interrelated making it challenging if not impossible even for trained inspector to determine whether the

hearings during 2008 on hallmark and related matters several bills were offered seeking to address humane treatment andor other inspection issues for example s 394 and hr 661 would have required usda to regulate the humane treatment handling and disposition of all nonambulatory livestock by co vered entities including requirement that nonambulatory livestock be humanely euthanized such entities would have been expanded beyond slaughter establishments to include stockyards market agencies and dealers the bill would have applied not only to cattle but also to any sheep swine goats horses mules or other equines another bill s 2770 would have banned the slaughter of nonambulatory livestock for human food establish gradually increasing penalties for plants that do so or that fail to comply with the hmsa and require usda to publish in final form rules it proposed in 2006 to disclose the names of all retailers that received recalled meat or poultry 15 ban on the slaughter of nonambulatory cattle for human food had been attached to version of the fall 2008 economic stimulus package the economic recovery act 2008 s 3604 however the measure did not clear the full senate past congresses had attempted to address humane oversight in number of past mainly appropriations acts after number of major news stories reported continuing abuses at slaughterhouses in 2000 congress in the 2001 supplemental appropriations act pl 10720 directed usda to spend not less than 1 million to enforce the act usda in turn allocated 125 million to hire 17 newly established district veterinary medical specialists exclusively to oversee enforcement lawmakers next included in the 2002 farm law in 10305 resolution urging usda to fully enforce the act and to report the number of violations to congress annually usdas fy2003 appropriation in pl 1087 include d an increase of 5 million for fsis to as senate report stated hire 50 additional inspection personnel to work solely on hmsa enforcement through fulltime antemortem inspection particularly unloading handling stunning and killing of animals at slaughter plants the senate appropriations committee noted in its report srept 107223 that it was extremely concerned that fsis did not have adequate inspection personnel dedicated to checking for or reporting hmsa violations and it questioned the effectiveness of simply instructing all inspectors to stop production when violation is observed subsequent appropriations continued and then increased designated funding for hmsa enforcement which now is at 63 positions and 5 million annually appropriators also have provided total of at least 10 million over several years since fy2005 to incorporate fsiss humane animal tracking system into its field computer systems continued 2008 personal
