action and evaluating the possible efficacy of proposed legislation freight rail transportation and electric power generation are mutually dependent network industries railroads accounted for over 70 of coal shipments to power plants in 2005 and due to economic and physical limitations on other modes truck barge and conveyor the heavy depe ndency of the power industry on rail transportation is likely to continue into th future from the standpoint of the rail industry coal transportation is an importa nt business accounting in recent years for about 20 of freight revenue s for the major railroads the mutual dependency between the rail and power industries creates complex business relationship there are connecti ons and to some degree tradeoffs between such factors as railroad i nvestments in capacity and rvice enhancement and power company tolerance for transportation risk and willingness to carry the cost of larger coal stockpiles central point is that increasing the reliability of coal deliveries to power plants costs money as does coping with disruptions central issue between power companies and railroads is how these costs should be shared proposed legislation

findings half the nations electricity comes from coal and most of that coal is delivered to power plants by railroads the reliable supply of coal by rail is therefore important to the electric power system concern over reliable deliveries of coal and other commodities limited rail system capacity and related issues such as rail rates sparked several congre ssional hearings in 20061 this report provides background information and analysis on coal transportation by rail to power plants the report discusses problems since 1990 with the rail delivery of coal implications of rail capacity limits on service reliability the role of coal inventories as backstop to reliable coal deliveries proposed legislation intended in pa rt to improve the quality of rail service to coalfired plan ts and other shippers the report also identifies data and analysis gaps that complicate measuring the scope of rail service and capacity issues termining the need for federal action and evaluating the possible efficacy of proposed legislation review of findings crs research finds that there have b een nine episodes since 1990 in which coal supply to power plants has been disrupted by rail transporta tion problems appendix 1 the causes of these problems vary incl uding severe weather surges in demand difficulties with rail system integration consequent to railroad mergers and major unplanned maintenance progra ms the most significant events were probably in 1997 and 1999 mergerrelated and in 2005 related to unplanned maintenance to western coal lines resear ch indicates that each of these events involved major widespread congestion and concomitant delivery delays however the cost consequences of these events appear to be ill defined we are unaware of any comprehensive cost estimates by the electri c power industry government agencies or other entities crs identified from scattered electric pow er industry sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs2 2 days of burn means the number of days the stockpiles can support normal operations assuming further deliveriesestimates totaling 228 million in costs from the rail service delays that began in 2005 appendix 2 in addition to these major events other more persistent in dicators of service issues have appeared the average speed of coal unit trains on the major coalcarrying railroads has generally declined since the early part of this decade the electric power industry and ot her industrial shippers cla im that the railroads are increasingly unwilling to offer strong service quality guarantees this may indicate the reluctance or inability of the railroads to guarantee service quality when their systems are capacity constrained capacity limits on the rail system appear to have contributed to coal transportation service problems the rail i ndustry has historically been plagued with uneconomic excess capacity since passage of the staggers rail act in 1980 the railroads have brought capac ity and the demand for rail services into alignment by increasing traffic shedding assets and staff and by generally not building new capacity far ahead of nearterm demand expectations it appears that the railroads believe it would be uneconomic to build more buffer capacity to handle service contingencies and question whether customers would be willing to pay for it wall street has at times encouraged the rail industry to pursue conservative approach to capital spending however without more buffer capacity the rail network may lose resiliency unexpected events such as bad weather or surges in demand may be more likely to cause persistent cong estion and delays in deliveries of coal and other commodities final aspect of tight rail system capacity is that it seems to have been an important factor in allowing the railr oad industry which has never been found revenue adequate by the surface transportation board stb to significantly increase coal and other rates and boost pr ofits since 2004 other factors contributing to the ability of the railroads to raise rates include demand growth and muted competition from trucks due to cost and capacity issues in that sector some parties have also suggested that the increase in rates is indicative of the ability of the rail industry to exercise pricing power at l east in some markets the government accountability office has performed limited st udy of this issue with inconclusive results the stb is planning study of th is issue due to be completed in late 2008 the coal stockpiles stored at power plants are in some respects backstop to rail system capacity power plant coal stocks cannot replace reliable rail service even large stocks will eventually be depleted by major transportation disruption and not all plants have the space to store large am ounts of coal but stocks can act as shock absorber postponing the need for plant operators to find expensive alternative fuel or electricity supplies in the event of delivery delays power plant coal stockpiles measured in days of burn2 have generally been declining since the 1970s stocks dropped by 40 by the latter lf of the 1990s coal transportation problems likely contributed somewhat to this decline but primary factor seems tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs3 3 the specific bills are the freight rail infra structure capacity expansion act of 2007 s 1125 and hr 2116 the railroad competition and service improvement act of 2007 s 953 and hr 2125 and the railroad antitrust enforcement act of 2007 s 772 and hr 1650 4 related issue which is how or if the federal government should seek to ensure modalneutral funding for rail and other freight modes is beyond the scope of this report also note that because the proposed tax incen tives would reduce revenues the legislation may require offsets under congressional payasyougo ruleshave been efforts by the power industry to cut costs to improve financial results in the case of regulated electric utilities the impetus to cut costs was sometimes at the behest of regulators the unregulated independent power producers ipps who entered the coal generation market in th 1990s with the advent of power market restructuring have generally maintained lower stocks then regulated utilities this may reflect the greater exposure of ipps to market forces nd investor demands the electric power industry cut stocks even as more coal was shipped long distances from western mines the decisions made to cut stocks presumably reflected in part the service guarantees included in rail transportation contracts and the receding risk of coal miner strikes as more production came from nonunion western mines nonetheless it appears th power industry reduced stocks even as its supply lines lengthened and ar guably became more vulnerable since 2006 as rail service improved th power industry has increased coal stocks in addition to rebuilding western co stocks depleted due to the rail service problems beginning in 2005 this trend proba bly reflects recognition of the risk of being caught short on coal supplies given th capacity constraints on the rail network the stock build also may reflect the diffi culty noted above the power industry and other industries claims to have had securing strong rvice quality guarantees from the railroads several legislative proposal s before the 110th congress address rail service and other rail issues such as ra levels these proposals fa ll into two categories tax incentives to encourage the expansion of rail system capacity and regulatory restructuring proposals aimed at changing th rail regulatory regime that has been in effect since the 1980s3 the tax incentives are intended to encour age investments in rail system capacity particularly for investments that expand system capacity4 our understanding is that the incentives would be available to any party making railrelated investments including in addition to railroads power plants and coal mines that make such capital expenditures the objective of increasing system capac ity appears to be broadly consistent with the interests of coal and other shippe rs who want more robust and reliable rail network and of tran sportation planners who believe the market should have more options for moving some freight traffic off of highways by effectively reducing the cost of capital expansion the tax incentives so seem to address the reluctance of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs4 rail industry to take on the additional financial risks i nherent in greater capital spending issues that may be of interest in ev aluating the tax incentive proposals include scope of the problem and information there is limited public information on rail system capacity or service for coal shipments and other traffic this makes it difficult to quantify the current rail capacity and service situation and would make it difficult to measure any benefits that flow from rail tax incentives if there is interest in having the governme nt collect and publish additional service and capacity data potential issue is data confidentiality the rail industry may consider deta iled capacity and service data to be business sensitive and proprietary if data confidentiality is concern steps can be considered to prevent disclosure of confidential information such as by aggregating or otherwise masking carrierspecific data expected outcomes coal shippers appear to want fluid resilient rail network able to operate reliably even under adverse conditions however this may imply level of investment in buffer capacity that the rail industry would find undesirable and unaffordable even with tax incentives as noted earlier excess capacity has historically been financial bur den on the railroad industry more recently the close balance between rail capacity and demand appears to have contributed to the ability of the industry to raise rates and increase profits because of thes factors the response of the railroad industry to tax incentives may be cautious and yield limited not systemwide improvements in capacity and service quality control some groups have argued th at the public should have more control over how the rail tax incentives would be used the rail industry believes that the direction of rail system investments should be left to private managers w ho have the best information on railroad capacity constraints nd traffic patterns another consideration is that it may be di fficult to implement some proposals for limiting the tax incentives to certain categories of traffic such as coal shipments to power plants captive to single railroad as pointed out by transportation system analysts railroads are networks so an investment in one location can have wide effects it may therefore be difficult to determine if specific investment will primarily benefit any one category of traffic the regulatory restructuring proposals in clude bills that would remove certain antitrust law exemptions that apply to th rail industry and bills that would more generally revise the current regulatory scheme the intent of the bills appears to be to use new regulatory rules to introduce mo re competition into the rail industry the concept is that more competition will lead to innovation and cost reductions that will improve coal and other service decrease rates and help the rail industry win new business the railroad industry characteriz these proposals as reregulation ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs5 argues that the proposals would inhibit th pricing and operationa l freedom that has been important to the revival of the ra il industry and would cause the industrys finances and service quality to regress the emphasis in the regulatory restru cturing proposals on enhanced competition appears consistent with an underlying principal of the current regulatory regime which is to allow to the maximum extent possible competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail 49 usc 10101 however the proposals would accomplish this goal through new rules and government oversight so depending on how the goals outlined in the proposed legislation are actually implemented there is risk that the outcome could be at least to some extent more regulatory control instead of more reliance on the market in general the outcomes from the regulatory restructuring bills may depend heavily on the details of implementation other factors that may be of interest in evaluating the regulatory restructuring proposals include scope of the problem and information are the coal and other rail service reliability and related issues such as rates of sufficient severity to justify major revisions to the current regulatory framework this is arguably an open question because of the limited available data on rail service rates and the degree to which coal and other shippers ar subject to market power financial condition central objective of the staggers rail act of 1980 was to restore the longterm fi nancial health of the railroad industry an evaluation of regulato ry restructuring may turn in part on whether the rail industry has ach ieved this goal of revenue adequacy however the relia bility of the stbs annual revenue adequacy determinations is uncer tain some par ties contend that various aspects of the stbs methodology are flawed based on review of financial literature one technical criticism seems to have particular significance this criticism is that the stb by using specific computational approach singlestage discounted cash flow model in combination with the recent high rates of earnings growth in the railroad industry s overstated the ra ilroad industrys threshold for achieving revenue ad equacy more general concern is also suggested by review of financial literature this is whether the stbs reliance on one financial ratio to determine if railroad has achieved revenue adequacy may put too much weight on single metric contrast can be drawn to typical electric power rate cases where an evaluation of multiple f actors by the re gulatory body is used to determine utilitys rate of return service focus as an alternative to extensive revision of the current regulatory regime could more limited changes result in material improvements in coal rail service if otherwise desirable more limited agenda might include elements of current proposals including giving rail service pr oblems and their resolution greaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs6 5 us department of energy energy information administration

by truck barge and c onveyor most coal moved by rail because coal mines are often distant from power plants and rail is usually the most economical means for moving bulk commodities long distances truck shipments of coal are generally uneconomic over bout 50 miles barge is practical only for mines or power plants near navigable wate r and conveyors can be used only if power plant is adjacent to

highway and transportation officials aashto i n the freight transportation service spectrum rail occupies place between and overlapping water transport and trucking it competes with water tr ansport for heavier lowervalue less timesensitive commodities it competes with trucking for highervalue often containerized shipments moving over longer distances and it is the preferred mode for number of economically important but heavy and bulky commodity groups such as coal farm products and minerals20 within the group of seven cl ass i railroads most rail tr affic is carried by four dominant

the industry giants accounting in 2005 for 92 of cla ss i railroad ope rating revenues21 the rail industry is sometimes characteriz ed as consisting of two duopolies one in the east and one in the west22 the actual situation may be more complex the degree to which the railroads have market leverage app ears to vary by commodity individual customer geography and other f actors for example in general the railroads face more competiti on from trucks for general merchandise shipments than for coal and other heavy bulk goods coalfired plant with access to barge shipments of coal has more competitive verage in the transportation market than plant remote from navigable waterway s served by single railroad the competitive environment also changes over time as discussed in the reports section on rates coal rates declined for many years but have more recently increased sharply the extent to which the rail industry is able to exercise market power appears to vary across markets and

access and competition issues by john frittelli12 to prohibit predatory pricing and practices to avoid undue concentrations of market power and to pr ohibit unlawful discrimination 36 these points illustrate the balancing aims of the staggers act to allow competition to determine the operation of the rail freight market to provide for the financial recovery of the ra il industry and to protect sh ippers from abuses of market power within this balance restoring the financial integrity of the railroad industry was primary objective according to the conference committee report the overall purpose of the act is to provide through financial assistance and freedom from unnecessary regulation the opportunity for railroads to obtain adequate earnings to restore maintain and improve their physical facilities while achieving the financial stability of the national rail system37 the act and its implementation by the icc and stb have given the railroads wide discretion to freely set coal and othe r rates in response to market conditions as directed by the act the icc exempted almost entirely from regulation categories of traffic with general access to compe titive transportation options such as most agricultural commodities and intermodal shipments38 shippers of traffic potentially subject to railroad market dominance and ra tes that could be unreasonable such as coal and grain shipments retained the option of appealing rates to the icc39 however rates could be app ealed only if the shipper c ould demonstrate that it was captive to one railroad that is it had credible competitive alternative for receiving coal other than delivery by single railroad40 the act also provided for faster processing of ra ilroad applications to merge and of requests to abandon sell or

but past regulatory practice had required railroads to offer joint multicarrier rates on practically all possible combinations of ra ilroad tracks between two points and to offer identical rates for each route without regard to the actual cost of providing the service41 staggers gave railroad wide discretion to rationalize its traffic flows by canceling joint movements changing rates and f unneling traffic to its single line routes this was economically beneficial to the railroads but potentially reduced the competitive routing options available to coal and other shippers however st aggers gave the icc new authority to direct railroads to interchange traffic when in the public interest or necessary to provide competitive rail service42 railroads were given an unambiguous right to enter into confidential contracts for rail service with rate s and service terms customized for specific customers the terms of contracts are outside of regulatory jurisdiction the staggers act left

perspective these costs may be onerous52 from the standpoint of the railroad this may be rational response to situation in which rail capacity is tight and the carrier must stretch limited capital budget railroad capacity rail system capacity and service the national rail system generally had substantial excess capacity when the railroad industry was largely deregulated in 1980 the ra ilroads have since brought their capacity and volume of business into alignment by increasing traffic selling off leasing or abandoning surplus track and equipment and by cutting staff53 they have also added capacity in some sectors for example to support intermodal traffic and prb coal shipments the changing traffic mix on the rail system has also contributed to tighter capacity there is tradeoff between the number of coal and other bulk cargo trains running on system versus highspeedhighpr iority intermodal traffic to compete against trucks rail intermodal traffic must be price competitive and offer speed and timeliness consequently intermodal traffic usually takes priority over coal trains and other freight traffic when intermoda l and coal trains are in conflict for the same segment of track the intermodal train is typically allowed to run through while coal and other traffic is moved to siding or otherwise held54 in general when trains of varying speeds are mixed on rail system and the faster trains are given priority the effective carrying capacity of the slow er trains the amount of cargo they can move over given period of time is reduced55 capacityconstrained rail network may

machalabarailroads big outlays on infrastructure are questioned critics continuednetwork because there is reserve capacity56 as explained by the congressional budget office cbo capacity can be constrained by shorta ge of any critical input infrastructure for example tracks or switching system s equipment locomotives and other railcars or labor and because the transportation industries are networks the existence of capacity constraints at one key junction or along one key corridor can cause delays that cascade throughout the system late after noon thunderstorm at hub airport for example can cause airplanes destined for that hub to be grounded at numerous other cations even people traveling between cities with clear weather may be delayed either because they have to travel through the disrupted hub or because the ai rcraft they are supposed to fly aboard has been held up such effects can occur in the freight rail industry57 unlike airlines which can reset their networks relatively quickly because of the mobility of aircraft and their freedom from fixed infrastructure except at the origin and destination ra ilroad equipment has limited m obility within system of track and yards that cannot be appreciably expanded or modified over the short term consequently congestion on rail networks can persist for weeks or months when rail system is congested it loses fluidity as the term suggests the system slows down trains are late and th railroads may be ble to carry all the traffic shipper has contract ed for or otherwise wants to move congested railroad may not be able to deliver all of the coal required by generators and power plants can run short of fuel tight capacity and consequent risks of delays in rail service have been identified since at least the mid1990s according to 1998 white paper by an advisory panel to the stb the serious railroad tr ansportation problems experienced in 1997 throughout the united states prompted our analysis of whether rail infrastructure continues to be capable of efficiently moving the volume of goods demanded by citizens our conclusion is that our ra il system has reached the point of being capacity constrained58 the wall street

more trains however operating more trains is not always an effective means of increasing capacity if system is already congested or on the edge adding more trains can trigger or exacerbate slowdowns running trains faster greater velocity allows railroad to move more traffic with the same amount of equipment60 railroads can increase velocity through capital improvements that debottleneck the system and by streamlining train handling procedures running trains closer together minimum headway between trains is required for safe operations if the headway can be reduced the density of trains on the system increases the freight railroads are testing advanced braking and train control systems that could reduce headway running bigger trains by increasing the number of cars in train and using more locomotives railroad can deliver more coal with fewer trains releasing capacity for new coal traffic or other business the biggest coal trains in routine power plant service currently have 135 cars and tests are underway on 150 car trains61 installing and improving track examples include adding doubletrack and more sidings to heavilyused rail corridors straightening curves that force trains

operations at the system level railroads want to avoid overstaffing but must ve enough crews to handle traffic in 2004 the up was caught shortst affed causing delivery shortages and delays for power companies and other shippers62 because it takes months to train new crews staff shortages cannot be quickly eliminated at the individual train management level railroads must precisely synchronize the positioning of coal and other longhaul trains with relief crews trai n must stop wherever it is when its crew reaches the end of its 12 hour sh ift the train will sit idle until the railroad can transport new crew to the train stalled trains can block tracks and delay other trains causing more crews to reach the end of their shifts remote from crew change points these delays can cascade through rail system causing widespread congestion railroads allocate capacity current and planned to balance customer demands operational constraints and the railroads financial goal s as discussed above capacity is routinely allocated by assigning priorities to different classes of rail traffic the highest priority is given to passenger traffic and to timesensitive truck competitive intermodal traffic the lowest priority is given to bulk shipments such as coal trains another means of allocati on is through pricing under federal law railroads are common carriers that are requi red to provide service when reasonably practicable and on reasonable term s to any requesting shipper63 in practice the rail industry uses price rationing of ava ilable capacity also known as congestion pricing as means of managing traffic64 according to aashto in some cases railroad companies use high prices to demarket business in order to release capacity that can be used more profitabl and to prevent

the fall of 2003 when traffic surged unexpectedly requiring us to satisfy all demand and requiring us to provide reliable service on infrastructure that lacks capacity to m eet every shipping demand would put us in an impossible position66 railroads and other transpor tation modes can also deal with capacity shortages by reducing the quality of service generally or for some customers as described by former railroad executive railway may simply accept lower standards of service during peak times or lower service quality fo r some customers strategy of poorer service or higher rates during peak times is facto reality with all transportation modes today67 railroad capital spending most of the options for increasing ra ilroad capacity involve capital investment in equipment or infrastructure in additi on railroads must inve st large sums annually to renew or replace their existing capital stock railroads are consequently much more capital intensive than most businesses and comparable to

pattern in which capital investment changes instep with growth in revenue and traffic but not more rapidly or slowly ppears to be consistent with the industrys stated approach to capacity expansion in order to improve their return on investment the railroads tailor investment s to the expected change in demand over the short term they do not build ahead of shortterm demand forecasts as one former

completely unrealistic like other companies railroads try to build and st aff for the business at hand or expected soon to be at hand build it and they will come has rarely been winning strategy for freight railroads72 related point is that when railroad expands its asset base it also incurs on going costs for operating and maintaining those assets73 because rail investment tends to be longlived railroads focus their investment dollars where they can either expect longterm traffic and revenues or can recover investments quickly in trying not to build capacity too far ahead of or behind demand railroads are not unique the same capital budge ting problem can face any firm74 in respect to coal traffic the railroad industry and th coal production and power industries must deal with longterm strategic questions in making investment decisions because of actual or prospective actions at the state and federal levels in such areas as carbon emission controls enhanced controls on other air emissions and encouragement of renewable energy sources there is uncerta inty concerning the volume and source of future coal flows the degree of this uncertainty has not stopped coalrelated

mode is made in frank leeuw the concept of capacity journal of the american statistical association 57 300 december 1962 826840one study broadly defines rail capacity as the greatest possible output while maintaining specified minimum acceptable level of service eg minimum speed82 however this kind of form ulation does not address host of complications there are in fact standa rd definitions or measures of rail system capacity83 as noted by the cbo the concep t of transportation network capacity is elusive84 measure of rail system capacity is ultimately function of the assumptions made by the analyst the us rail ne twork has 70000 origindes tination pairs many routing options and carries wide variety of products85 the carrying capacity of section of railroad depends on the quality of the track whether the corridor is single tracked or doubletracked the number and length of sidings and the type of signaling system installed railroads move trai ns over the network at varying speeds depending on the quality of service needed to compete with trucks or barges the weather maintenance programs and the condition of the track86 capacity is also function of the cost of service the railroad is willing to incur and which shippers are willing to pay without considerati on of cost the concept of capacity is meaningless87 railroad network capacity is consequently not single metric but is different for each type of traffic and depends on the assumptions made for traffic mix acceptable costs and many other variables since the am ount of capacity on rail network is hard to pin down the degree to which total capacity is being utilized is also elusivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs36 88 summary of testimony of matthew k rose chairman president and ceo burlington northern

estimates of rail system capacity and capacity utilization are developed and used by the rail industry itself the drivers of rail system capacity have been defined by railroad executives and other analysts for example the bnsf lists volume train density physical plant elements and productivity as determinan ts of system capacity88 and while the practicality and utility of encapsulating the capacity utilization of an entire rail system in single index number may be questiona ble it is possible to defi ne capacity for key corridors and categories of traffic for given set of assumptions89 for instance in the past csx has reported the degree of capacity utilization on its network for general merchandise traffic and for intermodal traffic90 union pacific has described its capacity situation in terms of specific corridors capacity is by certain corridors like the sunset corridor from angeles to paso were at capacity on the sunset corridor we are pressing capacity on the south central corridor between s angeles and salt lake city theres other areas we are not at capacity so its little more complicated answer than probably you would like to hear but in some areas with the railroad were bumping capacity and in other areas we are still in pretty good shape91 railroads estimate the current and projected capacity of parts of their systems in order to make investment

national railway company before the surface transportation board ex parte 671 rail infrastructure and capacity requirements april 4 2007 p 8in summary while systemwide capacity index may be difficult or impractical to develop corridorspecifi c capacity measures appear to be meaningful and feasible93 however the federal government does not collect the data needed to estimate rail system capacity or require the railroad i ndustry to provide estimates the association of american railroa ds doubts the value and feasibility of publishing capacity estimates in ptember 2006 the national industrial transportation league nitl an industria l shipper trade association which has at times raised concerns over ra il industry service suggested to the aar joint project to create an objective measure of capacity for the rail industry nitl stated that even if not entirely precise given the sign ificant public dialogue about the need for increased rail capacity such metric would allow rail carriers their customers and the public sector to gain better view of the capacity problem94 aars response was that creation of capacity metric was probably impractical because the rail system is so complex it is difficult to believe that meaningful aggregations or comparisons across railroads can be obt ained the aar was concerned that compared to the basic performance measur such as train speed already publicly available capacity index would be far more complicated considerably less applicable to any particular circumstance and potentially subject to greater misuse95 nonetheless as noted above capacity timates are made and used by railroads while the possibility of misuse or misinterpretation of capacity estimates exists this same risk presumably can exist for any metric of economic activity as discussed later in this report the absence of published railroad capacity estimates may impede informed analysis of rail and coal transpor tation policy it also can impede efficient privatesector decisionmaking in 2007 stb hearing the canadian national railway suggested that the stb consider organizing efforts by the railroads and shippers to project future traffic growth over

policy development or otherwise the confidentiality issue can perhaps be dealt with by aggregating or otherwise masking the publis hed version of the data for specific rail corridors future rail capacity and investment needs just as there are public metrics that directly measure current rail system capacity there are also firm estimates of future capacity needs or costs according to american association of state highway and transportation officials unlike with highways there is national planning process which allows the magnitude of rail congestion to be measured because what gets measured gets managed there is systematic national management of the nations rail congestion needs the individual railroads run their companies efficiently and make investments that meet the criteri of their business plans but from the perspective of the performance of the national freight transportation system there is baseline for service standards for operations true measure of what type of system and service the country needs98 principal reason the national planning process manageme nt and data do not exist is that the rail network is privately owned and operated unlike the publicly owned and operated highway system as noted above gao reports indicate that much of the data aashto specifies would likely be considered businesssensitive and proprietary by the railroads trends in railroad capacity and sy stem congestion are important to transportation policymakers because freight traffic is projected to grow enormously dot and aashto both estimate growth in the freight traffic carried by all modes of about 60 from the 20002002 time period to 202099 because rail capacity can be less expensive to build more costeffici ent to operate and more friendly to the environment than truck tr ansportation and roadbuilding some transportation planners are advocating large increase in rail system capacity with the primary goal of displacing growth in truck traffic

additional freight rail infrastructure improvements or 53 billion to 83 billion over 20 years howeve r this estimate is focused on the new capacity needed to put part of the grow th in general merchandise traffic on rail instead of trucks not on the capacity need ed to reliably ship coal or other bulk commodities100 moreover aashto cautions that its cost estimates are more than first approximations for purposes of illustration and discussion based on extrapolation from other studies and professional judgement101 i t n t s t h t longterm systemwide cost estimates that are comparable to those developed for the highway and transit systems do not exis t the railroads and the states generate cost estimates for specific projects to calculate return on investment and estimate public benefits but there is program to systematically compile these costs estimates and forecast futu re investment levels 102 in summary rigorous national level assessments of rail system capacity needs and expansion costs do not appear to exist coal stocks as complement to rail capacity expansion coalfired power plants maintain coal stocks for two purposes as buffer against short term variability in coal deliv eries and to provide an emergency supply in case deliveries are badly disrupted th size of plants stockpile largely determines how much delay in coal shipments plant can tolerate before the operator must take costly emergency measures such as running more expensive natural gas plants in lieu of its coal generation howeve r there is also cost in tying up working capital in large coal stockpile there is rough analogy between the excess capacity railroad can build to handle peak demands and tingencies and the coal stocks power plant holds to provide reserve of fuel railroads have suggested that it may be more economical for power companies to store more coal at their power plants than to pay the railroads to build enough surplus capacity to minimiz the chance of service problem for example at an april 2007 hearing before the stb on railroad capacity csx chief executive officer michael ward said it would make better economic sense for utilities to keep higher inventory levels to give them flexibility to ma ke up for some unreliability of the coal supply chain when you think about th supply chain my guess is that the better economic tradeoff for utilities is to have larger stockpiles he said if utilities want 100 guaranteed delivery they would need to be willing to payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs40 103 marcin skomial from railroad view

the longterm trend by the electric power industry to reduce its coal inventories is clear by reducing inventories as more coal was shipped long distances fro m western coal mines the power industry

so occurred in the context of the history of coal transportation disruptions see appendix 1 by cutting its coal inventories the ectric power industry incurred more coal supply risk according to one

in summary in an effort to reduce cost s the rail industry and the power industry have both been pursuing types of just in time costminimizing strategies for the rail industry this has meant not buildin g capacity ahead of demand for the power companies it had meant reduced inventory policies the simultaneous pursuit of these policies by the power nd rail industries and the deve lopment of resilient coal supply chain may be mutually exclusive an issue between power companies and railroads is how should the cost of impr oving reliability be shared between paying for larger stocks at power plants and building more rail capacity the trend toward increased stocks t hough still not to the levels of the 1973 1990 period suggests that power producers ve decided to bear higher inventory costs to improve the reliability of their coal supplies given as discussed below the reported unwillingness of railroads to offer strong service guarantees power companies may have had little choice except to increase coal stockpiles depending on the observers perspective this may be indicative of an exercise of market power or rational and effi cient economic outcome railroad service and disruptions in coal transportation service quality since staggers as rail system capacity has tightened the quality of service for some freight traffic has degraded as ex plained in 2006 by one analyst the capacity crunch is real it could go on for long time and it has serious consequences over the past 10 years there have been many occasions where mergers bad weather or spikes in mand have triggered prolonged periods of congestion all of the major us railroads have suffered from such episodes and customers have frequently complained about long and unreliable transit times and equipment

often have few if any service requirements118 at the same hearing eei stated that the railroads are now unwilling to accept responsibility for guaranteed performance at any meaningful level in general the service performance standards in rail contracts have deteriorated substantially over time as the railroads have gained more market power and as competition has deteriorated119 the mid2007 version of the bnsfs standard common carrier pricing authority for prb coal shipments states that until further notice service commitments previously ffered will not be accepted120 eei also asserts that railroads have become much more likely than in the past to use the force majeure clauses in transportation agreements to excuse inability to timely deliver coal121 but there is data series that can be used to verify this claim rail service metrics and disruptions as in the case of railroad capacity the data available on railroad service are limited and largely anecdotal an average speed for all freight traffic can be computed from data published by the aar figure 15 above but this measure is so broad that it is not useful for determining for example if cycle times for coal shipments are improving or deteriorating or which co rridors on rail system may be service bottleneck more valuable t of service indicators has been published by the rail industry since 1999122 these indicators

pollution control co sts and combustion efficiency it can find almost by definition alternative supplies are likely to be more expensive power plants are also designed to burn specific types of coal so plants ability to use alternatives to its primary supplies may be limited putting more railcars into service may yield only small increase in deliveries if rail system is congested and the additional cars could further degrade system performance by increasing the load on the system for this reason congested railroad may refuse to accept more trainsetsdeliveries by buying or leasing more railcars power company can also keep large coal inventories on site as backup fuel source in the event of transportation or supply pr oblems these steps can keep power plant from running out of coal but the tradeoff is higher costs135 market costs are the marketwide increases in coal prices and rail rates that can occur when power companies have to scramble to secure coal supplies and reliable transportation services these higher costs are incurred by all buyers whether or not they are affected by transportation problems if the generator is regulated electric utility the higher costs may be

review tre nds in rail rates although rates are not the primary subject of this report the relationship between rail system capacity and rates is important for evaluating legislation intended to expand capacity and improve service the rail rate environment since 2004 has been described as railroad pricing renaissance141 due in part to limited rail capacity rates are rising for the first time since the early 1980s rates were up on the order of 10 in 2005 which is major change from the prior 20 years the reversal of 20year trend suggests very significant change the driving factors supporting higher rail rates are the shortage of capacity in the rail system coupled with rising rates for trucking during time when demand is growing most notably for coal and for containerized imports since service quality has declined the higher rates certainly do not reflect faster or more reliable trip times for the first time in generation th railroads are able to raise rates so they do142 the recent increases in rail rates follows long period in which average rates declined rail rate indices computed by gao show that measured in nominal dollars average rates declined by about 20

growing prb coal market efforts by railroads to compete with other modes such as barges and trucks and to expand new markets with growth potential such as transportation of prb coal at the outset of the poststaggers period surplus capacity on the rail system the staggers act allowing the railroads to enter into customized multiyear contracts with shippers permitting more efficient planning and operations than public tariff rates transfer of some costs from railr oads to shippers as discussed above the swing from declining or relatively stable rates to increasing rates happened abruptly around 2004 due to the confluence of several factors as noted above rail capacity began to tighten in the mid1990s after peaking in 1998 railroad capital spending declined for several years and di d

rising fuel prices and cost differentials the trucking industry appears to be gradually moving away from longhaul crosscountry routes and towa rds shorter hauls many truck load carriers are allocating

consideration in rail rate increases is the consolidation of the rail industry into seven rge carriers of which four are dominant one press review of th rail industry noted that growth in demand combined with industry consolidati on has done wonders for pricing147 this nexus of factors has allowed railroa ds to broadly increase rail rates for coal shipments according to the electric po wer

congress without receiving further c onsideration s 3742 the freight rail infrastructure capacity expansion act of 2006 according to the rail industry the object of fricea is to help resolve growing national problem with freight congestion especially on highways by providing the capacity to put more freig ht traffic on railroads the underlying assumptions are that railroads are less costly to expand than highways and that rail freight is more fuel efficient and less po lluting than truck tran sportation however according to the aar funding constrai nts will prevent railroads from meeting sociallyoptimal future infrastructure investment needs entirely on their own154 fricea includes two distinct but rela ted inducements for capital spending the first is 25 tax credit for capacityexpanding rail investments the tax credit would be available to any taxpayer making qualified investments not only railroads the second incentive would increase rail investment generally not just for capacity expansion by enha ncing modal tax equity155 this would be accomplished by allowing railroads and other tax payers to immediately deduct expense qualifying rail capital investments from gross income the immediate deduction of capital costs is in contrast to the normal practice of depreciating the value of capital investme nts over several years156 the option to expense investments is in tended to end disc repancy in the tax treatment of the capital investment costs bor ne by railroads nd other freight modes particularly trucks and barges railroads own and pa for their own rights of way and structures tax recovery of these investments is made over time through tax depreciation in contrast waterways and highways are usually publicly funded and owned truck and

crs may 31 2007that can be immediately taken as an in come tax deduction the notion is that allowing the railroads to expense infrastructure investment will level the financial playing field between freight transportation modes157 advocates of modal equity in the tax treatment of freight investment costs argue it will lead to more optimal allocation of societys resources likely including greater investment in rail capacity158 closely related issu is whether trucks and barges pay the full cost of the infrastruct ure provided by the public according to the cbo the federal highway administration estimates that large trucks pay in taxes only about 50 percent to 80 percent of th federal costs attributed to them barge operators on the inland waterways pay taxes that cover only about 20 percent of the amount the corps of engi neers spends on navigation projects in contrast the railroads pay for their rightsofway and infrastructure and often must pay local taxes on those investment s as well those factors translate into lower private costs for truckers and wate r carriers and enable them to attract some freight shipments that could be carried at lower total cost by the railroads that encourages greater spending on highway and waterway construction than would be justified on economic grounds and leads to an inefficient use of the economys resources159 as proposed fricea defines two ma in categories of railroad property qualified freight rail infrastructure property includes investments in hardware such as track rail yards and freight loading and unloading terminals and communication and control equipment and related software investments in land and rail cars are specifically excluded160 qualified locomotive property includes purchases of locomotives that meet the fo

reliable rail network and of transportation planners who want the option of moving some freight traffic off of highways th tax incentives also directly address the reluctance of the rail industry to take the dditional financial risk s inherent in greater capital spending by effectively reduc ing the cost of capital expansion this discussion of fricea policy issues focuses on three questions who

with package of much needed relia bility accountability and policy reforms163 the gao has expressed different more genera l concern about the efficacy of rail tax incentives in 2006 report gao noted that we have also raised concerns about federal tax policies for railroads some industry groups have proposed freight rail tax credits to encourage investment however our work has shown that it is difficult to target tax credits to the desired activities and outcomes and ensure that tax credits generate the desired new investments as opposed to substituting for investment that would have occurred anyway164 the impact of fricea investments on coal or other shippers is unpredictable however the railroads could choose to fo cus the incremental investments triggered by fricea toward specific geographic areas or categories of traffic such as intermodal traffic165 intermodal investme nts have reportedly fa r outstripped coal related spending since the middle of this decade166 if fricea puts more intermodal traffic on the rails it would achieve the aims of public officials concerned with highway congestion but could put at risk or even degrade the reliability of coal shipments as one analyst notes this is because mixing the much faster intermodal trains with the slower bulk freight trai n movements tends to devour network capacity at an alarming rate 167 there have been

shippers captive to single railroad and there should be ban on applying the tax credit to he lp fund investments that would enhance railroad monopoly power general recommendation for regulatory oversight to ensure that the tax credit is used in the public interest and not simply to increase capacity in the most profitable rail markets all of these proposed qualifications lack specificity and perhaps in some cases would be difficult to impleme nt railroads are networks so an investment in one location can have wide effects it can be very difficult to determine if specific investment will primar ily benefit specific domestic shi ppers or groups of shippers the implication of the proposed qualifica tions is that each fricea investment would have to be individually reviewed by the government before it could qualify for the tax credit this degree of review nd likely associated delay might choke off the additional investment fric ea is intended to encourage it is also important to consider that the community of railroad shippers is not homogenous for example intermodal shi ppers are unlikely to support restrictions designed to funnel investment toward captiv coal traffic other shippers support fricea as it stands including the nationa l mining association which represents coal and other mining industries and txu large texasbased electric power company170 if congress does want to consider the possible restrictions on fricea investments mentioned above other formulations might re quire less intrusive federal oversight an example is limiting the fricea incentives to

managers responsible for the coal supply chain and other traffic from directing the incentives to what in their judgment would be the most productive uses expected outcomes as discussed earlier information on rail capacity and service quality is limited without common baseline different interests may have radically different views of the extent of current capacity and service issues the benefits fricea is likely to yield and what would constitute success for fricea173 the greatest difference in expectations is likely to be between shippers such as electric power producers and the railroads power companies want fast reliable service over rail network with sufficient capacity to smoothly absorb traffic growth at what they view as economical rates they also want the system to

coal stocks for power plants the railroad industry entered the poststa ggers era with financially burdensome excess capacity as noted above it has liminated this surplus by for example increasing traffic shedding assets and labor increasing efficiency and not building too far ahead of excess demand the resultin g tight capacity had directly contributed to the ability of the rail industry to raise ra tes and revenues according to jp morgan securities it appears that the long term trend of growth in demand for rail transportation finally caught up with availa ble capacity and the past two years have been period of much tighter rail capacity compared to the historical norm as result rail transportation ra tes have risen significan tly in 2004 and 2005 while the situation of tight capacity has had ne gative impact on rail service for several railroads and many shippers have received less reliable rail transport service it has also been significant positive from investor perspective174 in early 2007 the railroads were reporte d to be buoyed by new financ ial reports that validate their strategy of keeping capacity snug and pricing firm175 the rail industry has expressly noted the pricing advantages of running railroad systems with limited surplus capacity according to the bnsf we dont bring capacity on sooner than we need it so we always have natu ral

the profitability of the business that we do handle179 the strategy of minimizing excess capacity to support prices is not unique to the railroad industry according to the invest or warren buffett speaking of the electric power industry in deregulated market generators have clear incentive to reduce power reserves if you own in deregulated environment if you own generation assets what do you want things to be tight the nations responsibility is to have some not too much but some excess capacity at all times its crazy to operate without margin of safety he said wise utility regulation allows for ex tra capacity and an adequate return on investment the last thing in the world an unregulated operator wants is excess capacity around however it may be possible for industry actors to deliberately maintain tight capacity environment conducive to pricing power only if the industry is highly concentrated or if competition is otherwise muted to the degree that tight capacity has contributed to the recent ability of the railroads to raise rates it is not clear why the railroads would build significant surplus capacity with or without fricea incentives in this case fricea may not result in systemwide improvements to rail system service and resiliency in the face of adverse circumstances information because the public data on ra il capacity and service is limited the problems fricea is intended to re solve cannot be clearly defined looking ahead existing metrics in the public domai n could be used to rigorously measure the changes in coal capacity and service caused by fricea or other factors fricea does not require industry or government to define service and capacity baseline provide detailed characteriz ation of investments that use fricea incentives or determine the improvements to capacity and service if any that result from fricea incentives the relevant data may be considered proprietary by the railroads coal producers and power companies nonethele ss as discussed earlier in this report if congress concludes that bette r public data on rail capacity and service is needed the confidentiality issue can perhaps be dealt with by aggregating or otherwise masking published capacity and service da ta for specific rail corridors tax incentives considerations and options issues that may be of interest in evaluating the tax incentive proposals include should the public influence how the fricea incentives are used beyond the guidelines built into the proposed legislation if sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs65 how can this intervention be structured as to be practical and not unduly burdensome are the expected outcomes from fricea clear coal and other shippers want fluid resilient rail network offering high quality service even under adverse cond itions this implies level of investment in buffer capacity that may not be affordable even with fricea incentives and may not be attractive to the rail industry in any event because tight capacity has contributed to the industrys ability to raise rates the question is whether fricea is expected to lead to systemwide improvements in rail capacity and service or more limited benefits does the government need additional information on rail capacity and service this could include ba seline and ongoing data that would make it possible to evaluate the need for and effectiveness of fricea collecting and publishing more capacity and service data may require taking steps to protect the confidentiality of business sensitive information analysis of legislative

other goods rate appeals the current stb rate appeal process has been widely criticized by coal and other shipper in terests gao concluded in 2005 that the stbs rate appeal process is ineffective189 the rate appeal process is of particular interest to power companies because almost all rate cases since the passage of staggers have involved coal shipments to power plants this is because coal shipments are one of the few categories of regulated traffic that have enough volume and revenue at stake and the prerequisite lack of competitive service to justify the cost several million dollars

rates of 180 of direct costs rates at this level would still recover nonattributab costs but less than under current rates how much less is unknownlitigation costs and puts the burden of proof on the railroad to demonstrate that the rate is reasonable currently the burden of proof is on the complainant to show that rate is unreasonable it also explicitly bans any rate appeal process that relies like the current procedure on the cost of hypothetical competitor as noted above section 304 of rcsia gives agricultural sh ippers an option unavailable to other shippers of optingout of the rate appeal process altogether and relying on binding arbitration to resolve rate disputes the rate appeal process and the proposal to change it is point where major threads of rail policy intersect the existing process is deliberately designed to allow railroads to charge rates to captive customers that will include large share of the systemwide nonattributable costs that cannot be specifically tied to any individual rail movement this allows the railroads to charge lower rates but never lower than direct cost to customers who have competitive alternatives and are price sensitive costbased rate appeal process that is rates based primarily on the costs that can be directly tied to specific moveme nt could sharply reduce the amount of nonattributable costs charg eable to captive customers190 if the railroad industry is s till not revenue adequa or if the high rates charged to captive customers are cornerstone of the rail industrys financial stability then costbased rate appeals coul d detrimental to the financia l stability of the rail industry however under other circumstances such as the industry is revenue adequate there are relatively few captive customers andor the higher rates captive shippers are charged are not central to the financial integrity of the rail industry cost based rate appeal process may be feasible as discussed elsewhere in this report the information

eating new legal obligations for railroads to provide good service and by highlighting service issues through the web posting process annual report to congress on service and creation of th rail customer advocate the railroad industry characterizes these proposals as reregulation it argues that the proposals would inhibit the pric ing and operational fr eedom that has been important to the revival of the rail industry and would cause the industrys finances and service quality to regress according to the aar reregulation would deprive us freight railroads of several billion dollars in revenue each year making it impossibl for them to fund the rail capacity improvements our country needs the result would be shrunken rail network higher shipping costs more gridlock and environmental

sources effects and policy issues in continuedto implement new processes and technologies that could improve service and reduce costs201 in 2004 the national industrial transportation league commented in relation to its assertion at the time that more competition was needed in the rail market competition drives efficiencies and innova tion it leads to fundamental shift in thinking away from static and ultimately counterproductive effort to protect franchise toward positive effort to grow business opportunities and eliminate costs competition promotes cooperation between transportation providers and their customers as both become partners in an effort to eliminate inefficiencies and improve their market opportunities the result of these efforts is increased demand for the service that is growth202 the current restructuring proposals aim at improving service by heightening competition the emphasis on competition is c onsistent with an underlying principal of the current regulatory regime which is to allow to the maximum extent possible competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail203 though as discussed below it is not certain that more reliance on market forces would be the actual outcome from the proposals the bills would not require the government to develop and enforce specific rail service standards as has been proposed in the past204 the bills also do not directly address the limited information on rail service and capacity discussed earlier in this report without more information aspect s of the proposed legislation are difficult to evaluate for example the emphasis on rate relief and greater competition in the bills presumes that high rail rates especially for captive shippers is significant national

selected markets may be paying excessive rates related to lack of competition in these markets while our analysis of available measures shows that the extent of captivity appears to be dropping in the freight railroad industry shippers that may be captive are paying substantially over the statutory threshol d for initiating rate relief case this situation may simply reflect reasonable economic practices or it may represent an abuse of market power our analysis provides an important first step in assessing competitive markets nationally but it is imperfect given the inherent limitations of the carload waybill sample an stb data set and the proxy measures available for weighing captivity more rigorous analysis of competitive markets nationally is needed one that identifies the state of competition nationwide and inquires into pr icing practices in specific markets206 the gao recommended that the stb conduc t comprehensive study of rail competition and rates suggestion th stb initially rejected based on gaos inconclusive findings and its own lack of resources207 in june 2007 the stb reversed itself and said it would hire contractor to conduct such study to be completed by late 2008 gao commended the stb for taking this action but it remains to be seen whether these analysts would have stbs statutory authority and sufficient access to information to determine whether rail rates in selected markets reflect justified and reasonabl pricing practices or an abuse of market power by the railroads208 the effect of the bills particularly rcs ia is also difficult to evaluate because the outcomes will largely depend on how the legislation is implemented implementation may produce results that di ffer from the apparent objectives of its supporters for example under reciprocal switching or other avenues for opening rail bottlenecks the new competing ra ilroad would be required to pay the incumbent railroad fee for the use of the incumbents tracks for example new

state public serv ice commissions and the federal energy regulatory commission210 however traditional utility rate cases can be complex time consuming to prepare and litigate and very expensive while rcsia puts nine month time limit on rate cases it may nonetheless have less impact on the accessibility and affordability of the proce ss than its proponents intend as noted above section 105 of rcsia authorizes the stb to designate areas of inadequate rail competition and implement within those zones numerous remedies not ll of which are specified in the legislation other remedies author ized by law this provision is so broad that its potential geogra phic and regulatory scope and its impact on rail rates revenues servi ce and profits are very difficult to judge section 105 is probably the part of rcsia with the greatest potential for reintroducing pe rvasive regulation into the rail industry in general it is unclear how complex and intrusive regulatory framework the stb would have to create to implement rcsia related issue is the practical ability of the stb to timely handle the additional workload rcsia would assign to the agency the board is small agency with 137 full time equi valent staff and budget of 261 million in fy2006211 it may be difficult for the board to effectively execute the proposed additional duties without more resources revenue adequacy an important question concerning the rail restructuring proposals is the impact they would have on central goal of the staggers act returning the rail industry to financial health by re ducing the number of captive shippers and otherwise driving down rail rates the restructuring proposals would likely cut railroad revenues and profits for some period of time the railroad industrys position is that the financial impact would be crippling particularly since the railroads have still not achieved the objective of revenue adequacy established by staggers if this is the case service would likely

acknowledges is that of contestable markets in such markets th price of product lies somewhere between its incremental and its standalone cost just where it falls in the range depends on the state of demand thus for regulatory purposes standalone cost constitutes the proper costbased ceiling for prices robert willig and william baumol using competition as guide regulation vol 11 1 1987the issue of the financial impact of th restructuring proposals is particularly apt because the proposals could have the eff ect of changing the existing approach to railroad rate setting this approach called constrained market pricing was developed by the icc in 1985 with coal traffic at the forefront212 constrained market pricing is predicated on two prin ciples the railroad industry is not revenue adequate and to achieve revenue adequacy the railroad industry must be able to differentially price its serv ices based on the price sensitivity of various groups of customers for instance when trying to win business that has truck alternative the railroad might price the movement to recover little more than the costs directly attributable to that moveme nt and few or none of the sy stemwide nonattributable costs such as yard expenses incurred by the railroad on the other hand it may set rates to move coal to captive power plant at price that recovers all the attributable costs of the movement plus substantial share of the nonattributable systemwide expenses demandsensitive differential or strategic pricing is widely used in american industry213 in the case of the rail industry where potential competition is limited by high barriers to entry rates to the captive customers are in principle ultimately constrained by the shippers option to ppeal to the stb rates can be appealed if the shipper can demonstrate that it is captive and that rates exceed 180 of the direct costs of the movement if protested rate meets these initial criteria the stb then determines whether the rate exceeds the costs of hypothetical mostefficient competitor standalone railroad the costs of the standalone railroad represent according to the underlying theory the highest reasonable rate ceiling214 if the rate is ultimately determined by the stb to exceed standalone costs new rate is prescribed based on this ceiling in short constrained market pricing is designed to help the rail industry achieve financial recovery by allowing it to charge relatively high rates to captive customers and relatively low rates to customers who have competitive options the rail restructuring proposals by providing av enues for reducing the number of captive shippers and the rates they pay would chip away at pillar of the constrained markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34186crs77 215 the icc appeared to envision that once the rail industry achieved revenue adequacy significant changes would be made to the constrained market pricing framework in its constrained market pricing decision the icc explicitly stated captive shippers should not be required to continue to pay differentially hi gher rates than other shippers when some or all of that differential is longer necessary to ensure financially sound carrier capable of meeting its current and future service needs exactly what this means is uncertain since it is difficult to envision financially viable rail system in which the railroads do not have significant discretion to vary rates with the price sensitivity of different customers nonetheless it seems clear that when the i cc created the current pricing framework the expectation was that there would be signific ant adjustments when revenue adequacy was reached stb ex parte 347 subno 1 coal rate guidelines nationwide decision august 8 1985 p 18 216 james hixon

system however this may be more or less of concern depending on whether or not the rail industry has reached the staggers goal of revenue adequacy215 in summary it can be hypothesized that if the railroad industry is revenue adequate it may be better able to withstand the stronger dose of competition and regulation the proponents of regulatory re structuring propose and may be better positioned to respond to more intense competition with lower costs greater efficiency and better service if the i ndustry is not revenue adequate then the regulatory status quo may be the better course of action in particular should the regulatory restructuring proposals if implemented undermine the industrys finances then the results of regulatory ch ange could be deterior ation in rail service for coal and other traffic there is ar guably contradiction between demands for both lower rates and better rvice this point is made by norfolk southern the norfolk southern ceo testified at an stb hearing that he hears three things from rail customers they want more capacity they want better service and they want lower rates nd i dont know how you do all three his summary of the three themes he hears from rail customers was reinforced by subsequent witnesses with one even trying to reconcile the irreconcilable unfortunately many parties fail to see that infrastructure investment better service and rates are three legs to one stool one wants to pay everyone wants someone else to pay216 the counterargument not ed above is that more competition will force innovation efficiency gains and traffic grow th that will leave the railroads whole or better off because of these considera tions it would be useful to know if the rail industry is achieving the staggers act objective of revenue adequacy as required by statute the stb makes an annual determination of revenue adequacy for each class i railroad however for the reasons discussed below the reliability of these

determining revenue adequacy was defined in 1981 decision217 the test selected by the icc is whether railroads return on investment was at least equal to its cost of investment capital as explained by the icc adequate revenues are those which provide rate of return on net investment equal to the current cost of capital ie the level of return available on alternative investments this is the revenue level necessary for railroad to compete equally with other firms for ava ilable financing in order to maintain replace modernize and where appropriate expand its facilities and services if railroads cannot earn the fair market ra of return their ability both to retain existing investments and obtain new capital will be impaired because both the existing and prospective funds could be invested elsewhere at more attractive rate of return218 the icc emphasized that revenue adequacy is longterm concept that calls for company over time to average return on investment equal to its cost of capital219 therefore while railroad might be revenue adequate in one year it would not be deemed to have met the staggers act objectives for financial performance until it had achieved this threshold for period of time however the icc declined to specify what period of time may be sufficiently representative in every case this will vary depending upon th carriers traffic base and the relative stability of the economy at the time220 the icc also noted that we want to make clear that we will not and ca nnot guarantee any railroad return equal to the cost of capital railroad like any other firm should earn such return only if it pr ovides desired servi ce in an efficient manner we want to take great care how ever not to deny railroads the opportunity to earn the cost of capital221 the icc applied this approach retroac tively to 1979 and subsequently using this standard the financial performance of the railroad industry has been poor as shown in figure 20 over 27 years the class i railroa d industry as whole has never once been revenue adequate the diffe rence between the industrys return on investment and cost of capital na rrowed from 1979 to 1990 but the gap has not

realized these companies would earn their cost of capital by the ea rly 1990s investors were becoming frustrated by the lack of progress although they became p acified when peb presidential emergency board for resolving labor disputes 219 reduced crew sizes from 5man to 2man resulting in better margins and thus better returns for th industry but still not enough to earn the cost of capital few years later after it was clear that even with 2man crews the industry would not earn its cost of capital investors be gan to lose faith at which point the industry leaders initiated major round of mergers with the prospects of reducing costs and capital needs through consolidation but now six years after this round of mergers began we still have an industry with inadequate returnsunder the economic theory underpinning th boards revenue adequacy test the consistent inability of the ra ilroad industry as whole or even individual carriers to achieve revenue adequacy for over quart er century should result in significant capital shortages and even disi nvestment in the rail industry according to testimony relied upon by the icc223 in developing its re venue adequacy test in the final analysis the only valid test of adequacy of railroads revenues is that they yield rate of return equa l to the opportunity cost of capital fa iling that regulation will result in service dete rioration as result of disinvestment any firm that earns less than this amount its cost of capital will be unable to compete in the market for funds its owners will neither wish nor be able to keep the enterprises capital intact they will withdraw their capital as quickly and as expeditiously as they can224 the icc concluded that railroad management has little incentive to reinvest funds generated by ratepayers in continued rail uses if greater returns are available elsewhere railroads are private comp anies whose stockholde rs would not permit such reinvestment thus even retained earnings will not be invested in the company if they cannot earn rate of retu rn equal to the cost of capital225 nonetheless the railroads continued to invest billions of dollars in their systems over the years even as they consistently fell short of the regulatory standard for revenue adequacy this disc repancy between the failure to achieve revenue adequacy and the continued availability of investment capital has been explained as consequence of optimistic investors putting money into the rail industry in anticipation of financial results that were not realized226 other observers have

unhealthy at least in the technical sens we think the industry is actually fit as fiddle so how can this be we belie ve that the iccs definition of cost of capital is at fault228 the industry technically remains revenue inadequate the fact that the industry may not achieve revenue adequacy is not particularly meaningful however given the many flaws in the design of this financial test229 the revenue adequacy conclusions drawn by the stb are contradicted at times by statements made by railroads to financial analysts the stb determined that ns was revenue adequate in 2004 but the railroa d told investment analysts that it had not achieved its cost of capital230 up which according to the stb analysis has been revenue adequate only once since 1979 told wa ll street that it did achieve our cost of capital in many years and even exceeded231 these contradictions can perhaps be explained by differences which may exist between the financial measurement methods specified by the stb for regulatory filings versus those used by individual companies for their own purposes nonethel ess situation in which the boards metric of revenue adequacy which in essence is measure of how willing investors should be to put money into th railroad industry differs from the rail industrys own reports to the investment an alysts who advise t hose same investors creates some uncertainty about the utility of the stb determinations critics who claim that the stbs met hodology understates the rail industrys actual financial performance have raised numerous technical objections to the boards approach one criticism that appears to have particular significance relates to the methodology used by the board to termine the rail industrys cost of equity capital component of th overall

indefinitely th assumption of an unchanging growth rate is workable for steadystate industries with growth rates that roughly mirror the growth of the overall economy ho wever if an industry has been growing rapidly as has recently been the case for the railroads and this current high growth rate is used in the dcf formul as the stb has done the dcf model will produce an overstated cost of equity this methodological pitfall is documented in the financial literature for example one standard text notes that the simple constantgrowth dcf formula is an extremel useful rule of thumb but more than that naive trust in the formula has led many financial analysts to silly conclusions resist the temptation to apply the formul to firms having high current rates of growth such growth can rarely be sust ained indefinitely but the constantgrowth dcf formula assumes it can232 this problem was pointed out to the stb at least as early as 1997233 in august 2007 the stb proposed changing the approach used to estimate the cost of equity from the dcf model to an alternative capital asset pricing model capm methodology the boards sample capm cal culations show that application of the new method could cut its estimate of the ra ilroad industrys overa ll cost of capital in 2005 by more than third from 122 to 75 using these new estimates the railroad industry as whole was revenue ad equate in 2005234 the significant change in revenue adequacy that results from what is in essence technical adjustment point s at broader possible problem with the stbs revenue adequacy methodology this is the stbs

financial analysis is often not as cut anddried as running numbers through model and receiving clear results for ex ample the board noted that the literature on estimating just the equity component of

then are extremely useful tools but as with other analytical methods they continued in situation with this degree of met hodological uncertainty it is not clear that an essentially mechanical determination of revenue adequacy ba sed on one financial ratio will necessarily yield reliable results note that in traditional utility rate hearings the appropriate rate of return is typically set through contested hearing process not through the mechanical pplication of formula and procedure according to one source for public utility commission it is appropriate to use the results of mathematical financial models to provide zone of reasonableness for the return on equity or roe however the determination of the roe is not an exac t science judgment is inherent and certainly used by financial analysts when applying financial models certainly commission needs to exercise similar judgment to evaluate the overall results of those models and sel ect an appropriate roe237 in contrast to the current use of single financial ratio to determine revenue adequacy prior to passage of the staggers act the icc relied on qualitative evaluation of multiple financial indicators238 when it adopted its current methodology in 1981 the commission rejected multifaceted standard because it would require considerable amount of subjectivity in terms of selecting the mix of indicators to use and the performance standards applicable to each indicator based on the record we must reject mu ltiindicator standard because practical way has been shown to implement it objectively the stb later noted that an advantage of the iccs method for computin g the key cost of equity component is that the simple dcf method require d few inputs and few judgment calls however it may be difficult to avoid intr oducing considerable judgment into the revenue adequacy determination for ex ample the capm approach the stb has proposed using in its future revenue adequ acy determinations re quires its own set of assumptions the stb notes that there are disputes over how to apply the model and whether newer methods are superior239 according to survey of finance practitioners there are substantial disagreements on how to estimate all three of the key inputs to the capm model240 as one text observes finance is in large part matter of judgment and we simply must face this fact241 financial

issues the restructuring bills address of sufficient import to justify extensively revising the current regulatory framework existing data on service capacity rates and the degree to which captive coal and other shippers are subject to market power are incomplete at best should the executive agencies be directed to gather and analyze additional da ta in these areas on an ongoing basis as of mid2007 the stb plans to conduct study of rail competition and rates but this will apparently be onetime analysis what is the actual financial state of the railroad industry congresss view of the restruct uring proposals may depend in part on an evaluation of the financia l condition of the railroads in particular whether they have achieve d the regulatory goal of revenue adequacy financially robust i ndustry may be able to respond to enhanced competition with the innovation and service improvements suggested by proponents weaker industry may contract in response to more intense competiti on and service could deteriorate there are other perspectives if the railroads have achieved revenue adequacy then it might be unwise to make major changes if it has not then more competition may be needed to jumpstart the industry predicate for reachin g any of these conclusions is rigorous analysis of the financial state of the railroads and this does not currently appear to be available would
