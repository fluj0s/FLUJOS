industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034telecommunications act competition innovation and reform summary in 1996 congress enacted comprehensive re form of the nations statutory and regulatory framework for telecommunications by passing the telecommunications act which substantially amended the 1934 communications act the general objective of the 1996 act was to open up markets to competition by removing unnecessary regulatory barriers to entry at that time the indus try was characterized by servicespecific networks that did not compete with one another circuitswitched networks provided lephone service and coaxial cab networks provided cable service the act created distinct regu latory regimes for these servicespecific telephone networks and cable networks that included provisions intended to foster competition from new entrants that used network architectures and technologies similar to those of the incumbents this intramodal competition has proved very limited but the deployment of digital technologies in these previously distinct networks has led to market convergence and intermodal co mpetition as telephone cable and even wireless networks increasingl are able to offer voice data and video services over single broadband platform however because of the distinct regulatory regimes in the act services that are provided by different network technologies but compete with one anot her often receive different regulatory treatment also the act creat ed classification informa tion services that was not subject to either telephone or cable regulation today some voice and video services that are provided using internet protocol t echnology may be classified as information services and therefore not subject to traditional voice or video regulation there is consensus that the current statutory framework is not effective in the current market environment but not on how to modify it the debate focuses on how to foster investment innovation and co mpetition in both the physical broadband network and in the applications that ride over that network while also meeting the many noneconomic objectives of us telecommunications policy universal service homeland security public safety diversity of voices localism consumer protection etc given the underlying cost structure of broadband networks huge sunk upfront fixed costs the marketplace will likely support only limited number of such networks today the market is largely duopol the telephone company network and the cable company network the physical network providers argue that they will be discouraged from undertaking costly and risky buildouts if their networks are subject to open acce ss andor nondiscrimin ation requirements on the other hand independent applications providers ar gue that in order for them to best meet the needs of end users nd offer innovative services they must have nondiscriminatory access to the physical netw ork there is much debate over the advantages and disadvantages of stru ctural regulation such as open access ex nondiscrimination rules suc h as mandatory network neutrality requirements ex post adjudication of abuses of market power on casebycase basis and reliance on nonmandatory principles there is general agreement that there would be great consumer benefits from entry by wirele ss broadband network to compete with the telephone and cable ne tworks there also is deba about how to modify the universal service program and intercarrier compensation rules in light of the major market changes this repor t will be updated as

stat 56 3 the act defines information service as the offering of capability for generating acquiring storing transforming processing retrieving utilizing or making available information via telecommunications title i section 320 of the 1934 acttelecommunications act competition innovation and reform overview the big picture comprehensive statutory framework for us communications policy covering telecommunications and broa dcasting was first created in the communications act of 1934 1934 act1 that act created the federal communications commission fcc or commission to implement and administer the economic regulation of th interstate activities of the telephone monopolies and the licensing of spectrum us ed for broadcast and other purposes it explicitly left most regulation of intrastate telephone services to the states in the 1970s and 1980s combination of technol ogical change court decisions and changes in us policy permitted compe titive entry into some telecommunications and broadcast markets in 1996 cong ress passed the telecommunications act 1996 act2 which opened up markets to co mpetition by removing unnecessary regulatory barriers to entry the 1996 act attempted to foster compe tition among providers that use similar underlying network t echnologies for ex ample circuitswitched telephone networks to offer single type of service for exam ple voice thus there is one regulatory regime for carriers providing voice telephone service and another regime for cable television providers information services3 are not subject to either regulatory regime the subsequent deployment of digital broadband t echnologies in telephone and cable networks has resulte d in these networks providi ng services that compete with one another but that sometimes are subject to different regulatory requirements voice and video services can now be provide d using internet protocol and thus might be classified as unregulated information rvices but these services compete directly with regulated traditional voice and vide services moreover these digital technologies do not recognize national borders much less state boundaries there is consensus that the current statutory framework is not effective in the current market environment but not on how to reform that framework key issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs2 4 in addition there will continue to be niche providers that offer consumers users competitive options for specific services 5 this report does not address proposed legisl ation for discussi on of specific proposals relating to the regulation of broadband network providers that were incorporated into bills introduced in the 109th congress none of which were enacted and 110th congress see crs report rl33496 access to broadband networks by charles b goldfarb of contention have been identified howev er and various proposals have been put forward to resolve these issues both houses of c ongress have begun debating how to modify the 1996 act most of which resides within the comm unications act of 1934 as amended that debate focuses on how to foster investment innovation and competition in both the physical broadband network and in the applicati ons that ride over that network while also meeting the many noneconomic objec tives of us telecommunications policy universal service homeland security pub lic safety diversity of voices localism consumer protection etc the underlying cost structure of br oadband networks huge sunk upfront fixed costs can only support limited number of broadband networks though there generally is similar cost constraint on the number of applications providers in this new environment there will be three broad categories of competition 1 intermodal competition among small number of broadband network providers that offer suite of voice data video and othe r services primarily for the mass market 2 intramodal competition among small number of wireline broadband providers that serve multilocational business customers who tend to be located in business districts and 3 competition between these few broadband network providers and multitude of independent applications service providers4 these three areas of competition will all be affected by comm on factor will there be entry by third broadband network to compete with the broadband networks of the local telephone company and the local cable operator there are four general approaches to the regulation of broadband network providers visavis i ndependent applications providers structural regulation such as open access ex nondiscrimination rules ex post adjudication of abuses of market power as they arise on casebycase basis and reliance on antitrust law and nonmandatory principles as the basis fo r selfregulation at present the fcc follows the last two approaches in this report number of regulatory proposals sometimes incorporating elements from more than one of these approaches are discussed5 at the same time there is consensus that two sets of mechanisms that are fundamental to us telecommuni cations policy and the provision of telecommunications services universal service mechanisms to ensure that basic telephone service remains affo rdable and available to ll households and intercarrier compensation mechanisms by which networks are compensated for carrying traffic that originates or terminates on anot her network need to be modified to accommodate the new market conditions bu t there is agreement on what those modifications should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs3 6 there is single agreedupon definition of broadband in its data collection the federal communications commission defines highspeed lines as connections that deliver services at speeds exceeding 200 kilobits per cond kbps in at least one direction and advanced service lines as connections that deliver services at speeds exceeding 200 kbps in both directions see highspeed services for internet access

attachmatchdoc266596a 1pdf viewed on december 20 2006 speeds that minimally meet these finitions would not be sufficient for the provision of broadcastquality video service thus for example telephone companies that currently offer digital subscriber line dsl broadband connections would have to upgrade those connections in order to offer video service 7 in circuitbased networks for the durati on of any communication circuit is tied up from the calling partys premise all the way to the ca lled partys premise in ipbased networks communication is converted into digital bits and small packets of bits are transmitted over whatever route is available with broadband in place even the lastmile into the calling and called parties premises may accommodate multiple simultaneous applications depending on each applications bandwidth requirements problems with the current statutory and regulatory framework for telecommunications technological change is driving the convergence of number of previously distinct telecommunications and media ma rkets digital technologies are being deployed in and carried over wireline cable and wireless networks that are increasingly capable of providing voice data and video services over single broadband platform6 the us communications in frastructure is evolving from circuitbased networks in which individual applicati ons such as voice telephony are tightly woven into the network architectur to internet protocol ip networks in which multiple applications ride on top of the physical transmission network layer there is consensus that the current statutory and regulatory framework for telecommunications is illsuited for the current market environment there is disagreement however about what modifications are necessary and how comprehensive those m odifications should be at the time of the 1996 telecommunications act the last comprehensive review of us telecommunications policy the environment we live in today was barely contemplated

and therefore declined to treat providers of enhanced services as common carriers subject to regulation under title ii of the act knowledge of the next killer pplication comparable to the world wide web or email that will drive network and software investment given the distinct servi cespecific networks then in use the 1996 act created distinct vertical regulatory silos that equated specific services with specific network technologies the statutory framework for regulating telecommunications services is found in one title of the 1996 act8 and for cable services in another title9 in addition the 1996 act defines category of services information services consisting of the offering of capability for generating acquiring storing transforming processing retrieving utilizing or making available information via telecommunications10 these information services are not subject to any of the specific regulatory regimes in the 1996 act fcc jurisdiction over them is limited to its ancillary authority under title i of the 1934 act11 the distinction in the 1996 act between telecommunications services and informati on services was an outgrowth of line of fcc decisions dating back to the 1970s that distinguished between basic services that were subject to regulation and enhanced services that the commission chose not to regulate in order to foster their development and deployment12 keeping withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs5 13 see for example in the matter of inquiry concerni ng highspeed access to the internet over cable and other facilities internet ov er

such as cable modem service or dsl services based on its ancillary authority under title i of the actthis regulatory history the commission has chosen to forbear from regulating information services again seeking to fo ster their development and deployment13 these distinct regulatory regimes did not create significant problems so long as technological and market fo rces did not erode the distinctions between cable telecommunications and information servi ces and so long as it was possible to unambiguously classify services into thes categories but they became problematic when technological change made it more difficult to determine which service category particular service fell under and when market convergence resulted in competition between services that were classified and thus regulated differently since 1996 the distinctions between th service categories have become increasingly blurred for example some providers are offering voice over internet protocol voip services that meet th definition of information services while competing directly with traditional voice telecommunications services similarly some providers have begun to offer ip video services th at arguably would meet the definition of information services while competing directly with traditional cable services those ipbased service provide rs assert that their offerings should be subject only to the limited regulatory oversight of information services not to the more intrusive regulation of telecommunications services and cable services respectively it has proven to be an administrative and legal morass to determine whether an information service which by defi nition provides certain capabilities via telecommunications is purely an informa tion service and therefore subject only to light regulatory regime or has di stinct telecommunicati ons service component that would make it subject to the more rigorous common carrier regulation imposed on telecommunications services for example in 2002 the fcc concluded that the telecommunications functionality in the cable modem service offered by cable companies to provide high speed access to the internet is integral to the service and not transparent to the consumer and ther efore cable modem service should be treated as pure information service and not subject to the access requirements imposed on telecommunications services14 that decision was upheld by the supreme court in june 200515 at the same time although the fcc had tentatively c oncluded that dsl service which is offered by telephone companies to provi highspeed access to the internet also is an information service with an integral telecommunicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs6 16 appropriate framework for broadband access

september 23 2005 in order not to disrupt markets however the fcc creat ed oneyear transition period during which independent isps would continue to be ab to obtain dsl transmission service from incumbent local exchange carriers and also 270day transition period which could be extended during which the dsl revenues woul d continue to be treated as interstate telecommunications service revenues for the pur poses of funding universal service the fcc also stated that it retained ancillary authority to regulate dsl service and dopted further notice of proposed rulemaking to termine whether it should construct consumer protection rules for broadband services in addition the commission adopted nonbinding policy statement consisting of four principl consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice consumers ar entitled to run applications and services of their choice subject to the needs of law enfo rcement consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network and consumers are entitled to competition among network providers appli cation and service providers and content providerscomponent rather than telecommunications service16 it had continued to treat the transmission component of ds l as telecommunications rvice and therefore dsl continued for more than three years to be subject to the access and other telecommunications service requirements local telephone companies were required to unbundle and separately tari ff the underlying transmissi on component of their dsl internet access services on august 5 2005 the fcc adopted an order that granted dsl internet access providers the same regulatory classification and treatment as cable modem internet access providers17 there is an expectation that providers of information services will attempt to configure their service offerings in fa shion that will maximize the likelihood that the fcc will classify them as pure information services for regulatory purposes as explained in greater detail below in th section on voip however the commission continues to make deter minations based on the underl ying network architectures used about whether any specifi c service offering should be classified and regulated as an information service or as telecommunications service the current siloed statutory and regula tory framework has not been able to accommodate the rapid pace of market c onvergence it sometimes treats differently providers or services that are in direct competition with one another the disparate rules have sometimes created incentives for providers to tailor their investment decisions and product offerings to avoidex ploit artificial regu latory distinctions rather than to efficiently serve customer needs similarly the mechanisms currently embodied in statutes and rules to support such social policy goals as universal service are based on the pre1996 market environmen t and are longer sustainable or as effective as they could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs7 18 tcpip stands for transmission control protoc olinternet protocol ip is responsible for moving packets of data from node to node ip forwards each pa cket based on four byte destination address the ip number the internet authorities assign ranges of numbers to different organizations the organizations ssign groups of their numbers to departments ip operates on gateway machines that move data from department to organization to region and then around the world tcp is responsible for verifying the correct delivery of data from client to server data can be lost in the intermediate network tcp adds support to detect errors or lost data and to trigger retransmission until the data are correctly and completely received 19 since the 1970s engineers have developed va rious network design models incorporating protocols in layered manner while the ne twork configurations have varied somewhat there may be different numbers of layers if for example network functions are combined in some network designs and separated in ot hers there is general agreement that the broadband networks currently being deployed c onsist of layers or tiers starting with the lowest layer of physical infrastructure and ending with the highest layer of content with logical tspip layer that both can accommodate every type of physical network dsl cable modem ethernet fiber optics satellite wifi bluetooth etc as well as multitude of applications and content see for example richard s whitt horizontal leap forward continuedpublic policy issues to debate while there are many dimensions to the bate about reform of the statutory and regulatory framework for telecommunicati ons there appear to be two fundamental underlying issues that affect all others first in this new environment in whic h applications are longer tightly woven into the network architecture what is th best regulatory framework for fostering investment and innovation in both the physical broadband network and in the applications services that ride over that network the physical network providers local exchange carriers and cable system operators argue that they will be discouraged from undertaking costly and risky broadband network buildouts and upgrades if their networks are subject to open access andor nondiscrimination requirements that might limit their ability to exploit vertical integration efficiencies or to maximize the return on or even fully recoup their investments on the other hand the independent applicati ons providers argue that in order for them to best meet the needs of end users and offer innovative rvices in competition with the vertically integrated network providers and in some cases services not offered at all by network providers they must have th same unfettered open access to the physical networks that the network providers enjo or at the least be protected by non discrimination rules similarly many end users argue that their broadband network providers should not be allowed to restri ct their usage of the broadband network so long as they do not in any way compromise the integrity of the network this bigpicture issue raises number of corollary issues in complex technical environm ent in which broadband platform typically consists of physical transmission network layer logical layer usually the tcpip18 suite of protocols an applications layer and content layer19 and in which services passhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs8 19 continued formulating new public policy framework based on the network layers model federal communications law journal vol 56 3 may 2004 professor tim wu has suggested however that in order to construct si mple regulatory rules that would be subject to minimal administrative and litigative encumbra nces it might be preferable to construct regulatory framework that defines just two yers physical transport infrastructure layer and an application services layer see tim wu flat model of telecommunications regulation columbia program in law and tec hnology occasional paper 2006 available upon request from the author who can be reached at h ttp wwwtimwuorg 20 for more detailed discussion of these broadband access issues see crs report rl33496 access to broadband networks by charles b goldfarb 21 ex rules impose explicit requirements restri ctions or prohibitions to which parties know in advance they are required to adhere the regulatory agency typically need not analyze the impact of partys failure to comply with the rule before taking remedial action by contrast ex post adjudication of abuses of market power typically requires the regulatory agency to make finding of abuse of market power before taking any remedial action 22 these four internet consumer freedoms are freedom to access content freedom to use applications freedom to attach personal devices and freedom to obtain service plan information 23 appropriate framework for broadband access to the internet over wireline facilities cc docket 0233 policy statement fcc 05151 released september 23 2005over both the broadband network providers lastmile network and the internet where and how can denied access harm consumers what does it mean to have nondi scriminatory access should access be viewed from the perspective of an end user or of an independent applications provider or of competing network which access restrictions are justifiable to maintain the integrity and operational efficiency of the network20 should access regulation take the form of structural open access requirements or ex nondiscrimination rules or ex post adjudication of abuses of market power as they arise on casebycase basis21 or should there be regulation with industry voluntarily adhering to nondiscrimination principles such as the internet consumer four freedoms enunciated by former fcc chairman michael powell22 or the principles in the nonbinding policy statement adopted by the fcc on august 5 200523 how many competing physical broa dband networks are needed for market forces alone to ensure th at the network providers lack the incentive and the ability to restrict access or otherwise discriminate against independent applications providers to the detriment of consumers to what extent can federal spectrum policy and infrastructure programs foster the deployment of multiple competitive broadband networks thereby alleviating the need for access rules or is it the case th at additional access networks will increase the competitive options available to end users but may not improve the market position of i ndependent appli cations providers who do not have the option of c hoosing among access networks for the best terms conditions and ra tes for interconnection but ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs9 24 there is growing economics literature on these twosided market in which network provider has two distinct sets of customers end users and applications providers to whom it provides service and sets terms conditions and rates for network access in the case of broadband networks end users need access to broadband network to obtain broadband applications and independent applications pr oviders need access to that broadband network in order to provide their applications servic to the end users who are connected to that network see for

autumn 2006 pp 668691must connect to all of the access networks in order to reach their customers24 second while market demand appears to be sufficient to ge nerate competitive broadband network deployment in many urban areas without government intervention that may not be the case in rural or other highcost or lowincome areas where high costs andor limited mand may render it econom ically infeasible to deploy multiple broadband networks or even single network wit hout government intervention does congress want to expand the scope of universal service to include universal access to broadband network at affordable rates if so how can the needed universal servi ce support mechanisms accomplish this in an efficient and sustainable fashion that do not harm other policy goals such as competitive neutrality more basically how broad is the broadband that should be provided as part of universal servi ce bigger may be better but only at an associated cost is it sufficient for example to limit subsidy program in highcost areas to support for broadband service cap able of relatively low quality video streaming if the unsubsidized market is driving companies to deploy broadband capable of offering higher quality broadcastquality video service in urban areas should the universal service subsidy support access to the physical broadband network or should it support specific rvices provided over that network there are corollary issues relating to how the universal service program would be affected by changes in economic regu lation for example when the fcc recently reclassified dsl service as an information service rather than telecommunications service it had two effects on universal servi ce first the current universal service assessment base interstate and international telecommunications revenues was immediately reduced second currently fede ral universal service funding is only available to support telecommunications rvices if dsl services are longer telecommunications services eligible high cost carriers would longer be able to obtain universal service funds in support of those services thus reform of economic regulation must be undertaken in conjunction with review of existing universal service programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs10 25 see for example the research projec ts listed on the website of the parallel and distributed operating systems group at mit available at httppdoscsailmitedu viewed on june 7 2007 26 see for example ariana eunjung cha v iruses security issues undermine internet washington post june 26 2005 at pp a1 a15 27 for example in order not to disrupt mark ets when the fcc adopted an order on august 5 2005 changing the classification of dsl from telecommunications service to an information service it created oneyear tr ansition period during which independent isps would continue to be able to obtain ds l transmission service from incumbent local exchange carriers and also 270day transitio n period which could be extended during which the dsl revenues would continue to be treated as interstate telecommunications service revenues for the purposes of funding uni versal service in addition because blanket reclassification of dsl to informa tion service would under current rules relating to national exchange carrier association neca tariffs and pools that help fund universal service reduce the universal serv ice support available to certain rural telephone companies for the provision of dsl services those carriers were given the option of continuing to treat dsl as common carrier telecommunications service 28 47 usc 253 29 47 usc 151152 30 47 usc 522another important element of the debate is how to develop regulatory framework that will not quickly become obsolete as the market continues to experience rapid technological change for example many technologists envision the development of highly decentralized peertopeer networks to efficiently deliver interactive services in the future thes networks would have major nodes and therefore single points of failure ma king them more secure and robust than current networks that rely on key servers25 already there is discussion of the need to construct new more secure internet26 thus although it would not be appropriate to base new regulatory paradigm on pr esumption that peertopeer network architecture will predominate it so would not make sense to construct regulatory framework that cannot accommodate that architecture further complicating these issues it w ill be necessary to chart transitional course as the shift to digital broadband environment will not occur instantaneously and some providers and cust omers will continue to be dependent on old technology for some period of time27 finally although the current statutory nd regulatory framework allows the fcc to preempt state laws that restrict competition28 it generally limits fcc regulatory authority to interstate and international services29 leaving jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services to the states it also gives states or localities the authority to grant cable franchises and to regulate rightsofway30 as voice data and video services increasingly are provide d over technologies nd networks that do not follow state or even national borde rs however it is becoming less effective to perform certain types of re gulation and especially ec onomic regulation at the state or local level one task of telecom reform is to identify those regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs11 31 this report does not

issues what are the advantages and disa dvantages of the various different approaches to regulating access to broadband networks four options are discussed open access ex nondiscrimination rules ex post adjudication of abuses of ma rket power and selfregulation based on nonmandatory principles how might the current statutory fra mework be modified to address the headtohead competition developing between the broadband networks of telephone comp anies and cable operators how might public policy foster the deployment of additional broadband networks how might the rules for intercarrier compensation the payments that carriers make to one another for terminating the calls originated by their subscribers be made competitively neutral without impinging on other goals of us telecommunications policy in broadband environment whic h services should be supported by universal service subsidy who should receive the subsidy who should contribute to universal service fund and how should the contributors be assessed how do other programs and policies such as federal grant and loan programs and policies toward m unicipal provision of broadband networks contribute to the

telecommunications markets to competition conference report telecommunications act of 1996 house of representatives 104th congress 2d session hrept 104458 at p 1 33 47 usc 253 34 economists call this phenomenon direct network externalities positivenegative externality is benefitcost that is not accounted for in the price of good or service direct network externalities are positive externalities because network connection is more valuable if it can be used to reach more people but the subscriber is not charged more as the number of other subscribers increases in most situations pollution is an example of negative externality because it imposes costs on others but the perpetrator generally is not forced to compensate the harmed parties 35 47 usc 252 background the 1996 act in 1996 congress passed the telecommunica tions act the first major rewrite of our nations telecommunications w since the enactment of the 1934 communications act the general objectiv of the 1996 act was to open up markets to competition by removing unnecessa ry regulatory barriers to entry32 congress attempted to create regulatory framework for the transition from primarily monopoly provision to competitive provision of telecommunications services one key provision allowed the fcc to preempt enforcement of any state or local government statute regulati on or legal requirement that acted as barrier to entry in the provision of interstate or intrastate telecommunications service33 since the value of network service such as telecommunications service increases as the number of other parties connected to the network increases34 new entrants would have very difficult time entering the market if they could not interconnect their networks with those of the incumbent carriers competitive provision of service would benefit consumer s most if all carriers networks were interconnected thus another key provi sion of the 1996 act set obligations for incumbent carriers and new entrants to interconnect their networks with one another imposing additional requirements on the incumbents because they might have the incentive and ability to restrict competitive entry by denying such interconnection or by setting terms conditions and rates that could under mine the ability of the new entrants to compete35 with competitive provision of service ma ny calls will originate on the network of the carrier to whom the calling party subscribes but end up on the network of another carrier to whom the called party s ubscribes while it might be possible to have the calling party pay its carrier for originating call and the called party pay its carrier for terminating that call for various reasons it has been traditional in the united states for the calling partys carrier to pay the called partys carrier forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs13 36 for detailed discussion of interca rrier compensation see crs report rl32889 intercarrier compensation on component of telecom

41 47 usc 254ecompleting the call this is called intercarrier compensation36 and in turn for the calling partys carrier to recover those costs in the rates charged to its subscribers the 1996 act requires that intercarrier compensation rates among competing local exchange carriers be based on the additi onal costs of terminating such calls37 however as discussed below the frame work created by the 1996 act set different intercarrier compensation rates for services that were not competing at that time but do compete today to foster competition in both the long distance and local markets the 1996 act created process by which the regional bell operating companies rbocs would be freed from the restriction on their offering long distan ce service which was one of the terms of the 1982 consent decr ee settling the governments antitrust case against the former bell system monopoly38 once they made showing that their local markets had been opened up to competition39 because congress did not believe it would be viable for competitive entrants to fully build out their networks immediately it included provision requiring the incumbent local exchange carriers to make available to entrants at costbased wholesale rates those elements of their network to which entrants needed access in order not to be impaired in their ability to offer telecommunications services40 prior to enactment of the 1996 act unive rsal service primarily for highcost rural service had been funded through imp licit subsidies in above cost rates for the access charges that long distance carriers paid as intercarrier compensation to local telephone companies for origin ating and terminating their subscribers long distance calls abovecost busine ss rates and abovecos t urban rates recognizing that new entrants would target those services th at had abovecost ra tes and thus erode universal service support congress incl uded in the 1996 act provision requiring universal service support to be explicit rather than hidden in abovecost rates41 this requirement has only been partially impleme nted however and therefore significant implicit universal services subsidies still remain in abovecos t rates for certain services the regulatory framework created by the 1996 act was intended to foster intramodal competition within distinct markets that is competition among companies that used the same underlying t echnology to provide service such as the development of competition between the incumbent local and long distance wireline carriers plus new competitive local exchange carriers all of which used circuithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs14 42 for example for certain long distance calls if the caller uses wireless telephone number the callers wireless carrier is subject to co stbased reciprocal compensation intercarrier compensation charge for the termination of that call but if the caller made an identical call from the same location to the same called party using wireline telephone and hence wireline long distance carrier that carrier w ould be subject to above cost access charges for the completion of the call as another exam ple when long distance call is made to called partys wireline telephone that partys wi reline local exchange carrier can charge the calling partys long distance carrier an above cost access charge for terminating the call but if an identical long distance call were made to ths same called party from and to the same physical location but to the called partys wireless telephone the called partys wireless carrier is not allowed to charge the calling partys long distance carrier any access charge for terminating the call indeed the average intercarrier compensation rate ranges from 01 cents per minute for traffic bound to an information service provider isp to 51 cents per minute for intrastate traffic bound to subscriber of small rural incumbent local exchange carrier individual rates can be as low as zero and as high as 359 cents per minute even though in each case basically the same transport and switching functions are provided see crs report rl32889 intercarrier compensation one component of telecom reform as another example of distorti ons in intermodal competition caused by current rules the federal universal service fund is funded through an assessment on interstate telecommunications service revenues that exceeds 10 the exact assessment rate varies from quarter to quarter information serv ices even if they compete directly with the interstate telecommunications services are not assessedswitched networks to offer voice services it did not envision the intermodal competition that has subsequently developed such as wireless service competing with both local and long distance wireline service voip competing with wireline and wireless telephony ip video competing with cable television given the focus on intramodal competition and the lack of intermodal competition there was little concern about statutory or re gulatory language that set different regulatory burdens for different technology modes as result the current statutory and regulatory framework may be inconsistent with or unresponsive to current ma rket conditions in several ways service providers that are in direct competition with one another sometimes may be subject to differe nt regulatory rules because they use different technologies42 economic regulations intended to protect against monopoly power may not be fully taking into account intermodal competition and the framework may not effectiv ely address interconnection access and social policy issues for an ip architecture in which multiple applications ride on top of the phy sical transmission network layer at the same time it might not be wise to simply replace the statutory provisions fostering intramodal competition with provisions fostering intermodal competition on the expectation that intermodal competition will always be effective for the foreseeable future the primary source of competition in the telecommunications service market for large business enterprise customers will be intramodal ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs15 43 these conditions include divesting connecti ons to more than 350 buildings in their respective territories using longterm leases k nown as indefeasible rights of use freezing special access rates for 30 months offering sta ndalone dsl service continuing settlement free peering arrangements with at least as ma ny internet backbone providers as they had prior to the merger posting their peering policies on publicly accessible websites for two years abiding by the fccs network neutra lity goals not seeking increases in unbundled network element rates for two years and not in creasing the rates paid by existing inregion customers of att and mci for wholesale ds1 and ds3 local private line services than intermodal cable netw orks were constructed to rve residential customers and therefore tend not to be ubiquitously deployed in business districts even the largest cable companies are only in selected geog raphic markets in the country and may not be able to meet the needs of large multilocational business customers also it is likely to take many years for wireless carriers to construct networks that can meet the bandwidth and security requirements of large corporations competitive provision of broadband services to these enterprise customers therefore is most likely to be intramodal but even intramodal competition may be decreasing in the enterprise market until recently the long distance carri ers in particular att and mci were the largest providers of service to enterprise customers with various competitive local exchange carriers clec s also offering enterprise service in addition as they began to meet the conditions in the 1996 act that allowed them to offer service outside their regions the rbocs were becoming significant competitors to att and mci in the enterprise market the ac quisitions of att by sbc with the new company renamed att and of mci by verizon have eliminated those two rbocs as competitors in the enterprise market and also in the internet backbone market also although the remaining clecs have built fiber rings in business areas that connect directly to their major customers locations they have not captured sufficient traffic to capture the scale economies needed to justify buildout of ubiquitous transport network rather they have relied on the rbocs att and mci for transport facilities on many routes as result in approving those mergers the department of justice and the fcc set number of conditions intended to retain competitive options for enterprise and internet customers including the divestiture of some key transport f acilities and ensuring clecs and isps access to certain facilities or services at set rates for at least two years43 nonetheless some enterprise customers and clecs remain concerned about their reduced options for retail services and transport facilities competition and innovation in the internet protocol environment in relatively short period of time the telecommunications sector has evolved from monopoly provision of services over serv icespecific networks to brief period of limited intramodal competition from wi reline competitive access providers and competitive local exchange carriers for th provision of telephone services and from small number of cable ove rbuilders over servicespeci fic networks to incipient intermodal wireline wireless and cable competition over increasingly multiple service broadband platforms these new broadband networks are the physical vehicle for bringing into the home the pplications services of both the networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs16 44 for full discussion of this see george ford thomas koutsky and lawrence spiwack competition after unbundling entry i ndustry structure and convergence phoenix center policy paper number 21 july 2005 available at httpwwwphoenix centerorgpcpppcpp21finalpdf viewed on june 7 2007 45 as will be discussed below the telephone companies have sought at both the federal and state levels modification of existing cable fra nchising requirements to eliminate what they characterize as impediments to their entry in to the video market including the need to negotiate individual franchise agreements with thousands of local jurisdictions buildout requirements for their networks and certain inkind payments 46 the large business customers are likely to ve such great bandwidth demands that they continuedproviders themselves and the independent applications pr oviders at this stage of the transition however most customers c ontinue to receive services over legacy servicespecific narrowband networks it is important to understand what th is new environment characterized by convergence of previously distinct ma rkets and government policy focused on fostering facilitiesbased intermodal competition is likely to yield the market convergence currently underway will not re sult in multitude of broadband networks because the underlying cost structure for ch networks the huge sunk upfront fixed costs that can only be recovered if the company can exploit significant economies of scale and scope will only support limited numbe r of networks this is the case for wireline or wireless networks moreover market convergence is not simply the ability to bundle voice data and video serv ices into single product offering rather it is technological spillover from digital technology that reduces entry costs so that firms that already ve singleuse networks providing voice data or video services can now use those networks with relatively inexpensive upgrades to offer multiple services over single platform44 for example at far less cost than would be required to build an entirely new network the incumbent local exchange carriers can deploy dsl equi pment on their copper networks to offer data and video services or the cable companies can upgrade their networks to offer voip in this situation in which underlying costs ar likely to limit the number of network providers public policy can nonethele ss foster competition by removing impediments to singleuse networks expanding into other markets at the same time policy makers should remain vigilant that the few netw ork providers not constrain the ability of independent applications providers that do not have their own broadband networks to compete in those applications markets in the new environment there will be three broad categories of competition and innovation issues tied together by one co mmon issue these three categories are intermodal competition and innova tion among small number of broadband network providers that offer suite of voice data video and other services primarily for the mass market45 intramodal competition and innova tion among small number of wireline broadband providers that serve multilocational business customers who tend to be located in business districts46 and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs17 46 continued will have dedicated pipes to their major locations with broadband capability and will be reliant on the broadband network providers gene ral buildout only to connect to their smaller locations or to their customers locations some parties have expressed concern however that with the completion of the sbcatt verizonmci and attbellsouth mergers these large business customers may not have many alternative sources especially to the extent that cable networks tend to be bu ilt out to residential neighborhoods rather than business districtscompetition between those few broadband network providers and multitude of independent service providers often for applications that have more specia lized customer base the common issue how many broadband networks will there be and how will that affect competition among network providers and competition between those network providers and the independent applications providers despite all the technological and mark et changes that have occurred and continue to take place competition issues in the telecommunications sector will continue to focus on the physical transpor t link into both busin ess and residential customers premises the new network ar chitectures may allow many applications to ride on single physical transmission layer but access to that layer and competition among the small number of physical network providers remain the primary competition issues applications innovation competition between integrated network providers and independent applications providers integrated network providers and indepe ndent applications providers come from very different traditions the network provi ders the local exchange carriers cable companies and wireless carriers come from the tradition of employing vertically integrated business model providing as single product offering the network connection and specific service or suite of services they are used to developing and deploying their networks in the context of business plan that jointly maximizes profits from the physical network and the rvices they provide over that network their network rollout and applications product rollout are c oordinated network architecture is driven at least in part by the services they intend to offer underlying this approach is the assumption that inve stment can best be supported and innovation can best be achieved by giving the verti cally integrated netw ork provider free rein over network architecture control of network intelligence and discretion over the extent to which it gives competing app lications providers access to its network in sharp contrast many of the indepe ndent applications providers and their customers come from the internet tradition of network neutrality that is an internet that does not favor one application or one appli cations provider over others in practice even the internet does not adhere to pure network neutrality for example the internet protocol works well for data applications which are insensitive to latency delay and less well for voice and video applications that are sensitive tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs18 47 for more detailed discussion of the issues of network neutrality open access and broadband discrimination see tim wu net work neutrality broadband discrimination journal on telecommunicati ons high technology law vol 2 2003 pp 141178 professor wus

rl33496 access to broadband networks by charles b goldfarblatency because it lacks univers quality of service guarantee47 nonetheless the assumptions that underlie the internet tr adition are that the innovation process is survivalofthefittest competition among developers of new tec hnologies that the most promising path of innova tion cannot be predicted in dvance and that therefore it is not optimal to allow any private or public entity to direct that path the network should be neutral this reasoning s upports the need for endtoend design by which whenever possible communications protocol operations occur at the end points of communications sy stem ie dumb network with smart terminals but since until 1995 the internet was supporte d by government funding rather than market funding this approach has not focu sed in the past on the task of raising sufficient capital to build out physical networks the vertically integrated network provi ders and the indepe ndent applications providers are not inherently at odds with one another however they share many goals the internet environment is characterized by indirect network externalities in which independent actions taken by hardware and so ftware providers benefit one another the greater the investment in physical network to improve connection speed and quality of service the greater the opport unities for software pr oviders to develop new potentially profitable applications at the same time the greater the number of software applications available the greater the enduser demand for broadband connections network provider will have an incentive not to restrict applications providers access to its physical network to the extent that could reduce demand for connections to that network though that ffect could be limited if end users have alternative broadba nd networks available to turn to at the same time vertically integrated network provi ders might face counter incentive to restrict or delay network access to applications providers an example is if the vertically integrated companies are developing applications that would compete with independent providers applications and would like to exploit firstin advantages they also will have the incentive to deploy network architecture most consistent with their own plans for appli cations which may not coincide with the needs of the independent appli cations providers or with the desire of end users to use their broadband network for applications telecommuting home networking or other purposes that might undermine the ability of the network provider to price discriminate or in other ways jointly ma ximize the profits from its network and own suite of applications for example some critics have claimed that the rbocs resisted deploying dsl technology in thei r networks for more than decade because of concern that offering highspeed dsl service would cannibalize the revenues and profits that were being generated by their t1 large capacity dedicated pipe service according to these critics despite the fact that the relatively inexpensive dsl technology had been available for long time the rbocs began deploying dsl only once there was significant risk of ceding the mass market highspeedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs19 48 see joseph farrell and philip weiser modularity vertical integration and open access policies

platform access are regulated 2 if the platform monopolist can use otherwise efficient price discrimination to make even inefficient vertical leveraging prof itable 3 if an applications provider is potential competitor at the platform level th at the monopoly platform provider wants to weaken 4 if the monopoly platform provider can use its market bargaining power to impose licensing or other arrangement on an pplications provider that discourages future applications innovations 5 if the platform monopolist is incompetent and therefore cannot recognize optimal choices 6 if the platfo rm monopolist perceives that allowing open access today would undermine its ability to close access in the future even if it would be efficient to do so 7 if for regulatory st rategy considerations the platform monopolist is afraid that agreeing to open access for say isps would raise the risk of having open access imposed in another market such as cable video programming and 8 if the platform is not essential for all uses of the application and there are economies of scale or network effects in the applicationconnection market to cable modems the rbocs have responded that they had not deployed dsl because the market had not yet developed for the highspeed service in market characterized by economic interdependence between platform and applications made for that platform sometimes an armslength relationship between the platform provider and the applications providers will be less efficient than closer vertical relationshi p academic economists have employed the concept of internalizing complementary efficiencies ice to explain vertical competitive effects why sometimes the platform pr ovider chooses an open architecture and modular design to interact with the fu ll universe of applications providers and sometimes chooses to interact only with its own vertically integrated applications subsidiaries or affiliates48 the ice theorem suggests that monopolist broadband network provider has incentives to provide independent applications providers access to its broadband platform when it is efficient to do so and to deny such access only when access is inefficient but economic theory further expl ains that platform providers will not always make the optimal choice there are number of circumstances when the platform providers choice might not be efficient or benefit consumers49 economic theory therefore suggests that there may be pitfalls in either blanket requirement for access to the br oadband network or bl anket deregulation in market characterized by high sunk upfront fixed costs and very low variable usage costs once the upfront co sts have been sunk which is descriptive both of the physical broadband network and the software applications provided over that network it often is efficient for firm to employ price discrimination to recover its fixed costs that is it may be most efficient to segment customers according to the intensity of their demand for the broa dband connection or application charging higher price for the custom ers with higher intensity of demand in the case of the broadband connection that inte nsity might be measured in terms of the amount of bandwidth demanded as will be discussed below such price discrimination based on bandwidth usage need not infringe on network neutrality need not favor some applications over others so long as th market segmentation is based on the amount of bandwidth used rather than on the speci fic application and so long as customershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs20

performed rvey of broadband usage restrictions and network designs for the 10 largest cable operators and six major dsl operators50 the survey found that on the whole broadband providers networks and usage restrictions favored clients erver applications such as the world wide web and disfavored home networking peertop eer applications and home telecommuting cable operators tended to im pose far more restrictions on usage than dsl operators specifically nearly every cable operator nd one third of dsl operators restricted end users from operating server andor providing content to the public this restriction is potentially very significant because it affects the broadest class of applications those where the end user shares content as opposed to simply downloading content it favors onetomany or vertical mode l of applications over many tomany or horizontal model in application design terms the restriction favors clie ntserver applications over peertopeer designs the inability to provide content or act as server could serve to restrict major cl ass of network applications every cable operator and most dsl operators had some ban on using basic residential broadba nd connection for commercial or enterprise use the most controve rsial of such restrictions barred home users from using virtual public networks which are used by telecommuters to connect to their work network through secure connection when home networking became widespread in 2002 four of the ten largest cable operators contractually limited the deployment of home networks by setting restrictions on the number of computers that could be attached to single c onnection in contrast some dsl operators in their agreements ex plicitly acknowledged that multiple computers could be connected to the dsl connection though sometimes only through single dsl account and single ip address obtained from the dsl operator several cable operators sought to control the deployment of home wireless networks by

are onetomany or clientserver in design applications that w ould demand reside ntial accounts to deliver content as quickly as they receive it are limited by asymmetric bandwidth it was not clear how actively network pr oviders had attempted to enforce those restrictions in their contracts with subs cribers though there was anecdotal evidence of some enforcement nor was it clear whether such restrictions would continue when wireless technology was able to pr ovide greater competition to wireline and cable network providers in some ways there appear to be fewer usage restrictions today than there were in 2002 it is not eworthy however that the cable networks imposed more usage restrictions than di d the dsl network there are two possible explanations for this 1 cable was th largest broadband platform provider and could offer greater bandwidth and these f irstin and technology advantages might have allowed it to set strategic usage restri ctions that other pl atforms could only set at their peril and 2 since cables broa dband architecture requires customers to share bandwidth there was greater need for cable to manage the bandwidth usage of its customers yet cable operators have not barred streaming vide despite its potential for competing with cable television it does not appear that these restric tions will go entirely away anytime soon vendors are actively marketing equipment designed to f acilitate applicationsbased screening and control for broadcast networ ks such as products intended to address peertopeer traffic and unauthorized wi fi connections and control over network utilization51 network providers are deploying ch equipment though it is not clear exactly how they are using it access and usage restrictions may be justified if they are needed to protect the integrity of the network or to operate th network efficiently for example bandwidth management needed to maintain quality of service but there may be situations where the network provider has chosen an overly restrictive solution that will discourage applications i nnovation and competition for example if network provider must manage bandwidth usage in order to maintain quality of service for video and voice services it would be more efficient for the provider to do so by setting rates that rise as bandwidth usage increases rather than by prohibiting all bandwidthintensive applications the form er represents an application of price discrimination that most economists r ecognize as efficient the latter may be unnecessarily restrictive professor wu concluded that on the whole the evidence from his survey suggested that the operators were often pursuing legitimate goals such as price discrimination and bandwidth management the problem was they often used methods like

immediat ely after the fccs august 2005 decision that dsl service is an information service and therefore not subject to title ii access requirements52 they claimed that prior to th fcc decision verizon had offered them access to its broadband network at the yer 2 or data link level which allowed them to offer their own services at guaranteed quality of service but after the fcc decision verizon replaced that access ffering with an offering that only allowed access at the layer 3 or network level which in essence is complete package that the isp can only resell without offering additional services verizon representative conceded the change in service offering but claimed that customers have been cut off and inte rnet sites are being blocked and the customers of these isps will have full internet access under the new service arrangement53 more recently the three largest rbocs ve announced their intentions to take advantage of new technology that allows them to distinguish among the digitized packets on their highspeed networks to ch arge those providers of applications who want to be able to guarantee their customers an assured quality of service for example for voice or video service premium for such assured high quality delivery54 the rbocs claim that even if an enduser customer pays high price for lot of bandwidth that customer could not receive an assured quality of service for voice or video service received over the public internet that customer might blame its broadband network pr ovider or the applications provi der for the degraded service quality even if the problem resided in the internet but today an rboc can distinguish the packets destined for th at providers enduser customers and by connecting the provider directly to its pr oprietary ip networks can guarantee the quality of service of the providers offerings the rbocs argue that such guaranteed quality of service is of value to the applications provider as well as to the end user and therefore they should be able to char ge the provider premium for such assured quality independent appli cations providers have cr iticized these proposed quality of service charges arguing that the rbocs could impose high quality of services charges on them that they do not impose on their own applications they also have voiced concern that the rbocs could use the new packet identification equipment to provide better service to their own enduser customers than to competitors end user customers and could st rategically deploy network capacity

networks by charles b goldfarb 56 see tim wu flat model of telecomm unications regulation columbia program in law and technology occasional paper 2006 available upon request from the author who can be reached at http wwwtimwuorgapproaches to regulating access to broadband networks there are four general approaches to the regulation of broadband network providers visavis independe nt applications providers structural regulation such as open access ex nondiscrimination rules ex post adjudication of abuses of mark et power as they arise on casebycase basis and reliance on antitrust and unfair thods of competition law and nonmandatory principles as th basis for selfregulation there have been plethora of proposals for such regulation with the proposals sometimes incorporating elements from more than one of these approaches55 ex rules and ex post adjudication both typically focus on anticompetitive discrimination that harms consumers but in distinct ways ex rules have been characterized as positive antidiscrimination rules in that they create affirmative legal duties that are intended to remedy either past di scrimination or the likelihood of future discrimination56 prohibiting certain activities before the fact by contrast ex post adjudication typically seeks to punish identified episodes of discrimination on casebycase basis after the fact positive schemes impose more upfront costs by restricting certain beha viors some of which might have proven beneficial to consumers but depending on the cost to consumers in terms of denied access to potentially highly valued applications of allowing discrimination to occur and then adjudicating after the fact the ultimate cost of ex rules might prove lower than ex post adjudication open access although there is not single agreedupon definition of open access it generally refers to structural requireme nt that would prevent broadband network provider from bundling broadband service with internet access from its own inhouse internet service provider and would re quire the network pr ovider to make its broadband transmission capability available to independent isps on nondiscriminatory basis proponents of open access argue that if broadband network provider such as cable operator is allowed to bundle isp services with its broadband connection at single price and not offer the broadband connection separately

lines if the customer has choice but to accept from the broadband provider single bundle that includes both the broadband connection and isp service then an independent isp would always be at price disadvantage and could only compete by offering unique capabilities that are sufficient to overcome that price disadvantage this is likely to limit an independent isps customer base to those customers with unique needs that are not met by the mass market broadband provider proponents of open access claim that allo wing network providers to restrict independent isps access will 1 eliminate or at least reduce isp competition 2 allow legacy monopoly networks to improperl affect the architecture of the internet in an effort to protect their own busin ess plans 3 discourage innovators from investing in market in which dominant player has the power to behave strategically against them and 4 make government intervention to control certain forms of speech easier and therefore more likely

network providers do not have the incentive to restrict independent appli cations providers access to their networks or would do so only where it was efficient they further argue that even if one group of network providers for example the cable companies were to restrict access wireline broadband providers and other competitors are unlikely to follow suit so independent isps would have access to customers some critics claim that open access woul d retard deployme nt of broadband networks by reducing the ability of network providers to exploit vertical integration efficiencies and also by reducing the reve nues network providers could generate from their applications thereby making some ne twork investments unprofitable they also suggest that the close coordination between network provider and as applications provider needed for optimal joint devel opment of network nd applications is sometimes only possible through vertical inte gration for example professor james speta argues that vertical integration of access providers may be necessary especially in initial periods of deploy ment broadband access pr oviders must ensure supply of complementary informati on services broadband provider must either provide those goods itself or arrange for source of supply59httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs25 59 continued rules for broadband platforms yale j ournal on regulation

dependent applications it could harm network neutrality by threatening the vertical relationship required for certain application types it could maintain ips discrimination in favor of data applications in response to these criticisms of ope n access its proponents have pointed out fundamental contradic tion among the criticisms60 on one hand critics argue that due to indirect network externalities br oadband network providers selfinterest will lead them to place minimal restrictions on customers usage of and independent applications providers access to their ne tworks on the other hand critics argue that restricted access is need ed to ensure that the netw ork providers generate enough revenues to recoup their inve stment in the network ex nondiscrimination rules the basic principle behind network nondi scrimination regime is to give users the right by rule to use nonharmful attachments or appli cations and to give equipment and applications innovators th corresponding right also by rule to supply them it therefore applies both to end users and to inde pendent applications providers proponents claim that such regime avoids some of the costs of structural regulation by allowing for efficient vertical integration so long as the rights granted to the users of the network are not compromised proponents contend that the ability of network provider to discriminate is greater with digital broa dband network than with an analog narrowband network offering dialup service analog networ k operators cannot easily distinguish between types of digitized packets of information going across their lines but digital network operators can distinguish among the p ackets on their highspeed networks61 for example some universities are performing applicationspecific screening to identify students illegally copying entertainment materials and presumably similar capabilities could be used to identify app lications the network provider wishes to restrict or prohibit typically proponents of nondiscrimina tion rules are proponents of network neutrality not favoring one application or applications providers over another62httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs26 62

re classifying dsl services as information servic rather than telecommunications services in early august 2005 representatives from microsoft dell yahoo and the consumer electronics association cea as well as consumer organizations met with fcc commissioners and explained the need for net neutrality provisions because network operators have the opportunity incentive nd ability to violate these net neutrality principles see for example the ex parte letter dated august 2 2005 from veronica oconnell senior dire ctor government affairs cons umer electronics association to marlene h dortch secretary federa l communications commission on behalf of microsoft corporation media access project vonage dell and cea similarly as entertainment companies seek ways to dist ribute movies and television shows

providers clout gr ows fears over access take focus wall street journal august 8 2005 at p a1they argue that network neutrality as embodied in ex nondiscrimination rules fosters the goal of stimulating investme nt and innovation in broadband technology and services in two ways 1 by eliminating the risk of future discrimination thereby providing independent appl ications providers greater incentives to invest in broadband applications and 2 by facilitating fair competition among applications ensuring the survival of the fittest proponents claim that network that is as neutral as possible with such neutrality ensured by explicit nondiscr imination rules provi des entrepreneurs predictability in that all applications are tr eated alike this they argue will foster investment in broadband app lications by eliminating th unpredictability created by potential future restrictions on network usage neutrality provides applications designers and consumers alike with ba seline on which they can rely proponents allege the recent restrictions that cable operators placed on virtual private networks is indicative of the tendenc of some network provide rs to restrict new and innovative applications they see as either unimportant or competitive threat such usage restrictions they cla im particularly harm those small and startup developers that are most likely to push the envelope of what is possible using the internets architecture63 proponents also claim that the most pr omising path of development will be difficult to predict in advance neutral ne twork development is likely to yield better results than planned innovation directed by single prospect holder any single entity will suffer from cognitive biases such as predisposition to continue with current ways of doing business these proponents conclude that restrictions on usage however wellintended tend to favor certain app lications over others regulatory framework that requires networ k providers to justify deviations from neutrality would prevent both unthinking and illintentioned distortions of the market for new applications the proponents of nondiscrimination rules argue that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs27 64 the specific rule would be as follows ____ forbidding broadcast discrimination broadband users have the right reasonably to use their internet connection in ways which are privately beneficial without being publicly detrimen tal accordingly broadband operators shall impose restrictions on th use of an internet connection except as necessary to 1 comply with any legal duty created by fede ral state or local laws or as necessary to comply with any executive order warrant legal injunction subpoena or other duly authorized governmental directive 2 prevent physical harm to the local broadband network caused by any network attachment or network usage 3 prevent broadband users from interfering with other broadband or internet users use of their internet connections including but not limited to neutral limits on bandwidth usage limits on mass transmissi on of unsolicited email and limits on the distribution of computer viruses worms and limits on denialofservice or other attacks on others 4 ensure the quality of the broadband service by eliminating delay jitter or other technical aberrations 5 prevent violations of the security of the broadband network including all efforts to gain unauthorized access to computers on the broadband network or internet 6 serve any other purpose specifically au thorized by the federal communications continuedrestrictions that some ne twork providers have imposed on home networking online gaming and vpns not only directly harm consumers and app lications providers today but also have chilling effect on i nnovators and venture capitalists considering future applications development and deployment they argue that the possibility of discrimination in the future dampens the incentives to invest today two very different proposals for ex rules merit discu ssion one would enact pure ex regime the other would enact hybrid regime that constructs ex rules only where antitrust enforcement might not be sufficient ex neutrality regime professor wu has proposed what he calls neutrality regime that would set ex nondiscrimination acce ss rules that would apply to the internetwork portion of broadband networ k providers network that is the portion that it collectively manages with other network providers but not to the local portion of the network that is under the providers sole control each broadband network provider is member of two networks the local network that provides the lastmile of transport to its enduser customers and which it owns and manages by itself and the internetwork which it collectively manages with other service providers if broadband ne twork provider imposes local network restrictions usually those restrictions will only affect its local network such restrictions are likely to be necessary fo r good network management in contrast restrictions at the internetwork layer or applications layer will affect the entire network internetwork as well as local network and can cause externality problems the ex neutrality regime is based on nondiscrimination rule that distinguishes between discr imination at the local networ k level acceptable and at the internetwork level unacceptable the rule would make operational the network neutrality principle at the internetwork level64 the rule prohibits discriminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs28 64 continued commission based on weighing of the specific costs and benefit of the restriction b as used in this section 1 broadband operators means

to otherwise prevent customers from using vo ip applications and paid fine of 15000 it is possible that madison rivers primary incentive for blocking vonage service was to protect against the loss of access charge revenue s as explained below in the section on intercarrier compensation rural telephone comp anies currently get large portion of their revenues from abovecost access charges imposed on long distance carriers for originating or terminating long distance calls if inter carrier compensation reform were enacted that removed the implicit subsidies from access charges and placed those subsidies in an expanded federal universal service fund the incentive to block voip calls would be significantly reducedbased on such internetwork elements as ip addresses domain name and cookie information its general principle is abse nt evidence of harm to the local network or the interests of other users broadband network provi ders should not discriminate in how they treat traffic on their broa dband network on the basis of internetwork criteria thus for example under the ex neutrality regime broadband network provider concerned about ma naging bandwidth would be prohibited from blocking traffic from game sites based on either app lication information or the ip address of the application provider but it would be allowed to invest in policing bandwidth usage users interested in better gaming experience would need to buy more bandwidth not get permission to use give n application as another example in 2005 the fcc entered into consent decr ee with madison river communications rural telephone company which had been blocking ports used for voip applications thereby affecting their customers ability to use voip through voip service providers65 under this regime such discriminatory behavior would be ex illegal since professor wu would not regulate customer access to the local network portion of the broadband networ k he would allow cable opera tors to tie

cable modem to obtain isp service from another isp and would prohi bit an ilec from refusing to allow customer to use its dsl service to obt ain voice service from another voice provider ex nondiscrimination rules have been subject to criticism from parties that argue that such rules would intrude too much into the business plans of broadband network providers these critics argue th at nondiscrimination rules impinge on the ability of broadcast network providers to fully exploit efficiencies from vertical integration or to use price discrimination or other pricing strategies to maximize return on investment professor wu re sponds that his proposal which limits the non discrimination prohibition to the intern etwork portion minimizes that effect by allowing the network provide r to take advantage of those economies of scope and vertical integration advantages such as ffering service level guarantees not provided on shared network that come with bu ilding ones own physical network so long as restrictions such as prohibiting acce ss to certain ip addresses are placed on use of the shared portion of the internet network on the othe r hand some parties have been concerned that by allowing the broadband network providers unlimited control over the local portion of their networks those providers still could distort applications markets to their advantage though it might be more difficult or more expensive to do so another criticism of ex nondiscrimination rules is that they inherently lead to delays litigation and other regulatory costs as partie s fight over interpretation of the rules the complexity of communications networks it is argued renders it difficult if not impossible to construct clear ex rules these critics point to the industry experience implementing the 1996 ac t professor wu has responded that delays litigation and ot her regulatory costs of administering an ex non discrimination rule could be minimized by identifying only two network layers the transport infrastructure layer and the application services level66 and by restricting the rules to the internetwork portion of the network the other major criticism is that ex rules of any sort and especially those relating to network access w ill artificially aid an indepe ndent applications provider in its contractual negotiations with br oadband network provide r by allowing it to threaten to bring regulatory complaint and attendant costs if the network provider does not accept its terms according to this argument the network provider often might be forced to accept unfavorable or inefficient access terms to avoid the threat of litigation the european union framework the european union eu has adopted legislative framework for th regulation of elect ronic

within their national boundaries to determine which providers have significant market power and based on that market analysis create the appropriate specific regulations rules or oblig ations to impose on those providers76 to date very few of the member states have performed this market analysis or implemented regulations rules or oblig ations and thus there is empirical evidence on the impact of this regulatory framework the commission guidelines state that alt hough high market share alone is not considered sufficient to establish possessi on of significant market power concerns about single firm dominance arise with market shares of 40 or above77 providers with market share of 25 or less are deemed unlikely to have significant market power emerging markets where facto the

4151critics of the eu framework claim that although the rules are set ex they fail to provide either networ k providers or independent applications providers the type of certainty that fosters innovative activity because they are determined on casebycase basis and do not take advantage of characteristics common to most communications markets as one critic explains what distinguishes telecommunications pr oblems is that they share consistent features found in some but not all an titrust cases most telecommunications problems feature many if not all of the following economic features 1 physical infrastructure of high fixed cost that is 2 large source of both positive externalities including network ex ternalities that 3 can be used to provide range of services and 4 in an environment of rapid technological change that makes the infrastructure useful for different services than those for which it was originally designed79 given these common market characteristics it might be possible to construct general rules that provide certainty for networ k providers and inde pendent applications providers alike another criticism of the eu framework is that reliance on antitrust principles simply replaces the current contentious battle over the classification of services with new contentious battle over proper market definition since any determination of whether firm has signifi cant market power is likely to depend heavily on the geographic and product market definitions chosen ex post adjudication of abuses of market power the regulatory framework working group of the digital age communications act project of the progress and free dom foundation pff working group has proposed replacing the current statutory and regulatory framework that relies heavily on proscriptive rules that set ex structural and behavior requirements such as access requirements or nondiscr imination rules with system that would adjudicate alleged abuses of market power ex post as they arise on casebycase basis it proposes enacting new statute the di gital age communications act daca80 modeled after the federal trade commission act 81 that would give the fcc or successor agency the authority to adjudi cate allegations of unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts in or affecting electronic communications networks and electronic communications rvices these unfair practices could include interconnectionrelated practices such as the refusal to interconnect or unfair terms conditions and ra tes of interconnection httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs33 if such practices were shown to pose substantial and nontransitory risk to consumer welfare and if the commission determined marketplace competition were not sufficient to protect consumer welfare and if the commission considered whether requiring interconnection would affect adversely investme nt in facilities and innovation in services under the proposal the commission coul d require the guilty party to pay damages to the harmed party if any viol ation were found also under the proposal the commission would have very constraine d authority to prescribe rules which would automatically sunset after five ears the fccs authority to approve an application to assign or transf er control of license that is to review mergers would be limited to ensuring that any such change in control did not violate existing fcc rules the pff working group claims that the potential harm to consumers from bad regulation far exceeds the potential harm from badly functioning markets and therefore the burden of proof must fall on the regulator for imposing any regulation it seeks to codify presumption th at regulation is unnecessary to protect consumers and provide tools that can adequately address competition problems that arise in communications markets it stat that even inefficient market outcomes are likely to be less problematic than regulatory solution because 1 markets are effective at responding to and overcoming their own inefficiencies 2 government may not have the incentive to improve matters and 3 policy makers are likely to lack the information needed to make efficient decisions thus it proposes ex post rather than ex regulation and the fiveyear s unset provision the pff working group further argues that new statute is needed in order to repl ace the current model of regulation based on va gue standards such as the public interest and just and reasonable with the wellestablished unfair competition standard of the ftc it explicitly seeks in each and every provision of its proposed statute to minimize the fccs regulatory authority the pff working group proposal for ex post regulation has been subject to several criticisms first it is based on the assumption that consumer welfare loss from bad regulation is always far greater than consumer welfare loss from badly performing markets and that it is therefor best to err on the side of underregulating this may or may not be true in the case of markets characterized by networks where the platform provider and applications providers must c ooperate to maximize consumer welfare there is larg and growing academic law and economics literature on these unique markets there is consensus in the literature or from empirical evidence that in these markets there is less risk from erring on the side of underregulation than on the side of overre gulation nor is there theoretical or empirical proof that the potential harm to consumers from distortions created by ex rules are greater than those created by ex post adjudication it is possible that narrowly crafted ex nondiscrimination rule coul d create less distortion than ex post adjudications that will inherently result in some and potentially many innovative independent applica tions providers being driven from the market therebyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs34 82 see for example ex parte letter dated february 21 2003 from daniel l brenner and michael schooler counsel for the national cable telecommunications association to marlene dortch secretary of the federa l communications commission submitted in cs docket 0252denying customers the benefit of their services the pff working group proposal appears implicitly to recognize that possibility by giving the fcc rulemaking authority which although constrained would allow the commission to consider adoption of ex rules where appropriate more generally critics claim that ex post regulation distorts the business plans and undermines the negotiating position of independent applica tions providers by placing the burden of proof for network access on them if they seek to develop and introduce an application that may not fit into the business plan of the network provider according to this argument the independent appli cations provider might be forced to modify its planned application or accept unfavorable or inefficient access terms to avoid the threat of being denied access to the broadband network some critics also oppose the pff work ing group proposal to eliminate the public interest standard claiming reliance on what is basically an antitrust standard fails to take into account noneconomic objectives of us telecommunications policy such as localism and diversity of voices antitrust law and nonmandatory principles as the basis for selfregulation the broadband network provide rs have argued that they should not be subject to access regulation because they face strong market incentives not to restrict the access of independent applica tions providers to their networks they cite the existence of indirect network efficienci which reward network providers for keeping their network open and the availability to most americans of at least two broadband networks they argue that any access regulation would cause harm by curtailing their ability to vertically integrate to exploit efficiencies such as ensuring quality of service levels needed for video and voice services82 they argue that where they have placed usage restrictions on cust omers those restrictions were needed to ensure quality of service and other bandwidth management objectives and to make it feasible to undertake their huge infrastruct ure investments they also claim that they remain subject to the antitrust laws which would constrain them from undertaking any anticompetitive activities that are harmful to consumers these arguments have been subject to number of attacks critics have pointed to the widespread documented usage restri ctions that network providers have placed on end users which the critics claim have harmed consumers for example by denying access to virtual private networks needed for telecommuting critics claim that these usage prohibitions are far more restrictive than needed to manage bandwidth and often are imposed for stra tegic purposes not for network efficiency reasons they also claim that not re gulating access will harm innovation by giving the broadband network providers the ability to strategically constrain independent applicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs35 83 remarks of michael k powell chairm an federal communications commission at the silicon flatirons symposium on the digital broadband migration toward regulatory regime for the internet age university of colorado school of law february 8 2004former fcc chairman michael powell has suggested that it might not be necessary to impose regulations if the industry were to agree to follow certain internet freedom principles as the ba sis for selfregulation mr powell has constructed guiding principles83 noting that promoting competition among highspeed internet platforms is only half of our task however we must ensure that the various capabilities of these technologies are not used in way that could stunt the growth of the economy innovation and consumer empowerment thus we mu st expand our focus beyond broadband networks the socalled physical layer of the internets layered architecture referring explicitly to the research and analyses performed by professors weiser farrell and wu cited earlier mr powell explained that there are circumstances in which broa dband network providers might choose to restrict usage on their network and that some troubling re strictions have ppeared in broadband service plan agreements but he stated that he did not believe that there was yet case for government imposed regulations re garding the use or provision of broadband content applications and vices instead he challenged the industry to avoid future regulation by embracing what he called th four internet freedoms these are freedom to access content consumers should have access to their choice of legal content freedom to use applications consumers should be able to run applications of their choice freedom to attach personal devices consumers should be permitted to attach any devices they choose to the connection in their homes freedom to obtain service plan information consumers should receive meaningful information regarding their service plans in presenting these principles mr po well indicated that broadband network providers have legitimate need to manage their networks and ensure quality experience thus reasonable limits sometimes must be placed on service contracts such constraints however should be clear ly spelled out and should be as minimal as necessary since one can know for re which killer app lications will emerge to drive deployment of the next genera tion highspeed technologies the industry must let the market work and allow consum ers to run applications and attach devices unless they exceed service plan limitations or harm the providers network the broadband network providers have not explicitly opposed mr powells proposal nor have they explicitly endorsed it in its august 5 2005 order and related ac tions the fcc in effect implemented mr powells proposal it ruled that dbs

consumer s are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their choice subject to the needs of law enforcement consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network and consumers are entitled to competition among network providers application and service providers and content providers84 critics have challenged mr powells proposal and by extension the fccs august 5 2005 order and policy statement on several grounds they point to the many documented instances of usage restrictions placed on end users as proof that left unregulated market fo rces are not robust enough to ensure unrestricted access they argue that the search for the killer application that might drive investment in both infrastructure and applications is more likely to be successful in regulatory regime that fosters network neutrality than in regime that allows the few broadband network providers to determine the directi on of the network they argue that it is impossible to undo harm after it has occurred and that in light of the identifiable reasons why network providers might have both the incentive and the ability to restrict access it is dangerous to move forward based on nonmandatory principles that the network providers ve not in any case endorsed critics also claim that antitrust laws which generically address monopoly behavior and anticompetitive practices are inefficient vehicles for addressing the impediments to competition and i nnovation that are most common in communications markets these critics argue that there is abundant empirical evidence that there are greater opportunities for firms to erect barriers to entry in network markets than in traditional markets and that as result relying primarily on ex post antitrust enforcement leaves consumer s subject to unnecessary risk they also oppose elimination of the public interest standard platform

providers serving the mass market wireless including satellite carriers cable overbuilders or power companies may provide relatively ubi quitous third broa dband connection some time down the road but in the next few years are likely to offer mass market customers competitive option in scattered locations at most nor have the ilecs demonstrated tangible plans to extend th eir broadband networks

upgrade their networks to have the bandwidth capacity to offer video services themselves85 broadband network providers will seek to distinguish themselves by offering premium servic such as video on demand bundles that include wireless service with that servi ce provided over separa wireless network though perhaps using hybrid telephones that can be used on wireless and wireline networks access to advanced electronic ga mes etc key will be to offer broadband connection with sufficient bandwidth to accommodate whatever service becomes the killer application or at least an important application as explained earlier these broadband ne tworks actually consist of two parts the lastmile local network privately ow ned and operated by the broadband network provider and the internetwork that is jo intly operated by multip internet backbone providers success for any broadband network provider will depend on the bandwidth security and service quality it can ensure over its local

cable companies have upgraded their coaxial cable networks and now are offeri ng video data and voice services in many areas of the country especially in urban ar eas their cables into customers premises often have sufficient bandwidth to broad cast to customers premises hundreds of video channels for the customers to c hoose among and their settop boxes allow customers to select video on

of local franchising author ities there is statutory language explicitly requiring that franchising be performed at th local level as opposed to the state level according to sec 601 of the communications ac t the term franchising authority means any governmental entity empowered by the federa l state or local law to grant franchise 47 usc 521 at the same time sec 601 also explicitly identifies local purpose for regulation of cable television to establish franchise procedures and standards which encourage the growth and development of cable systems and which assure that cable

her verizons fiber to the home approach can prove out financially even as they concede that the huge bandwidth provided could give it leg up in the long run unlike current copper networks both th att architecture and the verizon architecture could leave cust omers without telephone servi ce if their electricity goes out though for different reasons fiber to the home technology does not incorporate line powering so verizon might have to provision the optical interface at its customers premises with backup batteri but even then the batteries would probably last at most 8 to 16 hours less time than might be needed in case of natural disruptions such as hurricanes at the same time dsl modem systems of the sort used by att require active electric power at the customer premise which may not be available during emergencies in bot h cases customers might have to rely on wireless telephone service during time of electric power loss the marketplace will determine which of these network strengths and weaknesses are most important to end users these architectural differences in addition to creating competing platforms for triple play service offer platform diversity to independent app

to review the current statutory and regulatory framework for cab found primarily in title vi of the communications act to determine whether it would be in the public interest to streamline the franchising process for example by consolidating it at the state or federal level andor to lessen or eliminate some current regulations for example are there elements of the current federal and state regulatory framework for cable service that impede entry into the video market and if so would the benefits to consumers from modifying or eliminating these elements outweigh the benefits of maintaining them is the potential for competition from the new telephone company based video providers sufficient to lighten or eliminate the remaining economic regulations of all video providers including incumbent cable companies already the only cable rates subject to regulation are basic cable ra tes and cable equipment rates is there need for more stringent economic regulation of the incumbent cable companies than of new subscription video providers which current regulations are intended to assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and in terests of the local community to what extent can competitive provision of subscription videohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs41 97 47 usc 531 and 532 create market forces that would on their own force video providers to be

protection and custom er service requirements better addressed at the local level or centrally at the state or federal level if there already is ubiquitous provider of broadba nd video service the local cable system in municipality does the public benefit from requiring new entran ts also to provide ubiquitous service on one hand the ex isting telephone networks do not conform to municipal boundaries so even complete broadband buildout of telephone company s network might not provide ubiquitous coverage of particul ar political jurisdiction on the other hand less than ubiquitous coverage might leave some households without competitive lternative and also might allow the new entrant to strategically cherrypick the most valuable neighborhoods if the underlying public interest objectives that are served by the current peg and institutional network requirements are fully met by the incumbent cable companies such that there would be little public benefit to imposing the sa requirements on new entrants how could these requirements be maintained on the incumbents without placing them at competitive disadvantage with respect to the longstanding media policy objective of diversity of voices the media ow nership rules address horizontal ownership relationships not ve rtical ones congress enacted sections 611 and 612 of the communications act97 to ensure diverse sources of video programming on cable television if cable companies are vertically inte grated into program production section 612 allows franchising aut horities to require cable system to designate channel

capac ity for public educational or governmental use the public access channels in particular are intended to ensure that diverse voices are heard how should these statutory provisions be applied to

franchising order at 1be very different for an incumbent and ne w entrant and if imposed in exactly the same fashion may act as barrier to entry and increase the first mover advantage already enjoyed by the incumbent98 for example buildout requirement is one of the costs of entry into the market fo r the incumbent cable operator the buildout requirement may have been imposed at time when cable operators received an exclusive franchise and thus it represented cost of entry into protected monopoly market moreover that cost is now sunk and likely has long since been recovered in contrast for new telephonebased entrant buildout requirement would represent an entry cost into competitive market environment and would not be viewed as sunk when it makes the decision to enter or not enter thus the imposition of identical franchise or other regulatory requirements on an incumbent and new entrant might not represent an equal burden in the marketplace the fcc determined on its own that it already had the statutory authority to address some of these issues on march 5 2007 the fcc released an order99 in which it adopted rules and provided guidance that set restrictions on the process and requirements that local franchising authorities lfas can employ when considering franchise applications from potential new cable service providers the fcc based its action on its authority under section 621a1 of the communications act of 1934 as amended which prohibits franchising author ities from unreasonably refusing to award competitive franchises for the provision of cable services100 the commission found that the current operation of the local franchising process in many jurisdictions constitutes an unreasonable barrier to entry that impedes the achievement of the interrelated federal goals of enhanced cable competition and accelerated broadband deployment101 it therefore adopted rules setting strict limits on the amount of time local franchising aut horities lfas have to approve or reject the franchise application of an entity seeking to provide cable service in competition with an existing cable provider it also t restrictions in the form of guidance on requirements that lfas could impose on ch applicants for network buildout franchise fees obligations to provide peg and institutional networks and the provision of noncable services or facilities the fcc also concluded that it has the authority to preempt provisions in cal laws regulations and requirements including levelplayingfield provisions that permitted lfas to impose greater restrictions on market entry than the rules and guidance adopted in its orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs43 102 see for example dissenting statement of co mmissioner jonathan s adelstein which is appended to the fcc

of the fcc order is whether the commission has the statutory authority under section 621 a1 to impose rules and guidance restricting the franchising process of local franchising authorities and to preempt local laws regulations and requirements that are inconsistent with such rules and guidance102 on april 3 2007 coalition of local government organizations and associations filed appeals of the fcc order in half doz different federal courts the appeals were consolidated in the sixth us court of appeals103 two other aspects of the fcc order also raised questions first although there was empirical evidence in the proceeding record that the current local franchising process often is lengthy and that some of the demands of some lfas may delay or discourage competitive entry which may not be in the public interest the commissions findings sometimes require leap of faith that such delays and discouragement constitute an unreasonable refusal to award competitive franchise the standard required by section 621a1 for the commission to act second there is some concern that the new franchising process imposed by the fccs rules and guidance will encourage lfas to deny franchise applications when an impasse occurs and for the denied parties to seek j udicial review in federal or state courts although there was empirical evidence on the record of how long such court actions tend to take some observers believe these delays are likely to be greater than the delays under the current franchising process the commission did not consider potentially more efficient ways to address the current lengthy process such as fast track complaint process at the fcc that both applicants and lfas could turn to when an impasse develops in negotiations the rules and guidance adopted in the or der are applicable only to competitive franchise applicants that is to applican ts for cable franchise in an area currently served by one or more cable operators the commission concurrently adopted further notice of proposed rulemaking to gather comment on whether the rules and guidance also should apply to existing cable operators104 in addition the adopted rules and guidance apply only to those situ ations in which the franchising process including but not limited to the ultimate decision to award franchise is controlled by county or municipalle vel franchising authorities105 they are not applicable to franchising decisions where state is involved either by issuing franchises at state level or by enacting laws governing speci fic aspects of the franchising process106 the video

some parties that have voiced concern bout duopoly market stru cture have pointed to the history of the wireless telephone industry according to those commentators for decade when there were only two cellular telephone providers in any geographic area the incumbent local exchange carrier and cond carrier there was little investment innovation or market success and attempt to position wireless service as direct competitor with wireline telephone service only when the fcc made additional spectrum available for wireless service allocating spectrum in the 1900 mhz band for personal communications service allowing several dditional carriers to offer service in most geographic areas did wireless begin to experien ce rapid technological and market advances that redounded to the benefit of consumers other commentators how ever claim that the rapid changes of the 1990s were due to technolog ical change lowering costs to the point that continuedthat at least 19 additional states could c onsider statewide vide franchising reform in 2007 with 11 already having b ills on the table107 the states with some state level oversight include the three most popul ous states california texas and new york as well as such other highpopula tion states as michigan new jersey and massachusetts in addition to these franchising issues the advent of ip video potentially raises new regulatory issue while it is unlikel that an independent applications provider would be able to put together suite of video programming to compete headon with att verizon or cable operators for the provision of multiple channels of subscription video service it is possible th at an independent pplications provider might be able to offer specialty video programming perhaps independent films or local sports programming using ip technolog while single applications provider of this sort might not be threat to th business plan of the large cable and telephone companies plethora of such independent video providers or in the future the development of direct link between cont ent providers and end users via peerto peer connections might be threat th network providers might then have the incentive to restrict end user access to these services this raises the non discrimination issues disc ussed earlier should verti cally integrated broadband network providers have the ri ght to restrict ip video or other applications that challenge their own video services or should end users ve nondiscriminatory access to all applications that do not threaten the integrity of the network be mandatory fostering additional broadband networks intermodal competition from advanced wireless networks in the debate among proponents of the various approaches to regulation of broadband networks stru ctural requirements ex nondiscrimination rules ex post adjudication of abuses and reliance on antitrust law and nonbinding principles the only point of agreement is that nd users would benefit and the need for regulation might be reduced if customers had more than two broadband networks to choose among108httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs45 108 continued wireless service could become substitute for traditional fixed telephone service not due to change in the market structure 109 the latter might be accomplished by deploying symmetric network with as much uplink bandwidth as downlink bandwidth or by not partitioning the available bandwidth for specific services see crs report rl33496 access to broadband networks by charles b goldfarb in almost all geographic markets toda however the mass market broadband market structure is characterized by duopoly provision of broadband network services cable modem service from the local cable system or dsl service from the local telephone company plus competition among independent app lications service providers and the two verti cally integrated broadband network providers for the provision of broadband pplications services most parties agree that the dynamics in both the network market and the applica tions market would likely change if there were three or more widely available br oadband network options for example as discussed earlier network providers face countervailing incentives on one hand due to indirect network externalities they have the incentive to minimize restrictions on independent applications providers access to their networks on the other hand they sometimes have the incentive to restri ct such access when to do so would yield them firstin advantages or other strategic advantages in the applications market or would aid in their ability to bolster profits through pri ce discrimination third network provider entering the market after the first two have been established is likely to seek customers by differentiating its network access offering perhaps by offering nomadic portable or mobile access services not available from the two wireline providers andor by configuring its network architecture and service offerings in fashion to accommodate independent applications not accommodated by the incumbents architectures and service offerings109 third network therefore may well strengthen the market forces for nondiscriminatory network access and may reduce the need for regulatory intervention given the high sunk upfront costs and initially low scale economies however new entrant is less likely to be able to provide strong pr ice competition even if its underlying cost structure when operating closer to capacity were lower than that of the incumbents also if the new entrant can succeed in gaining enduser customers and thus also independent applications provider custom ers primarily because of its nomadic portable or mobile feature it may have the same market incentives as any other network provider enjoying its middle positi on in twosided market once the new entrant has acquired enduser customers independent applica tions providers may have choice but to interconnect with the new entrants broadband network at terms conditions and rates over which they have little or leverage with possible harmful implications for competition in the applications market thus it is not certain whether entry by third network provider would eliminate the need for regulation still entry by third broadband network provider could threaten the profits of incumbent wireline and cable broadband network providers to the extent they lose customers to the entrant and to the extent third network reduces their negotiating strength visavis independent applications providers and end users the incumbenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs46 110 connected on the go broadband goes wi reless report by the wireless broadband access task force fcc wireless broadband task force report federal communications commission gn do cket 04163 february 2005 111 fcc wireless broadband task force report at pp 1314network providers might benefit however if such entry justified the easing of regulatory requirements the incumbents have argued that regulation of their networks inevitably introduces inefficienci distortions and unnecessary costs if entry of third broadband ne twork created market forces that decreased both the perceived and the actual need for regulati on of the broadband ne tworks and if such regulation did indeed impose those ine fficiencies on network providers then regulatory relief induced by competitive entry could benefit the incumbents while ultimately broadband may be provided over power lines bpl andor satellite there is general agreement that third ubiquitous broadband network option is most likely to be provided using terrest rial wireless technology in recognition of that fact the fcc created wireless broadband access task force that issued report in february 2005110 the report identified two policy reasons for fostering deployment of wirele ss broadband networks111 terrestrial wireless technolog provides both mobility and portability efficiently connects devi ces within short distances and bridges longer distances more efficiently than wireline and cable technologies wireless technolog ies frequently are more cost effective solution for serving areas of the country with less dense population and provide rural nd remote regions new ways to connect to critical health safe ty and educational services terrestrial wireless networks can provide competition to existing broadband services delivered throug h the currently more prevalent wireline and cable technologies wireless broadband can create competitive broadband marketplace and bring the benefits of lower prices better quality and great er innovation to consumers there appears to be consensus that one objective of us telecommunications policy should be to foster the deployment of wireless broadband networks but any actions to foster deployment should not ta ke the form of indus trial policy favoring any specific wireless technolog since there are variet of technologies that can offer broadband capability nor should it pr ovide wireless technol ogy an artificial advantage over other broadband technologies wireless broadband can be pr ovided

services to americans there is very lively deba about how best to manage the spectrum to maximize consumer welfare there has been much criticism that legacy commandandcontrol regula tion of spectrum under which spectrum is assigned to specific uses and access to that spectrum for other uses is prohibited does not take into account advances in technology th at have created the potential for systems to use spectrum more intensively and to be much more tolerant of interference than in the past115 two proposed alternative approach have been the subject of much discussion the granting of exclusive tradeable spectrum usage rights through marketbased mechanisms and creating open access to unlicensed spectrum commons the three approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive some portions of the spectrum could remain subj ect to commandandc ontrol while other portions are allocated by the market and the remainder is held as commons the debate about how best to allocate spectru m however is beyond the scope of this report some observers have suggested that third network provider might have less incentive to provide strong price and service competition to challenge the network access status quo if it shared ownership or strategic alliance with one of the incumbent networks for example if th new network were an advanced wireless network that shared ownership with one of the rbocs verizon wirelessverizon or att wirelessatt or if the wire less network had st rategic relationship with the major cable companies an allian ce has been formed between four of the major

8voicedatavideowireless in competition with the rbocs116 then there might be some reluctance on the part of the new entrant to employ an entry strategy that disrupts the market this might suggest th at in any auction of spectrum for 3g or 4g services some preference be given to bidders that are independent of the rbocs sprintnextel and major cable companies or that some portion of the auctioned spectrum be set aside for independent providers on the other hand there appear to be strong incentives for any broadband wireless network provider ev if it were owned by telephone company or in marketing relationship with cable company to be an aggressive competitor first wireless service is growing faster than wireline service so it would not seem to be in companys long term strategic interest to constrain its wireless activities to protect its wireline business second th broadband wireless ne tworks are likely to extend geographically beyond the geogra phic reach of any telephone company or cable company network and therefore wireless providers will in many instances not be competing against an affiliated network it would be difficult for national wireless carrier to strategically provide two levels of competition aggressive competition outside an affiliated networks region and passive within third there will probably be multiple broadband mobile wireless networks at the national level att wireless verizon wireless sprintnextel and perhaps t mobile and at the regional level alltelwestern wireless so any single network will face intramodal competitive pressure on price and service access intramodal competition from clecs for large business customers much of the criticism of the 1996 act has focused on those provisions that attempted to fac ilitate the transition from monopoly to competitive provision of telecommunications services most notably the provisions requiring the incumbent local exchange carriers to make elements of their networks available to new entrants under certain conditions those provisions were intended to foster intramodal competition with the understanding that new entrants could not instantaneously build out ubiquitous networks like those of the incumbent monopolies ten years after enactment of the 1996 ac t intramodal entrant has been able to construct ubiquitous netw ork it has not proven viable to replicate the local loop last mile connection between netw orks switch and customers premise except in the case of large business customers whose traffic volume is sufficient to justify deploying large pipe to the premise as result the competitive local exchange carriers clecs networks typically consist largely of fiber rings in business areas that connect directly to their major customers locations nor has it proven viable for the clecs to fully rep licate the rbocs transport networks the connections between the nodes in their netw orks through which aggregated traffic is routed even

economies needed to support ubiqu itous transport network rather they continued to rely on the rbocs for transport facilities on many routes cable networks were constr ucted to serve residentia l customers and therefore tend not to be ubiquitously deployed in business districts even the largest cable companies are only in selected geographi c markets in the country and may not be able to meet the needs of large multilocational business customers also it is likely to take many years for wireless carriers to construct networks that can meet the bandwidth and security requirements of large corporations competitive provision of broadband services to large business market customers therefore is most likely to be intramodal but the acquisitions of att by sbc of mci by verizon and of bellsouth by the new att have eliminated significant competitors in the enterprise market and also in the internet backbone market in approving those mergers the department of justice and the fcc set number of c onditions intended to retain competitive options for enterprise and internet customers including the divestiture of some key facilities and ensuring clec s and isps access to certain facilities or services at set rates for at least two years117 nonetheless some enterprise customers and clecs remain concerned about their reduced options for retail services and transport facilities it therefore might not be wise to simply replace the statutory provisions fostering intramodal competition with provisions fostering intermodal competition on the expectation that intermodal competition will always be effective intramodal competition will remain important especially for large business markets but given the inability of facilitiesbase d clecs to attain the economies of scale needed to support ubiquitous transport netw orks there might be reason to maintain some of the current statutory provisions inte nded to foster that competition antitrust savings clause the

unlimited private right of action on the part of otherthandi rectly affected parties to sue under the antitrust laws but as this case indicates the clause may be of little effect in instances such as this in which it is found that trad itional antitrust principlesstandards are not implicated give n the verizon decision there are at least three congressional options that might have the effect of providing the breadth of private action some members of congress apparently thoug ht they had assured first congress could amend the savings clause to clarify that the phrase the antitrust laws means the literal words of the statutory provisions but excludes any judicial interpretation of them s econd congress could amend th enforcement provisions of the 1996 act so that even if there d already been regulatory action certain provisions of the act would remain enforceable by private individuals who are not competitors of local exchange carriers but rather their customers or customers of

congress passed the 1996 act there was very limited competition across the boundaries of local exchange service long distance service and wireless service and thus the act did not focus on intercarrier compensation rates though it did prescrib that intercarrier compensation rates between competing local exchange carriers be based on the additional costs of terminating such calls125 primarily though the 1996 act left in place existing intercarrier compensation rates but that system of intercarrier compensation was implemented on piecemeal basis as specific existing telecommunications services were opened to competitive provision or providers offering entirely new services such as wi reless service were allowed to interconnect with the public switched telephone

conceivable that carrier could serve an isp free of charge and recover all of its costs from originating carri ers the ilecs were somewhat constrained in their ability to compete with the clecs for

distance carrier any access charge for terminating the call the current regime fails to provide innovators certainty about the intercarrier compensation regime to which their services will be subject for example since voip service is on one hand an application of an informati on service and on the other hand functionally equivalent to traditional voice telephone call it arguably fits into two different classifications for the purposes of intercarrier compensation inform ation services are not subject to access charges long distance telephone calls are as discussed in the section on voip below the f cc has begun to make decisions on casebycase basis about th classification of specific voice product offerings that use ip technology to varying degrees the business plans of voip providers will be strongly affected by the ultimate decision about how they are classified for intercarrier compensation purposes the current regime encour ages uneconomic arbitrage that is providers making business decisions based on the artificial rates set for intercarrier compensation rath er than on true underlying costs for example because of the traffic patterns of isps and some anomalies in the rules136 some clecs have pursued the market strategy of targeting isps as cu stomers they have offered isps service at what may have been belowcost rates because they could more than recoup any losses by ch arging abovecost rates to the carriers of the isps subscribers for terminating the large volume of subscriber calls to those isps137 regulators also may seek to exploit uneconomic arbitrage for example state regulators as well as rural lecs may have the incentive to limit the scope of rural local calling areas since calls that are classified as long distance will generate more revenues through toll charges or access charges than they would if classified as local and also will tend to move the burden ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs57 138 more detailed discussion of switching costs in presented below in the section entitled what is the underlying cost structure of the transport and switching functions 139 the long distance carriers assert that the bell operating companies which are now allowed to offer long distance service and typically do so as part of package of local and long distance service do not face the same pr oblem the long distan ce carriers claim that even if the bell companies long distance arms must pay the same usagebased access charges to their local operating companies as the long distance carriers pay the underlying costs to the bells are not usagesensitive th at is any losses that the bells long distance arms might suffer when serving high usage customer by having to pay minuteofuse access charges while offering large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price are matched by the additional profits that th bells local operating companies generate from those minuteofuse access charges since th eir underlying costs are not increasing with usage 140 the intercarrier compensation rules are different for intramta wireless calls that originate and terminate within an mta and intermta wireless calls that originate and terminate in different mtascost recovery from local rural cu stomers to urban long distance customers since long distance rates are averaged and thus urban customers who can be served at low cost face higher averaged rates that contribute to the recovery of higher rural costs the current regime creates an artificial cost structure based on minutes of use which appears to be inconsistent with actual cost causation in networks and which renders it difficult for carriers to meet the preferences of many c onsumers for offerings consisting of large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price for example under the current access charge regime interexchange carriers are charged on perminuteofuse basis for the switching used to originate and terminate their customers calls making the interexchange carriers underlying cost structure usagesensitive even though the preponderance of those switching costs appear not to be usagesensitive138 but by facing these artificially imposed usagebased costs long distance carriers are discouraged from offering large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at fixed price since they would lose money when serving high usage customers who are the customers most likely to select such packages139 the current regime requires carrie rs to expend millions of dollars and scarce information technology resources developing systems to identify measure monitor bill reconcile audit and dispute the classification of traffic as local or toll intrastate or interstate intramta or intermta140 information service or telecommunications service etc in order to determine which intercarrier compensation rules apply it also encourages wasteful litigation as carriers fight among them selves about that classification of traffic these costly nonpr oductive activities w ill continue to grow as providers respond to consumer demand for bundled offerings of services that fit into different classificationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs58 141 see for example jessica zufolo emerging voip policy is driving investment telecom policy report september 29 2004 142 the icc fnprm at paragraph 107 stat according to ntca the national telecommunications cooperative association rural lecs receive on average 10 percent continuedthe current regime undermines th stability of universal service subsidy funds where ilecs rely at least in part on the profits from above cost access charges to defray the cost of providing universal service this funding source is in jeopardy because the number of minutes subject to access charges is declining as carriers with more favorable intercarrier compensation treatment for example wireless and voip carriers are gaining market share and traditional long distance carriers have an incentive to manipulate the complex packages of services that they offer to minimize their exposure to access charges at the same time in some quarters there is resistance to comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform because of concerns that some carriers and some consumers may be harmed by the changes in this view if the access charges currently imposed by local exchange carriers on interexchange carriers to originate and terminate long distance calls were reformed to more accurat ely reflect the low proportion of switching costs that appear to be usagesensitive and the high proportion that appear to be fixed perminute access charges imposed on the long distance carrier s would fall but the fixed costs of switching would likely be recove red by raising the subscriber line charge imposed on end users for connecting to the network consumer groups have consistently opposed line charges of any sort arguing that such charges unfairly burden low usage and lowincome customers141 the access charges that long distance carriers must pay to small rural local exchange carriers for originating or terminating the long distance calls of the rural carriers customers tend to be higher than the access charges paid to urban carriers this is in part because the small rural carriers underlying cost s are higher than those of urban carriers due to the lack of popula tion density and lack of scale economies and in part due to efforts by regulators to keep rural end users local rates low also the rural carriers local calling areas tend to be narrowly defined and to serve only small number of households many of their cust omers incoming and outgoing calls therefore are classified as toll long distance calls for which the rural lecs receive abovecost minuteofuse access charges from long distance carriers rather than the fixed enduser charge typical of local service as result the small rural lecs historically have generated much larger portion of their total revenues from access charges than have urban lecs142 since the access charges of ruralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs59 142 continued of their revenue from interstate access charge s and 16 percent from intrastate access charges in comparison it asserts that the bocs b ell operating companies receive only four percent of their revenue from interstate access charges and six percent from intrastate access charges 143 the 1996 act states at 254e any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this sectionlecs exceed costs by more than those of urban lecs and since rural lecs have depended on access charges more than urban lecs reforming access charges to bring them down to cost would place greater revenue burden on rural cs than on urban lecs absent another revenue source enduser line charges would have to be raised more in rural areas than in urban areas to keep line charges from growing to the point where local service becomes unaffordable or noncomparable with urban rate s new universal service funding mechanism would be needed to replace the implicit universal service funding currently in the rural carri ers access charges although all the proposals for intercarrier co mpensation reform have included new universal service funding m echanisms the rural lecs prefer not to have to rely so heavily on an explicit universal service funding mechanism they generally prefer to have three revenue sources line charges universal service funds and abovecost access charges rather than just the first two in part this is because they prefer to recover larger portion of their costs from long distance carriers whose averaged rates subsidize rural customers than from their own enduser customers in subscriber line charges and in part it is because they are concerned about relying too heavily on universal service funds which they consid er potentially unstable source of revenue especially now that rural wireless carriers are seeking these same universal service funds although section 254e of the 1996 act requires universal service support to be explicit and sufficient143 many state regulators continue to set intrastate access charges and especially the intrastate access charges of rural carriers at abovecost rates that exceed interstate access charges in order to create revenue source ultimately borne primarily by customers of long distance carriers that do not live in rural areas that will help keep local rates low some parties question whether the fcc has the authority to modify intrastate access charges as part of comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform without the fo rmal involvement of the states the rural telephone companies have an additional problem relating to intercarrier compensation they claim that they are unable to receive compensation for the termination of very substantial portion of the traffic they receive from outside their service areas because they are unable to identify the originating carrier this problem referred to as phantom

lephone company which then passes the traffic on to the terminating rural carrier the transiting carriers sometimes however will not pay the rural carrier for terminating the call but rather will insist that the terminating carrier seek payment directly from the originating carrier unfortunately at times the information identifying the originating carrier has been stripped away before the call reaches the terminating carrier144 this allegedly happens most frequently when the originating carrier is long distance or wireless carrier which must pay abovecost access charges for the termination of the call but would prefer to transit the call through an intermediate local exchange carrier since the latter would only have to pay costbased recipro cal compensation rates for the termination of the call145 it is likely that intercarrier compensation reform that equalizes the termination rates for long distance and local calls would reduce this phantom traffic problem but it still is essential that the identification problem be corrected as it places an unfair burden on rural carriers recently another intercarrier compen sationrelated issue known as traffic pumping has arisen146

interests with conflicting views and the impact of intercarrier compensation on such f undamental public policy objectives as competition and universal service congress might choose to use its deliberations on reform of the communications act as an opportunity to provide the fcc statutory guidance on how to proceed with its intercarrier compensation reform efforts universal service in broadband environment the universal availability of basic telecommunications service at affordable rates has been fundamental element of telecommunications policy in the united states since the enactment of the communi cations act in 1934 to achieve this universal service subsidy system has been em ployed to keep end user rates affordable for lowincome households and for househol ds and small businesses in highcost areas and since 1996 to provide discount s to schools and libraries for telephone service internet access and internal ne twork wiring and to public and nonprofit rural health care providers for telecommunica tions services and installations and for long distance internet connections147 this policy goal can be fully compatible with the development of competitive market for telecommunications services including the last mile into customers premises so long as the universal servi ce funding mechanism is constructed in competitively neutral and effi cient fashion that cannot be accomplished if any of the universal service subsidy is hidden in bovecost rates for certain services that are intended to subsidize the below cost rates for other services in that situation competitor could successfully enter the ma rket by undercutting the abovecost prices for those services whose rates are raised to include implicit subsidies but could not compete in the provision of those servi ces whose rates are set below cost the policy goal also cannot be achieved if the universal service subsidy is not available on the same basis to all competitors in the market this is especially important today with competing wireline cable mobile wireless and fixed wireless technologies all potentially able to offer service to rural customers in addition if the universal service funding mechanism is not efficient and therefore requires more resources than is necessary to provide universal availability it will place an unnecessary burden on telecommunications markets or on the general public if supported by genera l tax revenues the 1996 act took major step in the dir ection of reconciling universal service with competitive markets by requiring that any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes148 this requirement has not yet been achieved however although competitive market for ces have driven so abovecost rates down toward

subsidies149 many rates continue to be set above cost in order to include hidden universal servi ce subsidies for example the intrastate access charges of many rural telephone carrier s discussed earlier in the section on intercarrier compensation which services should be supported by universal service subsidy and who should receive the subsidy the 1996 act instructs the fcc and fe deralstate joint board on universal service to base policies for the preservati on and advancement of universal service on seven principles one of those principles is access to advanced telecommunications and informa tion services should be provi ded in all regions of the nation150 the act is not specific about how this should be accomplished and does not explicitly include advanced services among those that should be subsidized to achieve universal service to date the joint board and the fcc have not included advanced services in the definition of universal service but there has been considerable national discussion of the role of broadband networks in stimulating economic development and some members of congress believe the time is ripe to debate the inclusion of access to br oadband network in universal service while market demand appears to be sufficient to generate competitive broadband network deployme nt in many urban areas without government intervention that may not be the case in rural or other highcost or lowincome areas where high costs andor limited mand may render it econo mically infeasible to deploy multiple broa dband networks or even single network without government intervention if congress wants to expand the scope of universal service to include universal access to broadband network at affordable ra tes it must address number of issues most basically how broad is the broa dband that should be provided as part of universal service bigger may be better but only at an associated cost as explained earlier one of the primary drivers of broadband deployment has been network providers desire to bring sufficient bandwid th to customer premises to support the triple play of voice data and subscr iption video services of these three applications video is the one that require s the most bandwidth but it also is the one that has the least nexus to public safety or economic developmen t thus it may be difficult to establish public interest justification for subsidizing the additional bandwidth needed for video on the other hand one of the principles in the universal service section of the 1996 act states that consumers in all regions of the nation should have access to telecommunications and information services including interexchange services and advanced information services that are reasonablyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs63 151 47 usc 254b3

report at p 2 and 2006 annual report at p 5 total high cost funding increased from approximately 16 billion in 1998 to 41 billion in 2006 153 the bulk of the increase in the fund is attributable to two proceedings at the fcc that continuedcomparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas151 is it sufficient for example to limit subs idy program in highcost areas to support for broadband service capable of relatively low quality video streaming if the unsubsidized market is driving companies to deploy broadband capable of offering higher quality broadcastquality video rvice in urban areas even though subscription video is needed neither for public safety nor for economic development also the sparse population and longer dist ances in rural areas translate into low density of demand limite d economies of scale and hen ce higher costs such that there is uncertainty whether even single broadband network can be sustained is it possible then to construct universal rvice subsidy program that is open to all competing technologies and thus competitiv ely neutral without creating incentives for the deployment of multiple networks none of which can exploit economies of scale to constrain costs historically universal service has b een limited to basic telephone service but the subsidy has been given to the provider rather than to the end user the latter might be accomplished in the form of vouche r that could be used to reduce cost based rate to an affordable rate since wireline wireless and cable companies all may offer local telephone service in pa rticular highcost area all three can potentially qualify as eligible telecommunications carriers etcs in that locality and receive universal servi ce funds the competing carriers only receive funds for those customers they capture but since customer can elect to obtain service from more than one carrier at th same time more than one carrier can receive universal service funding for serving that customer typically customers do not receive basic voice service from both the local telephone co mpany and the local cable operator so it is unlikely that those two carriers woul d each receive universal service funds for serving the same customer but many customers do receive both fixed telephone service from telephone company or cable operator and mobile telephone service from wireless carrier and in that case both the fixed and the mobile telephone service provider would receive the univers service subsidy thus competitive entry in that situation will increase the tota l size of the universal service fund data from the 2005 and 2006 annual reports of th universal service administrative corporation usac which administers the federal universal service fund corroborates this152 highcost funds in 2006 were distributed as follows 3116 million to incumbent etcs that is the incumbent local exchange carriers and 979 million to competitive etcs the vast majority of which were wireless carriers153httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs64 153 continued removed implicit universal service funds fro m two categories of rural local exchange carriers very small carriers subject to rateofreturn regulation and somewhat larger carriers subject to price cap regulation and replaced those implicit subsidies with new or expanded explicit universal service funding mechanisms 154 this approach requiring the end user to id entify single principal carrier eligible to receive fusf could be followed even if th definition of universal service were not expanded to include broadband services or broadband access the potential growth in the size of the federal universal service fund from customers being able to subscribe for services from multiple carriers with more than one of those carriers becoming eligible for fusf payments might be exacerbated if the scope of universal service were expande d to include advanced services or the connection access to br oadband network one possible way to limit the increase in subsidy requirements would be to expand the definition of universal service to include the connection to broadband network but at th same time to require each customer in highcost area eligible for universal service support to choose single broadband provider as its principal provi der and only that chosen provider would be eligible for the subsidy154 this approach would have the advantage of constraining the size of the universal rvice fund but it also likely would reduce the total flow of subsidy dollars to rural areas and might distort the market by encouraging consumers to c hoose broadband service even if they do not seek it having invested in broadband netw ork each network provider will seek to maximize its return from that investment most likely by enticing its customers to choose bundled packages of value added services for which it can charge prices that reflect that value network providers are likely to avoid the alternative pricing strategy of setting separate charges fo r the network connection access and for individual services for several reasons 1 most consumers prefer single bill 2 there is risk that network access c ould become lowmarkup commodity if competing networks eventually are deploy ed and the revenues generated by value added applications then might flow to independent services providers and 3 it might not be easy to set up discriminat ory pricing scheme for access that would allow them to maximize their profits this raises an interesting issue today universal service is defined in terms of providing basic local telephone service and typically only providers that offer as one option basic voice service connection plus limited local service are eligible fo r fusf funds if the universal service definition were changed to cover access to broadband would it be appropriate to make universal service funds available only to those carrier s that offer their customers as one option basic servi ce package consisting only of the broadband connection or of the connection plus basi c local voice service if that were requirement for receiving fusf support however network providers would not be able to tie broadband access to the purchase of valueadded services and thus might not be able to compel customers to select those service packages that maximize the providers profits currently the federal universal service f und subsidy is made directly to those carriers that qualify as etcs the specific payments made to individual carriers are subject to number of very arcane accoun ting rules some of which limit funding tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs65 155 there currently are

2006wireline providers because only those provi ders are eligible for certain pools of money155 the various mechanisms use different costing methodologies but where the subsidy is available to the incu mbent wireline telephone company and new entrants the payments to all are based on the costs of the wireline company the latter have complained that some of the new entrants in particular the wireless carriers have lower costs and therefore should receive lower subsidies otherwise they claim the wireless carriers will enjoy windfall the lower cost carriers have countered that for competitive neutrality each provider should be given the same level subsidy and then allowed to compete on an equal footing in the market low cost provider might be able to set lower rates since it needs less subsidy to meet the higher cost providers rates and over time the subsidy could be reduced or eliminated if lower cost rural providers could offer affordable service with little or need for subsidy economists argue that to base universal service payments on providers costs so that highcost providers receive higher subsidy payments is to subsidize the inefficient at the expense of whoever is paying the subsidy the incumbent local exchange carriers have made another argument for why they should enjoy superior or even exclus ive access to the universal service subsidy they have made commitment to be the carrier of last resort and serve every customer in their serving area but those states that have awarded etc status to other carriers have tended to require such commitment from those carriers as well though there may remain issues of the geographic reach of each etcs services the federalstate joint board on universal service has recommended that the fcc immediately impose an interim stat ewide cap on the amount of highcost support that competitive eligible telecomm unications carriers can receive from the high cost program as temporary measur to prevent uncontrolled

international telecommunications revenues among wireless carriers and incumbent local exchange carriers but the downward trend in total enduser interstate and international telecommunications re venues is expected to continue as result of number of factors the continued fall in rates for interstate and international calls as voip service grows continued substitution of email and other internet applications for long distance service and the classification of dsl service and certain other services as information services rather than telecommunications services the fcc has taken step to address the impact of one of these trends although the fcc has not yet classified interconnected voip services as either telecommunications services or information services160 it has extended the universal service obligations to providers of interconnected voip service161 although this action will not elimin ate the downward pressure that voip places on interstate and inte rnational rates it does eliminate one cause of that pressure voip service being exempt from the fusf contribution assessment it has become increasingly difficult to identify and audit individual companies interstate and international telecommunications service revenues because these services are being offered to both business and residential customers as part of bundled packages that include other services both customers and service providers have the incentive to understate the proporti on of total reve nues generated by these bundled services that are attributable to interstate and international

complicating business decisions by adding regulatory uncertainty to the mix there are number of alternatives to an assessment on interstate telecommunications revenues to provide the funding needed for uni versal service that might better meet the policy objectives articulated by congress some of these could not be implemented without cong ressional action these include an assessment on all telecomm unications service revenues interstate international and intrastate since telecommunications services increasingly are being offered as bundled packages of interstate and intrastate minutes at fixed price expanding the assessment base in this fashion w ould have the advantages of both increasing the total subsidy base and eliminating the problem of determining the proportion of fixe d monthly charge that should be attributed to interstate service because of court decision prohibiting the fcc from assessing intrastate revenues164 congress would have to modify the comm unications act before the fcc could include intrastate revenues in the assessm ent base but not all services can be readily classified as telecommunications services or information services as demonstrated by the example of interconnected voip services which the fcc has not yet classified as result the commission had to make servicespecific ruling that despite not being classified as telecommunications policy interconnected voip service is subject to the fusf assessment as new and innovative services ar offered that have some characteristics of telecommuni cations services and some characteristics of information services the commission may continue to have to make ad hoc decisions about how they should be treated with respect to the fusf assessment with the potential for inconsistent treatment of services that compete with one another as assessment on all telecommunications service and information service revenues this would increase the assessment base and eliminate the disparate treatment of telecommunications services and information services that compete directly with one another but it would impose an assessment on info rmation services which would be inconsistent with congressional and fcc policy to foster the development of these services by minimizing regulatory burdens onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs69 165 for example medium or large business customer may receive service either by installing its own switch called pbx which requires smaller number of lines into the premise because traffic is aggregated into smaller number of large pipes at the pbx or by using portion of the local telephone companys end office switch known as centrex service which requires larger number of lines because the traffic is not aggregated at the customer premise an appropriate weighting ra tio would have to be set for centrex vs pbx service but such weighting has been performed many times in fcc rules them it also might prove very difficult to determine which information services should be subject to the assessment since information services cover such wide range of applications this option also would require modifi cation of the communications act before the fcc could include all these revenues in the assessment base an assessment on the revenues of all services and equipment that benefit from the subsidies provided by the federal universal service fund such as revenues from the rvices and products that receive discounts under the schools and lib raries fund as well as on services this option would asse ss not only telecommunications and information service providers but also companies that manufacture goods or provide other services that are subsidized by the fund this would increase the assessment base but it would be inconsistent with congressional and fcc policy to foster the development of information services and it likely would be extremely difficult to identify the portion of revenues of non telecommunications service companies that would be subject to the assessment this option too woul d require modification of the act before the fcc could include ll these equipment and service revenues in the assessment base an assessment on all connections to the public switched network weighted by the bandwidth of t hose connections ultimately all telecommunications users must connect to the public switched network to complete communica tions thus per connection assessment based on bandwidth would significantly widen the assessment base and could be structured in way that is competitively neutral165 there would be issues about how to assign different assessment weights to connections of various capacity bandwidth consumer groups have opposed this approach arguing that it harms end users who have very low network usage including lowincome households propone nts have responded that since universal service is intended to subsidize connection to the public switched network per c onnection charge is appropriate they also argue that many lowincome households are actually large telecommunications users many of them make calls to family members in the military or for immigrants living overseas or calls from retirees living in the sun belt to family members living in more northern climes in additi on proponents argue that many low income households are eligible fo r subsidized telephone service ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33034crs70 166 just as in the case for connections the number of telephone numbers required by medium or large business customer will depend on the internal telecommunications architecture chosen by that customer with cer tain configurations requiring more and certain fewer telephone numbers this might require construction of weights for business customer telephone numberspart of the lowincome univers service program and these households would not be subject to the per line assessment there are differences of opinion about whether the communications act would have to be modified before the fcc could use connections as the assessment base an assessment on all tele phone numbers in use just as every end user needs connection to the public switched network every end user needs telephone number iden tifier per telephone number connection would significantly wide n the assessment base and could be structured in way that is competitively neutral166 consumer groups have had the sa criticisms of pe r number assessment as they had for per connection ssessment and pr oponents have made the same responses there is also some possibility that future technological changes will lead to use of customer identifier other than the telephone number ther are differences of opinion about whether the communications act woul d have to be modified before the fcc could use telephone numbe rs as the assessment base using funds from general tax revenues since universal service is subsidy program that is intended to benefit all sectors of the us economy and all segments of the population some have argued that it should be funded from general tax revenues this would eliminate the market distortions inevitable when an assessment is imposed only on subset of competitors or consumers and thus economists have argued this is the most efficient option but this would make universal service funding subject to annual appr opriations which particularly in times of budget ficits might place such funding at risk this option requires annual or multiyear appr opriations action by congress to be implemented continue to fund universal service in part by allowing rural carriers to set abovecost intercarrier compensation rates as way to maintain lower local rates some rural carriers are very concerned about relying entirely on external sources of universal service funding especially at time when competitors such as wireless carriers are seeking certification as etcs to compete for those funds these rural lecs would prefer to be able to ensure an internal funding source by ma intaining abovecost rates for originating or terminating certain traffic where the other carrier involved with the call is captive customer this however would maintain

fcc can choose to forbear from regulating those co mpetitive interstate services that are classified as telecommunications services it may not have the authority to require state jurisdictions to forbear on regulation of intrastate telecommunications services this suggests that it may be timely to review the title ii telecommunications requirements that review might addre ss which requirements may be applicable to all voice services regardless of the tec hnology and network architecture used to provide those services which may only be relevant for dominant firms and which may not be relevant at all w ith the advent of competition access to 911 and e911 competition in the provision of applications services is developing today between integrated network providers that have ubiquitous netw orks and independent applications providers that have more limited networks and capabilities in some situations it would be inefficient if not impossible for new entrant to replicate the facilities of network provider for example for public safety reasons the fcc has determined that all interconnected voip providers must be able to provide their customers access to 911 and e911 service and that for this to happen there is need for cooperation between vo ip providers and ilecs191 the fcc thus has required all interconnected voip providers to deliver all 911 calls to the custom ers local emergency operator as standard not optional feature provide emergency operators with the call back number and location information of their customers ie e911 where the emergency operator is capable of receiving it although the customer must provide the location information th voip provider must provide the customer means of updating this information whether he or she is at home or away from home and inform their customers both new and existing of the e911 capabilities and limitations of their service192 at the same time the fcc has required ilecs to provide access to their e911 networks to any requesting telecommunica tions carrier they must continue to provide access to trunks selective routes and e911 databases to competing

argued that customers should be allowed to c hoose lowcost options that do not include public safety features such as access to 911 and 911 service the fcc had determined that in this case government intervention was justified by the public safety concern at the same time without rules in place to ensure all voice providers access to the e911 network new entrants c ould be denied entry into the market some observers have argued that the voip providers currently are enjoying free ride and an artificial marketplace advantag because their services are not subject to state taxes imposed on telecommunicati ons services to support the e911 call centers sometimes referred to as public safety answerin g points or psaps run by municipalities or states these psaps are the physical locations where emergency calls are received and then routed to the proper emergency services law enforcement calea in 1994 congress enacted the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea193 to preserve the ability of law enforcement officials to conduct electronic surveillance effectivel and efficiently despite the deployment of new digital and wireless technologies that have alte red the character of such surveillance194 calea requires telecommunicati ons carriers to modify their equipment facilities and services wherever achievable to ensure that they are able to comply with authorized electronic rveillance actions in implementing calea the fcc adopted an order on august 5 2005 concluding that calea applies to facilitiesbased pr oviders of any type of broadband internet access service including wireline cable modem satellite wireless and power line and to voip providers that offer services permitting user s to receive calls from and place calls to the public switched public ne twork these providers are sometimes referred to as interconnected voip providers because th providers offer services that are replacement for substantial portion of the local telephone

1995 equipment and facilities and declined to adopt national surcharge to recover calea costs the important law enforcement objectiv of calea potentially can conflict with the goals of competition and innova tion some technol ogies and network architectures may be able to accommodate the calea requirements more readily more quickly less expensively or with less impact on efficiency than others also calea requirements might impos substantial upfront costs on new technologies architectures or services that could be an impediment to their successful entry into the market thus slowing innovation there may be some tension in the future if network technol ogies and architectures migrate away from centralized networks to peertopeer ne tworks which have potential benefits to consumers both in terms of security and of allowing service providers and end users to interact more directly but which may not be very accommodating to law enforcement concerns media policy localism competition and

markets these goals may now have to be considered when developing telecommunications policy as well subscription multichannel video services as discussed earlier section 601 of title vi of the communication act explicitly identifies local purpose for regulation of cable television to establish franchise procedures and sta ndards which assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and interests of the local community key sections in title vi related to localism and diversity of voices allow franchise authorities to 1 require cable systems to set aside channels for public

broadcast licensees have been given 6 mhz of spectrum on which to operate digitally and on february 17 2009 will have to return the spectrum on wh ich they currently operate in analog mode with digital technology one option available to licensees is to use their 6 mhz of spectrum for multicasting that is to broadcast multiple pr ogramming streams in support of the goal of loca lism cable operators have been required to carry the primary signals of the local broadcast stations in their service areas the fcc has ruled that television broadcaster that is multicasting video signals must identify one signal as its primary signal that cable systems must carry but that cable systems have obligation to carry additional multicast signals201 this decision was based in part on the concern that multicast must carry might infringe on the first amendment rights of cable operators and in part on the concern that the multicast signals might tend to be duplicative and might not meet the desires of viewers as well as cable channels some observers have suggested that limiting must carriage to single primary signal might result in missing an opportunity to foster localism for example in considering what public interest obligations might be consistent with allowing broadcasters to air multiple signals the fcc might consider modifying the current rule that requires cable operators to carry only the primary programming stream of each local television broadcaster by requiring cable operators to carry each programming stream that offe rs distinct programming aime d at different previously unserved geographic portion of the broadcasters serving area this could explicitly address those situations in which broadcasters serving area crosses state borders awarding the broadcaster must carry rights for second signal if the programming on that signal specifically addresses the n eeds and interests of the viewing households in the second state202 if the fcc were to consider this

and mandatory carriage of multicast broadcast signals would command channel capacity that could be better used providing innovative new applica tions sought by consumers take into account the impact on cable system s of requiring them to carry additional broadcast channels203 it also would want to deter mine how best to construct rule that did not artificially encourage or discourage broadcasters from choosing multicasting over other potential applications of digital technology to their 6 mhz of spectrum such as high definition tele vision congress might choose to direct the fcc to study and c onstruct recommendations for rule s and if necessary statutory changes to address the potentially related issues of mandatory carriage of multiple broadcast signals and better serving the n eeds and interests of viewers in different governmental jurisdictions
