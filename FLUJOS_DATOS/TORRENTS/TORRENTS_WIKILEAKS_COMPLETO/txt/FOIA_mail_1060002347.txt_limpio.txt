w all this its nice to know that our friends down under are doing their best to fight the misinformation it is true that the skeptics twist the truth clockwise rather than counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere there was indeed lot of activity last week hans von storchs resignation as chief editor of cr which i think took lot of guts couldnt have come at better time it was on the night before before the notorious james inhofe chair of the senate environment and public works committee attempted to provide public stage for willie soon and david legates to peddle their garbage the soon baliunas junk of course but also the usual myths about the satellite record 1940s1970s cooling co2 is good for us and but water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas fortunately these two are clowns neither remotely as sharp as lindzen or as slick as michaels and it wasnt too difficult to deal with them suffice it to say the event did not go the way inhofe and the republicans had hoped the democrats conveniently had received word of hans resignation but the republicans and soonlegates had not so when quite fittingly jim jeffords you may rememberhes the us senator who was in the news couple years ago for tilting the balance of power back to the democrats when he left the republican party in protest hit them with this news at the hearing they were caught completely off guard the wall street journal article you cited was icing on the cake inhofe who rails against the liberal media will have difficult time doing so against the wsj also of interest to you attached might be the oped that ray bradley phil and i have written and submitted to the seattle news tribune in response to an oped by baliunas also attached that some industry group has been sending around to various papers over the last week only two providence journal and seattle nt have thusfar bitten there is rumour that harvard may have had enough w their name being dragged through the mud by the activities of baliunas and soon and that something is up baliunas and soon as alluded to in the wsj article are now longer talking to the media will keep you posted on that mike at 0358 pm 842003 1200 jim salinger wrote dear mike et i also share nevilles thanks to you all for the reasoned and evaluated responses over the last few months they have been good and separated out academic standards from academic freedom which we have to be careful not to abuse i also note the following come through over the weekend from the wall street journal below and would also compliment those of you who with hans von storch resigned your editorships when information that should be published was clearly supressed if you have further information that you feel free to share on last weeks events then we in new zealand would appreciate hearing it as we have been extremely concerned about academic standards in the reviewing of articles from new zealand sources again thanks to all on your stands best regards jim july 31 2003 debating global warming global warming skeptics are facing storm clouds by antonio regalado staff reporter of the wall street journal big flap at little scientific journal is raising questions about study that has been embraced by conservative politicians for its rejection of widely held globalwarming theories the study by two astronomers at the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics says the 20th century wasnt unusually warm compared with earlier periods and contradicts evidence indicating manmade greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise since being published last january in climate research the paper has been widely promoted by washington think tanks and cited by the white house in revisions made to recent environmental protection agency report at the same time it has drawn stinging rebukes from other climate scientists this week three editors of climate research resigned in protest over the journals handling of the review process that approved the study among them is hans von storch the journals recently appointed editor in chief it was flawed and it shouldnt have been published he said dr von storchs resignation was publicly disclosed tuesday by sen james jeffords i vt critic of the administrations environmental policies during hearing of the senate environment and public works committee called by its chairman sen james inhofe r okla the debate over global warming centers on the extent to which gases released from the burning of fossil fuels mainly carbon dioxide are trapping the suns heat in the earths atmosphere creating greenhouse effect the political fight has intensified as the senate votes on major energy bill sens john mccain r ariz and joseph lieberman d conn planned to introduce an amendment this week that would cap carbondioxide emissions at 2000 levels starting in 2010 for select industries the bush administration is opposed to imposing caps and the measure isnt expected to become law the harvard study has become part of skeptics arguments mr inhofe who is leading the opposition to the emissions measures cited the research in speech on the senate floor monday in which he said the claim that global warming is caused by manmade emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science the paper was authored by astronomers willie soon and sallie baliunas and looked at studies of tree rings and other indicators of past climate their basic conclusion the 20th century wasnt the warmest century of the past 1000 years they concluded temperatures may have been higher during the medieval warm period the time during which the norse settled greenland dr soon couldnt be reached and dr baliunas declined comment in his testimony before mr inhofes committee dr soon reiterated the findings of his study which was partly funded by the american petroleum institute dr soons findings contradict widely cited research by another scientist michael mann of the university of virginia dr manns reconstruction of global temperatures shows distinct pattern shaped like hockey stick temperatures stayed level for centuries with sudden upturn during recent decades reference to dr soons paper previously found its way into revisions suggested by the white house to an epa report on environmental quality according to an internal epa memorandum disclosed in june agency scientists were concerned the version containing the white house edits longer accurately represents scientific consensus on climate change dr manns data showing the hockeystick temperature curve was deleted in its place administration officials added reference to dr soons paper which the epa memo called limited analysis that supports the administrations favored message the epa says the memo appears to be an internal email between staffers but isnt an official document spokesman at the white houses council on environmental quality says the addition of the citation to dr soons paper to the draft report was suggested during an interagency review process overseen by the white house dr mann and 13 colleagues published critique of dr soons paper in eos publication of the american geophysical union this month they said the harvard teams methods were flawed and their results inconsistent with the preponderance of scientific evidence then last week dr von storch was contacted by sen jeffordss staff which was looking into the paper in preparation for tuesdays hearing where dr soon and dr mann were scheduled to appear after hearing from sen jeffords dr von storch says he decided to speed an editorial into print criticizing publication of the paper but publisher otto kinne blocked the move saying that while he favored publication of the editorial dr von storchs proposals were still opposed by some of the other editors i asked hans not to rush the editorial mr kinne said in an email that is when dr von storch resigned followed by two other editors john j fialka contributed to this article on 30 jul 2003 at 826 neville nicholls wrote dear mike et despite my reluctance to get involved in preparing public response to the sb03 papers and my feeling that we would be better off ignoring it i have to record my appreciation of the job you have done in preparing the eos 8 july commentary i thought it was an excellent scientific calm evaluation of sb03 fortuitously it arrived the same day i had to prepare brief about sb03 for my political masters it was very helpful to have your commentary to include in this brief many thanks neville nicholls bureau of meteorology research
