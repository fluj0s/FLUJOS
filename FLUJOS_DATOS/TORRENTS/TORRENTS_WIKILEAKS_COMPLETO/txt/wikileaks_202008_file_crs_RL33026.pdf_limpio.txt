october 2004 term alaska v united states 125 s ct 2137 73 uslw 4441 6605 submerged lands alaska statehood act special master correctly determined that the united states owns two disputed areas of submerged lands in southeast alaska waters of the alexander archipel ago do not qualify as inland waters and hence lands underlying those waters ar not submerged lands that could have passed to alaska at statehood alaskas claim that these waters are historic inland waters over which the united states has deni ed the ships of other nations the right of innocent passage is rejected at best alaskas submissions establish that over the years the united states made one official statement consistent with such an assertion and seized one fo reign vessel but these incidents are insufficient to demonstrate the continuous assertion of excl usive authority necessary to support an historic inland waters claim juridical bays constitute inland waters but the archipelago cannot be divided into two dis tinct juridical bays glacier bay on the other hand is textbook example of juri dical bay the united states can rebut the presumption that lands underlying inla nd waters passed to the state at statehood by establishing that it set aside the lands prior to statehood and demonstrated clear intent to retain title the united states created glacier bay national monument prior to statehood and included in the monument the submerged lands under the bay congress expressed an intent to retain title to the entire monument in section 6e of the alaska statehood act that provision conveyed to alaska ll real and personal property used for fish and wildlife pr otection under three specified laws and provided that such transfer shall not incl ude lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife the antiquities act the authority under which the monument was creat ed was not one of the three specified laws but the proviso is best read as expressing an indepe ndent and general rule uncoupled from the initial clause 90 alexander archipelago 63 glacier bay opinion of court by kennedy unanimous in part and joined in separa part by stevens

4532 62005 commerce clause state hauling fee michigans flat 100 annual fee imposed on trucks engaged in intrastate hauling does not discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause the fee applies evenhandedly to all carriers that make domestic journeys and does not tax activity that takes place outside the state there is precedent for holding such neutralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33026crs2 locally focused fee to be inconsistent with the dormant commerce clause nothing in the record indicates that the fee imposes any significant practical burden on interstate trade levying the fee on pertruck rather than permile basis is fairly related to the services provided give n the objectives of defraying costs of administering size and weight insuran ce and safety requirements the 1987 scheiner case invalidating flat fee state im posed on all trucks using its roads is distinguished michigans fee on instate hauling does not tax an interstate trucks entry into the state nor does it tax transactions spanning multiple states the internal consistency test which requires consideration of what would happen if all states imposed similar tax is not offended any such cumulative fees would be imposed only because carrier engages in local business in multiple states not because the carrier engages in inte rstate commerce in multiple states 90 opinion of court by breyer join ed by rehnquist stevens oconnor kennedy souter and ginsburg concurri ng opinions by scalia and by thomas arthur andersen llp v united states 125 s ct 2129 73 uslw 4393 53105 statutory interpretation knowingly corrupt persuasion jury instructions failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing embodied in provision making it crime to knowingly use intimidation or physical force threaten or corruptly persuade another person to withhold or destroy documents for use in an official proceeding the restraint that is traditionally exercised in determining the scope of federal criminal statute is particularly appropriate where the act underlying the conviction persuasion is by itself innocent the most natural reading of the stat ute is that knowingly m odifies corruptly persuades as well as the other listed actions this most natural grammatical reading is to be preferred even though the statutory form ulation is inelegant only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to knowingly corruptly persuade the jury was instructed however that it could convi ct if it found that the petitioner intended to subvert undermine or impede governme nt factfinding and that the petitioner could be found guilty even if it honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful by excluding the requirement of dishonest action and by adding the term impede to the phrase s ubvert or undermine c ontained in the pattern jury instruction the district courts instructi on swept in innocent persuasion and departed from the statutes requirement that puni shable persuasion be knowingly corrupt the instruction also failed to require nexus between the persuasion to shred documents and any particular proceed ing proceeding need not be pending when the persuasion takes place but it is quite another thing to say proceeding need not even be foreseen the jury char ge was an inadequate basis therefore for finding that the petitioner accounting comp any violated the law when it directed employees to destroy files pursuant to its document retention policy relating to its audits of enron corporation 90 opinion for unanimous court by rehnquist ballard v commissioner 125 s ct 1270 73 uslw 4194 3705 tax court report of special trial judges the tax court may not exclude from the record on appeal reports submitted by speci trial judges unde r tax court rule 183httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33026crs3 the rule provides that the tax court judge to whom case is assigned after submission of special trial judges repor t may adopt that report may modify or reject it in whole or in part or may seek further evidence or brie fs the rule further provides that the special trial judges fi ndings of fact shall be presumed to be correct and that due regard must be given to the fact the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of witnesses changes to the rules adopted in 1983 eliminated requirement th at parties be served with copy of the special trial judges report and be allowed to file exceptions for consideration by the tax court judge but did not change the requirement that due regard be paid to the special trial judges findings of fact the tax court implemented these changes by treating the special trial judges report essentially as an inhouse draft to be worked over collaboratively by the tax court judge and the special trial judge at the conclusion of this collaboration the tax court judge issues decision in all cases agreeing with and adopting the opinion of the special trial judge the extent to which the final collaborative opinion departs from the original report of the special trial judge is not disclosed the tax court like all other decisionmaking tribunals is obliged to follow its own rules which do not authorize such procedures the tax courts practice of not disclosing the special trial judges original report and of obscuring the ta x court judges mode of reviewing that report impeded fully informed appellate review of the tax courts decision concealment of the special trial judge s report runs counter to the generally prevailing practice under which reports of hearing officers magistrates and the like are made part of the record on appeal an analogy to the practice of omitting single tax court judges opinion from the record when full court review occurs is misplaced that procedure is authorized by statute and full tax court review is designed for resolution of legal issues not factual issues 72 opinion of court by ginsburg jo ined by stevens oconnor

preemption fifra common law actions the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra does not preempt all state common law suits for damages resulting from pesticide application fifr prohibits states from imposing any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from federal requirements although the term re quirements reaches beyond positive enactments such as statutes and regulations to embrace commonlaw duties the provision sets two limits on the scope of pr eemption the requirement must be for labeling or packaging and must be in add ition to or different from federal labeling and packaging requirements there are many common law claims eg those for defective design defective manufacture negligent testing and breach of express warranty that do not impose labeling or p ackaging requirements the fact that finding of liability on any of these claims might induce manufacturer to change its label does not turn it into labeling requirement requirement is rule of law that must be obeyed an event such as jury verdict that motivates an optional decision is not requirement the petitioners fraud and negligentfailuretowarn claims are premised on common law rules that qualify as requirements for labeling and packaging the case is remanded however for consideration of whether thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33026crs4 claims are in addition to or different from fifras misbranding standards or whether they merely provide remedy for violation of the fede ral standards the state requirements for which th damage remedy is provide d need not be identical to the federal requirements it suffices if th ey are genuinely equivalent the presumption against preemption in areas of traditional state regulation strengthens the interpretation allowing states to provi additional remedies if congress had intended to eliminate long available fo rm of compensation it surely would have expressed that intent more clearly fifra does not impose uniform regulation but rather authorizes relatively decentralized scheme private remedies that enforce federal misbranding re quirements would seem to aid rather than hinder the functioning of fifra 90 design

opinion by thomas joined by scalia bell v cone 125 s ct 847 73 uslw 3432 12405 habeas corpus deference to state courts the sixth circuits conclusion that the tennessee supreme court failed to cure the constitutional deficiency in statutory aggravating circumstance justifying im position of the death penalty failed to comport with the deference required by 28 usc 2254d the sixth circuit based its decision overturning the respondent s death penalty on the states reliance on the unconstitutionally vague especially he inous atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance which is unconstitutional wit hout narrowing construction although the tennessee supreme court did not men tion narrowing construction it is clear that it applied one because the state c ourt had previously construed the heinous atrocious or cruel circumstance narrowly and had followed that precedent numerous times we must presume that it did the same thing here even without the presumption however it is clear that th court applied the narrower construction the facts on which the court relie d to describe the brutal b eating murder of an elderly couple were sufficient to satisfy the to rture prong of the narrowed construction which requires evidence that the defendant inflicted torture on the victim before his death the narrowing construction itself was not unconstitutionally vague 90 per curiam concurring opinion by ginsburg joined by souter and breyer bell v thompson 125 s ct 2825 73 uslw 4624 62705 appeals habeas corpus the sixth circuit court of appeals abused its discretion in state prisoners habeas corpus cas by staying its mandate and issuing an amended opinion six months after the s upreme court denied certiorari and five months after it denied rehearing t he consequence of delay for the states criminal justice system was compounded by th appeals courts failure to give notice to the parties that it was rec onsidering its earlier opinion this holding assumes arguendo that federal rule of appellate procedure 41 authorizes stay of mandate following denial of certiorari the sixth circuit acted on the basis of psychologists report negligently omitted from the original appeal in the federal habeas case finding that the petitioner had been suffering from severe mentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33026crs5 illness at the time of his capital offense even if that psychologists report had been included in the initial record reviewed by the appeals court however the respondent would have faced an uphill battle in obt aining federal hab eas relief based on constitutionally inadequate re presentation by counsel th psychologists report had been prepared 13 years after the crime and was contradicted by evaluations of two courtappointed experts this evidence would not come close to satisfying the miscarriage of justice standard that w ould have applied d the appeals court recalled its mandate and it did not justify the courts decision to withhold the mandate without notice to the parties fed eralism concerns rela ting to finality and comity are also implicated the state expended considerable time and resources in scheduling and preparing for the responde nts execution and the sixth circuit did not accord the appropriate level of respect to the states judgment that the respondents crimes merited the u ltimate punishment 54 opinion of court by kennedy join ed by

of charges there is requirement that the judge himself must inform the defendant of the elements of each charge before accepting guilty plea rath er the constitutional prerequisites for valid guilty plea that it be done volunt arily knowingly and intelligently can be met if the record shows that the nature of the charge and the elements of the offense were explained to the defendant by his own competent counsel in this case the defendants guilty plea to aggravated murder is not inconsistent with his claim that it was his accomplice and not he who s hot the victim since ohio law provides that aiders and abettors may be convicted of the offense the defendant could have had the requisite intent to k ill without having fired the gun that killed the victim nor is the guilty plea inconsistent with the fendants desire to introduce evidence as to his role in the murder since the judge had explained that the defense would have the opportunity to introduce mitigating evidence at th sentencing phase of his trial the fact that the plea may in retrospect have been poor bargain for the defendant is not basis for invalidation the prosecution s inconsistent identification of the triggerman in its case against the defendant and its case against his accomplice is not basis for invalidating the defendants guilty plea but may have bearing on the validity of the death sentence the case is remanded for consideration of this sentencing issue 90 opinion for unanimous court by oconnor concu rring opinions by souter joined by ginsburg and by thomas joined by scalia brosseau v haugen

the california supreme courts decision that there was reasonable likelihood that capital sentencing jury believed that it was required to ignore mitigating evidence was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly establis hed federal law the standard set by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act for limiting federal habeas corpus relief for state prisoners the ninth circuit therefore should not have granted habeas relief in this case during the sent encing phase of his tr ial the defendant had introduced evidence of his postcrime relig ious conversion and work with prison ministry the jury instruction at issue factor k directed the jury to consider any other circumstance which extenuates the gr avity of the crime the prosecutor erroneously told jurors that factor k limited them to consider ation of conduct that predated the crime and did not allow consideration of the defendants evidence of postcrime conversion the tr ial judge despite the defe nse counsels request did not correct this erroneous assertion the ju ry recommended death and the trial judge imposed that sentence the california supreme court upholding the sentence relied on its reading of the us supreme courts decision in boyde v california 1990 which held that factor k does not limit the jurys consideration to circumstances of the crime but rather allows consideration of defenda nts background and character in light of boyde the california court did not act unreasonably in declining to distinguish between precrime and postcrime mitigating evidence considering the whole context of the trial as required by boyde it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude that the jurors did not lik ely believe they were required to disregard the defendants mitigating evidence the defendant presented two days of testimony about his postcrime convers ion the prosecutor devoted substantial attention to discounting its importance and the court did not instruct the jurors to disregard the evidence 53 opinion of court by kennedy join ed by oconnor scalia thomas and breyer concurring opinions by scalia joined by thomas and by breyer dissenting opinion by souter

contract support costs incurred by two indian tribes pursuant to contract by which the tribes agreed to supply health services and other services normally provided by the government in exchange for the governme nts reimbursement of the tribescostshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33026crs7 and administrative expenses the contracts were authorized by the indian selfdetermination and education assistance act act which specifies that contract support costs are component of reimbursable administrative expenses the government did not deny its promise to pay these costs or its failure to do so rather the government argued that its debts were not legally binding because congress had failed to appropr iate sufficient funds for paying the obligation in each year at issue however congress had enacted lumpsum appropriation to carry out the act and the amount of the appropr iation was far more than the amounts at issue the appropriations being lump sum contained relevant statutory restriction on payment of the debts proviso stating that funding is subject to the availability of appropriations does not vest the secretary with authority to disregard contractual obligations in fa vor of other spending th act does not create special contract that immunizes the government from liability provision that special services contract shall not be construed to be procur ement contract seems designed to avoid technical burdens that often accompany procurement not to weaken contracts binding nature nor is the government saved by proviso that the secretary need not reduce funds available to one tribe in order to provide for another tribe the appropriations contained othe r unrestricted funds sufficient to pay the claims at issue and the government may not avoid debt by obligating unrestricted funds for another purpose laterenacted statute restricting use of funds for contract support costs is open to the in terpretation that it ba rs payment on claims arising under the reimbursement contracts but that interp retation is rejected because of its questionable constitutionality 80 opinion of court by breyer joined by all justices except rehnquist who did not participate

imposed by the communications act of 1934 act as am ended by the telecommunications act of 1996 tca section 332c7 of the act which creates cause of action against state and local governments that fail to comply is the exclusive remedy although section 1983 authorizes suits to enforce indi vidual rights created by federal statutes not all statutory rights are enforceable under section 1983 the issue is one of congressional intent provision of an express private right of action in statute is ordinarily an indication that congress did not intend to leave open more expansive remedy under 1983 there is indi cation that congress intended the tca remedy to complement rather than s upplant 1983 section 332c7 limits relief in ways that 1983 does not judicial review under 332c7 must be sought within 30 days of final zoning action it is unclear whether relief may include damages and there is provision for rec overy of attorneys fees the tcas saving clause providing th at tca amendments shall not be construed to impair existing federal law does not reflect c ongressional intent to allow 1983 actions section 332c7 does not impair the ope ration of 1983 but rather has effect on 1983 whatsoever the rights created by 332c7 did not exist before the passage of the tca and the claims forceable under 1983 prior to enactment of the tca continue to be available after its

the employer here the respondent took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work all in way injurious to his empl oyer the case is governed instead by pickering v board of

for period reasonably n ecessary to effectuate removal but does not permit detention once re moval is longer reasonably foreseeable the zadvydas court prescribed sixmonth pres umptive detention period for aliens already admitted and that period applies to inadmissible aliens as well by its terms the language of 1231a6 applies to an alien orde red removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 the pr ovisions operative language applies without differentiation to all three categorie s of aliens that are its subject and to give the words different meaning for each category would be to invent statute rather than interpret one although there may be different concerns present in the case of inadmissible aliens there is basis for interpreting the same language differently it is not at all unusual to give statutes ambiguous language limiting construction called for by one of its applications in such instances the lowest common denominator as it were must g overn reliance on the constitutional doubt canon as the court did in zadvydas is not designed to allow litigants to invoke the constitutional rights of others or to allow courts to apply statutes until they approach

paragraph specifies that party may seek contribution during or following any cercla action under section 106 or 107a it does not authorize contribution outside the context of such actions the word may is not used permissively to nullify the reference to section 106 and 107 actions rather the natural meaning of may in the context of the enabling clause is that it authorizes certain contribution actions and others contrary reading would render the restriction superfl uous saving clause providing that nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33026crs11 for contribution in the absence of ci vil action under section 106 or 107 does not change the interpretation the saving clau does not itself create cause of action its sole function is to clarify that the subsection does nothing to diminish any right of contribution that may ex ist independently of 113f1 the whole of section 113 reinforces interpretation of paragraph f1 the section provides one other avenue for contribution following certain approved settlements and then provides two separate limitations periods for seeking contribution one following judgments and one following settlements absence of limitation period applicable when neither judgment nor settlement has occurred as is the case with voluntary cleanup suggests that paragraph f1 doe s not authorize contribution following voluntary cleanup arguments based on the general purposes of cercla are rejected given the clear meaning of the text there is need to consult the purpose of cercla

religious exercise of an institutionalized person unless the burden furthers compelling governmental interest does not violate the establishmen t clause the court has recognized that there is room for play in the joints between the establishment clause and the free exercise clause and section 3 of rluipa fits within the corridor between the two clauses the provision is compatible with the establishment clause because it alleviates exceptional governmentcreated burdens on private religious exercise moreover rluipa does not run afoul of earlier decisions that require government to take account of burdens imposed on nonbeneficiaries and that require neutrality among different religions this does not m ean however that government must offer the same accommodations to secular entities that it extends to religious practitioners in order to facilitate their religious observances also rluipa does not elevate accommodation of religious observances over an institutions need to maintain order and safety prison security is compelling state interest and deference is due to institutional officials expertise in this area rejection of this facial challenge does not preclude later

justified in this case is rejected the claim that the jury was unawa re of the shackles is not supported by the record also lacking is evidence that the trial judge exercised discretion by finding exceptional circumstances warranting the use of shackles finally because shackling is inherently prejudicial the defendant need not dem onstrate that actual prejudice resulted 72 opinion of court by

probable cause depends upon the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest as the court held in whren v united states 1996 an officers reasons for making an arrest are irrelevant the issue is whether the circumstances viewed objectively justify that action the ninth circuits closely rela ted rule makes the lawfulness of arrest turn on the officers motivation and in addition is condemned by its perverse consequences there is constitutional requirement that officers inform person of the reason for his arrest at the time he is

newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review the text of this provision is clear and settles this dispute it unequivocally identifies one and only one date from which the 1year limitation period is measured that date is the the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized the petiti oners reliance on the second clause is misplaced the second cl ause imposes condition on the applicability of the first the date established in the first cl ause does not apply at all if the conditions in the second clause have not been met there is the potential for harsh results since the court rarely decides that new rule is retroactively applicable within one year of initially recognizing that right but it is for congress and not the court to rewrite the statute the dis position required in this case though strict is not absurd the petitioners claim is barred because he filed it more than year after the supreme court decided the richardson case on which he sought to rely it does not matter that he filed his claim less than year after an appellate court had held richardson applicable to cases on collateral review 54

that proof of actual economic loss is unnecessary lacks support in precedent the common law of deceit and misrepresentation on which the law of securities fraud is based requires pr oof of loss and other courts of appeals have required it in securities fraud cases in this case the complaint alleged that the petitioner drug company misrepresented the likelihood of fda approval of particular device and that the purchase price for shares was artificially inflated but did not allege that the price fell signif icantly after the truth became known the complaint was legally insufficient becau

reading is that only 3730a actions brought by the attorn ey general to remedy violations of 3729 the false claims acts basic prohi bition on filing false claims and 3730b qui tam actions brought by

committed ie the date on which the false claim was submitted retaliation plaintiff does not need to prove that false claim was submitted but only that his employer retaliated against him for alleging that it was two considerations argue in favor of resolving the ambiguity by reading the sixyear limitations period as applicable only to 3730a and b actions and not to 3730h retaliation actions first

clause if they mandate differential treatment of instate and outofstate economic interests in manner that benefits the former and bur dens the latter the restrictions on direct sale by outofstate wineries constitute such prohibited discrimination section 2 of the twentyfirst amendment which prohibits the transportation or importation into any state for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors in violation of the laws thereof does not allow states to regulate the direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of instate producers the twentyfirst amendment repealed the eighteenth amendment which had imposed nationwide prohibition and restored to the states the powers they had prior to prohibition those powers were shaped by the wilson act which authorized states to regulate imported liquor on the same terms that they regulate domestic liquor and the webbkenyon act which closed loophole that had left states powerless to regulate direct imports for personal use although some of the early cases interpreting the twentyfirst amendment did not take account of this history modern cas have recognized that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the nondiscrimina tion principle of the commerce clause discrimination can be upheld if the state advances legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reas onable nondiscriminatory alternatives but neither michigan nor new york has done so the states assertion that direct shipping of wine is likely to incr ease alcohol consumption by minors is unsupported and in any event does not justify distinction between direct shipments from instate producers and direct shipments from outofstate producers tax collection justification is also insufficient michigan does not rely on wholesalers to

permissible raceneutral reasons for its peremptory challenges it is the third stage of the process after the defendant has presented prima facie case and the state has offered its justification when

category of transactions formerly covered by clau i closedend loans secured by real property congress did not alter the language of the liability limitation in clause ii the conventional meaning of subparagraph suggests applicability to i as well as ii and the statutory history resolves any ambiguities created by the odd placement of the limitation within the second of three clauses if congress

to negate the like lihood of any confusion in raising the affirmative defense that term is used scriptively not as mark fairly and in good faith the fact that congress made c onsumer confusion an

of the ordinary utility of descriptive words and for that reason descriptive terms can qualify for trademark protection only af ter taking on secondary meaning as distinctive of

aggravat ed felony is defined to include crime of violence as defined in 18 usc 16 that provi sion in turn defines crime of violence to mean an offense that has as an elem ent the use of force against the person or property of another or b any other felony that by its nature involves substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense primary focus on the word use is too narro w instead the word should be construed in light of the terms surrounding it becau the ordinary or natural meaning of using physical force against someone suggests higher degree of intent than negligent or accidental conduct the dui ffense is not crime of violence under and while b sweeps more broadly it does not thereby encompass all negligent misconduct that provision simply covers ffenses such as burglary that by their nature involve the risk that the use of physical force may become necessary in completing the crime this interpretation is reinforced by another provision of the ina that renders inadmissible certain aliens who have previously committed any crime of violence or any dui offense if possible each part of statute must be given meaning and the separate prov

the offense the dut was particularly pressing in this case due to the similarity of the violent prior offense to the crime charged and in view of the defense strategy of stressing resi dual doubt the requirement that defense counsel obtain information that the prosecu tion has and will use against the defendant is basic principle embodied in the aba standards for criminal justice the pennsylvania

juveniles the eighth amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment prevents imposition of the death penalty on persons who were under age 18 at the time they committed thei r offense missouris law setting the minimum age at 16 for persons eligible for the death penalty is therefore unconstitutional as applied to persons w ho were under 18 at the time they committed their offense national consensus agai nst execution of juve niles has developed since the court held in 1989 in stanford v kentucky that execution of juveniles over age 15 was not cruel and unusual punishment stanford is longer controlling the situation is now similar to that found by the court in atkins v virginia 2002 to merit the conclusion that there was consensus against execution of the mentally retarded thirty states prohibit execution of juveniles 12 that prohibit the death penalty altogether and 18 that exclude juveniles from its reach only three states have executed juveniles in the last 10 years since stanford five states have eliminated authority for executing juveniles and states that formerly prohibited it have reinstated the authority these objective indicia of consensus provide sufficient evidence that today our society views juveniles as categorically less culpable than the average criminal the courts own judgment is also brought to bear the eighth amendment limits imposition of the death penalty to those offenders who commit narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution three general differences between juveniles and adults render juveniles less culpable because juveniles lack maturity and have an underdevel oped sense of responsib ility they often engage in impetuous nd illconsidered actions and decisions juveniles are also more susceptible than adults to nega tive influences and peer pressure finally the character of juveniles is not as well formed and their personality traits are more transitory less fixed for these reasons irresponsible conduct by juveniles is not as morally reprehensible they have greater claim than adults to be forgiven and greater possibility exists that minors character deficiencies will be reformed because of the diminished culpability of juveniles the penological objectives of retribution and deterrence do not provide adequate justif ication for imposition of the death penalty categorical rule is necessary rather than individualized assessment of each offenders maturity the differe nces between juvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well understood to risk llowing youthful person to receive the death penalty despite insufficient culpab ility although not controlling the overwhelming weight of inte rnational opinion against th juvenile death penalty lends confirmation to the courts conclusion 54 opinion of court by kennedy joined by stevens souter ginsburg and breyer concurring opini on by

as state courts to give full faith and credit to the decisions of state courts encompasses the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel england v louisiana board of medical examiners 1964 authorizin g federal courts to reserve decision of federal constitutional issues while state courts resolve antecedent issues of state law does not mean that federal courts can reserve judgment on the very issues to be litigated in st ate courts federal court abstention under england operates when the antecedent state issue is distinct from the reserved federal issue and resolution of the state issue may moot the federal issue but has application when the state and federal issues are identical here the issues are identical there is exception from ordina ry preclusion rules when takings claim is forced into state court by pplication of the ripeness rule of williamson c ounty 1985 the request for an exception is pre mised on the belief that plaintiffs have right to vindicate their federal claims in federal forum but the court has repeatedly held that there is such right if federal issues have been litigated in state court there is general right to have them relitigated in federal court also rejected is the assumption that courts may simply create exceptions to the full faith and credit statute whenever courts deem them appropr iate exceptions can be justified only if plainly stated

the prohibition on possession of firearm by anyone who has been convicted in any court of crime punishable by prison term exceeding one year does not apply to persons who have been convicted in foreign court the word any considered alone cannot answer the question of whether the prohibition covers foreign convictions any means different things in different contex ts although the presumption against extraterritorial application of statutes doe s not apply directly in this case congress nonetheless generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind this assumption about the domestic reach of domestically orient ed statutes can be overcome by contrary statutory language context history or purpose but here there is such convincing contrary indi cation if the provisi on were interpreted to apply to foreign convictions other provisions would create anomalies for example an exception that allows gun possession despite pr ior conviction under federal or state antitrust laws would mean that persons with foreign antitrust convictions would be banne d from possessing guns while persons with domestichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33026crs39 convictions would not other provisions extend the prohibition to persons convicted of certain misdemeanor offens also described by refere nce to federal and state law the anomaly here is that the prohibition would apply to persons with such domestic convictions but not to persons with s imilar foreign c onvictions the statutes lengthy legislative history confirms the f act that congress did not consider whether foreign convictions should serv as predicates references to federal and state crimes were removed during bill c onsideration but without any mention of foreign convictions while the statutes purpose of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people would be served by includi ng persons convicted in foreign courts the force of this argument is weakened significantly by the fact that there have probably been more than 10 to dozen prosecutions that relied on foreign conviction as predicate given the statutes total sile nce and reason to believe that congress considered the added enforcement advantages flowing from inclusion of

application to the adea the reasonable factors other than age qualification reflects the fact that age unlike race or other classifications protected by title vii not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment the petitioners in this case police officers who challenged pay plan giving officers w ith less than five years of tenure higher percentage raise than those with more seniority failed to satisfy the wards cove requirement that they identify the specific employment practices allegedly responsible for the observed statistical

proof may be reconsidered massachusetts has done so how ever only with respect to clerical and other minor errors and has not adopted any rule of nonfinality applicable to acquittals on the merits also the possibility of prejudice arises when as in this case the acquittal precedes the defendants presentation of his case interpretation of the double jeopardy clause cannot be allowed to become

providing that peace officer shall use every reasonable means to enforce restraining order and shall arrest or seek warrant for the arrest of restrained person when the officer has probable cause to

right to in itiate civil contempt proceedings it merely confers right to request initiation of criminal contempt proceedings and is silent about any power to request or demand an arrest and even if
