energy efficiency requirements applicable to congressional buildings and the energy saving activities being undertaken in the capitol complex the architect of the capitol aoc has the authority and responsibility to provide energy services and implement energy efficiency measures in congressional buildings congress has used legislative appropriations bills to establish energy efficiency measures under aoc in the early 1990s congress funded an energy efficient lighting initiative for congressional buildings in 1998 congress set goal for 2005 to improve energy efficiency by 20 brief comparison with the 30 energy efficiency goal of the executive branch suggests that the current goal for aoc is lower in absolute percentage but calls for higher rate of improvement also aoc does not currently have access to the funding and staff resources that the department of energys federal energy management program provides for executive branch agencies authority by law the architect of the capitol aoc operate s and maintains the capitol complexs buildings and grounds1 specifically the architect is charged with the operation maintenance and improvement of the us capitol and adjacent buildings and grounds some 285 acres that include the capitol building the house and senate office buildings the three library of congress buildings the supreme court the thurgood marshall federal judiciary building the capitol power plant the capitol police headquarters and the robert taft memorial2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20935crs2 3 at one time the capitol power plant did produce electricity power but since the mid 1950s it has only produced steam for heating and domestic hot water and chilled water for cooling buildings 4 personal communication with mr scott birkhead aoc may 29 2001 5 crs report 98920 gov the capitol visitors center an overview by stephen stathis 6 crs report rs20189 p 6 7 aoc personal communication with mr rick khan june 22 2001 of the total use electricity provided about 51 natural gas provided 49 and coal and oil provided less than 1 the capitol power plant only provides steam for heating and chilled water for cooling it is supplied almost exclusively by electricity aided by tiny amounts of natural gas coal and oil 8 aoc personal communication with mr rick khan the provision was contained in house report 100621 which accompanied hr 4587responsibility for the capitol power plant is subject to direction by the house office building commission the plant provides heating and cooling services to the buildings listed above as well as to union station folger shakespeare library government printing office and former district of columbia main post office now called postal square3 however many buildings in the capitol campus receive heating and cooling services from other sources for example the ford house office building receives steam for heating from the general services administration gsa and chilled water for cooling from the food and drug administration4 further the aocs maintenance and energy service responsibilities will be exten ded to include the 265 million capitol visitors center scheduled to be completed in 20055 aoc funding comes primarily from annual legislative branch and judiciary appropriations acts in addition to funding through the appropriations committees statutory authorization for the aocs work comes primarily from four congressional standing committees house administration house transportation and infrastructure senate environment and public works and senate rules and administration6 energy use and energy efficiency measures in fy2000 aocs total energy use was about two trillion british thermal units btu or alternatively about 600 million kilowatthours kwh this is equivalent to the output of 110mw millionwatt power plant energy input to the capitol power plant accounted for about 390 billion btu which is about 20 of the total energy use7 thus most of the energy used in the capitol complex is obtained from utility companies and commercial sources energy management system pl 100458 in 1988 the legislative branch appropriations act for fy1989 pl 100458 appropriated nearly 1 million for the aoc to develop systemwide energy management and control system emcs8 this system monitors indoor and outdoor air temperatures and provides centralized control of air conditioning systems throughout the capitol complex by reducing mechanically produced cooling energy the emcs has saved more than 20 million in utility airhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20935crs3 9 aoc cecmp p 79 10 for each building the report was to cover heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment insulation windows domestic hot water food service equipment and automatic control equipment for each of these measures the report was to include projected installation cost energy and cost savings and payback period 11 us congress house legislative branch appropriations bill 1994 report to accompany hr 2348 june 8 1993 p 1920conditioning costs since 19909 also aoc has used several utility incentive programs including customer rebates and incentives for new building design and curtailable load energy effic ient lighting initiative pl 102486 section 168 of the energy policy act of 1992 epact pl 102486 directed the aoc to undertake an analysis and retrofit program for the capitol and its grounds and the house and senate office buildings including lighting efficiency program and report on other potential energy efficiency measures10 epact specified that the house committee on public works and transportation and the senate committee on rules and administration were to review and approve the identified measures before aoc implemented them the law also encouraged aoc to seek utility incentive programs and directed that cost savings from such incentives be applied to additional energy and water conservation measures epact authorized such sums as might be necessary to carry out the program the lighting retrofit program was allocated 40 million through three public laws pl 10290 appropriated 10 million for fy1992 pl 102392 appropriated 10 million for fy1993 and pl 10369 appropriated 20 million for fy1994 congressional intent was clearly to achieve both energy savings and cost savings the house report h rept 103117 for the legislative branch appropriations act for fy1994 pl 10369 directed the aoc to show how these goals would be achieved the architect is directed not to obligate these funds until he has forwarded an analysis and recommendat ion to the committees on appropriations regarding the proposals received from energy service companies who are experts in this field and which may enable the savings of the original federal investment also the committee believes the pilot test report does not fully explain how the architect intends to dispose of those installations which indicate negative present values an indication of noncosteffective investment and how that will affect total estimated project costs that will need to be clarifie d before proceeding the funds provided subject to their release will enable phase i emergency corridor 24hour lighting retrofits to be made throughout the capitol complex and sufficient funding is available to comply with the first year requirement of the 4year proposed plan11 however the conference report h rept 1034 24 for the emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy1994 pl 103211 reprogrammed 3 million of the appropriations for the lighting initiative and instead provided authority for aoc to seek private sector services to conduct the project the report says the conference agreement does not include rescission of 3000000 as included in the house bill of funds made available to the architect of the capitol for energy efficient lighting retrofitting in the capitol complex the senate deleted this rescission and directed the architect of the capitol to use these funds for converting

appendix 1 16 aoc cecmp p 31 as of july 2000 aoc had compiled electricity data and was in the process of collecting data for natural gas water oil and coal 17 aoc cecmp p 117 27 18 aoc cecmp p 10 eight of the 16 major buildings are more than 60 years old many of their mechanical and electrical systems have exceeded normal lifetimes 19 aoc cecmp p 26maintaining property and facilities at fort meade for longterm storag needs the conferees agree with this directive the energy efficient lighting funds are not needed because the conference agreement provides authority for the architect of the capitol to use the services of energy services comp anies to underwrite the cost of the retrofit program12 another 100000 of the original 40 million in appropriations was also reprogrammed to other nonenergy uses the remaining 900000 was used to survey the opportunities for lighting retrofit project in congressional buildings the survey results formed the basis for issuing request for proposal the selected contractor was to be paid from the energy cost savings over the eight to 10 years following installation13 the energy service company esco engaged by aoc completed the lighting project in 1998 across the capitol complex more than 160000 energysaving fixtures with fluorescent lamps were installed along with motion sensor light switches in public bathrooms as result electricity use dropped from 329 million kwh in fy1990 to 298 million kwh in fy2000 that represents an annual savings of nearly 31 million kwh 10 decrease in use of electricity in decade14 energy plan and goal comprehensive energy conservation and management plan pl 105 275 section 310 of the legislative branch appropriations act for fy1999 directs the aoc to undertake several energy efficiency measures for buildings in the capit ol complex15 aoc completed the plan in july 2000 it describes aocs current and planned energy efficiency activities to prepare for the plans execution aoc is compiling baseline energy use information starting with 199116 as its first step in executing the plan aoc will conduct surveys to identify energy saving opportunities through building retrofit projects17 to comprehensively address the opportunities in the capitol complex the surveys must include 16 major buildings 14 million square feet of floorspace and number of challenges arising from older buildings and historic preservation concerns18 another significant challenge is that most organizations in the complex are not under aoc control19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20935crs5 20 aoc cecmp p 17 as of january 2000 doe had committed to audit the capitol building but its own resource limits may preclude it from committing to do any others in the complex 21 aoc cecmp p 1011 22 aoc cecmp p 19 23 aoc cecmp p 2526 24 aoc cecmp p 15 25 aoc cecmp p 2830 26 aoc cecmp p 18as part of the survey effort aoc requested that doe perform an energy audit of the capitol complex20 also aoc has number of individual building projects and studies underway this included as of july 2000 renovation design underway for the botanic garden project funded to upgrade electricity and air conditioning equipment in the capitol study underw ay to improve the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system in the cannon house office building hob plan for replacing mechanical electrical and plumbing equipment in the supreme court and proposal to study the mechanical system of the rayburn hob21 further aoc reports that the emcs has become obsolete and that consultant has been retained to study needs and propose plan for new system22 aoc also has programs related to vehicle fuel efficien cy substitution and conservation employees are encouraged to use mass transit and carvan pools and aoc actively promotes the acquisition of alternativefueled and fuelefficient vehicles aoc states that it plans to continue these programs and indicates that it will assist other legislative branch entities such as the capitol police with developing programs to acquire such vehicles and to promote use of mass transit and carvan pools23 aoc indicates that it is presently understa ffed for energy responsibilities causing numerous slippages in energy management activities and loss of some energy efficiency opportunities to ensure compliance with the law and effective implementation of the plan aoc proposes to create new energy management and conservation branch under its mechanical engineering division this branch would require additional staff resources including three to seven energy managers and additional office space24 further aoc intends to use doe technical assistance and utility incentive programs to support surveys and projects after exhausting free assistance from doe and certain service contracting opportunities with local utilities aoc indicates that it would then seek direct appropriations from congress to meet the requirements of pl 105275 and the objectives of the plan 25 anticipating that doe will not be able to perform all building surveys at cost to aoc the plan says that aoc anticipates the need for appropriations in fy2002 to hire consultant to help with the survey requirements of pl 10527526 also in compliance with the law aoc says it will submit annual reports to congress that describe energy use and expenditures for each facility energy management and conservation projects and future priorities energy efficiency goal for 2005 for buildings of the capitol complex major provision in pl 105275 required aoc to set goal to reduce energy use per square foot relati ve to 1991 by 20 in 2005 aoc expects that completed ongoing and plannedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20935crs6 27 personal communication with mr scott birkhead aoc may 29 2001 28 aoc this week may 21 2001 p 1 29 aoc comprehensive energy conservation and management plan july 2000 p 12 30 in 1994 executive order 12902 had previously set goal for reducing energy use relative to 1985 levels by 20 percent in 2000 31 aoc cecmp p 31initiatives many of which were underway before the legislation was enacted should enable it to meet that goal aoc says project to replace aging and outdated chillers is the best example of what its future efficiency efforts will achieve these devices provide chilled water to cool the buildings on the capitol campus at the capitol power plant new equipment in the west refrigeration plant expansion will replace vintage 1950s chillers in the east refrigeration plant the new equipment will include high efficiency chillers steamdriven chillers used in combined heat and power chp arrangement and free cooling that employs outside cold air to chill water27 if the project keeps to its schedule aoc estimates 20 electric energy savings by 2005 and 35 savings by project completion in 201628 aoc says the estimated investment of 56 million will avoid other capital costs of 25 million and provide annual electricity savings worth 700 000 to 800000 per year yielding simple payback in about 45 years29 energy savings goal comparison parallel to the aoc goal executive order 13123 directs executive branch agencies to employ energy efficiency measures to achieve goals for reducing building energy use relative to 1985 levels by 30 percent in 2005 and by 35 percent in 2010 the federal energy management program femp at the department of
