the us navy types of submarines submarines are one of four principal categories of combat ships that traditionally have helped define the size and structure of the us navy the other three are aircraft carriers surface combatants eg cruisers destroyers frigates and littoral combat ships and amphibious ships the navy also includes mine warfare ships and va riety of auxiliary and support ships submarines can be powered by either nuclear reactors or nonnuclear power sources such as diesel engines or fuel ce lls all us navy submarines are nuclear powered submarines use of nuclear or nonnuclear power as its energy source is not an indication of whether it is armed with nuclear weapons nuclearpowered submarine can lack nuclear weapons nd nonnuclearpowered submarine can be armed with nuclear weapons roles and missions us navy submarines fall into three types nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines ssbns nuclearpowered cruise missile submarines ssgns and nuclearpow ered

united states2 as of the end of fy2008 the navy included 14 ohio ssbn726 class ssbns which are commonly called trident submarines because they carry trident slbms each trident ssbn can carry 24 trident slbms ssgns the navys four ssgns which ar recent addition to the fleet are former trident ssbns that have been c onverted ie modified to carry tomahawk cruise missiles and special ope rations forces sof rather than slbms although the ssgns differ somewhat from ssns in terms of mission orientation with the ssgns being strongly oriented to ward tomahawk strikes and sof support while the ssns are more generalpurpose in orientation ssgns can perform other submarine missions and are sometimes incl uded in counts of the proj ected total number of navy attack

capability for submarineconstruction yard and perform submarine finalassembly work the joint production arrangement is departure from past us submarine construction practices under which complete submarines were built in individual yards the joint production arrangement is the product of debate over the virginia class acquisition strategy within cong ress and between congress and dod that occurred in 19951997 ie during the markup of the fy 1996fy 1998 defense budgets the goal of the arrangement is to keep both gdeb and newport news involved in building nuclearpowered subm arines and thereby maintain two us shipyards capable of building nuclearpowered submarines while minimizing the cost penalties of using two yards rather than one to build submarine design that is being procured at low annual rate costreduction effort the navy is working to reduce the cost of virginia class submarines so that two boats can be procured in fy2012 for combined cost of 40 billion in fy2005 dollars goal referred to as 2 for 4 in 12 achieving this goal involves removing about 400 million in fy2005 dollars from the cost of each submarine the navy calculates that th unit target cost of 20 billion in fy2005 dollars for each submarine translates in to about 26 billion for boat procured in fy2012 and about 27 billion for boat procured in fy2013 the navy says that in constant fy2005 dollars about 200 million of the 400 million in the soughtafter cost reductions would be accomplished simply through the improved economies of scale eg better spreading of shipyard fixed costs and improved learning rates of producing two submarines per year rather than one per year the remaining 200 million in soughta fter cost reductions the navy says is to be accomplished through changes in the ships design which w ill contribute roughly 100 million toward the costreduction goal and changes in the shipyard production process which will contribut the remaining 100 million or so toward the goal some of the design change s will be introduced to virginiaclass boats procured prior to fy2012 but the navy says the full set of design changes will not be ready for implementation until the fy2012 procurement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs7 8 for more on the navys plan for reducing th procurement cost of the virginiaclass design see statement of ms allison stiller deputy assistant

navy march 24 2008changes in the shipyard production proce ss are aimed in large part at reducing the total shipyard construction time of virginiaclass submarine from 72 months to 60 months if the ship spends less total time in the shipyard being built its construction cost will incorporate sm aller amount of shipyard fixed overhead costs the principal change involved in reducing shipyard c onstruction time to 60 months involves increasing the size of the modules that form each submarine so that each submarine can be built out of smalle r number of modules the navy says that the goal of reducing shipyard construction time to 60 months is mediumrisk goal meaning that the navy believes that there is moderate as opposed to low or high risk that the goal will not be achieved because the full set of design changes and the reduction in construction time to 60 months will not be achieved until fy2012 the navy says that the 20 billion goal cannot be fully met for boats procured pr ior to fy2 012 even if t hose boats are procured at rate of two per year the navy says that if improved economies of scale and changes in the ships design and in the shipyard production pro cess are not sufficient to achieve the 20 billion target the navy may consider reducing the capabilities of the virginia class in certain areas until the target is achieved8 the navys goal to reduce the cost of each virginiaclass boat to 20 billion in constant fy2005 dollars is goal that the navy has set for itself while congress may take this goal into account it need not control congressional action in december 2007 it was reported that th navy believed it had reduced the estimated cost of each boat planned for procurement in fy2012 to within 40 million of the 20 billion goal9 in march 2008 it was reported that the navy believed it had reduced the estimated cost of each fy 2012 boat to within 30 million of goal10 the costreducing design changes are to be implemented in part through an effort known as the technology inserti on program tip in march 2008 the government accountability ffice gao reported thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs8 11 government accountability office defense acquisitions assessments of selected weapons systems gao08467sp march 2008 pp 171172a recent cost analysis indicated that the navy may have difficulty achieving its virginiaclass cost target the tec hnology insertion program was delayed to reduce cost and schedule risk and further evaluate technologies the tip consists of three systems advanced electromagnetic signature reduction advanced sail and conformal acoustic ve locity sensor wide aperture array the first of which is scheduled for insertion in 2010 the advanced electromagnetic signature reduction aesr is software package that uses improved algorithms to continuously monitor and recalibrate the submarines signature similar soft ware has been demonstrated in british submarines but the technology is cons idered immature because modifications to the software will require additional sting software modification is expected to begin in october 2008 and insertion is scheduled for fiscal year 2010 once development is complete aesr will be retrofitted on all virginiaclass submarines the advanced sail is redesign of the structure that sits atop the main body of the submarine the new design provides expanded space to carry weapons antisubmarine systems and co mmunications systems external to the hull development began in june 2006 and the composite material used to construct the sail has been demonstrated under separate program however insertion of the advanced sail has been delayed because related costs may exceed budget limits new bow design that also adds payload space for weapons and systems will be used on submarines starting in fiscal year 2009 the navy will await testing of the new bow before completing new sail design the conformal acoustic velocity nsor wide aperture array caves waa is intended to be more costeffective sensor array caves waa consists of two developmental technologies fiber optic sensors and integrated panels that house them and manage their signature that w ill be integrated together both technologies are still imma ture to save costs the insertion schedule has been deferred 2 years to fiscal year 2014 in fiscal year 2009 the navy will conduct atsea testing of caves waa integrated panel being used as part of another application but not in the form necessary for the virginiaclass submarine the navy hopes to reduce construction time from more than 80 months to just 60 months while ssn 778 and ssn 779 are expected to be delivered in 72 and 68 months respectively construction time must be reduced by another 17 and 12 percent respectively in order to meet the 60 month target historically construction efficiencies tend to be captu red in the early part of production run but ssn 778 and ssn 779 are the fifth and sixth ships being built additionally recent navy estimate indicates that construction for the ssn 784 may take 6 months longer than target according to program officials about 79 percent of the programs target savings for construction and design has already been achieved approximately 158 million however recent cost analys is of the program indicated that the navy may have difficulty achieving target costs in fiscal year

submarinedesign projects underway the submarine design and gineering base is facing the nearterm prospect for the first time in about 50 ears of having major submarinedesign project on which to work navy and industry officials members of congress and other observers are concerned that unless major submarinede sign project is begun soon the submarine design and engineering base will begi n to atrophy through the departure of experienced personnel rebuilding an atr ophied submarine design and engineering base navy and industry offi cials believe could be timec onsuming adding time and cost to the task of the next submarinedesign effort whenever it might begin concern about this possibility among so navy and industry officials was strengthened by the uks difficulties few years ago in designing its new astute class ssn the uk submarine design and engineering base atrophied for lack of work and the subsequent astu teclass design effort experienced considerable delays and cost

vessels for fy 2009 p 8 the potential for the navys longrange ssn procurement plan to produce shortfall in the ssn force over the long run has been discussed by crs since 1995 in the form of testimony to congress in 1995 1997 1999 2000 2002 2004 2006 and 2007 1997 crs presentation to defe nse science board task force on the submarine of the future which issued its report in 199814 19992000 crs report15 2002 crs report16 and this report since its inception in 2004 navy study on options for mitigating projected shortfall the navy in 2006 initiated study on options for mitiga ting the projected ssn shortfall the study was completed in early 2007 and brie fed to crs and the congressional budget office cbo on may 22 200717 at the time of the study the ssn force was projected to bottom out at 40 boats an 8 boat shortfall the addition of second submarine to be procured in fy2011 has since reduced the projected shortfall to seven boats as shown in table 3 principal points in the navy study include the following the daytoday requirement for deployed ssns is 100 meaning that on average total of 10 ssns are to be deployed on dayto day basis18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs11 19 the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time the navy stated is an internal navy fi gure that reflects several studies of potential wartime requirements for ssns the navy stated that these other studies calculated various figures for the number of ssns that would be required and that the figure of 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time was chosen because it was representative of the results of these other studies 20 if shipyard construction time is reduced from 72 months to 60 months the result would be oneyear acceleration in the delivery of all boats procured on or after certain date in program in which boats are being procured at rate of two per year accelerating by one year the deliveries of all boats procured on or after certain date will produce onetime benefit of single year in which four boats will be delivered to the navy rather than two in the case of the virginiaclass program this year might be around 2017 as mentioned earlier in the discussion of the virginiaclass costreduction goal the navy believes that the goal of reducing virginiaclass shipyard constr uction time is mediumrisk goal if it turns out that shipyard construction time is reduced to 66 months rather than 60 months ie is reduced by 6 months rather than 12 months the size of the ssn force would increase by one boat rather than two and the force w ould bottom out at 41 boats rather than 42 21 the navy study identified 19 existing ssns w hose service lives currently appear to be extendable by periods of 1 to 24 months th previous option of reducing virginiaclass shipyard construction time to 60 months the navy concluded would make moot the option of extending the service lives of the three ol dest boats in this group of 19 leaving 16 whose service lives would be considered for extension 22 the navy stated that the rough orderofmag nitude rom cost of extending the lives of 19 ssns would be 595 million in constant fy2005 dollars and that the cost of extending the lives of 16 ssns woul d be roughly proportionalthe peak projected wartime demand is about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time this figure includes both the 10 ssns that are to be deployed on daytoday basis and 25 additional ssns surged from the united states within certain amount of time19 reducing virginiaclass shipyard construction time to 60 months something that the navy already plans to do as part of its strategy for meeting the virginiaclass costreduction goal see earlier discussion on costreduction goal will increase the size of the ssn force by two boats so that the force would bottom out at 42 boats rather than 4020 if in addition to reducing virginiaclass shipyard construction time to 60 months the navy also lengthens the service lives of 16 existing ssns by periods ranging from 3 months to 24 months with many falling in the range of 9 to 15 months this would increase the size of the ssn force by another two boats so that the force would bottom out at 44 boats rather than 40 boats21 the total cost of extending the lives of the 16 boats would be roughly 500 million in constant fy2005 dollars22 the resulting force that bottoms out at 44 boats could meet the 100 requirement for daytoday deployed ssns throughout the 2020httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs12 2033 period if as an additional option about 40 ssn deployments occurring in the eightyear period 20252032 were lengthened from six months to seven months these 40 or so lengthened deployments would represent bout onequarter of all the ssn deployments that would take place during the eightyear period the resulting force that bottoms out at 44 boats could not meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time the force could generate total deployment of 32 ssns within the time in question three boats or about 86 less than the 35boat figure lengthening ssn deployments from six months to seven months would not improve the forces ability to meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time to meet the 35boat figure an additional four ssns beyond those planned by the navy would need to be procured procuring four additional ssns would permit the resulting 48boat force to surge an additional three ssns within the time in question so that the force could meet the peak projected wartime mand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time procuring one to four additional ssns could also reduce the number of sevenmonth deployme nts that would be required to meet the 100 requirement for daytoday ployed ssns during the period 2025 2032 procuring one dditional ssn would reduce the number of 7 month deployments during this pe riod to about 29 procuring two additional ssns would reduce it to about 17 procuring three additional ssns would reduce it to about 7 and procuring four additional ssns would reduce it to 2 the navy added number of caveats to these results including but not limited to the following the requirement for 100 ssns deploy ed on daytoday basis is current requirement that c ould change in the future the peak projected wartime mand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time is an internal navy figure that reflects recent analyses of potentia l future wartime requirements for ssns subsequent analyses of th is issue could result in different figure the identification of 19 ssns as candidates for service life extension reflects current evalua tions of the material condition of these boats and projected use rates for their nuclear fuel cores if the material condition of these boats years from now turns out to be worse than the navy currently projects some of them might longer be suitable for service life extension in addition if world conditions over the next several ears require these submarines tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs13 23

the navy now projects then the amounts of time that their service lives might be extended could be reduced partially to zero or to less than zero ie the service lives of the boats rather than being

service live23 sevenmonth deployments might aff ect retention rates for submarine personnel funding additional ssns alternative funding methods alternative methods of funding the procurement of ssns include but are not necessarily limited to the following two years of advance procurement funding followed by full funding the traditional approach unde r which there are two years of advance procurement funding for the ssns longleadtime components followed by the rema inder of the boats procurement funding in the year of procurement one year of advance procurement funding followed by full funding one year of advance procurement funding for the ssns longleadtime components followed by the remainder of the boats procurement funding in th year of procurement full funding with advance procurement funding singleyear full funding full funding of the ssn in the year of procurement with advance procuremen t funding in prior years incremental funding partial funding of the ssn in the year of procurement followed by one or more years of additional funding increments needed to complete the procurement cost of the ship and advance appropriations form of full funding which can be viewed as legislatively locked in form of incremental funding24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs14 24 continued ship procurement alternative funding approaches background and options for congress by ronald orourke 25 for example at march 1 2007 hearing before the house armed services committee on the fy2008 department of the navy budget re quest representative taylor asked which additional ships the navy might want to pr ocure in fy2008 should additional funding be made available for that purpose in response secretary of the navy donald winter stated in part the virginiaclass submarines requi re us to start with twoyear advanced procurement to be able to provide for the nuclear power plant that supports them so we would need to start two years in advance what th at says is if we were able to start in 08 with advanced procurement we could ac celerate potentially the two year to 2010 source transcript of hearing navy offici als made similar statements before the same subcommittee on march 8 2007 and before the senate armed services comm ittee on march 29 2007 26 in both fy1988 and fy1980 the navy had spar set of nimitz cvn68 class nuclear propulsion components in inventory the exis tence of spare set of components permitted the carriers to be built more quickly than would have otherwise been the case but it is not what made the singleyear full funding of thes carriers possible what made it possible was congress authority to appropriate funds for the purposenavy testimony to congress in early 2007 when congress was considering the fy2008 budget suggested that two years of advance procurement funding are required to fund the procurement of an ssn and consequently that additional ssns could not be procured until fy2010 at the earliest25 this testimo ny understated congresss options regarding the procuremen t of additional ssns in the near term although ssns are normally procured with two years of advance procurement funding which is used primarily for financing longleadtime nuclear propulsion components congress can procure an ssn without prioryear advance procurement funding or with only one year of adva nce procurement funding consequently congress currently has the option of proc uring an additional ssn in fy2009 andor fy2010 singleyear full funding has been used in the past by congress to procure nuclearpowered ships for which prio ryear advance procurement funding had been provided specifically congress us ed singleyear full funding in fy1980 to procure the nuclearpowered aircraft carrier cvn71 nd again in fy1988 to procure the cvns 74 and 75 in the case of the fy1988 procurement under the administrations proposed fy1988 budget cvns 74 and 75 were to be procured in fy1990 and fy1993 respectively and the fy1988 budget was to make the initial advance procurement payment for cvn 74 congress in acting on the fy1988 budget decided to accelerate the procur ement of both ships to fy1988 and fully funded the two ships that year at combined cost of 6325 billion the ships entered service in 1995 and 1998 respectively26 the existence in both fy1980 and fy1988 of spare set of nimitzclass reactor components was not what made it possibl for congress to fund cvns 71 74 and 75 with singleyear full funding it simp ly permitted the ships to be built more quickly what made it possible for congress to fund the carriers with singleyear full funding wa s congresss constitutional authority to appropriate funding for that purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs15 27 see for example the spoken remarks of cretary of the navy donald winter at hearings before the house armed services committee on march 1 2007 and march 6 2008 and spoken remarks by other navy officials at march 29 2007 hearing before the senate armed services committee and at march 14 2008 hearing before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committeeprocuring an ssn with one year of dvance procurement f unding or advance procurement funding would not materially change the way the ssn would be built the process would still encompass about two years of advance work on long leadtime components and an additional six years or so of construction work on the ship itself the outlay rate for the ssn c ould be slower as outlays for construction of the ship itself would begin one or two years later than normal congress in the past has pr ocured certain ships in the knowledge that those ships would not begin construction for some time and consequently would take longer to enter service than ship of that ki nd would normally require when congress procured two nuclearpowered aircraft carriers cvns 72 and 73 in fy1983 and another two cvns 74 and 75 in fy1988 it did so in both cases in the knowledge that the second ship in each case would not begin construction until some time after the first procuring ssns in 212 pattern some potential approaches for procuring additional boats in fy2009fy2011 could resu lt in pattern of procuring two boats in given year followed by one boat the following year and two boats the year after that 212 pattern navy testimony to congress in early 2007 and early 2008 suggested that if the procurement rate were increased in given year to two boats it would not be best from an indus trialbase point of view to decrease the rate to single boat the following year and then increase it again to two boats the next year because of the workforce fl uctuations such profile would produce27 this statement may overstate the productionefficiency disadvantages of 212 pattern if two boats were procured in given year followed by one boat the next year total of three boats in 24 mont hs the schedule for producing the three boats could be phased so that for gi ven stage in the production process the production rate would be one boat every eight months production rate of one boat every eight months might actually help th industrial base make the transition from the current schedule of one boat every twelve months one boat per year to one boat every six months two boats per year viewed this way 212 pattern might actually lead to some benef its in production efficiency on the way to steady rate of two boats per year the navys own 30year fy2009fy2038 ssn procurement plan calls for procuring ssns in 1212 pattern in fy2029fy2038httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs16 issues for congress accelerating procurement of second fy2011 boat one issue for congress is whether to accelerate the full funding of the second virginiaclass boat now pla nned for fy2011 to either fy 2010 so as to facilitate followon option of funding an additi onal virginiaclass submarine in fy2011 supporters of this option might argue the following the operational risks of allowing the ssn force to drop below 48 are unacceptable the navy has described the 48boat goal as moderaterisk force so dropping substantially below 48 boats would imply highrisk force although the deepest part of the projected ssn shortfall lasts only certa in number of years potential adversaries can know in advance when this w ill occur and make plans to take advantage of it the navys nonprocurement options for mitigating the ssn shortfall carry their own risks th navy might not be able to reduce the shipyard construction period for virginiaclass boats to 60 months due to unexpected problems in the effort to reduce shipyard construction time the navy might not be able to extend the service lives of existing ssns as much as currently projected due to faster thananticipated deterioration in ship material condition or higher thananticipated rates of nuclear fuel core use in coming years the navy might not be able to ngthen ssn deployments without adversely affecting retention rates for submarine personnel accelerating the second fy2011 ssn to fy2010 and procuring an additional ssn in fy2011 would re duce the number of sevenmonth ssn deployments needed to meet the requirement for having 10 ssns deployed on daytoday basis between 2025 and 2032 and permit the ssn force to fulfill more of the peak wartime demand for 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time opponents of this option might argue the following given constraints on navy funding the navy cannot afford to accelerate the second fy2011 ssn to fy2010 and procure an additional ssn in fy2011 without re ducing funding for one or more other navy programs in those ears the operational risks that would be created by reducing funding for these other programs is greater than the operational risk that would result from procuring an additional ssn in fy2011 the navy has nonprocurement op tions for mitigating the projected ssn shortfall these options would allow the navy to meet the current requirement for the numbe r of ssns to be deployed on ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs17 daytoday basis and to come close to meeting the projected peak wartime demand for ssns deployed within certain amount of time maintaining design and engineering base navy and industry officials appear to ag ree that preserving the submarine design and engineering base over the next severa l years will require funding substantial submarine design and engineering work in the near term the navy plans to address the issue by accelerating into the near term the start of design work on the next generation ssbn given the ages of the navys 14 current ssbns work on replacement ssbn design would normally not need to start for several years the navy however is accelerating the start of this project into the near term with an eye toward carrying out the project as steadystate effort over several years rather than as moreconcentrated effort starting several years from now the navys plan will provide significant amount of submarine design and engineering work for several years and engage wide range of submarine design and engineering skills the navy asked rand to study the questi on of sustaining the submarine design and engineering base the rand study which was published in 2007 states that based on rands analysis we reach the following recommendations seriously consider starting the desi gn of the next submarine class by 2009 to run 20 years taking into account the substantial advantages and disadvantages involved if the 20yeardesign alternative survives further evaluation the issue of gap in submarine design is resolved and further actions need be taken if that alternative is judged too risky we recommend the following thoroughly and critically evaluate the degree to which options such as the spiral development of the virginia cla ss or design without construction will be able to substitute for newsubmarine design in allowing design professionals to retain their skills if options to sustain design personnel in excess of demand are judged on balance to offer clear advantages over letting the workforce erode then the navy should take the following actions request sufficient funding to sustain excess design workforces at the shipyards large enough to permit substantial savings in time and money later taking into account trends affecting the evolution of critical skills continue efforts to determine which shipyard skills need action to preserve them within the sustained design core conduct comprehensive analysis of vendors to the shipyards to determine which require intervention to preserve critical skillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs18 28 john f schank et sustaining us submarine design capabilities rand santa monica ca

reach the navys virginiaclass costreduction target the scope of this effort could be ex panded to include greater number and variety of modifications an expanded modification effort would add to the

proposed developing new asds design with the intention of putting this new design into serial production this option like the previous one would add to the amount of submarine design and engineering

design for this purpose this option would genera substantial volume of work and engage many skill areas uncertainty over whether and when this project might occur could make it difficult to confidently incorporate it into an integrated schedule of work for preserving the us design and engineering base although the project would engage many skill areas it might not engage all of them skills related to the design of nuclear propulsion plants for example might not be engaged in addition this project might raise concerns regarding the potential for unintended transfer of sensitive us submarine technology an issue that has been cited by the navy in the past for not supporting the idea of designing and building diesel electric submarines in the united states for sale to foreign buyers31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32418crs20 31 continued such boats would lead to political pressure for the navy to accept the procurement of such boats for its own use perhaps in lieu of nucl earpowered submarines the navy argues that nonnuclearpowered submarines are not well suited for us submarine operations which typically involve long stealthy transits to the operating area long submerged periods in the operating area and long stealthy transits back to home port 32 section 121 of hr 4986pl 110181 of january 28 2008new ssn design developing completely new ssn design as the

to the procurement cost of three ssns the house version of the fy2006 defense authorization bill hr 1815 proposed this idea but the idea was not supported by the navy in large part because of its cost

based upon an analysis and prioritization of unconstrained attack submarine requirements sorted by mission provided by the combatant commanders the committee further directs that results of such an assessment be included in the report on the quadrennial defense review submitted to the senate committee on armed services and the house committee on armed services in accordance with section 118d of title 10 united states code servicelife extension of ssn688 angeles class hulls the committee understands that the secretary of the navy has conducted an assessment of the feasibility of extending the

that the assessment did not explore options that would increase the number of attack submarines above 48 in the longterm the committee also notes that the assessment did not explore options for limiting deployments or other actions that could limit hull fatigue in the near term in order to conserve service life of more angeles cl ass submarines over the longterm therefore the committee directs the secretary of the navy to submit report which includes an assessment of th feasibility and cost of extending the service life of all current angeles class submarines this report should

development the design and development efforts in these programs are to evaluate broad range of system and technology alternatives to directly support and enhance the mission capability of current submarines and future submarine concepts qthe budget request include d funding to begin studies that would lead to developing replacement for the ohio class strategic missile submarine program which was designed in the 1970s the navy has begun studies under program called the undersea launch missile study ulms the efforts within ulms will involve exploring new technologies conceptual design of ship configurations supporting ship systems c onsideration of strategic payloads and development of other payloads however there appears to be insuffi cient work to maintain the skill set among submarine designers until the navy would otherwise start designing replacement for the ohio class previous report by the rand corporation evaluating the submarine design industria l base concluded that it would be less expensive to sustain some number of workers in excess of those needed to meet the residual design demands during such gap one means of achieving this goal would be to begin the more extensive design activities earlier than the navy would otherwise start them to support sp ecific date to start building the next class the committee believes that the navy should continue that effort in fiscal year 2009 and recommends an increase of 150 million for that purpose page 193 compromise in lieu of conference report there was compromise version of s 3001 that was accompanied by

regarding the appropriateness of the navys 48boat ssn forcelevel goal navy view46 in support of its position that 48 is the correct number of ssns to meet future needs the navy in 2006 argued the following the figure of 48 ssns was derive d from number of forcelevel studies that converged on figure of about 48 boats making this figure an analytical sweet spot force of 48 boats is moderaterisk ie acceptablerisk force as opposed to the lowrisk force called for in the 1999 jcs study force of 48 boats will be sufficient in coming years to maintain about 10 forwarddeployed ssns on daytoday basis the same number of forwarddeployed boats that the navy has previously maintained with force of more than 50 ssns the navy will be able to maintain 10 forwarddeployed ssns in coming years with only 48 boats because the force in coming years will include an increased number of newer ssns th at require less maintenance over their lives and consequently are available for operation greater percentage of the time us regional military commanders would prefer daytoday forwarddeployed total of about 18 ssns but total of 10 will be sufficient to meet their most important needs all 10 of the forwarddeployed ssns are needed for daytoday missions such as intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr while about 75 of these submarines are also needed to ensure that an adequate number of ssns are in position for the opening phases of potential conflicts in various locations on the issue of meeting us regional military commanders requirements for daytoday forwarddeployed ssns the navy states each combatant commander cocom requests assets to execute required missions utilizing the global force management process broad categories of mission types are used to make reque sts including

alternative view some observers believe that more than 48 ssns will be needed to meet future needs one ch observer retired vice admiral albert konetzni jr former commander of the us pacific fleet submarine force argued the following in 200648 the navys ssn forcelevel analyses called for force of 48 to 60 ssns in this context force of 48 ssns looks more like sour spot than sweet spot the navys ssn forcelevel analyses reflect reverse engineering in which an ssn forcelevel number is selected at the outset for affordability reasons and assumptions used in the forcelevel study are then adjusted
