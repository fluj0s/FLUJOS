available to the prevailing party as alternative remedies full compliance is the preferred outcome however so as to ensure that negotiated rights and oblig ations are preserve d and maintained article 22 of the dsu provides that if the prevailing member in dispute believes that the other member has not implemented the wto rulings and recommendations by the end of the comp liance period it may request the other member to negotiate compensation agreement or may ask the dsb for authorization to suspend wto concessions usually to impose higher tariffs on items from the other country the member ma choose the latter option without first seeking compensation generally member should seek to suspend concessions in the same sector in which the wto viola tion was found but if the member finds that this is not practicable or effective it may seek to suspend concessions in other sectors in the same agreement if however the member finds that this alternative would also be impracticable or ineffective and that the circumstances are serious enough it may seek to suspend obliga tions under another wto agreement or in other words crossretaliate under the dsu the dsb is to authorize the

clarification through bilateral agreements 3 j intl econ l 553 2000 4 the dsu does not expressly set out procedure for obtaining the removal of countermeasures though memb ers may obtain ruling on whether continued imposition is warranted either through compliance panel or new dispute settlement proceeding the issue of removing such measures has arisen with respect to the continued levying of increased tariffs on ec products by the united states and canada the increases having been originally imposed in response to the ecs fa ilure to comply with wto decision faulting european union eu import restrictions on beef produced with growth hormones ds26ds48 the ec filed complaint in the wto in november 2004 in which it argued that the higher tariffs should be removed on the ground that

suspension of obligations in the echormones dispute wtds3206 january 14 2005defending member objects to the request however the proposed retaliation will be arbitrated and the 30day deadline for appr oving the retaliation request effectively extended the objection may relate to the level of nullification or impairment of benefits involved or whether dsu rules as to the choice of retaliatory measures have been followed under the dsu the arbitration is to be carried out by the original panel if members are availa ble or by an arbitrator appointed by the wto director general the arbitration is ordinarily to be completed within 60 days after the compliance period expires the dsb then meets to authorize the retaliation request to the extent the proposed retaliation is c onsistent with the arbitrators decision in addition article 215 of the dsu pr ovides for further dispute settlement proceedings in the event the disputing parties disagree as to whether the defending member has implemented the wto rulings and recommendations in particular case once compliance panel is convene d it has 90 days to issue report the report may then be appealed since th dsu fails to incorporate article 215 proceedings into the 30day period for pproving countermeasures and the timeframe for any subsequent arbitration procedural problem referred to as sequencing has resulted members have often filled the gap however by entering into ad hoc bilateral agreements such agreements may provide for example that the prevailing party will request authoriza tion to impose countermeasures the defending party will request arbitration of the proposal and the arbitration will be suspended until the compliance panel procedure is completed3 the dsu provides that any suspension of concessions or other obligations is temporary and may only be applied by the prevailing member until the wto inconsistent measure is removed the defe nding member provides solution to any trade injury at issue or

accompanying notes 15289 for further discussion of this case continuedprecedence7 moreover section 102 is further in tended to clarify that all changes to us law known to be necessary or appropriate to implement the wto agreements are incorporated in the uraa and that any unforeseen conflicts between us law and the wto agreements can be enacted in subsequent legislation8 congress has traditionally treated potentia l conflicts with prior gatt agreements and free trade agreements in this way treatment that it also deems to be consistent with the congressional view that necessary changes in federal statutes should be specifically enacted not preempted by international agreements9 this approach carries over into the implementation of wto dispute settlement results situation explained as follows in uraa legislative history since the uruguay round agreements as approved by the congress or any subsequent amendments to those agreements are nonselfexecuting any dispute

for the purposes of declaring such law or application invalid13 according to legislative history the pr ovision makes clear th at the uruguay round agreements do not automatically preempt st ate laws that do not conform to their provisions even if wto dispute settlement panel or the appellate body were to determine that particular state measure wa s inconsistent with one or more of the uruguay

that person other than the united states shall have cause of action or defense under any of the uruguay round agreements or by virt ue of congressional approval of such an agreements or may challenge in an action brought under any provision of law any action or inaction by any department agency or other instrumentality of the united states any state or any political subdivision of state on the ground that such action or inaction is incons istent with such agreement congress has additionally stated in 102c2 of the uraa 19 usc 3512c2 that it intends through the prohibition on private remedies to occupy the field with respect to an cause of action or defense under or in connection with any of the uruguay r ound agreements incl uding by precluding any person other than the united states from bringing any action against any state or political subdivision thereof or ra ising any defense to the application of state law under or in connection with any of the uruguay round agreements on the basis of judgment obtained by the united states in an action brought under any such agreement or b on any other basis the house ways and means committee report on the uraa discusses the rationale and implications of 102c as follows for example private party cannot br ing an action to require preclude or modify government exercise of discretionary or general public interest authorities under other provisions of law these prohibitions are based on the premise that it is the responsibility of the federal government and not private citizens to ensure that federal or state laws are consistent with us obligations under international agreements such as the uruguay round agreements17 the saa notes however that 102c does not preclude any agency of government from considering or entert aining argument on whether its action or proposed action is consistent with th uruguay round agreements although any change in agency action would have to be authorized by domestic law18 in addition federal

november 23 2002 while japan had threatened trade retalia tion earlier in november because it found it unlikely that the united states would comply with each element of the ruling by this deadline the

national authorities when calculating normal value under past practice the partment considered sales of produc t to an affiliate to be at arms length if the prices charged were on average at least 995 of the prices charged to unaffiliated comparison market customers the departments new test provides that for affiliate sales to be considered the sales prices must fall on average within defined range or band around sales prices of the same or comparable merchandise sold by that exporter or producer to all unaffiliated customers the band applied for this purpose will provide that the overall ratio calculated for an affiliate be between 98 percent and 102 per cent inclusive of prices to unaffiliated customers71 according to the department the regulatory revision is consistent with the view expressed by the wto appellate b ody that rules aimed at preventing the distortion of normal value through sales between affiliates s hould reflect even handedly that both high and lowprice sales between affiliates might not be in the ordinary course of trade72 the department stated th at the new methodology would be used to implement the wto findings regarding the japan hotrolled steel ad proceeding and applied in all investigations and reviews in itiated on or after november 23 200273 on december 3 2002 the department an nounced new dumping determination in the ad proceeding at issue

the use of adverse facts available and recalculated the allothers rate based on the new rates for the respondent companies74 the recalculations resulted in reduced dumping margins for the three companies as well for all other exporters legislative compliance as noted earlier the dispute panel as upheld by the appellate body concluded that the ited states was in violation of its wto

applied to exports of upland cotton and other unscheduled agricultural commodities supported under the programs and to exports of rice scheduled commodity are export subsidies applied in manner that illegally circumvents us export subsidy commitments in the agriculture agreement119 the three programs are the commodity credit corporation ccc export credit guarantee program gsm 102 providing export credit guarantees for up to three years the ccc intermediate export credit guarantee program gsm 103 providing export credit guarantees for up to 10 years and the supplier credit guarantee program scgp as these programs did not conform fully to export subsidy obligations in the scm agreement they were found not to be covered by the p eace clause and thus subject to challenge120 the panel went on to find that these programs are prohibited export subsidies under article 31a of the scm agreement121 second the panel found that 1207a of the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 7 usc 7937a or the socalled step 2 program to the extent that it provides for payments to exporters for their purchase of higher priced upland cotton constitutes an export subsidy for that product that was not scheduled by the united states and therefore incons istent with us obligations under the agreement on agriculture122 as such this part of the step 2 program was also found not to be covered by the peace clause to be subject to challenge and as further found by the panel to constitute prohibited export subsidy under the article 31a of the scm agreement123 similarly the panel also determined that 1207a insofar as it provides for payments to domestic users of upland cotton constitutes an import substitution subsidy prohibited under article 31b of the scm agreement124 third the panel found that various u s domestic support programs including countercyclical payments market loss ssistance payments market loan program payments and step 2 payments for us cotton producers granted support to specific commodity in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year and thus were not covered by provision of the peace clause that could be invoked onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32014crs33 125

antigua had not made prima facie case that eight state measures violated the agreement the panel had improperly examined their gatsconsistency159 with respect to the gats exceptions the ab found that the panel had erroneously concluded that the three fe deral statutes could not be considered necessary for purposes of articles xiva and xivc because the united states had not entered into consultations with antigua to find less traderestrictive alternative the ab ultimately found that statutes were necessary to protect public morals or to protect public order for pur poses of article xvia and that they thus fell within the scope of this exception160 at the same time the ab also found that in light of provision in the interstate horseracing act iha that might facially continue to allow the remote supply of wagering on horseracing by domestic firms the united states had not shown that the wire act the travel act and the igba were being applied consistently with the article xvi proviso that is that they may possibly be used to prosecute foreig n but not domestic providers of remote horserace gambling services161 antigua had based its argume nt that the united states was applying the three statutes inconsistently with the article xiv proviso on two aspects of the iha statute allowing the acceptance of interstate offtrack wagers provided certain conditions are met making violators civilly liable for damages to named entities including the state in which the subject horserace takes place and authorizing certain civil suits against violators162 first antigua

or transmitted by an individual in one state via telephone or other elec tronic media and accepted by an offtrack betting system in the same or another state provided the wagers are lawful in the states involved164 in the words of the ab antigua thus argued that the iha on its face authorizes domestic service suppliers but not foreign service suppliers to offer remote betting services in relation to certain horse races to this extent in antiguas view the igha exempts domestic service suppliers from the prohibitions of the wire act the travel act and the igba165 as further described by the ab the pa nel found that the evidence provided by the united states was not sufficiently persuasive to conclude that as regards wagering on horseracing the remote supply of such services by domestic firms continues to be prohibited notwithstanding the plain language of the iha166 the ab concluded that the panel did not err in making this finding the appellate body report and the panel report as modified by the ab were adopted april 20 2005167 the united states reported at the may 19 2005 meeting of the dsb that it intended to implement the rulings and had begun to consider options

the appellate body has made finding as to whether the activity that is prohibited by these statutes is permitted under the iha instead the appellate body has emphasized the need to demonstrate that in the light of the existence of the interstate horseracing act the wire act the travel act and the illegal gambling business act are applied consistently with the requirements of the article xi v chapeau accordingly reasonable legislative option would have the effect of clarifying that relevant us federal laws entail discrimination between foreign and domestic service suppliers in the application of measures prohibiting remote supply of gambling and betting services there will be ample room for reasona ble and principled disagreements among legislators as to precisely how to achieve such clarification in the context of internet gambling legislative clarification will be furthe r complicated by the fact that starting in the 105th congress 199798 and continuing in each

allow but not re quire the practice is reasonable one196 the wto panel in report issued october 31 2005 found that zeroing as applied in the weightedaveragetoweighted average price comparisons made in the specific original investigations cited in the ecs complaint is inconsistent with article 242 of the antidumping agreement which provides in part that subject to the provisions governing fair comparison in paragraph 4 the existence of margins of dumping during the inves tigation phase shall normally be established on the basis of comparison of weighteda verage normal value of prices of all comparable export transactions or by comparison of norma l value and export prices on transaction totransaction basis197 the panel based its conc lusion on earlier appellate body rulings including ruling against the united states regarding its use of zeroing in calculating dumping margins on softwood lu mber from canada ds264 that when margin of dumping is calculated on the basis of multiple averaging by model type the margin of dumping for the product in stion must reflect the results of all such comparisons including weighted average export prices that are above the normal value for

address the issue of zeroing these sections respectively define the terms dumping margin and weighted average dumping margin blish the basic authority for imposing antidumping duties and authorize the

than original investigations the report was appealed by the united states and the ec on april 18 2006 the appellate body found although on different grounds from the panel that the zeroing methodolog could be challenged as such as it relates to original investig ations and upheld the panels finding that the practice is inconsistent with article 242 of the antidumping agreement199 the ab reversed the panel however in finding that the united states was in compliance with its wto obligations in using zeroing in the administrative reviews cited by the ec the ab found instead that the application of zeroing in these reviews violated article 93 of the antidum ping agreement and article vi2 of the gatt 1994 since the practice resulted in antidumping duties that ex ceeded the exporters or producers dumping margins article 93 which sets out obligations regarding the assessment of antidumping duties provides that the amount of the antidumping duty imposed by wto member shall not exceed the margin of dumping as established under article 2 of the agreemen t article vi2 of the gatt 1994 provides that wto member may impose an antidumping duty on dumped product greater in amount than th

price exceeded the contemporaneous average normal value the usdoc at the aggregation stage disregarded the result of this individual comparison because results of this type were systematically disregarded the methodology applied by the usdoc in the administrative revi ews at issue resulted in amounts of assessed antidumping duties that exceeded the foreign producers or exporters margins of
