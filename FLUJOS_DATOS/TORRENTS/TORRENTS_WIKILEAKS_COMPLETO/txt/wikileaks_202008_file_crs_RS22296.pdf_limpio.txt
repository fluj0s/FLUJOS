nondiscrimination legislation since th civil rights act of 1964 it provides broad nondiscrimination protection and as stated in the act its purpose is to provide clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities1 title iii provides that individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns leases or leases to or operates place of public accommodation2 entities covered by the term public accommodation are listed and include among others hotels restaurants theaters auditoriums laundromats museums parks zoos private schools day care centers professional offices of health care providers and gymnasiums 3 although the sweep of title iii is broad there are some limitations on its nondiscrimination requirements failure to remove architectural barriers is not violation unless such removal is readily achievable4 readily achievable is defined as easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense5 reasonable modifications in practices policies or procedures are required unless they would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods services facilities or privileges6 individual with disability may be excluded denied services segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services unless the entity can demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods services or facilities or would result in an undue burden 7 an undue burden is defined as an action involving significant difficulty or expense8 the remedies and procedures of section 204a of the civil rights act of 1964 are incorporated in title iii of the ada9 this allows for both private suit and suit by the attorney general when there is reasonable cause to believe that there is pattern or practice of discrimination against individuals with disabilities monetary damages are not recoverable in private suits but may be available in suits brought by the attorney general10 section 204c of the civil rights act 1 42 usc 12102b1 bills hr 3195 and s 1881 have been introduced in the 110th congress to amend the definition of disability to broaden the scope from that termined by supreme court decisions for more detailed discussion of the definition of disability under the ada see crs report rl33304 the americans with

also prohibited by title ii civil action may be brought before the expiration of thirty days after written notice of such alleged act or practice has been given to the appropriate state or local authority the ada does not specifically incorporate this requirement and the courts which have considered the issue have generally found that this requirement was not incorporated in the ada11 g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 although situations involving the filing of multiple law suits by an individual with disability based on deminimus violations have generally been settled out of court there have been judicial decisions involving these issues12 generally the cases that have gone to court have addressed questions concerning whether the plaintiff is vexatious litigant or whether the plaintiff has standing in at least one case court held that prelitigation unambiguous notice and reasonable opportunity to cure were required prior to the award of attorneys fees in molski v mandarin touch restaurant13 california district court found that the plaintiff was vexatious litigant who filed hundreds of law suits designed to harass and intimidate business owners into agreeing to cash settlements the plaintiff jack molski had physical disability which required that he use wheelchair and had filed between 300400 lawsuits in federal courts since 1998 the district court reviewed the cases and found that many are nearly identical in terms of the facts alleged the claims presented and the damages requested 14 in fact the court noted in one complaint mr molski claimed that on may 20 2003 he went to 7 mares restaurant which he alleged lacked adequate parking and had food counter that was too high after the meal the plaintiff alleged that he attempted to use the restroom but because the toilets grab bars were improperly installed he injured his shoulder and he was also unable to wash his hands due to faulty design in two other cases mr molski alleged that he encountered almost identical problems in another restaurant and at winery on the same day may 20 2003 the court found these complaints to be indicative of clear intent to harass businesses 15 even though the court noted that it was possible even likely that many of the businesses sued were not in full compliance with the ada the court found the sanctions for bad faith were not therefore barred especially where the motive was to garner funds the district court ordered the plaintiff to obtain the leave of the court prior to filing any other claims under the ada observing that in addition to 11 see eg botosan v paul mcnally realty 216 f3d 827 9th cir 2000 for detailed discussion of this issue see adam milani go ahead make my 90 days should plaintiffs be required to provide notice to defendant before filing suit under title iii of the americans with disabilities act 2001 wisc l rev 107 2001 this article argues that the best reading of the ada is that it requires like title ii of the civil rights act that plaintiffs provide thirty days notice to state or local agency responsible for combating discrimination prior to filing suit the article concludes that this interpretation renders federal legislation to provide notice unnecessary 12 commentators have also explored these issues see eg carri becker private enforcement of the americans with disabilities act via serial litigation abusive or commendable 17 h ahastings women s lj 93 2006 samuel r bagenstos the perversity of limited civil rights remedies the case of abusive ada litigation 54 ucla l rev 1 2006 13 347 fsupp2d 860 cdcalif 2004 14 id at 861 15 the district court observed the court is tempted to exclaim what lousy day it would be highly unusualto say the leastfor anyone to sustain two injuries let alone three in single day each of which necessitated separate federal lawsuit but in molskis case may 20 2003 was simp ly business as usual molski filed 13 separate complaints for essentially identical injuries sustained between may 19 2003 and may 23 2003 the court simply does not believe that molski suffered 13 nearly identical injuries generally to the same part of his body in the course of performing the same activity over fiveday period id at 865

his claims of being the innocent victim of hundreds of physical and emotional injuries over the last four years defy belief and common sense16 in related suit the california district court also found against the counsel in the molski case holding that the counsel was required to seek leave of the court before filing any additional ada claims17 these two cases were upheld on appeal to the ninth circuit in molski v evergreen dynasty corp 18 after detailed examination of the cases in light of standards for vexatious litigation the ninth circuit noted for the ada to yield its promise of equal access for the disabled it may indeed be n ecessary and desirable for committed individuals to bring serial litigation advancing the time when public accommodations will be compliant with the ada but as important as this goal is to disabled individuals and to the public serial litigation can become vexatious when as here large number of nearlyidentical complaints co ntain factual allegations that are contrived exaggerated and defy common sense 19 similarly the court of appeals held that the district court was within its discretion to impose pre filing order the ninth circuit observed that the frankovich group filed numerous complaints containing false factual allegations thereby enabled molskis vexatious litigation provided the district court with sufficient grounds on which to base its discretionary imposition of sanctions 20 several courts have found that plaintiff lacks standing to bring an ada claim for injunctive relief under title iii if the plaintiff cannot establish that he or she intends to return to the entity with the alleged ada violations in harris v stonecrest care auto center21 the district court questioned the plaintiffs credibility due to the fact that he had brought at least twenty other ada related lawsuits and carefully examined the requirements of standing noting that title iii of the ada was intended to remedy discrimination in the area of public accommodation by providing injunctive relief the court concluded that since the plaintiff had visited the gas station solely for the purpose of bringing title iii claim and supplemental state claims any injunctive relief the court might grant would not satisfy the redressability requirement of standing 22 similarly in tampa bay americans with disabilities association inc v nancy markoe gallery inc23 the court found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate real and immediate threat of future injury since her visits to the store were infrequent there was gap in time between visits and she did not live in the same city as the store the court also noted with some concern that the tampa bay americans with disabilities associati on had filed sixteen previous ada cases and the individual plaintiff had filed fourteen24 16 347 fsupp2d 860 867 cdcalif 2004 17 molski v mandarin touch restaurant 359 fsupp 924 cdcalif 2005 see also molski v arbys huntington beach 359 fsupp2d 938 cdcalif

attorneys fees where plaintiff who uses wheelchair had won settlement against restaurant where he alleged he had encountered architectural barriers following discussion of the use of ada to create profits for law firms the court held it was fair and reasonable to require prelitigation unambiguous notice and reasonable opportunity to cure before allowing attorneys fees in an ada case

adas statutory language to address the issue of vexatious law suits have also been proposed 26 hr 3479 would add provisions to the remedies and procedures of title iii of the ada to require plaintiff to provide notice by registered mail of an alleged violation to the defendant this notice would be required to contain the specific facts regarding the alleged violation including the identification of the location at which the violation occurred and the date on which the violation occurred the notice also would require informing the defendant that civil action may not be commenced until the expiration of ninety day period state or federal court would not have jurisdiction for civil action filed pursuant to title iii of the ada or under provision of state law that conditions violation of any of its provisions on violation of the act unless this notice is provided at least ninety days have passed and the complaint states that as of the date on which the complaint is filed the defendant had not corrected the alleged violation the notification provisions would not apply to civil actions brought under rule 65 of the federal rules of civil procedure or civil actions under state or local court rules requesting preliminary injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders hr 3479 was referred to the house judiciary committee

congresses hr 2804 109th congress differs somewhat from hr 728 for example hr 728 would have allowed notice to be provided in person not just by registered mail hr 728 was referred to the house judiciary committee and to the subcommittee on the constitution although the bill was not passed in the 108 th congress the house subcommittee on rural enterprises agriculture and technology of the house small business committee held hearings on the bill on april 8 200327 continued lack of continuing connection to the business being sued but argued for an amendment to the ada stating that only congress can respond to vexatious litigation tactics that otherwise comply with its statutory frameworks 25 373 f supp2d 1028 cd calif 2005 26 proponents of such legislation have argued that notifi
