part of the vahud fy1999 appropriations bill on october 21 1998 this report highlights the major provisions of this act indicating its nature and scope this report will not be updated under this act wellrun public housing agencies will have more freedom to operate while poorly run agencies will be held more accountable more working families with higher incomes will live in public housing that is now largely occupied by the poorest of the poor and some residents will be required to perform 8 hours month of community service while there will be more incentives and opportunities for tenants to improve their lives in both public housing and the section 8 program it will be easier to evict tenants who commit crimes and cause problems home rule flexible grant demonstration program will allow some local governments rather than public housing agencies to receive federal housing funds to develop creative approaches for providing affordable housing new section 8 housing voucher program will be more landlordfriendly and more marketdriven most provisions in the new act become effective october 1 1999 the new housing act in perspective approximately 5 million lowincome households currentl receive federal housing assistance1 at least another 15 million qualify for help but do not receive it because of limited budget appropriations most of those receiving help are very poor with median income of about 8000 after three years of debate congress recently passed major public housing and tenantbased assistance reform bill the quality housing and workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98868crs2 responsibility act of 1998 title v of pl 105276 the fiscal 1999 hud budget bill largely addresses the public housing agencies that manage 13 million households who live in publiclyowned units and another 14 million who receive section 8 vouchers that are used to pay part of the rent in privatelyowned apartments many provisions in the new act attempt to protect the 90 billion investment the nation has made in public housing by requiring the agencies that manage these projects to rethink their own goals and standards of operations both the tenants and the local community are to have role in this process the agencies will then be held more accountable for carrying out their annual and long term plans the new legislation also has many provisions for improving the living environment of the tenants for example better efforts to reduce crime and to moderniz or replace dilapidated units there are more incentives for residents to improve their lives and become more economical ly self sufficient for example tenants will not necessarily face an immediate rent increase if they become employed or increase their current income as has often happened in the past many housing analysts believe housing vouchers are an efficient way to help low income households afford decent housing vouchers give households more choice over where they prefer to live than projectbased assistance they also make it at least somewhat less likely that the poor will be concentrated in particular project or neighborho od the new law makes it likely that all or parts of some public housing projects will convert to system of vouchers in addition the fiscal 1999 hud budget provides for about 90000 new vouchers including 50000 under the welfare to work initiative these and other changes will mean more lowincome households will be taking their vouchers in search of housing in middle class apartment complexes the new legislation makes the section 8 voucher program more landlordfriendly in order to retain current landlords and to attract new ones landlords will be able to screen prospective tenants with vouchers and use standard rental lease they will be expected to treat voucher holders with the same respect and provide them with the same level of service as unassisted renters assisted tenants in turn will be held to the same standards of conduct as unassisted renters title v quality housing and work responsibility act of 1998 public housing general provisions rents housing authorities may set minimum rent of up to 50 but can make exceptions for hardship circumstances residents will be given an annual choice of paying either flat rent or an incomebased rent in order not to discourage families who are attempting to become economically selfsufficient through employment rents may not be increased for 12 months as result of employment and then increases are to be phased in however rents are not to be reduced if tenants income from welfare program is reduced because of

vacancies occur but is not to be done by concentrating very low income families in certain projects or in certain buildings of project an agency may offer incentives for eligible higher income families to occupy units in projects now mostly occupied by verylow income families skipping family on waiting list to accomplish the income mixing will not be considered an adverse action within
