financing domestic social policy division transitional medical assistance tma under medicaid summary medicaid meanstested federalstate program that provides health care coverage to certain groups of individuals requires that states continue medicaid benefits for certain lowincome families who would otherwise lose coverage because of changes in their income this continuation is known as transitional medical assistance tma federal law permanently requires four months of tma for families who lose medicaid eligibility due to increased child or spousal support collections as well as those who lose eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment congress expanded workrelated tma under section 1925 of the social security act in 1988 requiring states to provide tma to families who lose medicaid for workrelated reasons for at least six and up to 12 months to qualify for tma under section 1925 family must have received medicaid in at least three of the six months preceding the month in which eligibility is lost and have dependent child in the home during the first six months of tma states must provide the same benefits the family was receiving although this requirement may be met by paying familys premiums deductibles coinsurance and similar costs for employerbased health coverage an additional six months of tma for total of up to 12 months is available for families who continue to have dependent child in the home who meet reporting requirements and whose average gross monthly earnings less workrelated child care costs are below 185 of the federal poverty line states may impose premium limit the scope of benefits and use an alternative service delivery system during the second six months of tma although federal statute outlines requirements for tma some states modify these requirements in practice survey of state medicaid directors conducted by the congressional research service crs in july 2002 collected information on tma programs in 46 states although not required by law 12 states provide more than 12 months of tma coverage many states also have policies that modify the three of six months requirement 17 states change reporting requirements 19 states or allow individuals to selfdeclare earnings and child care costs 20 states none of the states have limited the scope of benefits provided during the second six months and three states impose premium states are not required to report tma participation and expenditures separately from other medicaid data but number of states were able to provide these as part of the crs survey since 2001 section 1925 tma requirements have been funded by series of shortterm extensions most recently through june 30 2009 pl 110275 although state childrens health insurance program

assistance tma under medicaid introduction medicaid meanstested federalstate program that provides health care coverage to certain groups of individuals requires that states continue medicaid benefits for certain lowincome families who would otherwise lose coverage because of changes in their income this continuation of benefits is known as transitional medical assistance tma federal law permanently requires four months of tma for families who lose medicaid eligibility due to increased child or spousal support collections it also permanently requires four months of tma for families who lose medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment however congress expanded workrelated tma benefits as part of the family support act of 1988 pl 100485 requiring states to provide at least six and up to 12 months of tma coverage to families losing medicaid eligibility due to increased hours of work or income from employment as well as to families who lose eligibility due to the loss of timelimited earned income disregard such disregards allow families to qualify for medicaid at higher income levels for set period of time1 an additional six months of tma for total of up to 12 months is required for families who meet certain conditions these expanded tma requirements are outlined in section 1925 of the social security act and congress has acted several times to extend them beyond their original sunset date of september 30 1998 most recently tma requirements under section 1925 were extended through june 30 2009 by pl 110275 this report provides an overview of tma while section 1925 of the social security act outlines the provisions requiring states to provide tma for up to 12 months states have considerable flexibility in designing and implementing their tma programs to better understand these programs the congressional research service crs conducted survey of state tma policies in effect on july 1 2002 1 under the aid to families with dependent children afdc program the predecessor to the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program which had direct link to medicaid eligibility states were required to disregard the earnings of recipient family for limited time special rules applied to applicants and child students for the first four months of job less for parttime work the disregard per month was 120 onethird of remaining earnings and actual dependent child care costs up to 175 up to 200 for child under age 2 in months five through 12 the disregard per month was 120 plus dependent care costs after 12 months the disregard per month was 90 plus dependent care costs the intent of these disregards was to allow individuals to remain on cash assistance and medicaid for limited period of time as they transitioned to work crs2 this report summarizes the results of the survey and discusses legislation introduced to extend and in some instances to modify tma family medicaid coverage and cash welfare medicaid is health insurance program jointly funded by the federal government and the states while states have considerable flexibility to design and administer their programs certain groups of individuals must be covered for certain categories of services generally eligibility is limited to lowincome children pregnant women parents of dependent children the elderly and people with disabilities the federal government finances more than half of all medicaid expenditures annually medicaid eligibility under section 1931 as described throughout this report states are required to provide tma to families who lose eligibility for medicaid under section 1931 of the social security act following is description of how medicaid eligibility works for these families prior to the creation of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program individuals qualifying for welfare under the aid to families with dependent children afdc program were automatically eligible for and in most states automatically enrolled in medicaid the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 herein referred to as the welfare reform law formally delinked medicaid and cash assistance and created new medicaid eligibility category for lowincome families under section 1931 of the social security act medicaid entitlement under section 1931 was retained only for individuals who meet the income and resource eligibility standards of their states former afdc program in effect on july 16 1996 herein referred to as eligibility under section 1931 regardless of whether they receive tanf or ever received afdc however states were given flexibility to modify their income and resource eligibility standards for medicaid in three ways 1 states may lower their income standards but not below those used for afdc on may 1 1988 2 states may increase their income and resource standards by an amount that is more than the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi or 3 states may use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those in effect on july 16 1996 since the welfare reform law of 1996 number of states have aligned section 1931 medicaid eligibility with eligibility for tanf and many use less restrictive methods for counting income and resources to allow individuals and families to qualify for medicaid at higher income and resource levels than those in place on july 16 1996 as part of their methodology for determining medicaid eligibility some states have policies in place to disregard portion of earnings or income for limited period of time for example state might disregard the first 120 plus 90 of earnings during familys first four months of section 1931 medicaid coverage after month four the disregard drops to 120 as result the amount family can crs3 earn and still qualify for medicaid is reduced in the fifth month of coverage and beyond2 as shown in figure 1 the medicaid income eligibility threshold for working parent3 applicant in family of three ranged from 280 to 5848 per month as of july 20074 in 10 states working parent applicant in family of three needed income at or below 50 of the federal poverty line fpl to qualify for medicaid5 the same parent could have income between 50 and 100 fpl in 19 states and income above 100 fpl in 22 states including dc in addition to disregarding certain amounts or types of income states may disregard some or all of the value of parents assets when determining eligibility for medicaid as of july 2007 22 states including dc had eliminated their medicaid asset test for parents in contrast 46 states including dc had done so for children6 2 in 2001 the most recent comprehensive data available 36 states including dc did not have timelimited disregard policies for section 1931 coverage meaning that the amount family could earn and still qualify for medicaid would not vary from month to month in the 15 states with these policies the length of the disregard period ranged from four to 12 months see kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured can medicaid work for lowincome working families april 2002 available at httpwwwkfforgmedicaid4032indexcfm 3 although parents and children are eligible for family medicaid coverage under section 1931 number of eligibility pathways with higher income and asset thresholds eg mandatory eligibility for ages 6 and under with family income less than or equal to 133 fpl may be available for children depending on state practices children may be enrolled via these other pathways rather than section 1931 in contrast section 1931 is one of the few medicaid eligibility pathways available for parents and more generally adults who are not pregnant disabled or elderly states that wish to work outside of the regular medicaid rules can do so under waiver see crs report rs21054 medicaid and schip section 1115 research and demonstration waivers by evelyne p baumrucker 4 kaiser

assistance states must provide tma to families losing eligibility for section 1931 medicaid under two scenarios7 first states are required to provide four months of tma coverage to families who lose medicaid eligibility under section 1931 due to increased child or spousal support this provision was included in the child support amendments of 1984 pl 98378 and was made permanent by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 second under section 1902e1 and section 1925 of the social security act states are required to provide tma to families losing section 1931 medicaid eligibility for workrelated reasons states were originally required to provide four months of tma to families losing eligibility due to an increase in hours of work or income from employment however the family support act fsa of 1988 pl 100485 expanded state tma requirements under section 1925 requiring states to provide at least six and up to 12 months of tma coverage to families losing section 1931 medicaid eligibility due to increased hours of work or income from employment as well as to families who lose eligibility due to the loss of time limited earned income disregard fsa originally authorized section 1925 to replace the fourmonth requirement in section 1902e1 through fy1998 however the welfare reform law of 1996 pl 104193 extended section 1925 thorough fy2001 and the provision has continued to exist under series of shortterm extensions most recently through june 30 20098 if section 1925 were allowed to expire9 states would still be required to provide four months of tma to families who lose medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment but not to those who lose eligibility due to the loss of timelimited earnings disregard in addition regardless of activity to extend section 1925 states would still be required to provide four months of tma to families who lose section 1931 eligibility due to increased child or spousal support initial sixmonth period of section 1925 tma coverage under section 1925 of the social security act families losing section 1931 medicaid eligibility due to the loss of timelimited earned income

pl 11048 was enacted in july 2007 it had expired on june 30 and before pl 110275 was enacted in july 2008 it had expired on june 30 crs6 coverage to be eligible federal statute specifies that families must have received medicaid under section 1931 in at least three of the six months preceding their loss of eligibility and have dependent child in the home10 during this initial sixmonth period of tma states must provide families with the same amount duration and scope of benefits offered under section 1931 that is the medicaid coverage the family was previously receiving however states may opt to meet this requirement by using medicaid funds to pay familys premiums deductibles coinsurance and similar costs for employerbased health coverage referred to in statute as wrap around tma may not be terminated during this initial sixmonth period so long as the family continues to have dependent child in the home second sixmonth period of section 1925 tma coverage during the initial sixmonth period states must notify families of the availability of up to six additional months of tma for total of up to 12 months of coverage to maintain eligibility for the second sixmonth period of tma families must report their gross monthly earnings and child care costs in months four seven and 10 of their coverage that is on quarterly basis in addition tma coverage may be terminated during the second sixmonth period if any of the following apply the family ceases to include dependent child the familys average gross monthly earnings less child care costs necessary for employment exceed 185 fpl approximately 2647 for family of three in 2007 the caretaker relative had earnings in one or more of the three previous months unless the state determines that the lack of earnings was due to an involuntary loss of employment illness or other good cause the family fails to file quarterly report or the family fails to pay any required premiums should the state choose to impose them tma enrollment and expenditures while states are required to submit data on their medicaid programs to the department of health and human services hhs they are not required to report tma enrollment and expenditures separately from other medicaid program data in the summer of 2002 the congressional research service crs surveyed state medicaid directors on their tma policies as part of this survey states were asked to report if available monthly enrollment and expenditures for tma for selected months in 2001 these data are provided in table 1 below as table 1 illustrates approximately 682800 individuals in 32 states were enrolled in tma in december 2001 more recent data indicate that as of june 2006 there were approximately 351300 tma enrollees in 15 states whose medicaid 10 families losing eligibility due to increased child or spousal support are eligible for total of four months of tma if they received medicaid under section 1931 in at least three of the six months preceding their loss of eligibility and have dependent child in the home there are additional eligibility requirements for supportrelated tma crs7 enrollment accounted for about 18 of total us medicaid enrollment11 using these figures very rough approximation of us tma enrollment in june 2006 would be 20 million this rough estimate may be inaccurate if the states without tma data differ systematically from the 15 states with tma data eg if they have higher or lower percentage of tma enrollees in their medicaid populations the vast majority of tma enrollees are eligible for workrelated reasons as nearly all states indicated in the crs survey that less than 10 of their tma population lost medicaid eligibility under section 1931 because of an increase in child or spousal support collections table 1 also illustrates that expenditures for the 20 states reporting totaled 6528 million in calendar year 2001 table 1 tma enrollment and expenditures for selected months in

crs survey of state tma policies note na indicates that specific piece of information was not available for the state to provide as part of the crs survey arizona indicated in their survey response that effective july 2001 they had increased their income eligibility standard for medicaid under section 1931 medicaid since this allowed many families to retain section 1931 coverage tma enrollment declined b these states did not provide data as part of the crs survey june and september 2001 data for these states are from kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid program

california indicated in its survey response that in 2000 it expanded its earnings disregards under section 1931 allowing families to remain eligible for longer periods of time and thus keeping tma enrollment low d monthly expenditure data are estimates provided by the state for kentucky dec enrollment represents 18800 recipients individuals and 6500 cases families since data on cases but not recipients were available for june and sept enrollment is estimated using the ratio of recipients to cases in dec f for louisiana monthly enrollment numbers do not include child and spousal support cases g minnesota indicated that june 2001 expenditures are low due to the fact that capitation payments were not made in that month crs9 state tma program policies as table 1 illustrates enrollment and expenditures for tma vary tremendously by state due both to differences in state characteristics such as population size and in medicaid program design as discussed above section 1925 of the social security act requires states to provide up to 12 months of tma to certain families however some states have made considerable efforts to expand and extend their tma programs expansions and extensions of state tma programs have occurred through number of avenues within the states these include waivers of federal requirements also referred to as section 1115 waivers medicaid state plan amendments that expand eligibility under section 1931 through modified income and resource eligibility standards or other means and the use of stateonly funds the july 2002 crs survey asked states to respond to number of questions designed to determine the extent to which states have extended or expanded tma coverage for example several states lengthen the period of medicaid coverage by providing 12month disregard of all earned income at the point when an increase in income jeopardizes their medicaid eligibility under section 1931 this disregard allows the family to retain section 1931 medicaid eligibility for 12 months after the disregard is exhausted at the end of this 12month period families are then eligible for up to 12 months of tma other states extend tma coverage through the use of stateonly funds states also use various options to modify the three of six months requirement for tma as previously discussed federal statute requires that individuals receive medicaid under section 1931 in three of the six months immediately preceding their loss of eligibility in order to qualify for tma however some states will effectively bypass this rule by using earned income disregards for example family whose earnings are low enough to qualify for section 1931 medicaid may see an increase in earnings immediately in months two or three after receiving coverage this increase in earnings may mean that they longer qualify for section 1931 medicaid and they would not qualify for tma because they did not receive medicaid in three of the immediately preceding six months some states would allow this family to remain eligible for medicaid by disregarding all earnings for two months and as result also meet the three of six months requirement for tma other states conduct lookback reviews to provide retroactively coverage to lowincome families who would have qualified under section 1931 medicaid had they applied table 2 below summarizes state responses to the crs tma survey which reflects state policies in effect as of july 1 2002 detailed statebystate information is available in the appendix crs10 table 2 overview of state tma policies policy number of

from the kaiser report b wraparound refers to the state option to use medicaid funds to pay familys premiums deductibles coinsurance and similar costs for employerbased health coverage legislative developments since 2001 section tma requirements under section 1925 of the social security act have been funded by series of shortterm extensions most recently through june 30 2009 pl 110275 in the 109th congress provision to modify section 1925 tma was included in welfare reauthorization bill that saw action but was not adopted in the 110th congress provision to modify and extend section 1925 tma for four years was included in state childrens health insurance program schip reauthorization bill passed by the house hr 3162 but not in the schip bills that were vetoed hr 976 and hr 3963 tma and welfare reauthorization early in the 109th congress the house ways and means subcommittee on human resources favorably reported hr 240 welfare reauthorization bill that would have extended tma under section 1925 through fy2006 with statutory changes the senate finance committee approved its own welfare reauthorization measure s 667 discussed below that would have modified and extended tma through fy2010 ultimately the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 extended tma through calendar year 2006 and provided scaledback version of welfare reauthorization through fy201012 12 see crs report rl33418 welfare reauthorization in the 109th congress an overview by gene falk melinda gish and carmen solomonfears crs11 although welfare reauthorization was achieved through other means s 667 is noteworthy in that it would have provided fiveyear extension of section 1925 tma and given states statutory options for modifying their tma policies as described earlier and shown in table 2 number of states have already implemented changes through other avenues under s 667 states could have opted to provide continuous eligibility for tma for 12 months by waiving quarterly reporting requirements extend coverage for an additional 12 months for total of up to 24 months of tma so long as familys gross monthly earnings less necessary child care costs remained below 185 fpl waive the requirement that family must have received section 1931 medicaid in three of the previous six months to qualify for tma s 667 also would have allowed states to meet section 1925 tma requirements by extending medicaid coverage under section 1931 to families whose gross monthly earnings less necessary child care costs are at or below level that is at least 185 fpl in state choosing this option families whose earnings exceed the eligibility standard for section 1931 medicaid would receive further medical assistance families whose earnings remain at or below the states eligibility standard at least 185 fpl would continue to receive section 1931 medicaid in effect this provision would have prevented states with relatively high section 1931 eligibility standards from having to provide the automatic six months of tma coverage outlined in section 1925 to families whose earnings exceed those relatively high standards it would not have allowed states with lower less than 185 fpl section 1931 eligibility standards to opt out of providing the automatic six months of tma even in cases where family earnings exceed 185 fpl and it still would have required them to provide up to six additional months of tma to families whose earnings remain at or below 185 fpl in addition s 667 would have required states to collect information on average monthly tma enrollment and participation rates for adults and children to make the information publicly available and to and submit the information to the secretary of hhs in turn the secretary of hhs would submit annual reports to congress concerning these rates the bill also would have required administrators within hhs to work together to develop guidance or other technical assistance for states regarding best practices in guaranteeing access to tma finally the bill would have required states to notify all families whose tanf benefits are terminated of their ongoing eligibility for medicaid benefits or if family is longer eligible for medicaid to supply onepage notification describing eligibility and how to apply for medicaid and schip coverage recent action legislation to temporarily extend section 1925 tma through june 30 2009 was enacted at the end of 2007 pl 110275 although reserve funds for tma have been included in recent budget resolutions their deficitneutral crs12 status has meant that offsets or waiver of budget rules might be required for any extension13 although provision to modify and extend tma for four years was included in an schip reauthorization bill passed by the house in 2007 hr 316214 it was not included in the schip bills that were vetoed hr 976 and hr 3963 under hr 3162 states could opt to treat any reference to 6month period or 6 months as reference to 12month period or 12 months for purposes of the initial eligibility period for tma in which case the additional 6month extension would not apply could opt to waive the requirement that family have received medicaid in at least 3 of the last 6 months in order to qualify and would be required to collect and submit to the secretary of hhs and make publicly available information on average monthly enrollment and participation rates for adults and children under workrelated tma and on the number and percentage of children who become ineligible for workrelated tma and whose eligibility is continued under another medicaid eligibility category or who are enrolled in schip in turn the secretary would submit annual reports to congress concerning these rates discussion research shows that lowincome individuals are more likely to be without health insurance than those with higher incomes in 2006 34 of people under age 65 with family incomes below the federal poverty threshold went without health insurance compared to 12 of individuals with incomes at least two times the poverty threshold among lowincome individuals who are working health care coverage is not always available or affordable only 18 of people under age 65 with incomes below the poverty threshold received health care coverage through employment in 2006 compared to 79 of people with incomes of at least two times the poverty threshold15 for lowincome families tma continues health care coverage on temporary basis when they might otherwise lose eligibility for medicaid due to their earned income hours of work or child or spousal support this continuation is especially valuable for parents since income eligibility limits for medicaid coverage of adults who are not pregnant disabled or elderly are quite low in some states as shown in figure 1 and since private health insurance may be unavailable or unaffordable although congress has not yet reached consensus on the future of tma under section 1925 the government accountability office gao and others assert that 13 until 2005 ending with pl 10919 shortterm extensions of section 1925 tma were packaged with tanf and related programs and did not include offsets since then extensions have sometimes occurred through standalone legislation with offsets pl 109 91 pl 11048 pl 11090 and sometimes been packaged in broader legislation pl 109 171 pl 109432 pl 110173

the insured and uninsured populations in 2006 by chris l peterson and april grady crs13 tma can play an important role in supporting lowincome families especially those who are transitioning from welfare to work16 however some have expressed concern that there are families eligible for tma who do not enroll and that programmatic aspects of tma create barriers that prevent individuals from continuing to receive tma once they become eligible for example gao noted in 1999 that quarterly income reporting requirements for tma could pose barriers to family receipt of tma and recommended that the congress consider allowing states to lessen or eliminate these requirements17 16 see us government accountability office medicaid transitional coverage can help families move from welfare to work
