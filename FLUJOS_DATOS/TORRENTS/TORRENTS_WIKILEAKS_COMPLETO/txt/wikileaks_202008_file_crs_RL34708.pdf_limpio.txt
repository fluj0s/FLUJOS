1993 stating that nothing in this act shall be construed as affecting religious accommodation under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964freedom of religion in medical context general constitutiona l and statutory prot ections of religious exercise the first amendment of the us constitution provides that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof1 these clauses are known resp ectively as the establishment clause and the free exercise clause although the us supreme court had historically applied heightened standard of review to government actions that allegedly interfered with persons free exercise of religion2 the court reinterpreted that standard in 1990 since then the cour t has held that the free exercise clause never relieves an individua l of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral law of general applicability3 under this interpretati on the constitutional baseline of protection was lowered meaning that laws that do not specifically target religion or do not allow for individualized assessments are not subject to heightened review under the constitution congress responded to the courts holdi ng by enacting the religious freedom restoration act rfra which statutorily reinstated the standard of protection of heightened scrutiny for government actions interfering with persons free exercise of religion4 when rfra was originally enacted it applied to federal state and local government actions but the supreme court later ruled that its application to state and local governments was unconstitu tional under principl of federalism5 thus the current standard of protection fo r federal government actions that interfere with persons free exercise of religion is the heightened standard of review that is often referred to as strict scrutiny u nder strict scrutiny analysis statute or regulation of general applicability may lawfully burden persons exercise of religion only if it 1 furthers compelling governmental interest and 2 uses the least restrictive means to further that interest6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34708crs3 7 for example two religious affiliations that often

or specific medical procedures7 followers of these religions believe that receiving treatment would violate their firstamendment right to exercise their religion freely this conflict raises the issue known as forced care whether patients can be forced to receive medical care to which they otherwise would object on religi ous grounds legal issues of forced care typically arise in situations where patients lack the capacity to make an informed decision about whether or not to receive care these situ ations often i nvolve patients facing death if they do not receive treatment 8 for example because some religions have specific teachings regarding matters of life and death patient may object to lifesaving treatment on religious grounds ho wever if that patient lacks the capacity to provide informed consent at the time that care would be provided doctor or hospital may not be willing to withhold care based on religious affiliation alone without an informed discussion with the patient federal and state courts ve addressed these issues of forced care for patients with religious objections to medical care caselaw indicates growing willingness of courts over the past several decades to recognize patients religious objections to medical care including lifesaving tr eatments in the 1960s federal court authorized hospital to treat patient with what would be an objectionable procedure under her religion9 the patient faced death without blood transfusion procedure that her religion prohibited but due to em ergency circumstances the hospital staff was unable to determine if the patient wa s making an informed decision when she refused the treatment by the 1980s courts were giving greater weight to patients choices regarding care10 in later cases courts concluded that competent adults with religious objections to procedures cannot be forced to receive care with one court noting that courts should give great ference to the individuals right to make decisions vitally affecting his private life according to his own conscience11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34708crs4 12 state vaccination requirements cent ers for disease control and prevention available at

ark 2002examples of religious exempt ions for heal thcare programs state mandatory vaccination programs as matter of public health all 50 states and the district of columbia have enacted laws requiring vaccination particularly in the contex t of school immunization laws12 these laws have been enacted under rationale of preventing th spread of communicable and debilitating diseases all but two states mississippi and west virginia have enacted religious exemptions for these vaccination programs these exemptions allow students who have religious objections to the vaccinati ons but would otherwise be required to be vaccinated not to comply with the vaccination requirements these exemptions have raised constitutional questions related to free exercise rights with many courts holding that exemptions are not required under the free exercise clause the us supreme court has not ruled directly on the constitutionality of religious exemptions for these vaccination programs however the court has addressed th conflict between public h ealth policies and religious beliefs faced with such conflict between the governments interest in protecting public health and individuals interest in being free to exercise their religious beliefs the court has held in favor of public health concerns13 the implication that public health concerns outweigh the right to exer cise ones religion w ithout interference has led some state supreme courts to hold that mandatory vaccination programs are not violation of religious freedom14 the exemptions have also been challe nged under the establishment clause and equal protection clause allowing an ex emption based on religion might appear to be endorsing religion in violation of the establishm ent clause exemptions that allow certain individuals to claim religious objections to process required for others also may give the appearance of distinct treatment for those individuals who have religious objections in violation of equa l protection doctrine under the first amendment law cannot favor some indi viduals based on thei r religious beliefs15 allowing an exemption based on religion to generally required practice may be construed as special treatment for religious adherents particularly in cases in which the legal provisions limit the scope of the exemption to religious beliefs only that is excluding philosophical beliefs or to members of specific religions only16 because these exemptions seem to make benefit av ailable to religious adherents but not to individuals who are not identified with that group the

members of religious faiths who oppose acceptance of insurance benefits including medical care are generally exempt from selfemployment taxes21 the us supreme court has held that th free exercise clause does not prohibit mandatory payment of social security taxes even when the payment of such taxes or the receipt of the related benefits woul d violate the taxpayers religion in united states v lee selfemployed amish man claimed that paying fica taxes violated his belief in an obligation to provide similar assistance for church members22 lee argued that his religion prohibited him from accepting such benefits from the state or paying taxes to fund the social secur ity system although the court recognized burden on religious belief it held that the burden was justified by the governmental interest in maintaining sound tax syst em and that accommodation of all of the diverse religious beliefs relating to ta xation would pose too great difficulty to maintain functional tax

requires empl oyers to provide health insurance for employees and requires indi viduals to purchase insurance through employers or individually the state provides alternatives for employers and employees to facilitate the process of universal coverage for example employers that do not provide health insurance may in stead pay into the states uninsured care fund and individuals w ho cannot

received medical care during the year in which he claimed an ex emption he is responsible for paying for the care and is subject to penalty ssessed by the commi ssioner of revenue26 constitutional analysis of religious exemptions in mandatory healthcare programs religious exemption provisions in manda tory healthcare programs often raise constitutional issues of religious free dom and equal protec tion any religious exemption must meet the requirements of the first amendments religion clauses which serve as guarantees that individua ls will neither be required to act under prescribed religious belief the establis hment clause nor be prohibited from acting under their chosen religious beliefs the fr ee exercise clause religious exemptions also may raise equal protection issues under the fifth amendment thus constitutional analysis of religious exemptions in mandatory healthcare programs must address two questions 1 whether the constitution requires religious exemption to ensure the free exercise rights of citizens who may have religious objections to mandatory program nd 2 if religious exemption is not constitutionally required but include d nonetheless whether it would be constitutional under the first and fifth amendments does the constitution require religious exemption for mandatory healthcare programs any congressional enac tment regarding mandatory healthcare programs would be subject to constitutional rules and would qualify for review under rfra as federal action that potentially burdens religious exercise thus any legislation that would mandate healthcare pr ogram would be subject to strict scrutiny analysis generally it does not appear that the us constitution requires religious exemption with respect to legislation that creates mandatory healthcare programs but the details of that legislation may impact the analysis under strict scrutiny an exemption would be required only if the government does not have compelling state interest that is achieved by the least restrictive means possible the us supreme court and other lower courts gene rally have allowed federal mandates that relate to public health but nonetheless interfere with re ligious beliefs to continue without exemptions27 in addressing the issue of religious objections to generallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34708crs7 27 continued 1964 28 jacobson v

gibbons v ogden 22 us 1 1824 addressing divisions of federal and state power 32 federal jurisdiction to regulate public he alth derives from the commerce clause us const art i 8 the federal government has had significant role in some public health matters including food safety agencies biomedi cal research programs and health and safety regulatory programsapplicable public health re quirements the supreme cour t has upheld legislative acts that promote public policies relating to public health as valid exercise of protecting the welfare of the people28 the governments interest in protecting public health has been held to outweigh individuals religious interests according to the court the right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death29 the courts decision to hold the interest of public health above the interest of individuals to freely exercise their religious belief was made before the court applied strict scrutiny to religious exercise cases but nonetheless provi des an indication of the nature of the governments interest in pub lic health regulation the c ourt has also held that the governments interest in tax programs used to fund healthcare programs outweighs individuals interests in exercising their religion freely30 the courts treatment of public health as an interest paramount to individual relig ious practice appears to open the door to recognition of public health as compelling state interest under strict scrutiny analysis mere connection to public health is not necessarily enough to find compelling interest some courts have addressed the issues of religious exemptions in the context of certain mandatory hea lthcare programs but the nature of other programs may lead to different outcomes laws that require an affirmative participation in medical procedure eg vaccination differ from laws that require more indirect participation in medical programs eg funding for insurance programs one factor that might affect the outcome of the constitutional analysis is the role the federal government plays in the objective of the program public health has historically been matter of state regulation31 the vaccination laws were enacted under states authority to regulate the public health of their citizens the federal government however does have some authority to act in the realm of public health32 also the actual connection to public health might affect whether the governments interest is compelling for example lthough courts have recognized compelling state interest in statutes preventing the spread of disease it may be more difficult to find compelling state interest in requiring individuals to have health insurance thus the governments interest may va ry depending on the specific requirements imposed by the legislation if the legislation does further compelling governmental interest it must also use the least restrictive means that is the government must make the burden ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34708crs8 33 epperson v arksansas 393 us 97 10304 1968 34 lemon v kurtzman 403 us 602 61213 1971 while the first two prongs of the test are selfexplanatory the thir d prong prohibits an intimate and continuing relationship continuednarrow as possible this test may be met by providing alternative means of compliance with the legislation in the c ontext of the vaccinati on laws for example the government might allow individuals with religious objections to vaccination requirements to be quarantined or isolated to avoid infecting others rather than receive the vaccination in the context of universal healthcare insurance the government might allow an exemption for individuals with religious objections and also allow individuals who objected without qualifying religious reasons to pay into state fund rather than receive insuran ce coverage these types of accommodations may be deemed the least restrictive means of advancing the governments interest because they satisfy both the individuals free exercise of religion and the governments interest in protectin g public health there may be other accommodations that would satisfy the requirement of tailoring the legislation narrowly to meet strict scrutiny requirements thus when determining whether mandatory healthcare program would require religious exemption two factors are critical to the outcome of the analysis first the constitutionality would depend on the nature of the mandatory healthcare program eg whether it is required medical pr ocedure or required payment for an insurance program second the cons titutionality would depend on the structure of the program eg whether the program provides th required participants options with which to comply in order to meet the program objectives these factors would affect the extent of the burden placed on an individuals religious exercise and significantly impact the strict scrutiny analysis does the constitution allow religious exemption for mandatory healthcare programs because legislation that mandates participating in healthcare programs may conflict with religious beliefs c ongress may choose to include an exemption for relevant religious objections even if it is not required the exemption would provide an alternative for certain people based on their religious belief that would not be available to ot her people who do not share that religious belief thus some individuals may cl aim that the exemption violates the establishment clause by providing bene fit to groups based on religion and the equal protection clause by providing for disparate treatment of separate groups the establishment clause prohibits preferential treatment of one religion over another or preferential treatment of religion ge nerally over nonreligion33 providing an exemption based on religion may be cons trued as favoring pa rticular religion or religion generally because only individuals with religious affiliation would be eligible for the exemption however the mere f act that law addr esses religion does not automatically make that law unconstitutional under establishment clause analysis government action must meet threepart test known as the lemon test to meet the lemon test law must 1 have secular purpose 2 have primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion nd 3 not lead to excessive entanglement with religion34 the supreme court has upheld relig ious exemptions for governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34708crs9 34 continued between government and religion as the result of the law id at 62122 the continuing viability of lemon has been unclear as the court has ra ised questions regarding its adequacy in analyzing these issues see eg county of allegheny v amer ican civil liberties union 492 us 573 1989 35 the court in locke v davey 540 us 712 2004 recognized that some government actions that allow free exercise consequently raise questions of establishment noting that there was room for play in the joints in this intersection of the religion clauses 36 see sherr v northporteast northport union free school district 672 f supp 81 8990 edny 1987 37 see mccarthy v boozman 212 fsupp 2d 945 wd ark 2002programs where the exemptions were enacted to prevent government interference with religious exercise35 like the analysis under the free exerci clause the constitutionality of religious exemption under the lemon test would depend on the language of the exemption exemptions that are specifically available onl to certain religions have been construed in some cases as vi olation of the establishment clause36 however providing an exemption that does not specify certain religions as eligible may not pass the lemon test either generally available religious exemption may be construed as violation of the establishm ent clause because it provides preferential treatment to individuals with religious be liefs but does not provide individuals who might object on philosophical grounds to claim the exemption37 thus there does not appear to be clear consensus regarding the constitutionality of religious exemptions under the establishment clause the concerns of preferential treatment fo r certain groups of individuals that lead to establishment clause questions also raise questions under the equal protection clause the equal protection clause prevents the government from treating some groups of individuals differently than othe r groups of individuals if the disparate treatment results from suspect classifi cation the equal prot ection clause may be violated typically courts have recognized groups identified by r ace national origin or alienage as suspect classifications in the context of religious exemptions the group being treated differently is group th at might be based on religion or might be based on nonreligion often courts decide cases alle ging disparate treatment involving religion under the first amendment rather than equal protection thus equal protection jurisprudence does not appear to have addressed religious discrimination to significant extent courts have generally held that laws that treat groups of individuals differently becau of some animus would be suspect classifications that would be subject to strict scrutiny thus it appears that the analysis under the doctrine of equal prot ection likely would not produce different outcome than the analysis that woul d be used under the first amendment
