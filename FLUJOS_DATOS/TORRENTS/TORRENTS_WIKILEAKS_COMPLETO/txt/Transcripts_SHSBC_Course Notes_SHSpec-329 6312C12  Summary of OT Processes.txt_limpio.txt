6312c12 shspec329 summary of ot processes this is fast and rapid summary of ot processes this is matter of record not so much matter of education this gives the record of the final technology of bank running which is now complete and unvarying the technology is very precise it is extremely crisp you do not vary from it some pcs become fixated on parts of the bank and argue with you about structure for instance seeing two ris the pc may think that he has two and only two gpms there are variations as far as which implants someone could have someone might not have the helatrobus implants for instance but everyone on this planet has the train implant there is whole set of implants around trillions 2 which are similar to the helatrobus implants and for which we dont have the pattern you can get variations at level v but none at level vi or the person wouldnt be here one person has not made different types of actual gpms than another you dont get variations at level vi but lack of data and an overburdened case could bring about an apparent difference in the case the differences are only mistakes made by the auditor andor the pc every actual gpm is similar to every other actual gpm in basic composition see fig 23t the goal as an ri is always the first ri in the bank it then runs on up the line on solve basis not on an oppose basis each item is problem with its opposite item going on up the bank but those masses are actually very huge spheres they are all the accumulated energies that anyone ever had anything to do with on this particular subject they have been lived through and they have been accumulated now an actual gpm has varying numbers of ris on the middle track the gpms have 16 to 18 ris in them late on the track closer to pt they go to 22 to 24 ris each one has crossover the middle pair of ris if gpm has 20 ris at number ten you will generally get the crossover the crossover is very important that is where the pc ceases to be for the goal and starts to be against it on the oppterm side you get progression up through the crossover point from the bottom oppterm which is dead opposed to the goal to the top oppterm which is dead for the goal and on the terminal side you have the goal as an ri at the bottom and it progresses up to the crossover for the goal and then on gradient scale goes against the goal the top terminal of actual gpm is dead against the goal if the goal were to be strong the top terminal would be something like weak or being weak that pattern has to be understood or the pc will get in trouble the patterns are all similar matter what the gpms position on the time track is as you go earlier on the track however there is this change you get more items for the goal ie the crossover point drifts higher but the position of the crossover is also monitored by whether the pc as thetan liked the goal or not the crossover would occur very near the bottom of gpm whose goal the pc detests eg to be obedient you can have the crossover appear almost at the goal on goal that the pc detests perhaps in the first couple or three pairs but this is not an important eccentricity dont be alarmed by it that is the only variation in crossover another variation in actual gpms is that earlier on the track the time span for gpm is longer eg modern gpm could span only billion years an early gpm could span trillions 20 to trillions 30 years there are about as guess 26 gpms in bank very few the closesttopt gpm can be expected to be truncated which makes it difficult to enter the track because the pt gpm may have any number of items in it in case analysis you can only count on what blows down the ta the emeter is not wholly reliable here the meter is only of relative use if all is perfectly correct on the meter you have chance of being right gpm when found will read if not forever it does give you nice long rocket reads and blowdowns when you find it but dont expect it to read forever figure 23 structure of an actual gpm graphics inserted now the pt gpm being truncated will have less than full complement of ris which makes it hard to find its top the present gpm has some top short of total attainment of the goal on the oppterm side and short of total opposition to the goal on the terminal side how short is the pt gpm dont cut your throat if you find after 75 hours that it only had two ris or if you find that it is really the second gpm and is there in full you may not find out that this is the case until you reach the eighth gpm you cannot be sure that you have the pt gpm or any other particular gpm you do the best you can and always suspect that there are more ris into pt once the thing can be repaired and you are getting charge off all the way it is not fatal to make mistakes in doing this but dont underestimate the ability of these processes to nearly kill the pc if mishandled say you skipped two gpms and started to run out the one below it the pc would feel like hell pc never feels worse than on r4 done wrong but he can live through it it is the auditor who is in danger wrongly worded gpm will shut off the rr the pt gpm is the one you are working for but it may not show up until you have run an earlier gpm the programming is done only one way in running these things that is you find the pt gpm you find its top terminal you list the top terminal for two items the first oppterm and the second oppterm from the second oppterm you get the solves it by asking who or what would it solve and you go on down the bank so it is always the same you find the pt gpm you run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm and get its top oppterm and then run all items out of it and find the next gpm etc until you get to the beginning of the time track you can cut in and find the second gpm first by accident and find out later on that it is the second gpm and then by doing goal oppose of it you can find the actual first gpm but that is at the risk of the game that is just fixing mistake properly you find the pt gpm or something that you could believe was the pt gpm you then run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm you get its top oppterm and run all items out of it then you go on down the bank to the beginning of track and that is the only program that is successful taking any gpm that fires and then trying to goaloppose it to pt is not hard to do it is impossible you end up with messedup track you do this same program on every case including cases that have had goals found and run out in various ways you start with listing for the pt gpm what is your present time actual gpm this can be long list it follows goals list format when you get fifty items past the last rr seen on listing and you are getting ta while listing the gpm is on that list somewhere and you find it by elimination this sounds impossible but this pattern has been successful whenever tried pcs come up with the pt gpm every time of course it has to be an educated pc if not you dont have prayer it takes terrific stability on the part of the pc to hang in there when things get tight an untrained person wouldnt stand for it it is not that he couldnt be gotten into it but he will panic when things go wrong and he feels terrible he wont have the security of knowing that he can get out of what he got into it is basically understanding that will carry him through here is tabulated summary of the r4 procedure as outlined in this tape 1 do pt goals list and get goal list for the pt gpm using what is your present time actual gpm you use goalslisting procedure that is you list fifty items past the last rr seen on listing if the ta is all run out then the list is complete you then find the item by elimination 2 try to count the number of ris in the pt gpm then plot it up accordingly and observe where the top of this gpm sits in relation to the crossover point eg say youve got 12 ris then you know that the top pair is one pair past crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal 3 find the top terminal by listing what terminal are you sitting in now 4 list two lists from this same top terminal to get the top oppterm and the second oppterm of this truncated gpm charge will expire on the top oppterm so then you will get the second oppterm because that is the way the pattern progresses going down into the bank after getting the top oppterm list ww wd solve top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm see fig 24 5 solve this across and continue to the bottom of the gpm 6 do goaloppose list to find the goal of the second gpm using goalslisting procedure 7 take the goal as an ri from the pt gpm and list who or what would it solve to find the top oppterm of the second gpm 8 take this top oppterm and list who or what would solve the top oppterm to get the top terminal of the second gpm 9 solve it across to get the second oppterm of the second gpm 10 run all the items out of that gpm in similar manner and continue on down the bank using steps 6 to 10 above to the beginning of the track figure 24 running the top of the present time actual gpm it is the pc who comes up with the answers he finds out what is going wrong if you can get off any bpc he will start giving you some good data about what has gone wrong eg the pcs next gpm is found but wont read so gpm has been missed there is so much inval on the goal that it reads as wrong goal so the pc says that some inval is present so the auditor prepchecks the goal and on the rocket read comes and off they go but repair is too complex to do without help from the pc however pc can sell an item and if the auditor buys it it can land the pc in the soup also if the rr doesnt pack up in the first five items down the bank dont let the pc sell you on the idea that it is wrong goal wrongly worded or misworded lrh once let pc sell him on the idea that goal was wrong goal he listed and found two new goals without realizing that the pc had merely gotten into dramatization of one of the items of the goals gpm and therefore so despised this goal that the pc wanted nothing to do with this goal rule if it is running all right keep running dont make trouble until trouble happens since it is trouble that consumes session time take up trouble as it comes if the pc does get in trouble dont try to force the pc on stop and find out what is wrong and fix it otherwise you can invalidate goals and items and make them read like wrong goals and items the read you get on listing actual gpm items and goals is like nothing you have seen elsewhere it is not an rr and it is not fall and it is not anything else you have seen elsewhere tick will never be the item the real item hits rubber bumper and forces its way through like breaking through stone wall and then falls on through to bd these are item reads only an item read looks that way nothing else does it goes the whole dial and brings about blowdown the rule in itemfinding is to list as long as the pc wants to list and then find the item on the early part of the list that has variation the item could be wrongly worded early on the list and reappear correctly worded later on the list so that it looks as though it actually appears later on the list the item lists are short especially compared to most goals lists you might have shorter goals lists however when the pc gets pretty educated he can spot the goal right away the meter blows up heat comes off etc etc here is an example of an lrh bank the goaloppose question who or what would destroy oppose gave the next goal which was to worship to create was rocketreading implant gpm worship had nothing to do with religion it was too early the earlier you go on the track the simpler and more direct the goals and items are as you go later the items get more dispersive and complicated items like certainty and predictability and solved by unpredictability it will be less neat pattern the thetan is thinking more complexly more involvedly he is in more dispersed state on the middle and back track the thetan is simpler as you get back to the middle track word like the goal appears in 80 of the items on earlier track word with the sense of the goal appears in almost 100 of the items close to pt you get tremendous variation in items and more complex goals that are hard to get oppositions to with the goal almost never appearing in the items the hard end of the track is the pt end the thetan has less scope the gap is less wide between opposites there is more dispersion the thetan is nattery picky and so forth you can see the dwindling spiral of the thetan as you look over these gpms the chances are far against getting simple goals in pt middle track goals are simple when you get two or three gpms back you start getting simpler goals on the middle track for instance you get goals like to do to think to postulate in later gpms there are more items and greater complexity the items disperse more quickly from the basic goal area as was said earlier the goal word appears less frequently in the items but the pattern doesnt change the top oppterm is definitely the goal and the top terminal is definitely against the goal the hard things to list are the top terminal and the bottom oppterm thats shootin into the blue the top terminal is very often but not always controlled by the goal that you are about to get ie the next goal up the top terminal may or may not be similar to the next goal it could be quite disrelated you can get fooled here the pattern might not hold eg the next goal might be the goal to postulate and the top terminal might be sitting you cant predict the top terminal except that it is opposite to the goal of the gpm that it is in the bottom oppterm is the reason he done it of course the real reason he done it is the gpm he just lived through but his particular penchant is usually expressed in the bottom oppterm because it is opposed by the goal as an ri the bottom oppterm is going to say what the person is mad at in the pt gpm like civilization or financial institutions this one is hard to get so the pc might miss it like mad the two bottom oppterms and the two top terminals in the gpm forecast some difficulty the toughest to get are the bottom oppterm and the top terminal how do you list one of these things first do your pt goals list and get goal then try to count the number of ris in that gpm the presumptive pt gpm then plot it up accordingly observe where it sits in relation to where the crossover point is say youve got twelve ris so you know that you are one pair past the crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal you can get the top terminal of the pt gpm by listing what terminal are you sitting in now if you want to ask why dont you list for the top oppterm it is the same as asking why dont you try to list the bank its the same question the pc doesnt know whats there relative to the top oppterm but he is sitting in and intimately connected with as himself this top terminal because that is the one that he is living through life in therefore it is easy to list for the top terminal so list for the top terminal and find it then list two lists from this same top terminal and get 1 the top oppterm 2 the second oppterm you are able to do this because charge will expire on the top oppterm when you have found it and therefore there wont be any more charge on this oppterm you then get the second oppterm because that is the way the bank progresses going down into the bank see fig 24 gpms always proceed downwards from the top oppterm why this pattern for running the gpm because if you get this higgledypiggledy in the first gpm you are going to be kittycorner from the oppterm to the next terminal below it and that doesnt solve the bank doesnt run that way and it doesnt solve that way and you will be in trouble so you get the two top oppterms 1 and 2 sometimes you almost wreck yourself by getting both oppterms on the same list both firing but you really need two listings so you can tell which is which so after getting the top oppterm do who or what would solve the top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm solve it across and go on down the bank that way see fig 24 now items always solve goals always oppose never do goals solve list eg what goal would solve goal the goal as an ri sounds like goal but it is an item and that would be an item solve list for the next lower top oppterm so after you get the whole of the top bank now do goaloppose list to get the goal of the 2 gpm you now assess by elimination to get that goal thats the end of all oppositions until you are up to the point of getting the goal for the next gpm but you still have an unsolved ri which is the goal as an ri at the bottom of the top gpm opposing the goal as an ri is the most critical action in the whole operation take the goal as an ri and list who or what would it solve and get the top oppterm of the next gpm using nice beefy long list on this one that is the touchiest part of the bank if you get it wrong it will be wrong from then on out if you get wrong top oppterm you will go all over the place you will have the wrong gpm it is also the easiest to get wrong because it looks the simplest the top oppterm is the final achievement of the goal that you have just gotten from the goaloppose list the pc is now against it eg on goal to sneeze the top oppterm would be sneezing or people who sneeze or sneezers or having to sneeze etc if you get the top oppterm slightly misworded you have had it so do nice long top oppterm list you want 20 or 30 item list so dont take an item as the top oppterm just on the pcs sayso you can tangle the whole bank dont promote the pcs itsa on this one if you buy the pcs delighted itsa you are likely to get the third terminal from the bottom and get the whole bank upside down the other place where you disregard the pcs itsa is when you are halfway through gpm with the rr still on and he tells you that it is not his goal so get the list on listing for the top oppterm null it with the pcs attention on it ask which item had heat look around the area of that item on the list especially few items above the item that he mentioned see if you can get that area to read get the top oppterm and check it out mow be very careful when you get the top terminal the wording is critical the terminal has an opposite meaning to the bank at large when you have the two top ris make sure that both of them are absolutely correct before you go on the alternative is to get circular invalidation going where you are leaving wrong items behind you and listing from wrong items correcting and going ahead into messedup areas as you correct one item another gets messed up when you find wrong item behind you accept items that you found after you found the wrong item redo all the later lists the way you check out bank when looking for wrong item is to go back over it from the top reading the items off with mathematical precision with the session ruds in the wrong item that you left behind you will tick or rocketread that is proven rule if it reads it is wrong item invariably it is not that it wasnt opposed being wrong it reads and throws into question all succeeding items any items that occur after that if they are right are so merely by coincidence so you have to list again through muddiedup bank to correct the wrong item take the list you got it from and look earlier or later if it was the first or second item on the list or the list could be incomplete but two items reading in the same items list means nothing listing rules dont apply to items lists listing rules apply to goals lists and only to goals lists you can have six items reading on an item solve list and it doesnt mean that the list is incomplete one of the six reading items is the item and you dont continue the list on wrong goal everything you write down reads for awhile then nothing reads the only thing that shuts off an rr is wrong goal wrong item will not do so you can overrun the gpm and run into gpm for which you have goal the only thing that shuts off an rr is not having the goal what shuts down the rr is not having the goal and this is the only way to shut off an rr even slightly misworded goal will turn it off so if the rr continues youve got the right goal so relax and once you get your goal dont call it again until you get to the goal as an ri refer to it by number and dont use the wording how does this ri relate to the goal use how does this ri relate to this gpm or to gpm _______ the reason for this is that every time you call the goal you pull the goal as an ri up towards pt and disarrange the bank you save it so that if you have to use it later to prepcheck off inval in straightening things out you can or you might want to save it for use in later cleanup even then you still say the goal as little as possible if you are prepchecking gpm goal use on this goal dont keep repeating the goal as this will drive the pc to the bottom of the gpm there are lots of things to know lots of indicators but only few simple rules and they are dead on for instance you ask is this an actual gpm after you have found the goal you always check it out when you have run five or six gpms you get response on the meter until the pc says it then it reads as you go down the bank the items will read when the pc says it not when you call it at first when the case is unburdened with r3sc etc the subitsa comes up towards the surface however further on down the line you lose the subitsa again the subitsa line reverses with the itsa line eventually basic auditing must be very well in and the pc must be easily auditable youve got to promote his confidence and itsa so that when you run out of the emeter the pc can handle it youve got to be able to talk to the pc and the pc has to be able to talk to you because in few cases itsa is all that you will have to guide you through the only thing that makes bad basic auditor is person who is afraid of becoming ot or who sees great deal of harm in being exteriorized or in being set adrift alone without body or the idea of setting people adrift or alone without body restimulates all those people that they have held down and stuck spears in the stomachs of that is exteriorization too someone whose basic auditing is poor at levels ii iii or iv will have it fly out at upper levels because he gets so restimulated at the idea of exteriorizing exterization restimulates murder so you get the idea that he doesnt deserve to be clear etc dont look for the significance to explain fear or terror of exteriorization it is just gpms shifting around and colliding caused by the thought of exteriorizing you can set someone up so they will do flawless basic auditing for one session by running ow this shows that they consider auditing to be an overt this was first tested in melbourne in 1960 there are arc breaky pcs there are only bad basic auditors the pc who is dangerous is the one who goes into propitiation or lower when arc broken such pc is harder to handle than one who screams any pc audited beyond an arc break will go into the sad effect you could audit the auditor on ow for short session and he would give flawless sessions this is very important tape the exact patter is on the demo tape of last wednesday probably 6312c04 shspec326 tvd 24 basic auditing pp 551552 above lrh also mentions color movie with all the tech in this area and the area of gpms
