1 two letters on zuma and the arms deal january 11th 2008 by terry the arms deal hots up and the zuma camp inquiry will help to bring it to the boil here are two letters i recently sent to the papers neither was published but i think the earlier one listed second below might have helped inspire the editorial leader in yesterdays business day click here to read it 7 jan 2008 thank you gerald shaw if zuma trial erupts in crisis lets face it now january 7 for setting out the disastrous consequences that would follow were the charges against jacob zuma to be withdrawn yet zuma is just small fish in the arms deal saga who is being scapegoated to divert attention from president thabo mbekis much greater culpability mbeki intervened irregularly as early as 1995 in swinging the warship contracts to the germans and compounded his improper behaviour in 1998 by intervening on behalf of thomson csf he then lied about legal opinion when he fired judge willem heath in january 2001 and later that year interfered unconstitutionally in the joint investigating team report with massive abuse of his office whilst attempting to cover up his role in the scandal mbeki has regularly blasted arms deal critics as racists who are telling blatant lies predictably his own behaviour has come back to haunt him the arms deal is now under investigation in eight countries plus the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the british government has admitted that bribes were paid to secure baes warplane contracts with south africa those bribes are estimated at gbp 112 million r16 billion thyssen krupp also admits it paid bribes to secure the german warship contracts in addition there are the bribes agusta paid for the italian helicopter contracts the bribery clauses in those contracts authorise our government summarily to cancel the contracts and even to claim compensation just why have those clauses not been invoked to cancel the arms deal except that the anc which few years ago was bankrupt now has investments worth r175 billion where did that money come from the national prosecuting authority has at last charged zuma with corruption fraud money laundering racketeering and tax evasion will it now prove and confirm its own incorruptibility by charging mbeki on similar charges plus additional charges of deliberate and systematic obstruction of justice we have come long way since 1998 when i requested the british government to investigate whether bae was bribing tony yengeni and other anc politicians the response then was that it was not illegal in england to bribe foreigners british ngos have successfully initiated legal action against former prime minister tony blair and former attorney general lord goldsmith for their roles and complicity in baes saudi arabian scandal that case is scheduled to come to court within month and will reverberate around the world including south africa as shaw rightly argues the seeds have been sown for destruction of our young democracy if the president is beyond the rule of law 3 jan 2008 hurrah that the national prosecuting authority has at last charged jacob zuma with corruption fraud money laundering racketeering and tax evasion zuma is nonetheless just small fish in the scandal who wasnt even national politician during 19941999 when the arms deal decisions were made will the npa now confirm and prove its own incorruptibility by charging thabo mbeki alec erwin and trevor manuel on similar charges plus additional charges of deliberate and systematic obstruction of justice they not zuma were the cabinet subcommittee that rammed through the arms deal contracts over civil society and other objections the impression otherwise is that zuma is being scapegoated by the npa to divert attention from mbekis much greater culpability the british government has admitted that bribes were paid to secure the bae warplane contracts but extraordinarily pleads that those bribes were within acceptable limits those acceptable bae bribes are estimated at gbp 112 million r16 billion in addition thyssen krupp admits that it paid bribes to secure the warship contracts but arrogantly declares that it was then not illegal in germany to bribe foreigners there are also the bribes agusta paid for the italian helicopter contracts it is however illegal in south africa both then and now to accept bribes from either foreigners or locals and south african law has established that bribors and bribees are equally guilty the bribery clauses in those contracts authorise our government summarily to cancel the contracts and even to claim compensation just why have those clauses not been invoked to cancel the arms deal mbeki intervened irregularly as early as 1995 in swinging the warship contracts to the germans and compounded his improper behaviour in 1998 by intervening on behalf of thomson csf he then lied about legal opinion when he fired judge willem heath in january 2001 and later that year intervened unconstitutionally in the joint investigating team report virtually each paragraph of which finds that that the arms deal contracts were riddled by tendering irregularities erwin and the late joe modise concocted the economic idiocy in violation of section 217 of the constitution that expenditure of r30 billion on armaments would magically generate r110 billion in offsets to create over 65 000 jobs they overruled the then secretary for defence who rightly objected that offsets are illegal manuel in 2000 signed the 20 year foreign loan agreements that give effect to the arms deal far exceeding his authority as set out in section 71 of the public finance management act and in so doing has sold the country to barclays bank and commerzbank his own department had warned him and his cabinet colleagues that the arms deal was highly risky proposition that would lead the government into mounting fiscal economic and financial difficulties international investigations and revelations in eight countries plus the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd in coming months will expose the anc leadership as gang of criminals who willfully and deliberately betrayed the struggle against apartheid the corner house and campaign against arms trade in england have successfully initiated legal action against former prime minister tony blair and former attorney general lord goldsmith for their roles and complicity in bae bribes of gbp 1 billion to saudi prince bandar that may be scant consolation to mbeki who year ago angrily described blair as hypocrite we have come long way since 1998 when allegations about bribes to tony yengeni first surfaced and civil society is now rightly holding corrupt politicians such as blair and mbeki to account mbeki has regularly blasted arms deal critics as racists who are telling blatant lies much more than meaningful apology and cancellation of the arms deal contracts is now due mbeki erwin and manuel must resign forthwith rather than compound and prolong the constitutional crisis for which they with their arms deal bear primary responsibility of course they are unlikely to do so in which case zumas supporters will understandably hang them out to dry over the next 15 months can south africas still fragile constitutional democracy survive such abuse 2 manuel sold the country to barclays bank and commerzbank december 27th 2007 by terry how appropriate it would be for trevor manuel to be the first senior ministerial casualty of the polokwane conference manuel has been disastrous finance minister in cabinet filled by incompetent and dysfunctional ministers south africa has 40 percent unemployment on his watch our public schools and hospitals are in chaos almost 1 000 south africans are dying daily of aidsrelated causes the reason given repeatedly until very recently was the lack of financial resources the arms deal is the core reason for the polokwane upheavals which rightly has haunted thabo mbekis presidency manuels role in this debacle was pivotal first in its affordability and secondly in its funding the arms deal affordability study prepared by manuels own department warned him and his cabinet colleagues that the arms deal was highly risky proposition that would lead the government into mounting fiscal economic and financial difficulties those warnings were recklessly ignored and overruled our balance of trade is in record deficit inflation is rising and there is real prospect that south africa will be battered by financial crisis in 2008 the 20 year foreign loan agreements signed by manuel which give effect to the warship and warplane contracts are textbook example of third world debt entrapment by european banks and governments yet in violation of the public finance management act these agreements have never been referred to parliament for authority wonder there are riots all over south africa protesting the mbeki governments failure to deliver manuel sold the country to barclays bank and commerzbank which with the sycophantic financial industry and media plus manuels personal spin doctoring still lauds his brilliance instead of vetoing the arms deal which was his constitutional obligation to the people of south africa manuel prostituted himself for the sake of political perks and power the anc was technically bankrupt just few years ago it now boasts investments worth r175 billion it is past time the anc opened its books to public investigation of whether arms deal and related kickbacks are the source of its new wealth and whilst the mbeki clique ponders whether to resign after polokwane the urge to charge jacob zuma with corruption will also backfire spectacularly zuma was very small fish in the arms deal fiasco mbeki not only chaired the cabinets arms deal subcommittee but actively and irregularly intervened to swing the warship contracts to the german frigate corsortium corvettes thabo all at sea weekend argus may 21 1995 thyssen krupp even admits that it paid bribes to secure those contracts and brazenly pleads that it was then not illegal in germany to bribe foreigners neither mbeki nor manuel were charged with corruption yours faithfully terry crawfordbrowne an edited version of this letter originally appeared in the cape argus
