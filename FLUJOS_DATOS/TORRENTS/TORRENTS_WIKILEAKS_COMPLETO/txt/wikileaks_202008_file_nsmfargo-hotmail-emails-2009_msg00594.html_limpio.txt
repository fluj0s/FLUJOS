nsm broke another record this weekend by enlisting more recruits in one weekend than ever before not only did we enlist solid group of new members in missouri this weekend but new recruits from other parts of the nation also joined the ranks there is so much i could say about how well the entire event went this past weekend in mo from the march to the swastika lighting to the feast the whole atmosphere and our folk in general furthermore the texas troops took to the streets proving that the nsm has enough troops to spread out our forces the nsm is now stronger than ever as recent events

712 pm sc boswell nsm88_missouriyahoocom wrote the rally at the state capitol building in jefferson city mo was huge success as 63 of us took to the streets for our families folk and nation some comrades had come as much as week early to help us with last minute preparations but they started arriving in force on thursday and friday thursday and friday were taken up with media interviews and last minute preparations then friday night we went on flyer run about 1200 flyers were dropped in and around columbia congratulations and job well done to those that participated saturday was the rally we formed up at parking garage and then marched the Â½ mile from the governors mansion to the capitol steps we were met by sparse protestors of the most pathetic greasiest kind along the way two androgynous peace lovers showed their love for humanitarian ideals by spitting at us they were chased down by the police and arrested for assault and resisting arrest at the capitol we had speeches bringing our message of america for americans to the people of missouri the protestors who had vowed to shut us down numbered considerably less than 50 fags drug addicts child molesters race traitors and other assorted commie trash it was the most pathetic pitiful display of opposition i have ever seen braving cold temperatures and brutal wind we stayed for over an hour taking stand for our nation and race afterwards we retired to private land for ceremonies first we had promotions congratulations to all those receiving promotions they are welldeserved for all your hard work next was the book burning the place of honour went to particular issue of the kansas city mo commie rag that was dedicated to exposing one of our comrades thereby putting him his wife and kids in danger also being purged was copy of the anne frank diary and jew flag donated by commander and his wife after break we paid homage to the martyrs of national socialism and then lit the swastika cross and life rune nothing is so beautiful as lit swastika lighting up the night sky dispelling ignorance and our spiritual slavery and calling to arms all of our racial comrades to defence of our folk this was followed by feast the next day in honour of our blood martyrs ham turkey sweet potatoes and all the trimmings were enjoyed by all in attendance sending them off with note of camaraderie and hopefully reflection on the importance of the date and the amount of sacrifice others have given for us november 9th is the second most auspicious day in the national socialist calendar for good reason on nov 9th 1923 sixteen men gave their lives for their nation race and freedom how much can we give adolf hitler said when human hearts break and human souls despair then from the twilight of the past the great conquerors of distress and care of disgrace and misery of spiritual slavery and physical compulsion look down upon them and hold out their eternal hands to the despairing mortals woe to the folk that is ashamed to grasp them surely if these men can sacrifice their lives for us we can sacrifice few luxuries for our future generations special thanks goes to many many people too many to name i would however like to thank the women for all the work with the food and cleaning up and merchandise i would also like to especially thank ssgt drake for all her hard work and thanks to nsm missouri for all their work in preparing for this event thank you to everybody who came out and braved the cold weather for making this event such success we will see what we can do about the cold next time
