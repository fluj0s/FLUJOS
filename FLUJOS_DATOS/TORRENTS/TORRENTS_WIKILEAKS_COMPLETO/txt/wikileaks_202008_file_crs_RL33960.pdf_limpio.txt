educational and related services to lowachieving and other pupils attending prekindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of pupils from lowincome families it has also become vehicle to which number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public k12 education for all pupils have been attached as condition for receiving title ia grants title ia funds are allocated by the us department of education ed to state educational agencies seas which then suballocate grants to leas it is one of the few federal k12 formula grant programs for which substate grants are in most cases calculated by ed portions of each annual appropriation for title ia are allocated under four different formulasbasic concentration targeted and education finance incentive grantsalthough funds allocated under all of these formulas are combined and used for the same purposes by recipient leas although the allocation formulas have several distinctive elements the primary factors used in all four formulas are estimated numbers of chil dren aged 517 in poor families plus state expenditure factor based on average expenditures per pupil for public k12 education other factors included in one or more formulas include weighting schemes designed to increase aid to leas with the highest concentrations of poverty and factor to increase grants to states with high levels of expenditure equity among their leas each formula also has lea hold harmless provision lea may receive less than 8595 of its previous year grant depending on the leas poverty rate and state minimum grant provision up to either 025 or 035 of state grants depending on the formula within leas title ia funds are used to provide supplementary educational services to pupils at public schools with the highest percentages or numbers of children from lowincome families as well as eligible pupils who live in the areas served by these public schools but who attend private schools 3 while there are several program rules related to school selection the participating schools must generally have percentage or number of children from lowincome families that is greater than the leas average leas can generally choose to focus title ia services on selected grade levels eg only in elementary schools but they must usually provide services in all schools without regard to their grade level where the percentage of pupils from lowincome families is 75 or more once schools are selected title ia funds are allocated among them on the basis of their number of pupils from lowincome families there are two basic types of title ia programs schoolwide programs are authorized if the percentage of lowincome pupils served by school is 40 or higher in schoolwide programs title ia funds may be used to improve the performance of all pupils in school for example funds might be used to provide professional development services to all of schools teachers upgrade instructional technology or implement new curricula the other major type of title ia 3 although title ia funds are used to serve eligible private school pupils funds remain under the control of public school authoritiesie they are not transferred to private schools

the original type of title ia program under which title iafunded services are generally limited to the lowest achieving pupils in the school for example pupils may be pulled out of their regular classroom for several hours of more intensive instruction by specialist teacher each week or they may receive such instruction in an afterschool program or funds may be used to hire teachers aide who provides additional assistance to low achieving pupils in their regular classroom according to data for the 20022003 school year the latest currently available 54 of schools receiving title ia operated schoolwide programs and these schools served 84 of all participating pupils4 number of major accountability requirements apply to public schools in state that participates in the title ia program participating states5 must administer annual standardsbased assessments in reading and mathematics to pupils in each of grades 38 plus at least once in grades 1012 beginning with the 20072008 school year such assessments must also be administered to pupils in each of three grade levels 35 69 and 1012 in science pupil performance standards for all required assessments must establish at least three performance levels advanced proficient and basic the state assessments must meet variety of criteria regarding accommodations for pupils with disabilities and lep pupils and linkages between state content standards pupil performance standards and assessments participating states must also administer annual assessments of english language proficiency to all of their lep pupils and participate in national assessment of educational progress naep tests of 4 th and 8th grade pupils in reading and math every two years states participating in title ia must use results of the required reading and math assessments to make annual adequate yearly progress ayp determinations ayp standards must be applied to all public schools leas and to states overall however under the esea consequences for failing to meet ayp standards need only be applied to schools and leas participating in title i and consequences for states as whole are limited to potential identification and provision of technical assistance ayp is defined primarily on the basis of the percentage of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level of achievement ayp standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator in the case of high schools this must be the graduation rate ayp calculations must be disaggregatedthat is determined separately for several demographic groups as well as for an all pupils group the specified groups include economically disadvantaged pupils lep pupils pupils with disabilities and pupils in major racial and ethnic groups however pupil groups need not be considered if their number is so small that results would not be statistically significant or the identity of pupils might be divulged minimum group size in order to make ayp at least 95 of pupils overall and 95 of each demographic group must participate in assessments schools or leas meet ayp standards only if they meet the required threshold levels of performance on assessments other academic indicators and test participation with respect to all of the designated pupil groups that meet the minimum group size criterion selected by the state the primary structure for ayp determination under the esea applies the same required threshold level of achievement to all pupils and schools statewide status model the esea also includes safe harbor provision under which ayp may be met by pupil group if it experiences 10 reduction compared to the previous year in the number of pupils below proficiency in recent years there has been increasing interest in using growth 4 us department of
