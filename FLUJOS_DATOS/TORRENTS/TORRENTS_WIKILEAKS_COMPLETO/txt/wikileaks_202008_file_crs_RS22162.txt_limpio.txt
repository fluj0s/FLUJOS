of the international development association ida approved the fourteenth replenishment of idas resources1 ida the world banks concessional lending and grantmaking facility provides development assistance to the worlds 81 poorest countries eligibility for ida resources is determined by countrys level of poverty as measured by per capita income in 2006 countries with 2005 annual per capita gross national income of up to 1025 were eligible for ida assistance ida is funded annually by the united states and other donor governments with major agreements and funding strategies determined approximately every three years in the world banks fy2006 which ended june 30 2006 ida made commitments to its members totaling 95 billion half of these commitments are in sub saharan africa south and east asia received 38 of new commitments with the remainder 1 the world bank additions to ida resources fourteenth replenishment available at

new assistance other large borrowers receiving 500 million in assistance or more were vietnam tanzania ethiopia and india the ida agreement at the conclusion of the ida14 negotiations ida donors announced that at least 34 billion in resources will be made available to the 81 idaeligible countries during the three years of ida14 20052008 of the 34 billion 18 billion will be in new donations from the 40 contributor countries the remaining 16 billion will come from reflows repayments on former ida loans and transfers from the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd the world banks marketrate lending facility the 34 billion in resources made available by ida14 is an 116 billion increase from the total ida13 level of 228 billion it includes an almost 40 increase in donor contributions from 127 billion in ida13 to 207 billion in ida14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22162 the bush administration pledged 285 billion to ida14 to be split into three payments of 950 million for fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 for the united states this represents real increase from the amount budgeted and requested for ida13 for that replenishment the administration requested 255 billion annually over three years 850 million per year fy2003fy2005 and 300 million in incentive agreements if the world bank met certain treasuryspecified performance targets 100 million in fy2004 and 200 million in fy2005 since the total size of donor contributions to ida has increased by 40 while the us contribution has remained constant the us share of ida decreases to 13 in ida 14 from 21 in ida13 whether this decrease in the us ida share will have any effect on the ability of the united states to pursue future objectives at ida has not yet been determined the decline in us percentage contributions does not affect voting share however since the european member countries combined hold much larger percentage of world bank shares than the united states as well as an increased share of ida contributions some analysts argue that they could exert more force in ida lending decisions andor future replenishment negotiations if they negotiate together2 us objectives the united states government pursued many priorities at the ida14 negotiations major us objectives at ida14 were implementing results measurement framework increasing the allocation of grants implementing performancebased allocation and increasing world bank transparency3 2 current ida voting status of all contributor countries is available at httpwebworldbankorg

meeting february 22 2005 available at httpwwwtreasgovpressreleasesjs2270htm crs3 measuring results in recent years many observers both critics and supporters of the multilateral development banks have cited need to better measure the performance of world bank projects criticism often voiced by the us administration is that it is unclear what mdb assistance has accomplished due to vague objectives and too much emphasis on outputs volume of aid rather than country outcomes introducing stronger performance requirements thus became one of the administrations most sought after goals at ida the ida14 performance measurement system is twofold assessing both 1 progress on aggregate country outcomes and 2 idas contribution to country outcomes to assess country performance the world bank will monitor set of 14 country indicators for all ida countries4 to analyze ida performance the world bank will create output indicators measuring idas contribution in the health education water supply and transportation sectors in addition to country performance and ida performance indicators the world bank will design countrylevel institutional indicators and projectlevel indicators the ida14 agreement also stipulates that world bank management work to ensure that 100 of ida investment projects and development policy loans include indicators connected to timeline with baseline data and periodic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22162 assessments of project and program performance performancebased allocation building on the new results measurement system the us administration would like to channel more ida resources to the strongest performing countries total ida14 allocations will be determined using formula that includes the ida country performance rating5 gross national income gni per capita and population the ida performance rating is the dominant factor and higher performance can increase ida allocations exponentially grants the united states has advocated for several years the use of grants rather than loans at the mdbs concessional lending facilities this view is response to the debt situation of many of the poorest countries principally in subsaharan africa bilateral and multilateral debt of the poorest countries increased heavily between the 1970s and the present it has become increasingly clear that the poorest countries are unable to service their old loans let alone new loans in 1996 the multilateral banks the 4 country indicators are proportion of population below 1day poverty line under5 child mortality hiv prevalency rate of women aged 1524 proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education primary school completion rate proportion of population with sustainable access to an improved water source fixed lines and mobile telephone per 1000 inhabitants formal cost required for business startup time required for business startup public expenditure management gdp per capita access of rural population to an allseason road household electrification rate 5 the ida country performance rating is determined by two world bank ratings the country policy and institutional assessment cpia and the portfolio performance rating arpp the cpia constitutes 80 of idas country performance rating and is combined index of 16 pieces of information evaluating economic management structural policies policies for social inclusionequity and governance the cpia system was us initiative and was put in place during the ida negotiations in 1998 the arpp assesses each countrys performance on implementing prior programs and accounts for 20 of the performance rating the cpiaarpp number is multiplied by country measure of good governance to determine the ida country performance rating crs4 international monetary fund and the major creditor nations introduced the heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative to reduce debt levels for the poorest countries building on this initiative president bush in 2001 introduced his proposal that the world bank shift its assistance to the poorest countries away from loans to grants6 according to bobby pittman treasury deputy assistant secretary for multilateral development banks grants can be useful for ending the lendandforgive cycle7 other donor countries agree with the concept of grants yet note that without commensurate increases in ida funding the banks financial strength may suffer some analysts note that an unstated component of the longterm us administration policyshift towards increased mdb grants may be shrinking of the institution barring additional donor funds the capacity to provide future assistance will decline because of fewer loan repayments critics of grants also note that the world banks ida loans are already provided on highly concessional terms with little or interest at ida14 deputies agreed on 30 of total ida assistance in the form of grants an 8 increase from ida13 which ida countries are eligible for grants depends on their level of debt distress under the new debt distress framework 47 countries are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22162 projected to receive grant financing 42 of which will receive 100 of their ida assistance in grants special dispensation will be given for hivaids grants to idaonly countries that would be ineligible for grant assistance under the new debt distress criterion transparency increasing transparency and public disclosure of world bank documents and policies has also been longstanding us priority at the world bank section 581 of the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act pl 108199 directed the treasury department to pursue policy goals related to transparency and accountability across the mdbs these priorities influenced us objectives at ida14 major component of the ida14 agreement is the world banks commitment to full disclosure of the numerical ratings for the country policy and institutional assessments cpia ratings beginning in 2005 the cpias are the main component for determining ida lending allocations although the world bank began disclosing the cpia ratings in 2000 nongovernmental organizations argued that they were released in an aggregated format that did not reveal anything about how country rating differed between countries and how the ratings were calculated8 6 i propose that up to 50 percent of the funds provided by the development banks to the poorest countries be provided as grants for education health nutrition water supply sanitation and other human needs president george bush speech to the world
