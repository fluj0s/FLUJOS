closings and threaten to cause further i ndustry losses industr representatives have pledged to continue filing safeguard petitions until broader bilateral agreement is reached with china that will cover all categ ories of textile and apparel imports more comprehensive agreement is favored because industry representatives believe that it may provide relief before the industry suffers the job losses and declines required to trigger the implement ation of safeguard measures8 us retailers and other textile and appa rel importers are opposed to any implementation of safeguards because they believe the i ndustry has already been given substantial protection over the last fifty years they point out that many of the jobs lost in us textile and apparel manufacturing can be attributed to improvements in technology and productivity rather th an from increased imports from china or other countries and that any implementa tion of safeguards would allow the us industry to continue to remain uncompetitive in the international marketplace9 in addition they argue that even in the abse nce of quotas high tariff wall will remain in place on many textile and apparel products re lative to tariffs on many other us imports retailers especially oppose any imp lementation of safe guards based on the threat of market disruption or any extens ions of safeguards beyond the time period originally authorized10 additionally some retail indus try supporters believe that if quotas are imposed on chinese goods retailers are more likely to divert orders to other lowerwage countries such as indi and pakistan rather than buying us goods11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32168crs5 12 for more complete discussion of economic issues in the post quota environment see crs report rs20889 textile and

volume of chinese imports grew more th an 500 during the same time period from 19 billion sme in 1998 to 117 billion in 2004 lower growth rate in terms of value compared with higher growth rates in

lead to several countries particularly china india pakistan and turkey being major beneficiaries at the expense of other developing countries many developing nations such as indonesia sri lanka and thailand have invested heavily in the textile and apparel industry sectors due to access that the quota regime provided to developed country markets and are now concerne d that they are losing considerable international market share to china12 us international trade commission itc study forecasted for example that apparel exports from indonesia th philippines and thailand are likely to decline as has already occurred in appare l categories for which quotas were already eliminated many african nations may also lose us market share even though preferences under the african growth nd

textile nd apparel products partic ularly through indonesia or through certain african countries that r eceive preferential trea tment under the african growth and opportunity act agoa transshipment is the movement of goods through second country route to the united states or another receiving c ountry although the practice is generally legal and commonly used in the ordinary cour of business it is illegal if it is done for the purpose of circumventing trade laws and other applicable trade restrictions45 illegal transshipment can 1 adversely affect domestic producers 2 create an unfair competitive advantage for the violator 3 restrict the trade of legitimate manufacturers if quotas are imposed on th merchandise 4 undermine bilateral textile agreements and other trade initiatives that confer preferential treatment and 5 confer false information regarding country of origin to the consumer46 many different schemes are used to evade duties or quotas on textiles being brought into the united states for exam ple some importers or manufacturers may forge the country of origin documents of their goods through the process of transshipment others may use false doc uments or labels or provide incorrect descriptions of the merchandise47httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32168crs13 48 19 usc 2463b1a 49 ibid 50 ibid 51 indonesia china to discuss transshipment issue asia pulse news june 26

commodities are considered import sensitive and thus are specifically excluded from receiving preferential treatment under gsp48 therefore if chinese producers ar transshipping merchandise through

amounts to only small percentage of the illegally transshipped products in addition the indonesian government s delivered formal complaint on the issue of illegal transshipment with the chinese government and has pledged to further discuss the issue during b ilateral meetings in august 200651 the indonesian interest in the problem is most likely due to bilateral talks between the united
