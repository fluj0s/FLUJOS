sponsors have been responsible for th most politically significant acts of middle eastern terrorism in late 1997 signs began to appear that major factions within iran want to chang irans image from backer of terrorism to constructive force in the region if this trend in iran takes hold there is chance that statesponsored middle easter n terrorism will decline over time as iran moves away from active opposition to th arabisraeli peace process the arabisraeli peace process is longstanding major us foreign polic initiative and the administration and congress pay particularly close attention t terrorist groups and state sponsors that oppose it islamist groups such as hama s have largely displaced secular nationalist groups as the most ctive antipeace process organizations hamas has become stronger poli tically since its founder was released from an israeli prison in october 1997 but acts of terrorism by hamas and its allies have declined since mid1997 p ossibly because of greater antiterrorism vigilance by the palestinian authority over the past few years radical islamic groups have increasingly sought to oust prous regimes and gain r emoval of us troops from the persian gulf this is the chief goal of independent terr orist financier and chieftain saudi dissident usama bin ladin bin ladin the independentlyfinanced leader of broad terrorist coalition receives safehaven in afghanistan and thus far in 1998 he has been outspoken i n support of attacks n us troops in the middle east the administration contends it has convincing evidence that bin ladins network was involved in the august 7 1998 bombings of the u s embassies in kenya and tanzania prompting august 20 military action against hi s bases in afghanistan his officiallysanctioned presence in afghanistan could lead that country at some point to be placed on the us list f state sponsors of terrorism us pol icy to counter middle eastern terrorism operates on several differen t levels us counterterrorism policy has generally been directed against stat sponsors which are r eadily identifiable targets problem for us policy has been how to coordinate us counterterrorism policies with those of us allies mos t allied governments believe that engaging these countries diplomatically migh t sometime s be more effective than trying to isolate or punish them but us officials believe that economic and political pressure against states sponsoring terrorism has made some of these states more cautious in recent executive orders and legislation the administ ration and congress have stepped up effort s to directly pressure terrorists and terrorist groups some of which obtain support and funding from persons living in the united states in octobe r 1997 under 1996 antiterrorism law the admi nistration formally named 30 groups half of which are middle eastern as terrorist groups barring them from having presence in the united states the august 20 1998 military strikes on bin ladins network sugges ts

middle eastern groups and state sponsors 1998 introduction this report is an annual analysis of the activities of major middle easter n terrorist groups and the middle astern countries on the us terrorism list the1 report also disc usses us unilateral and multilateral efforts during the previous year to combat midd eastern terrorism this analysis draws extensively from the state departments annual report on international terrorism entitled patterns of globa l terrorism 1997 state depart ment publication 10535 released april 1998 the report uses number of additional sources including conversations with us counterterrorism officials experts investigative journalists and foreign diplomats middle eastern t errorist groups and their state sponsors have been the focus of us counterterrorism policies for several decades since the 1970s many of th major acts of terrorism against americans and us targets have been conducted by middle eastern groups or states according to the state departments report n internat ional terrorism for 1997 subsequently referred to as patterns 1997 th middle east in 1997 witnessed some of the worlds most deadly acts of terrorism including the most lethal act of terrorism ever committed in egypt luxor few us citize ns were killed and wounded in acts of terrorism in jerusalem in 1997 but these casualties were few compar ed to 1996 in june of that year the us military2 complex near dhahran saudi arabia was bombed killing 19 us airmen major antipeace process bombings in israel appear to have declined since september 1997 however the august 7 1998 bombings of the us embassies in k enya and tanzania which the united states asserts was conducted by middle east terrorist network killed over 250 people including 12 americans this network has threatened future acts of terrorism against the united states even after us military action of august 20 1998 five out of the seven states currently on the us terrorism list are middl eastern iran iraq syria libya and sudan the other two are cuba and north korea which will not be covered in this report terrorism list countries are ofte n referred to in policy literature as synonymous with the term rogue states althoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98722crs2 fifteen other groups not considered middle eastrelated wer also designated as ftos at that3 time there is agreed definition of what constitutes rogue state for example syria is not generally considered rogue state in part because it has participated in peace talks with israel patte rns 1997 said iran remains the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 1997 but the report only covered few months of the presidency f mohamm ad khatemi in iran patterns 1997 characterizes sudan and syria s primarily harboring terrorist groups and training camps rather than activel perpetrating terrorism and iraq is described more as potential than an activ terrorist threat pa tterns 1997 as did patterns 1996 credits syria with taking some steps to restrain terrorist groups groups middle eastern terrorist groups and state sponsors differ in their motivations objectives ideologies and level s of activity the radical islamic groups appear to be the most active stating as their main objectives the overthro w of secular prowestern middle eastern governments the derailm ent of the arabisraeli peace process or the ouster of us forces from the persian gulf and middle east many of the olde r palestinia n groups founded in the 1960s and 1970s are leftist and nationalist i n orientation and have become less active than they were decade ago nonetheless they share with their islamic counter parts opposition to peace with israel and to us influence in the middle east other leftist groups such as the kurdistan workers party pkk fight for much different causes such as the formation of separat ethnically based states or the overthrow of incumbent regimes the table belo w shows the fifteen middle easter n groups named by the state department on october 8 1997 as foreign terrorist organizations fto s pursuant to the antiterrorism and effectiv death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 the first twelve of th e3 groups listed were also named in president clintons january 23 1995 executiv order 12947 as antipeace process terrorist groups these twelve have bee n redesignat ed every year since he listing of these groups blocks their assets in th united states and makes it criminal offense for us persons to provide materia l support or resources to them the january 23 1995 designation also bars us dealings with any individuals of those groups named as specially designate d terrorists sdts two groups not on the october 8 1997 fto list below are discussed in thi s report the palestine liberation organization plo is included because of th debate over whether or not the palestinian authority pa headed by plo leade r yasir arafat is taking sufficient steps to prevent terrorism by other groups in areas under its control another group discussed here the veterans of the afgha n conflict refers to loose network of radical islamic fighters who battled th soviet occupation of afghanistan the terrorist network headed by saudi exil usama bin ladin is l oosely organized and diffuse perhaps explaining why it was not originally included in the january 23 1995 or october 8 1997 terrorist grou p designations however n august 20 1998 president clinton issued an executivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98722crs3 order that had the effect of adding the bin ladin network to the list of middle eastern

against israel and the west especially the united states the organizations initial goal was to establish an islamic republic in lebanon as part of broader regionwide islamic republic more recently perhaps in recognition that such goal may b unattainable hizballah has focused on attempting to derail the arabisraeli peac process or at th very least to try to end israels control over six to ten

losses an d fewer hizballah casualties hizballahs ne w tactics have prompted growing sentiment in israel to withdraw completely from lebanon and the israeli cabinet voted in april 1998 to withdraw if lebanon guarantees the security of lebanons northern border lebanon and hizballah have refused to offer such guarantees on the other hand hizballah and israel conducted major swap of pr isoners and

if hizballah has7 the weapon it has not yet used it against israeli aircraft and it is not clear tha t hizballah is able to maintain the weapon hizballah also is increasingly focused on political

perlcontrolling middle eastern terrorism most observers believe it is not possible to prevent all acts of terrorism n matter how comprehensive or wellimplemented is us counterterrorism policy there is universally agreed strategy either withi n the united states or between the united states and its middle eastern and european allies for countering middl eastern terrorism there are variety of options available to pressure terrorist groups and state sponsors although success often depends on bilateral multilateral r international cooperation with us efforts within the united states efforts to deter suspected middle eastern terrorist groups are constrained by concerns about th infringement of civil liberties and contradictions with longestablished immigratio n policies an exhaustive discussion of us efforts to comba t middle eastern terrorism is beyond the scope of this paper but the following sections highlight key recen t middle east counterterrorism initiatives and trends in the administration and i n congress 54 the us approach to middle eastern terrorism has tended to vary with different circumstances and allied perceptions although the united states has tracked an d brought several individual middle eastern ter rorists to justice us counterterrorism policy has tende d to focus on pressuring state sponsors of terrorism in part because terrorists with state backing in the past have been better able to conduct operations than groups without s tate sponsorship to pressure middle eastern terrorist groups and their st ate sponsors the united states has employed combination of unilateral and multilateral measures which us officials maintain have succeeded in makin g state sponsors and their client groups more cautious military force on the few occasions when the united states has used military force agains t middle east sponsors of terrorism such action has been generally unilateral although us allies have often been the victims of middle eastern terrorism the appear to believe that military retaliation will inspire cycle of attack and reaction that might be difficult to control on some occasions us allies have provided som logistic and diplomatic support for us retaliatory attacks the us actions hav almost always enjoyed strong congressional support major us attacks have taken place in ret aliation for terrorist acts sponsored by libya and iraq on april 15 1986 the united states sent about 100 us aircraft to bomb military installations in libya the attack was in retaliation for the april 2 1986 bombing of berlin nightclub in which 2 us military personnel were killed president reagan announced that there was considerable evidence of libya n responsibility for that terrorist bombing on june 26 1993 the united states fired cruise missiles at the headquarters in bagh dad of the iraqi intelligence service which allegedly sponsored failed assassination plot against former president george bush during his apr 1416 1993

sponsor and did not have the approval of the taliban regime in afghanistan or its patron pakistan suda n vehemently protested the simultaneous us attack on the chemical plant i n khartoum asserting it is only pharmaceutical manufacturing plant us military action against state sponsors of terrorism has had some effect on their support for terrorism although not necessarily complete or longlasting both saddam husayn and muammar qadhafi remained defiant of the united states after us military action against them libya was quiescent after the attack but i t apparently returned to the use of terrorism in the decem ber 1988 bombing of pan am 103 and the u ta bombing the following year since the 1993 strike it has avoided attacking high profile us targets unilateral economic sanctions the united states has been willing to apply economic sanctions unilaterally to state sponsors of terrorism even though there is substantial disagreement amon g experts about the effectiveness of unilateral sanctions the listing of country as state sponsor of terrorism alone triggers wide range of us economic sanctions countries on the list are prohibited from receiving us foreign aid exportimpor t bank guarantees and sales of items on the us munition s control list us exports to terrorism list countries are subject to strict licensing requirements that generall prohibit exports of items that can have military applications such as advance d sensing computation or transportation equipment 55 placement on the us terrorism list does not automatically trigger total ban on trade with the united states however us trade ban is in effect for ever middle eastern terrorism list state except syria under separate executive orders foreign aid ap propriations bills over the past several years have barred any direct or indirect assi stance to most states on the terrorism list however us contributions to most international programs have continued to flow because of administratio n waivers or specific agreements with nongovernmental organizations that us support would not benefit specific terrorism list countries section 327 of the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act

try to choke off binhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98722crs36 ladins sources of funding although us officia ls acknowledged that doing so would take substantial international cooperation it does not appear that unilat eral us economic sanctions by themselves force major changes in the behavior of state sponsors of terrorism iraq expelled know n terrorists and obtained removal from the list in 1982 but that removal was attributed by observers more to the merging of us and iraqi strategic interests in the earl 1980s than to us pressure on terrorism iraq was reinstated to the list following the invasion of kuwait major us allies did not join the us trade ban imposed on iran may 6 1995 and the move did not in itself meas urably alter irans objectionable behavior on the other hand virtually all middle eastern terrorism list states hav publicly protested their inclus ion on the list and other us sanctions suggesting that these sanctions are hurting politically andor economically three years after being included on the terrorism list sudan expelled usama bin ladin from that country us officials assert that us sanctions even if unilateral have made some terrorism state sponsors think twice about promoting terrorism multilateral approaches in concert with us unilateral sanctions the united states has sought to develop multilateral approaches to combating middle eastern terrorism this involves i n some cases closer coordination of overall policies and ontheground cooperation and in other cases attempting to persuade other countries to support sanction s against countries that sponsor terrorism however allied business interests an d philosophical differences between the united states and its allie s over how to dissuade states from sponsoring terrorism have often hampered us efforts to forge multilateral consensus in the case of libya some us allies which buy substantial amount s of libyan light crude oil geared to certain refineries in europe have bee n reluctant to

it would welco dialogue with the khatemi government in part in an effort to reduce irans support for terro rism iran has not accepted the us offer of dialogue because of fa ctional infighting between

see above the domestic front the february 1993 world trade center bombing as well as israeli allegations that month that hamas was receiving funding and dire ction from arab residents in the united
