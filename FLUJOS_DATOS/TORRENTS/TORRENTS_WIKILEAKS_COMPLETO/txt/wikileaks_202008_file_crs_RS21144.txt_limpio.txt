charity an overview of legislative proposals jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance division summary this reports briefly discusses the development of proposals for tax incentives for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21144 charity embodied in hr 7 and s 476 in the 108th congress and s 6 in the 109th the revisions in the pension protection act pl 109280 and prospects for future legislation proposed changes initially included charitable deductions for nonitemizers rollovers of iras into charitable uses reduction in the excise tax on private foundation income an increase in the deductions cap for corporate contributions and several narrower provisions relating to business contributions of property and charitable remainder trusts pl 109280 included some of these changes along with some revenue offsets legislation involving tax incentives for charity began in the 107th congress with the community solutions act of 2001 hr 7 this bill adopted in 2001 by the house had eight new tax provisions designed to benefit charitable giving including capped deduction for nonitemizers the president had proposed three of these tax provisions in his original 2001 tax proposal but these provisions were not included in the 2001 tax cut pl 10716 senate consideration also began in the 107th congress with s 1924 introduced by senators lieberman and santorum which would have provided temporary nonitemizers deduction with higher cap along with other provisions the senate finance committee reported this bill the care act of 2002 with temporary nonitemizers deduction with both floor and ceiling but it was not considered on the floor containing some other provisions of hr 7 similar bill s 476 estimated to cost 11 billion over 10 years was passed by the senate on april 9 2003 new version of hr 7 passed the house in 2003 this report summarizes the tax provisions affecting charitable contributions and briefly reviews the issues in most cases the discussion begins with hr 7 and continues with the provisions in the senate alternative 109th congress bill s 7 included charitable provisions as well and the senate continued to propose some of these charitable provisions along with revenue raisers which were enacted in 2006 in pl 109280 the presidents advisory panel on tax reform also proposed extending the deduction to nonitemizers and introducing floor crs2 deduction for nonitemizers under current law taxpayer can either itemize deductions the major deductions are charitable contributions excess medical expenses mortgage interest and state and local income and property taxes or choose the standard deduction the standard deduction is advantageous if that amount is larger than total itemized deductions hr 7 would have allowed someone who takes the standard deduction to deduct charitable contributions singles could deduct amounts in excess of 250 but not over 500 joint returns may deduct the excess of 500 not to exceed 10001 this provision was to be effective for the years 20042006 while in effect this deduction is the largest provision accounting for 14 billion of the 22 billion cost in the first full year fy2005 over all 10 years 20042013 it accounted for 29 billion out of 127 billion 22 this provision has not been adopted while the deduction for nonitemizers may increase giving its effects would be limited because of the cap although increased in effectiveness per dollar of revenue by the floor even without cap the deduction is unlikely to induce additional giving as large httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21144 as the revenue loss because evidence suggests that the responsiveness of taxpayers particularly lower and moderate income taxpayers to incentives is small2 the provision would also increase complexity of tax filing by including another line item limited deduction for nonitemizers was formerly available for 19811986 enacted as part of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 ira rollover provision the largest permanent tax provision in hr 7 allowed tax free distributions from individual retirement accounts to charities by individuals aged 70 and12 and over which originally cost 204 million in the first year 9 of the cost 470 in the last year 33 of the cost in fy2013 and 22 of the ten year cost while this treatment may appear different from simply including the amounts in adjusted gross income and then deducting them as itemized deductions it can provide several types of benefits even to those who itemize in the absence of general deduction for nonitemizers it also permits such deduction for eligible nonitemizers or permits the avoidance of caps or floors apparently an important motivation was to reduce adjusted gross income which can trigger variety of phaseouts and phaseins including the phasein of taxation of social security benefits there are also income limits on charitable contributions since iras tend to be held by higher income individuals the taxpayers might be somewhat more sensitive to the incentive to give however it is not clear why this particular group of taxpayers is targeted this provision was adopted in pl 109280 with 100000 annual limit 1 this provision differs from the 107th congress version which allowed permanent provision with cap beginning 25 for singles 50 for joint returns for 20022003with the cap rising over time 50100 for 20042006 7550 for 20072009 and 100200 thereafter the presidents original proposal and his fy2003 proposal have cap 2 see crs report rl31108 economic analysis of the charitable contribution deduction for nonitemizers crs3 reduce the excise tax on foundation investment income under current law there is 1 tax on investment income of foundations and an additional 1 if the foundation does not make certain minimum distribution based on distributions made in the previous five years or has been subject to tax for failure to distribute in the previous five years hr 7 would have eliminated the extra 1 tax this provision accounted for 196 million 9 in the first year 270 million 19 in the last year and 2273 18 for the 10year period private foundations whose contributors or their families retain the right to direct the distribution of funds have always been subject to greater scrutiny in part because of the possibility of the donor or family obtaining private benefit foundations are required to distribute 5 of their assets each year or pay penalty but the tax is credited against that distribution if the foundation is just making the minimum distribution every dollar of tax httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21144 reduction should be funneled into distributions moreover the moving average discourages large contribution in particular year the reduction in the investment tax would also make private foundations more attractive in general although that increased attractiveness might in part induce more contributions and in part replace contributions that might have gone to other charities the effects should be small however because the tax is small proponents of reducing the tax also argue that it should be reduced because it brings in revenue that is in excess of irs audit costs which they indicate was the original purpose of the tax which was introduced in 1969 the revenue stream from this tax has however been quite variable recently because it is heavily affected by the stock market in any case reading of the legislative history indicates that while the senate characterized the tax as an audit fee the house referred more generally to the notion that private foundations should bear part of the cost of government generally because of their ability to pay as well as viewing it in part as user fee and both objectives were cited in the final explanation of the bill it was reduced twice in 1978 and 1984 based on the argument regarding costs of audit versus revenue another argument made for eliminating the additional tax is the additional complication arising from it of course one could as easily simplify by converting the entire tax to flat fee simplification does not require reduction hr 7 added new provision that limits the counting of administrative costs as part of foundations minimum distribution requirement foundations are required to make minimum distribution of 5 but that 5 can currently include administrative costs which currently have only to be reasonable as originally introduced earlier in 2003 the provision would have disallowed any administrative costs but the proposal as reported allows deductions for most administrative costs with some exceptions this proposal was not adopted see crs report rs21603 minimum distribution requirement for private foundations proposal to disallow administrative costs for an analysis this provision has not been adopted crs4 raising the cap on charitable deductions of corporations under current law corporations can deduct charitable contributions of up to 10 of income hr 7 would have gradually raised the cap to 20 by one percentage point each year beginning in 2004 reaching 15 in 200811 and 20 thereafter3 this provision accounted for 4 of the first year cost 19 of the final cost and 12 of the 10 year cost most corporate giving already falls well under the cap the average giving is less than 2 of income there has been dispute over corporate charity since shareholders could make their own decisions about charitable giving in some views charitable giving by corporations is another management perk that might be excessive because of monitoring problems by shareholders this problem is also called an agency cost problem others argue that corporations should be encouraged to give to charity and to be socially responsible economists have studied models in which charitable giving is part of the firms profit maximizing behavior eg by gaining the firm good will evidence on the effectiveness httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21144 of the deduction is mixed with time series studies showing positive effect and cross section results not finding an effect4 this provision has not been adopted extend present law section 170e deduction for food inventory to all businesses extend research benefit corporations that donate inventory to charity in general get deduction for the cost not the market value special rule allows businesses paying the corporate tax to also exclude half the appreciation half the difference between market value and cost of production if the inventory is given to an organization that directly passes it on to the ill the needy or infants as long as the total deduction is more than twice the cost an important category of donations is that of food and there have been disputes between taxpayers and the irs about how to measure the fair market value of food hr 7 would have allowed unincorporated businesses or businesses that are incorporated but do not pay the corporate tax the additional deduction and the fair market value of wholesome food would be considered the price at which the firm is currently selling the item or sold it in the past although this deduction would be limited to the corporate percentage cap on deduction in general this provision accounted for 3 of the first year cost and 6 of the last year cost the objective was to create more equity among types of taxpayers and resolve disputes largely in the taxpayers favor however one important concern about donated inventory is whether firms might be profiting from charitable contributions for items that they could not otherwise sell pl 109280 extended the provision to unincorporated 3 this provision is more generous than the 107th congress version which would have raised the cap to 15 4 see james r boatsman and sanjay gupta taxes and corporate charity empirical evidence from microlevel panel data national tax journal vol 49 june 1996 pp 193213 crs5 business not to exceed 10 of business income making permanent change adopted in the katrina emergency relief act of 2005 but other change was made modify the basis of s corporation stock for certain charitable contributions under current law shareholder in subchapter s corporation corporation treated as partnership was allowed to deduct his or her pro rata share of any corporate contribution at the same time the taxpayer must decrease the basis of stock by that amount which is way of reflecting the effect on the shareholders asset position the bill provides that the taxpayer will not have to reduce basis in the stock to the extent deduction is taken in excess of adjusted basis of the donated property eg cost this provision appears to be consistent with allowing deduction for the market value of appreciated property without including the appreciation in income special benefit generally available to taxpayers this provision would have cost 1 of loss in the first year and about 5 in the last year it has not been adopted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21144 modify tax on unrelated business taxable income of charitable remainder trusts current law provides tax deductions for some portion of trust and income tax exemption on the earnings if remainder of the assets is left to charity while paying income to noncharitable donee usually spouse or other relative during an interim period the trusts income is however longer exempt from tax if the trust has unrelated business income this provision liberalizes the rule by providing for 100 excise tax on any unrelated business income rather than loss of all tax exemption this provision accounts for negligible share of the cost this provision has not been adopted contributions of scientific and computer property certain special treatment similar to that for food inventory is allowed for certain scientific property used for research and for contributions of computer technology and equipment provided the property is constructed by the taxpayer in concrete terms this rule requires that more than 50 of the cost is due to parts purchased elsewhere this provision expired in 2003 the bill would allow property assembled as well as constructed to be eligible and make the provision permanent this provision would account for 6 of the first year cost and 14 of the last year cost it has not been adopted there are number of other provisions in the 108th congress version of hr 7 which are minor or were not addressed in the 107th congress version the most important one would exclude certain items such as rent received by subsidiary from tax on unrelated business income except for the excess over an armslength price this provision was adopted in pl 109280 crs6 modifications in the senate proposal final changes in the 107th congress the liebermansantorum plan s 1924 would have provided nonitemizers deductions with cap of 400 800 for joint returns the senate finance committee reported version of s 1924 as substitute for hr 7 with temporary nonitemizers deduction with floor and ceiling 250500 for singles and 5001000 for joint returns as in hr 7 similar bill was introduced as s 476 in the 108th congress with charitable provisions costing 11 billion from 20032013 with 28 trillion due to two year nonitemizers deduction this bill was passed by the senate on april 9 2003 the proposal included the ira rollover provision but not the foundation excise tax reduction or the increase in corporate contributions cap the remaining provisions of hr 7 discussed above were included although the provision for research and computer contributions was temporary extension through 2005 there were also number of additional provisions although some of them relatively small another important set of provisions related to benefits for contributions for conservation purposes including 25 exclusion from capital gains on the sale or exchange of property to the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21144 government for conservation purposes 766 million and lifting contribution caps for contributions for conservation purposes 332 million third provision allowed the food inventory treatment for book inventories as well 283 million there are number of minor provisions as well the bill also included increases in grants as well as revenue offsets relating to tax shelters and user fees senate floor amendment allowing up to 10 years to eliminate excess holdings of stock to avoid heavy tax on excess business holdings was adopted this provision would cost 129 million over 10 years some indications were made at the time that wal mart might especially benefit from this change in the 107th congress consideration of the bill this provision substituted for an amendment proposed but then withdrawn during committee consideration which would have raised the limit on holdings in one firm from 2 to 5 another amendment passed on the senate floor extended the 25 capital gains exclusion for land sold to any charity regardless of the purpose similar bill s 6 sponsored by senators santorum frist hutchinson and mcconnell was introduced in the 109th congress the administration included provisions in their budget of fy2006 but did not include the nonitemizers deduction the pension protection act pl 109280 included certain provisions of hr 7 as noted above along with lifting contribution caps for conservation and the book inventory provision it included some other minor benefits along with number of revenue raising provisions including increased accountability and restrictions for donor advised funds and supporting organizations arrangements that like private foundations permit individuals to direct future charitable distributions from fund while there is current legislation relating to deduction for nonitemizers the presidents advisory panel on tax reform has proposed such deduction along with 1 floor which would only allow charitable deductions in excess of 1 of income
