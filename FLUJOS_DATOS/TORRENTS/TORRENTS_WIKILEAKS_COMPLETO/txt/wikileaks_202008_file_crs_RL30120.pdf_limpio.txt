reauthorized in 1994 the mmpas authorization of appropriations expired at th end of fy1999 at issue for congress are the terms and conditions of provisions designed to reauthorize and amend the mmpa to address variety of concerns relating to marine mammal management in the 109th congress the house passed bill to reauthorize and amend the mmpa but further action was taken on this measure the 110th congress may again consider measures to amend and reauthorize the mmpa as well as bills to address specific marine mammal regulatory and management issues several issues that may arise in reauthorization relate to modifying management of the interactions between marine mammals and commercial fishing operations other concerns relate to marine mammals in captivity and subsistence use of marine mammals by native americans additional issues include providing for trade in marine mammal produc ts managing robust marine mammal stocks understanding the effect of noise on marine mammal s fostering intern ational cooperation regulating large incidental takes modifying the scientific research permit process improving agency compliance with mmpa deadlines facilitating marine mammal research by federal scientists dealing with harassment of marine mammals considering directed research program and appropriating ad equate funding for federal agency programs while some of these issues could be addressed administratively in regulations proposed and promulgated by the national marine fisheries service the us fish and wildlife service or the usda animal and plant health inspection service others lik ely would require statutory changes most potential participants in the reauthorization debate anticipate extended negotiations on some of these issues lthough the authorization for appropriations expired at the end of fy1999 the mmpa itsel f did not expire eventually however an extension of funding authority may need to be considered to continue federal program operations most of the issues associated with this law are not time sensitive and number of oversight hearings have been held to increase understanding of various issu positions and possibilities this report lays out the range of issues likely to be raised during any reauthorization debate the reasons behind them and possible proposals that could be offered to address these concerns this report will be updated as warranted to reflect the evolution of these issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120contents introduction 1 constituency groups 2 commercial fishing industr y2 environmental groups 3 p

native american and envi ronmental interests to identify issues that might surface during reauthorization debate3 this report identifies these concerns and provides background to fac ilitate better understanding of various positions on these issues these concer ns along with other factors may be considered as congress determines whether and how to address mmpa reauthorization other than recommendations contained in reports to congre ss mandated by the mmpa amendments of 1994 discussed late r in this report and in testimony presented at june 29 1999 oversight hearing before the house

supra note 7 p 4 10 id p 79amendments proposed by the bush administration4 congress has been active on marine mammal protecti on issues in recent years res ponding primarily to balancing concerns of the commercial fishing industr and environmental in terests congress generally views the mmpa as working well but possibly needing changes to address an increasing number of concerns that ve arisen since the 1994 amendments in the house the committee on natural resources has jurisdiction over any mmpa reauthorization legislation in the sena the committee on commerce science and transportation has jurisdiction ove r any legislation on this issue constituency groups an array of groups and individuals hol d common and conflictin g interests in our nations marine mammals despite their diversity they generally share the goals of ensuring sustainable marine mammal popul ations and maintaining healthy marine ecosystems these groups however some times disagree about how best to achieve these goals and use these common resources and thus conflict is inevitable as congress considers reauthorization of th mmpa these diverse groups will advocate wide variety of policy proposals5 commercial fishing industry there were more than 65000 commercial fishing vessels estimated to be operating in us marine fisheries in 20016 and 3242 processor and wholesale plants employing 65690 individuals in 20047 in 2005 the total catch of marine fish was more th an 96 billion pounds with an estimated ex vessel value8 of more than 39 billion9 for 2005 the overall economic contribution of commercial fishing to gr oss national product in valu added was estimated to exceed 329 billion10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs3 this sector is chiefly concerned with ensuring sustainable fisheries that balance environmental protection with the continued shortterm and longterm viability of the industry an additional concern is how best to manage conflicts between increasingly abundant marine mammals and commerc ial fishing within this sector is diverse group of interests each with specific concerns regarding the rational use of living marine resources nd the allocation of resources among user groups these sectors divide according to scale of operation type of activity fishermen catcher processor processor type of fishing gear used trawl longline gillnet pots seine and location inshore or offshore environmental groups more than 50 us envi ronmental and conservation organizations focus primarily or largely on marine issues membership in these groups ranges into the millions with re spect to the mmpa environmental groups are principally concerned with the lack of assessment data for many managed stocks the direct and indirect harm to less resilient marine species including marine mammals the protection of marine biodiversity and the continuing loss of marine habitat public display community this community includes about 200 us marine life parks aquarium s and zoos dedicated to the conservation of marine mammals and their environments through public display education and research the public display community has not take n formal position on any of the issues raised in this report animal protection advocates more than 30 us animal protection organizations have programs focusing on the protection of marine mammals and other marine species animal protecti on groups are concerned with impacts on individual animals as well as species with harassment as well as killing and injury and with captive as well as freeranging animals they share concerns with environmental groups regardin g habitat loss and degradati on but are also concerned with intentional and incidental takes that result in animal suffering their key focus is on protection native americans because of their culture tradition and subsistence needs many tribes and indigenous groups are c oncerned about the ma nagement of marine mammals some alaska native groups ar represented by commissions eg eskimo walrus commission alaska kimo whaling commission harbor seal commission aleut marine mammal commission alaska nanuuq commission alaska sea otter and steller sea lion co mmission that coordi nate management of certain species with federal agencies th longterm goals of tribes and indigenous groups generally include economic stability resource sustainability and regulatory certainty of particular concern during mmpa reauthor ization will be cooperative management of marine mammals which they believe fosters economic vitality environmental health nd rational management of natural resources marine mammal scientists scientists from academia the private sector and state and federal agencies are princi pally involved in analyzing the ecological social and economic effects of mmpa pr ovisions and marine mammal management policy like the other groups they are c oncerned with the health and integrity of marine ecosystems and the rational use of marine resources specifically they arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs4 11 some consider this action ban or prohib ition rather than moratorium because it was and is permanent 12 under the mmpa in 16 usc 136213 take means to harass hunt capture or kill or attempt to harass hunt capture or killinterested in the availability of adequate funding and accurate data to perform the necessary analyses such scientists are also often members of or associated with other constituent groups marine mammal managers federal and state marine mammal managers are charged with implementing the mmpa and complementary state programs because of this responsibility their interest s and concerns are more keenly focused on the pragmatic aspects of the mmpa specifically they are interested in clarity in the intent of management requirements and in federa l appropriations to fund data collection and research marine mammal protection act congress enacted the marine mammal protection act mmp in 1972 due in part to the high level of dolphin mortality in the eastern tropical pacific tuna fishery estimated at more than 400000 animals per year in the late 1960s the mmpa established moratorium11 on the taking of marine mammals in us waters and by us nationals on the high seas12 the mmpa also established moratorium on importing marine mammals nd marine mammal products into the united states the mmpa protects marine mammals from clubbing mutilation poisoning capture in nets and other human actions that lead to extinction it also expressly authorized the secretaries of commerce nd the interior to issue permits for the taking of marine mammals for certain pur poses such as scientific research and public display under the mmpa the secretary of commerce acting through the national marine fisheries service nmfs in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration also popularly referred to as noaa fisheries is responsible for the conservation and manage ment of whales dolphins porpoises seals and sea lions the secretary of the interior acting through the us fish and wildlife service fws is responsible for walruses sea otters polar bears manatees and dugongs this division of authority derives from ag ency responsibilities as they existed when the mmpa was enacted title ii of the mmpa established an independent marine mammal commission mmc and its committee of scientific advisors on marine mammals to oversee and recommend actions necessary to meet the requirements of the mmpa title iii authorized the international dolphin conservation program title iv authorized the marine mammal hea lth and stranding response program title v implemented the agreement between the united states and the russian federation on the conservati on and management of the alaskachukotka polar bear populationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs5 13 although the state of alaska began the proc ess to request management authority for some marine mammal species state has been granted such management authority 14 section 109f2 defines subsistence uses as the customary and traditional uses by rural alaska residents of marine mammals for dir ect personal or family consumption as food shelter fuel clothing tools or transportation for the making and selling of handicraft articles out of nonedible byproducts of marine mammals taken for personal or family consumption and for barter or sharin g for personal or family consumption 15 subsequently the mmpa amendments of 1994 established new regime to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals by commercial fishing operationsprior to passage of the mmpa states were responsible for managing marine mammals on lands and in wa ters under their jurisdiction the mmpa shifted all marine mammal management authority to the federal governme nt it provides however that management authority on sp eciesbyspecies basis could be returned to state that adopts conservation and ma nagement programs consistent with the purposes and policies of the mmpa13 it also provides that the moratorium on taking can be waived by the federal government or states with management authority for specific purposes if the taking will not disadvantage the affected species or population permits may be i ssued to take or import any marine mammal species including depleted species for scientific research or to enhance the survival or recovery of the species or stock nondepl eted species may be taken or imported for purposes of public display the mmpa allows us citizens to apply for and obtain authorization for taking small numbers of mammals incidental to activities other than commercial fishing eg offshore oil and ga s exploration and velopment if the taking would have negligible impact on any marine mammal species or stock and if monitoring requirements and other conditions are met the mmpas moratorium on taking does not apply to any resident alaskan indian aleut or eskimo who dwells on the coast of the north p acific including the bering sea or arctic oceans including the chukchi and beaufo rt seas if such taking is for subsistence purposes14 or for creating and selling authentic native articles of handicrafts and cl othing and is not done wastef ully however such taking can be regulated or even prohibited if the secretary determines stock is depleted the mmpa also provides for comanagement of marine mammal subsistence use by alaska native groups under which aut hority native commissions have been established the mmpa also authorizes the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations in 1988 most us commercial fish harvesters were exempted from otherwise applicable regulations and permit requirements for five years pending development of an improved system to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations15 the taking of marine mammals incidental to the eastern tropical pacific tuna fishery is governed by specific and separate provisions in title iii of the mmpa the endangered species act of 1973 sa pl 93205 as amended 16 usc 1531 et seq provides additi onal protection for some ma rine mammal species that have been determined to be threatened or endangered with extinction when protective actions are taken

two statutes may increase management complexity and legal uncertainty in dealing with some species such as the southern sea otter in california 1994 mmpa reauthorization the 1988 commercial fishing exemption ex pired at the end of fy1993 and new provisions were enacted in pl 103238 which reauthorized the mmpa through fy199916 these new provisions indefinitely authorized the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations and provided for 1 preparing assessments for all marine mammal stocks in waters under us jurisdiction 2 developing and implementing take reduction plans for st ocks that may be reduced or are being maintained below their op timum sustainabl populati on levels due to interactions with commercial fisheries and 3 studying pinniped17fishery interactions in addition the 1994 ame ndments substantially changed provisions relating to public display of marine ma mmals authorized imports of polar bear trophies from canada authorized the limite d lethal removal of pinnipeds and enacted general authorization for research involving only low levels of harassment implementation of the 1994 amendments implementation of the 1994 mmpa amendm ents by nmfs and fws has been controversial on seve ral issues in some cases implementation of new provisions took more than the full five years of the au thorization to complete one of the most difficult and contr oversial amendments to impleme nt was the convening of take reduction teams trts18 and the development of ta ke reduction plans by these trts critics believe an insufficient numbe r of trts have been convened and that development of plans is far behind schedule nmfs has convened nine trts to reduce bycatch of strategic stocks of marine mammals in selected commercial fisheries one of these the atlantic offshore cetacean trt was disbanded in august 2001 due to changes in the affected fisheries another the midatlantic trt became the midatlantic harbor porpoise trt because of priority given to particul arly vulnerable harbor porpoise six of the remaining trts address bycatch issues on the atlantic coast while the remaininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs7 19 for

pacific driftnet fishery for swordfish and sharks19 several trts have yet to be convened and plans developed although nmfs recognizes that fisheryrelated morta lity exceeds the pbr level in some marine mammal stocks new trts are to be convened until add itional funds are appropriated or redirected from existin g take reduction plans that have been declared successful congress recogn ized that funds would be limited and established criteria for pr ioritization of this effort in 16 usc 1387f3 overall nmfs believes that the time allowed by the mmpa to convene trt and develop plan has been adequate however nmfs found it difficult to publish final rule based on plan in the time allotted by the mmpa due primarily to the complexity and difficulty of implementing regulations that minimize impacts to the industry as required by the mmpa and by the economic analyses and requirements of other statutes the difficulties in meeting statutory deadlines and implementing plans for these strategic stocks has been both frustrating to many sometimes resulting in litigation and satisfying to others in that serious bycatchfishery issues have been addressed in response to the 1994 mmpa amendments at 16 usc 1386 nmfs and fws have completed reports assessing more than 170 different marine mammal stocks as required by the mmpa20 and have developed list of fisheries that monitor their annual takes of marine mammals by stock these lists are frequently being revised and are also the target of controve rsy as new information is incorporated into the assessments however some of th stock assessments conducted by fws have been criticized for using outdated eg decad old data in addition alaska native interests continue to be concerned that some stock assessment reports have little information on incidental take from co mmercial fishing operations the sparse information in these reports base d on data collected during the 19881992 exemption was the result of an emphasis on some us fisheries having interactions with marine mammals at rate that was considered more serious than that occurring in fisheries of concern to native alaska ns an observer program was therefore not initiated in alaska until 1998 nmfs anticipat becoming better able to address the concerns of alaska natives the 1994 amendments also directed th federal government to undertake an ecosystembased research and monitoring program for the bering sea to identify the causes of ecosystem decline there is controversy over the extent to which this provision has been fulfilled meanwhile the alaska native community would like to initiate complimentary effort to unde rstand bering sea ecological processes by drawing upon traditional native knowledg and wisdom the alaska native community was unable to obtain public fundi ng to convene meetings among affected villages to review the draft federal bering sea research plan and eventually sought independent funding to support march 1999 bering

scientists have attempted to define osp for population based on the carrying capacity for an ecosystem that may longer exist for many reasons both humancaused and natural 27 these scientists are concerned that since most marine mammal species have suffered dramatic population decreases over the last tw centuries the true carrying capacity of the environment is unknown in addition they be lieve that carrying capacity for some species would increase if certain commercial fish harv ests were curtailed and other human uses of the marine environment were modified 28 maximum productivity is based on inexact population surveys subject to natural fluctuations and can be derived scientifically in several ways improving survey techniques with more advanced technology holds prom ise for improving the precision of these variables full realization of this poten tial may be dependent upon increased fundingcommerce appealed this ruling the 9th circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower court decision in july 200125 issues for congress the remainder of this report reviews issues that may be raised during discussions on reauthorizing the mmpa the major issue categories include commercial fishing interactions with marine mammals marine mammals in captivity native americans and marine mammals permits and authorizations and program management and administra tion some of these issu could be addressed administratively in regulations implemented by nmfs fws or the animal and plant health inspection service aphis depa rtment of agriculture others would require legislative action commercial fishing interactions with marine mammals optimum sustainable population optimum sustainable population osp is defined in 16 usc 13629 as the number of anima ls which will result in the maximum productivity of the population or the species keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form constituent element however the va riable nature of populations in marine ecosystems makes it nearly impossible to determine carrying capacity in addition for many species the limiting habitat factors that govern carrying capacity are not known or well understood26 animal protection scie ntific and environm ental interests generally agree that osp is an important concept for assessi ng the viability of population or stock some scientists however ex press concern that if curre nt rather than historic population data are used to cal culate osp osp vels may be calculated too low for some marine mammal stocks27 some in the commercial fishing industry however argue that osp as currently defined is complex and vague in concept they contend that maximum productivity is diffi cult to determine and imprecise28 and complicates work on developing take re duction plans for mari ne mammal stockshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs10 29 the recovery factor accounts for uncertain ty in population estimates and reproductive ratesthe difficulties in declaring th at species is at osp 1 frustrate fishing industry interests by impeding the ability of the federal government to transfer management authority to states and 2 prevent or delay fishermen from gaining authority to deliberately kill marine mammals in addition commercial fishing interests chafe when the mmpa through osp grants marine mammals priority access to certain fish stocks and allocates marine mammals facto harvest quotas in direct competition with and to the detriment of the fishing i ndustry environmental and scientific intere sts counter that marine mammals are part of the marine ecosystem and should have their prey sp ecies protected from excessive fishing these interests also believe that critics within the comme rcial fishing industry may be too quick to blame marine mammals for re ductions in target fish popul ations where predatorprey relationships are incompletely understood commercial fishing interests would like to see the mmpa amended to modify simplify and clarify the definition of osp as the objective for marine mammal management scientif ic animal protection and envir onmental interest s believe that osp as the central core innovation of the mmpa should be retained and improved other suggestions include directing the mmc to host workshop involving marine ecologists oceanographers and climatologists to further examine the methods for determining osp and its rivative potential biological removal see section below appropriati on of funds necessary for this task would probably be required calculating potentia l biological removal the potential biological removal pbr level is used to establish limits on incidental marine mammal mortality for commercial fish ing operations it is defined in 16 usc 136220 as the maximum number of animals not including natural mortalities that may be removed from marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population pbr is calculated by multiplying stocks minimum population estimate by half th known or presumed maximum net productivity of the stock this product is multiplied by fractional multiplier known as the recovery factor29 take reduction plans are based on two assumptions 1 that stock or population currently within its osp range will remain so and 2 that any stock or population below its maximu m net productivity level will increase to that level if the total humancaused mortality is kept below the pbr level however some scientists believe that both these assumptions might be questionable in light of todays much better information mmpa critics in the fishing industry and native alaskan community believe that nmfs has been so restrictive in calculating pbrs that the economic viability of certain fisheries eg the new england and midatlantic gillnet fisheries bering sea pollock fishery is being compromised nmfs and fws managers counter that the lack of critical data used in pbr calculations limits their ability to calculate precise pbr values for many species these issues are particularly acute for alaskan species where population surveys productivity rates

management tool that should be maintained30 without way to calculate concrete limits on take they argue nmfs would have way of adequately determining the impact of humancaused mortality on marine

marine ecologists oceanographers and climatologists to furt her examine the methods for determining osp and its derivative pbr considerations for such workshop might include 1 multiple mortality factors such as subsistence harvest commercial fishery interactions including enta nglement in net discards and industrial activities eg noise contaminants 2 standardized guide lines for using the

incidental serious injury of marine mammals permitted in the course of commercial fishing operations be reduced to insignificant levels approaching zero mortality and serious injury rate within 7 years after april 30 1994 in july 2004 nmfs defined in significant levels approaching the zmrg as 10 or less of the pbr for any stock31 the animal protection and environmental communities believe the objective of approaching the zmrg must be maintained however while marine mammal mortality in many fisheries has been reduced in some cases substantially animal protection and environmenta l interests do not consider these reductions to be significant they believe that the zmrg can be implemented in ways that do not impose burdensome costs on the fishing indus try and that promote marine ecosystemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs12 32 new methodology might include both population numbers and ecological relationships as well as review by independent scientists 33 for updated stock

maintained as means of encouraging the development and use of more riskaverse fishing methods the fishing industry is concerned that zmrg be implemented in manner that recognizes reasonable balance

supportive of the nmfs definition of appro aching the zmrg that is 10 of the pbr or less stock assessment process the mmpa outlines stock assessment process in 16 usc 1386 several scientists and managers contend that this process is insufficient to assess most ma rine mammal populations with reasonable degree of certainty in addition these critics as well as various advocacy groups believe that federal funding is insufficient to impr ove speciesspeci fic methods for assessing marine mammal stocks32 and that congress shoul d authorize specific and substantial multiyear funding to improve our basic knowledge of marine mammal populations especially for arctic species33 alaskan native interests suggest that the mmpa 16 usc 1386d be amended to confer greater authority to regional scientific review groups authorizing these groups to exercise more power in addressing concerns of where research is needed rather than be only advisory in addition they suggest amendments to 16 u sc 1386c to alter the timing of stock assessment reviews feeling that healthy stocks may not need review every three years every five years would be more reasonable they believe that three years may be too short an interval to detect meanin gful trends and can be burdensome on the agency performing the assessments for most strategic stocks since little new information is gathered to necessitate an annual review they believe an assessment every two years might be sufficient deterrence in 16 usc 1371a4 the mmpa allows the use of deterrents to discourage marine mammals from damaging fish catch or gear currently the burden falls on the federal gove rnment to prove that dete rrent is harmful before it can be prohibited for example the longterm effects on marine mammals of acoustical harassment

natural ability of marine mammals to find food and use the full extent of their foraging range is not well known but may have unintended consequences for example the loss of hearing due to loud noise

reasonable standard might be to prohibit the use of ahds that have been shown to cause any kind of permanent damage 41 some fishery practices eg discarding by catch and fish waste invite marine mammals into close proximity with humans in additi on an increase of fishery interactions with continuedscientific workshop that raised signif icant concerns about ahds and recommended that their use be severely limited nmfs proposed35 but never finalized deterrence regulations because of the difficulty in identifying measures for safely deterring endangered and threatened marine mammals36 and the use of ahds has increased substantially in recent years similarly so scientists are cerned that there has been insufficient research37 to determine at what thre shold deterrent device might become harmful to marine mammals38 with huge gaps of knowledge in marine mammal science39 some animal protection advocates argue that it would be prudent to allo w only proven harmless deterrents for use on marine mammals interacting with fishing vessels andor fish farms some have argued for reliance on the precautionary principle that would require manufacturers to prove that deterrent does not cau permanent harm to any agesex class of affected marine mammal species before allowing its use40 i n addition some scientists nd managers believe that not enough emphasis has been placed on encouraging fishermen to change their fishing practices rather than use proven deterrent to reduce inter actions with marine mammals41 howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs14 41 continued sperm whales in alaskan waters appears to have coincided with the change from derby fishery where the whole fleet fished for short period of time to an individual fishing quota ifq system where individual fisherme n

the side effects of noise and other emissions of nonlethal deterre nts to identify any potential for damage to targeted and nontargeted marine mammals fi sh that may be more sens itive to noise eg

fishermen and pinnipe ds have become more frequent and economic losses have increas ed nmfs has recommende d that congress consider authorizing the intentional lethal taking of california sea lions and pacific harbor seals in specific areas and fisheries to pr otect gear and catch until effective nonlethal methods are developed44 critics oppose reinstating th is authority fearing that allowing

involved representatives of animal pr otection groups mari ne mammal facilities veterinary professiona ls trainers and government managers working cooperatively the animal protection community believing that aphiss expertise and experience is primarily with nonaquatic species may propos to return jurisdiction to nmfs and fws which they feel are better qualified to monitor marine mammal care and maintenance54 on the other hand some in the public display community see basis for stripping aphis of prima ry authority for captive marine mammals since they contend that aphis has long history of developing and enforcing standards of animal health and care and has vigorously exercised its jurisdiction55httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs18 55 continued animals including marine mammals for

critics cite examples where aphis appears content to wait for facilities to fix recurring problems rather than taking more aggressive action and where aphis is alleged to have accepted facilitys tank

legal doctrine under which countries recognize and enforce each others legal decreesthis has included conducting br oad rulemaking proceedings on revised requirements for marine mammals in captivity in contrast the public display community views nmfs and fws as not typically dealing with or being involved in the animal husbandry sector and having limited expertise in the captive maintenance and care of marine mammals56 critics further assert that giving nmfs and fws jurisdiction in this area would necessitate an expensive program duplicating what aphis already administers some in the public display community further assert that the majority of problems concerning the quality of care provided captive marine mammals occurred prior to the 1994 mmpa amendments and in privatel operated facilities that were not regulated rather than in regulated public display facilities regardless of who regulates these facilities some marine mammal scientists and animal protection advocates belie ve that regulations need to be brought more closely into accord with the physical psychological and social needs of marine mammals in addition they suggest that existing regulati ons need to be enforced with more rigor and with less influence from the facilities being regulated57 they argue that reliance on the public display community to be forthcoming when explaining the application of particular husbandry prac tices may be open to questi on particularly when public display facilities fear that proprietary interest related to husbandry techniques eg successful captive breeding techniques might be revealed to competitors they suggest that congress consider ways in which successful husbandry techniques might be made more openly available in the interest of benefitting the care of marine mammals throughout the public display indus try under such conditions husbandry practices might be standardiz ed to better protect animals export of captive animals the 1994 mmpa amendments repealed export permit and public notif ication requirements replacing them with 15day federal agency notification requirement prior to export58 nmfs has interpreted export provisions as requiring letter of comity59 from the foreign government certifying that the standards of the mmpa are upheld in foreign facilities in addition nmfs requires letter of comity for any further transfer of marine mammal of us origin by one foreign nation to another foreign nation animal protection advocates claim that the current status of some of the marine mammals dolphins in particularhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs19 60 animal protection advocates have serious concerns regarding the ability of nmfsfws under the short notification regime and without public input to ensure the wellbeing of marine mammals leaving this country for foreign and often substandard facilities they are concerned that the brief window of notific ation eliminates any and all opportunity for public notification and comment and also limits the time available for the agencies to review the documentation that must accompany an export 61 the scientific issue is one of detailed and open record keeping so that scientists know where animals have gone and are able to compar wild to captive mortality rates birth rates etc 62 the primary safeguard is the requirement certified by the recipient nations agency responsible for marine mammals that the re ceiving facility meets the same criteria for holding such animals as were required of the originating us facility 16 usc 1374c9 while some critics suggest that st ronger regulatory criteria might be imposed by nmfsfws in implementing this provision they believe such action may require congressional direction either through stat ement in committee report language or as specific mmpa amendment 63 16 usc 1374c8biiishipped from the united states to honduras china portugal tahiti and other countries since the 1994 repeal is not known the animal protection community is concerned and may seek to amend the mmp to restore the export requirements to their original condition ie requiring pe rmit with public comment period as part of the process60 some scientists agree that requirement for export permits should be reinstated61 but believe that mmc and nmfsfws review of export permits might make public comment unn ecessary some suggest that congress require full accounting from nmfsfws for all past exported marine mammals before allowing any further us animals to be exported in addition they suggest the mmpa be amended to require 25000 surety bond or insurance policy per exported marine mammal to cover emergency medical and transfer costs in the event of financial or natural disaster at fo reign facility animal prot ection advocates recommend mandatory onsite inspections of foreign facilities before any us marine mammal can be exported elements of the public display community however believe the current process includes extensive safeguards62 and that the prior law requirements were outmoded and cumbersome some in the public display community may suggest further amending the mmpa to eliminate the 15day prior agency notification requirement for exports63 import of captive animals some in the public display community may seek to amend the mmpa to treat the import of marine mammals the same way exports are treated ie agency notification required but permit required and public comment solicited they argue that the current process is cumbersome and unnecessary the animal protection community would likely oppose such an amendment desiring to retain and possi bly strengthen federal agency review of imports as well as the option for public comme nt they believe that public process with agency review would better protect marine mammals discouraging the import of certain marine mammals such as those captured specifically for the importing facilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs20 64 for example see httpcerfbccapubsbib liomarmam_bibliohtml prior to the establishment of marine mammal facilities most of what was learned bout marine mammals resulted from whaling and sealing ac tivities rather than from field research 65 some scientists suggest that workshop of experts be convened to provide guidance on better defining what might be considered valid research on captive marine mammals and on increasing opportunities for legitimate research access to captive marine mammals similar efforts have been conducted under the authority provided in 16 usc 1380 66 some scientists report that research on captive animals is also constrained by economics for example estimates of the cost of obtaining young healthy dolphin range from 100000 to 150000 67 however captive marine mammals used for research often are orphaned stranded or disabled animals that are not physically able to be returned to the wild 68 again some believe it may be an extreme standard to be required to prove negativescientific research on captive marine mammals research on captive marine mammals has provi ded critical information and substantial body of literature on many aspects of marine mammal biology64 some scientists assert that research on captive marine mammals may be more useful for certain disciplines eg physiology immunology nutrition hearin g sensitivity and cognitive and acoustic abilities than others eg acoustic behavior and intra and interspecies interactions65 some scientists ve proposed that more research be conducted on how human activities might affect marine animals66 they further contend that research on and observation of marine mammals in captivity affords scientists the opportunity to conduct studies with live animals that are not always possible or practical to do in the wild and contributes valuable data useful in determining management criteria for wild populations many of these scientists believe the mmpa has placed an unreasonable burden on scientific research eg invasive research is seriously impeded other scientists as well as parts of the animal protection community question how much of the research conducted on captive marine mammals actually benefits marine mammals in the wild these critics may suggest that the mmpa be amended to require that more attention to benefits be given by federal agencies that review permits for scientific research on captive marine mammals other scientists are likely to oppose any amendment that might in crease their regulatory burden or curtail access to potential research animals as an alternative to greater restrictions some scientists suggest amending the mmpa to impose research requirement on all regulated facilities holding marine mammals with mandatory peer review of these research programs to ensure that the capture and holding of marine mammals for research is justified67 more extensive medical exams for transferred animals although both aphis and fws require health certif icate from licensed veterinarian prior to transporting marine mammal the unite d states does not require any blood tests be made on marine mammals destined for export in addition neither nmfs nor fws requires an exporter to prove th at an animal harbors infections68 even if the animal may have been exposed to morbillivirus highly contagious distemperhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs21 69 this disease is prevalent in wild animals but has never been reported in nonstranded captive animal 70 this concern may arise when private organiza tions often affiliated with animal protection groups promote the release of captive animals as well as with some foreign public display facilities 71 for individual public display facilities discharging waste to publicly owned treatment works local municipalities enforce wastewater treatment standards and effluent discharge permits under the authority of the federal clean wat er act if the facility discharges directly to the environment standards and permits under this same act are administered by the environmental protection agency epa or qua lified states to which epa has delegated responsibility 72 66 fed reg 239257 jan 3 2001 73 in rare instances such as hazardous situations or removal of an animal from imminent danger it may be in the sick or threatened an imals best interests to be transported to quarantined location where it can be treated animal protection interests are concerned to ensure that cumbersome paperwork and bureaucracy do not jeopardize an animals life in these situations 74 in the reverse situation cases have been reported where receipt of stranded wild animal or inadequate treatment of influent water has allowed pathogens from the wild to infect continuedlike disease harmful to some marine mammal species69 therefore critics assert that some diseasecarrying marine mammals c ould be exported to countries where they might infect marine mammals in that region animal protection advocates suggest that the mmpa or the awa may need to be amended to requi re more safeguards against transferring pathogens including antibioticresistant pathogens among captive populations when animals are move d and b to wild populations when captive animals are moved to seapens70 or when public display facility discharges untreated effluents into the marine environment71 more extreme scientific critics suggest that transferred animals should be prohibited from ever being placed in sea pen or other open enclosure and that im ported and exported ma rine mammals should be treated like parrots and other exotic bi rds with quarantines and thorough medical examinations required at each end of the transfer individuals at some public display facilities believe that these matters have been addressed sufficiently in regulations finalized by aphis72 in addition an individual associated with the public display community relates that medical examinations prior to transporting marine mamma ls regardless of their des tination have been long standing practice for many zoos and aqua ria under such practice and before an animal is transferred ve terinarian conducts an ex amination and certifies the animals healthy condition73 they further state that since humans are not required to be proven diseasefree before traveling it would be ridiculous to impose higher standard for marine mammals managers of public disp lay facilities ar exceedingly hesitant to accept any animal that could pose potential pathogenic threat because of their interest in their investment and the difficulty in replacing animals that die furthermore they assert that there is documented case where release of captive marine mammal to the wild or to an open ocean pen or di scharge of facility effluent has contributed to an epidemiological episode in the wild74httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs22 74 continued captive marine mammals 75 necropsies are routinely performed as soon as possible normally within hours of death

policy into regulation 78 with few exceptions zoos and aquaria claim to be open regarding the disposition of marine mammals within their care with re cords available for public review animal protection advocates dispute this claim sugge sting that majority of facilities refuse to share such information considering it proprietary 79 animal protection advocates believe that c onsiderable incentive exis ts for public display facilities to provide false or incomplete in formation on the cause of death of marine mammals asserting that these institutions are unlikely to provide evidence that would lead to accusations of wrongdoing with s ubsequent scrutiny and possible finenecropsies currently necropsies on dead marine mammals are performed inhouse by public display fac ility veterinarians75 prior to the 1994 mmpa amendments necropsy reports were required to be submitted to nmfs and fws current aphis standards require such reports to be completed and kept on file at the public display facility for three years76 such medical records are available to aphis inspectors onsite when requested but are not submitted to nor kept on file at aphis or any centralized point the onl requirement under the mmpa is to report to nmfs and fws the date of death of the marine mammal and the cause of death when determined77 thus necropsies which former ly were available to the public under the freedom of information ac t are longer public records78 animal protection advocates believe that public access to necropsy information is important to protecting the wellbeing of marine mammals in captivity and they object to the 1994 changes in necropsy policy they also fear that captive holding facilities minimize the impact of animal d eaths by underreporting findings of necropsy performing an inadequate necropsy or failing to report actual findings79 these critics would like to see the mmpa amended to again require that necropsyreports in standardized format be submitted to federal agency thus guaranteeing public access to them in add ition animal protection in terests may propose requirement that necropsies be performed by independentimpartial veterinarians federally employed appointe d or contracted veterinari ans and that institutions experiencing marine mammal death re port to aphis within 48 hours upon which an official examiner would be dispatched to perform the necropsy or review the tissue samples and examine the carcass scientists however point out that the more time that passes between death and necropsy the less there is to learn from the necropsy thus this suggests that in addition to raising costs the logistics of implementing an external review also may frustrate the ability to gain worthwhile information some scientists suggest an alternative approach that would direct veterinarians employed by the public di splay facilities to c onduct necropsies but allow veterinarians represen ting animal protection groups to have access to replicatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs23 80 supporters of supervised or independent necropsies contend that requirements for such might further protect facilities from liability nd claims of negligence whereas the current unsupervised necropsies may leave them unprotected 81 66 fed reg 239257 jan 3 2001 82 alternatively it could be required that ge netically mixed offspring be neutered

stat that they ensure good healthcare for their animals by providing licensed veterina ry care thus also protecting themselves from liability and claims of negligence80 they assert that there is evidence that such care is suspect furthermore they point out that necropsies were the subject of 2001 aphis rulemaking81 because these rules are still being implemented the need for legislation is unclear for now if more expensive necropsies were required the issue of who would pay for them is likel to be controversial animal protection interests believe that captive holding fac ilities should pay for supervised necropsies as part of the costs of captive care managers of captive animals contend that the federal government should b ear the costs if additional outside veterinary services were

the movement of animals between captive facilities the us navys use of atlantic bottlenose dolphins in openo cean training exercises in the pacific wh ere they occasionally integr ate with local populations of wild pacific bottlenose dolphins also has been criticized scientists animal protection advocates and nvironmentalists question whether it is responsible management to mix animals originating from different oceans especially if there is the possibility that they or their offspring might be inadvertently or intentionally released into wild breeding population these interests suggest that the mmpa should be amended to address the genetic mixing that invariably occurs when captive animals are moved from one facility to another mmpa provisions requiring attention to this concern might engender greater confidence if such captive animals later became candidates for release programs82 an opposing view encourages genetic mixing within captive populations especially for

compared to the same species in the wild85 animal protection advocates suggest that the mmpa be amended to direct and fund governme nt workshop to review the status of knowledge on survivorship in captive and wild marine mammal populations86 such workshop might determine what if any concerns are relevant to the performance of facilities holding such animals and influence the development of appropriate captive care and maintenance standards since only few wild populations are reported to have been studied well enough to provide conf ident data on survivorship such workshop likely would identify additional areas for research on wild populations to obtain data necessary for comparison air quality and ise at facilities based on speculation from human studies as well as limited

along the atlantic gulf of mexico and pacific coasts involve dozens of facilities that provide shortterm assistance to beached and stranded marine mammals when necessary to im prove their condition sufficiently to be able to return healthy animal to the wild 91 these critics suggest that veterinary examinations are unlikely to be able to pronounce captive animals diseasefree and that released animals are unlikely to be accepted easily or smoothly into the social st ructure of wild populations 92 while some coastal species may inhabit topographically diverse physical environment the open ocean is almost featureless some scientists suggest that emphasis should be placed on cleanliness space and behavioral responses rather than what humans might assume constitutes quality environment since most marine mammals get their stimulation from social interaction feeding etcrelease to the wild of marine mammals that have spent significant time in captivity88 recognizing the need to prevent the spread of disease and release of unfit animals some animal protection advocates may propose mmpa amendments authorizing oversight of rehabilitation and release activities requiring federal agency definition of rehabilitationrelease protocols89 and establishing scientific research permit for rehabilitation and release activities as well as for establishing rehabilitationrelease facilities for longcaptive marine mammals90 such facilities might also engage in captive rotation programs where animals are brought into captivity for predetermined amounts of time or are maintained in enclosures where they have periodic access to the open ocean propone nts contend that the existence and operation of such facilities under strict guidelines w ould promote the welfare of captive and freeliving marine mammals including threatened and endangered species some public display interests and few scientists however assert that rehabilitation and release does not work91 these critics cite research indicating that animals held in captivity for any length of time and those born in captivity are more likely to die upon release because they do not or are not able to make the necessary adjustments

are in providing sufficient space for animals to make normal postural and social adjustments or in allowing adequate freedom of movement these critics would like the mmpa to be amended to require aphis to define minimum acceptable levels of environmental and social stimuli for marine mammals the physical and social envir onment of any animal regulated by the mmpa it is argued should conform to some standard for what is minimally acceptable and strive for enrich ment to fulfill animals need s however establishing standards to respond to the differing requirements of various species may be complex for example while some contend that overall size of the captive environment is much more important than its features for cetaceans others believe that pinnipeds require more emphasis on geot opical elements in their artificial habitat rather than large enclosure in additi on it may be difficult or impossible to provide situations in captivity that permit the co mplex social systems

to 347 animals in 1998 and its summer range contractedenvironmental interests believe the level of detail available on subsistence takes for many alaska species could be improved in particular some animal protection interests scientists and ma nagers do not consider the fws program wellrun and would like to see this program improved some scientists believe that program for each species s hould include welldesigned harvest survey based on structured hunter samples from different communities that intensively exploit the targeted species with data analysis by good sta tistical methods to adequately fulfill management needs other scientific and environmental interests suggest that the mmpa be amended to require reporting marking tagging and sampling of all marine mammals taken by alaska natives for subsistence100 t h r s i n t h environmental and animal pr otection communities believe such reporting should be required for seal hunting and for any subsis tence takes of marine mammals by native americans in the contiguous states g washington oregon and california some scientists however contend that tagging of subsistence kills may not be practical for species taken in large numbers such as some seals and that the sheer volume of individuals subsistence ac tivities may lead to underreporting in addition some scientists nd managers believe that be tter subsistence

animals removed and 2 subsistence harvest may approach or exceed the pbr level101 limitation on the sale of edible subsistence takes in 16 usc 1371b2 the mmpa states that any edible portion of marine mammals may be sold in native villages and towns in alaska or for native consumption there are legitimate reasons why alaska natives purchase legally taken parts of marine mammals for their consumption102 the current interpretation of the mmpa language is that all alaska locales including the city of anchorage qualify as native villages and towns certain markets in anchorage sell large quantities of marine mammal meat and muktuk103 with few alaska natives allegedly hunting primarily to supply this commercial market104 scientists animal protection advocates and environmentalists

advocates are concerned that the makah seek to k ill whales without demonstrable proof of nutritional need but with an eye to the possibility of commercial trade in whale products to animal protecti

the makah situation native peoples in canada demanded their cultural right to return to whaling although norwegians icelandics faroese irish japanese russian and others assert cultural traditions in whaling their situati ons and that of canadian aboriginal groups differ from the makah in that right to whale has been acknowledged by treaty110 animal protection and some scientific interests suggest amending the mmpa to make clear distinction between nonsubs istence and subsistence whaling and to establish more stringent criteria for nons ubsistence whaling allowing only minimal token quotastakes

clarification requiring attention to both ethicstradition and biologyecology for re solution some of the confusion was created when the mmpa waived the moratorium on taking of marine mammals by alaska

animal protection community almost certainly would oppose ch proposal and some may even seek repeal of the 1994 amendments allowing the import of polar bear trophies from canada animal protection

incidentally take small numbers of marine mammals115 however the mmpa lacks comparable program to deal with large incidental takes other than those by the commercial fishing industry for more information s ee commercial fishin g interactions with marine mammals related to this the regulatory burden for protecting marine mammals appears to fall inequitably on diffe rent industries for example while small incidental take permits are regularly required by nmfs for offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities nmfs does not regulate large commercial vessel traffic under

harassment because mitigation measures imposed by nmfs on the activity prevent serious injury or mortality to marine mammals if it were proposed that the mmpa be amended to address this issue individuals who might be required to comply with these modified permitting procedures eg jet skis whalewatching vessels ocean transport vessels would likely oppose such change if the new requirements were viewed as imposing add itional or burdensome restrictions on their activities some environmen talists and animal protecti on advocates recognize that the permitting process is relatively inefficient way to mitigate impacts from vessel traffic and suggest that separate ma nagement scheme protective of marine mammals would be more appropriate to address both vesse lstrike and anthropogenic noise concerns noise and its effects noise as category of potential harm to marine mammals is unique in that sound propaga tes both horizontally nearat the surface and vertically down to s ubstantial depths anthr opogenic acoustics eg ship traffic military active sona r seismic exploration ex plosives trials acoustic harassment devices used by fishermen permeate the water column and have the potential to affect numerous unseen marine mammals fish diving birds and other marine life although it is difficult to m easure the potential that noise has to harm or harass unseen animals the us navy the minerals management service and other agencies have invested considerab time and funds on re search to develop monitoring capabilities and to document and quantify the impact from specific noise sources on certain species under known conditions118 however significant information remains lacking on sound impacts on cetaceans on behavioral and physiological reactions of marine

noise in their research as well as scientists consulting for industries and agencies eg the us navy that release large amounts of noise into the ocean 120 these advocates also assert that various ac

deterrents than anthropogenic noise eg concern over course deviations and other shortterm behavioral changes 121 see the previous section large incident takes which considers whether the mmpa should

any potential effect on marine mamma ls may propose amending the mmpa to simplify procedures for federal authorizati on of incidental taking from acoustic noise as one approach these scientists sugge

proposals might include revising the definiti on of level b harassment 16 usc 136218aii to be applicable to acti ons that can reasonably be expected to constitute significant threat only to marine

topic because insufficient resources to address the problem have been pr ovided by funding agencies they further question if funding were provided whethe r permits from nmfs and various institutional animal care and utilization committees mandated by the animal welfare act would allow necessary research to be conducted 130 other than perhaps taxpayer groupsfrequency active sonar exerci ses in madeira 2000 and the canary islands 2002 september 2002 beaked whale stranding in the gulf of california occurred concurrently when vesse l operated by columbia universitys lamontdoherty earth observatory pulsed the ocean with highpowered sound waves to map the lithosphere beneath the ocean floor124 more than five years of regulatory attention to deployment of low frequency active sonar by the us navy with accompanying legal challenges culminated in publi cation of final rule in july 2002125 with letters of authorization required fo r subsequent deployment126 in addition and in recognition of concerns ra ised in federal court127 over use of the lfa system and to further its commitment to responsible stewar dship of the marine environment the navy is preparing supplemental nvironmental impact statement on this technology128 some animal protection advocates environm entalists and scientists characterize many sources of anthropogenic noise in the ocean as increasingly persistent and regular these critics point to growin g body of evidence particularly the mass mortalities of beaked whales associated with military active sonar use as indicative that current mitigation practices are insufficiently protective of marine mammals believing that too little is known about th longterm effects of noise on marine mammals129 these critics believe precautionary approach is necessary and oppose any action that could be interpreted as liberalizing the regulation of anthropogenic sources in addition these critics are esp ecially concerned w ith lowfrequency sound that is produced at very high pressure leve ls and is designed to travel thousands of miles through the ocean as opposed to othe r anthropogenic noise that dissipates relatively quickly in the ocean furthermore these critics suggest that rather than exempting acoustic scientists from regulation and permitting additional sources of ocean noise other sources of nonresearchrelated noise s hould be more aggressively regulated to reduce this harassment variety of constituencies130 might support proposal to authorize and fund major re search effort directed at increasing understanding of the potential effects of anthropogenic noise sources on marine mammals research permits for nmfs and fws scientists the mmpa 16 usc 1374c3a provides lengthy pr ocess for issuing scientific research permits nmfs and fws are funded by congress to study marine mammals ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs36 131 some critics allege bias andor conflict of interest in current federal agency permitting procedures wherein applications for highly controversial research pass quickly and quietly through the review process when forwarded by field staff within the permitting agency while comparable proposals by nonagency resear chers can take months or longer to receive action 132 16 usc 1374 c3c 133 some agency managers suggest three days between receipt of permit application and publication in the federal register is reasonable and attainable 134 some but not all of this research may already be reviewed by institutional animal committees required by 7 usc 2143 or by animal care committees required by 42 usc 289dnecessary to provide sound basis for th eir conservation and management some federal scientists would like to see the mmpa amended to facilitate federal research on marine mammals by eliminating the cumbersome process of obtaining scientific research permits these federal resear chers question the necessity of requiring federal agency personnel to request permits from another part of their own agency before they can do their work these critics suggest that the mmpa be amended to provide scientists within the federal management agencies with blanket authorization for research others suggest that relief from the lengthy permitting process be extended to all those involved in conducting federally funded research this could include an exemption from permits or an expedited permit review procedure offering simpler issuance or renewal of permits for studies unchallenged by public comment it might also be applicable to state wildlife agencies when their scientists work in direct cooperation w ith one of the federal agencies some nonfederal scientists animal protection advocates and nvironmentalists argue that regular reporting as well as outside peer andor public review are especially necessary for government scientists who could be influenced by political considerations they also would object to preferential treatment of federal researchers as discriminatory arguing that federal research should be required to meet the same standards requirements and scrutiny as nonfederal research131 scientific research permits several issues concern the administration of scientific research permits by federal management agencies some scientists criticize fws and nmfs permit offices for delays in processing requests for scientific research permits even though the mmp mandates 30day deadline for agency action132 while some permits are processed quickly others may take many months longer they charge with explanati on or obvious differences between them critics report that the delay between submission of permit application and its publication in the federal register for public comment can be six weeks or more133 to assist the agencies in expediting the permit review process they suggest that the mmpa be amended to authorize committees of scientists that would review scientific research permit applications in the same fashion that committees review proposed research on human and animal subjects134 such committees might also be helpful in addressing concer ns about alleged misuse of sc ientific research permits by whalewatching operators dolphin encount er tour brokers and others wherein paying volunteers are recruited to help conduct research of questionable value although this latter issue coul d be addressed administratively some scientists believehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs37 135 also guam and the northern marian islands exercise similar authority 136 although the state of alaska began the pr ocess to request management authority for some marine mammal species state has b een granted such management authoritycongressional direction might be helpful or even necessary if administrative action is not forthcoming scientists are also concerned with permit restrictions that they interpret as constraining their ability to conduct manipulative nd invasive research on marine mammals albeit w ith adequate safeguards some scientists suggest that the entire scientific research permit process needs to be streamlined especially what are seen as 1 restrictive burdensome and unreasonable procedural requirements ie level of specificity and amount of paperwork related to justify level b harassment see also the discussion of harassment for bona fide research and 2 unduly tedious and specific requirements of the annual repor ting process scientists feel they are subjected to much more stringent regulatory regime g see also the discussion of noise and its effects than is imposed on activities that appear to be potentially more harmful to marine mammals eg commercial fishing on the other hand animal protection advocat assert that pe rmit processes and requirements are not too restrictive when it comes to invasive re search and both they and environmentalists argue that there is little justification for treating the research community as privileged while certain amendments might streamline the permitting process for certain research with low harassment potential or to establish streamlined programmatic permitting for certain kinds of research the environmental and animal protection communities both disa gree that research should be seen as having less of an impact on the marine environmental and marine mammals as general matter when compared to fishing or other human activities state approval of federal mmpa permits under the authority of the federal coastal zone mana gement act three states hawaii washington and alabama135 include in their state coastal plans the requirement that the state approve federal permits granted under the authority of the mmpa some scientists are concerned that state review of federal marine mammal permits is duplicative and burdensome for marine mammal researchers and circumvents the procedures in the mmpa 16 usc 1379 for granting state management authority over marine mammals136 these critics suggest that congress may wish to review whether this action improves protecti on for marine mammals program management and administration definition of take some scientists suggest it might be worthwhile to re evaluate the mmpa definition of take in their belief that the current definition may be overly broad and encompassing as we ll as unenforceable in many situations these critics suggest that the mmpa be amended to incorporate new definition of take that establishes an enforceable biologically significant standard for interactions with individual marine mammals for alisted and depleted species and for marine mammal populations for ll other species with such standard they argue management will focus specifically on interactions which are likely to have adversehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs38 137 some suggest limited mmpa amendment to permit importing of byproducts of aboriginal subsistence activities allowing fo r example ringed seal skins from canadian and greenland inuit subsistence hunters to enter us markets 138 the main concern by the wto appears to be that the mmpa prohibits trade in marine mammal products regardless of species conser vation status thus the united states may encounter difficulties in justifying the expansive mmpa ban on imports as necessary for responding to legitimate conservation concerns for those species where conservation is concern listing under the provides trade restrictions under cites 139 elements of acceptable harvest management might include sustainable kill based on sound science with adequate animal welfare sta ndards however some us scientists and managers might argue that for the united states to be able to certify that our own science meets these standards substantial expansion of us research programs might be requiredbiological significance for these animals however animal protection advocates and environmental groups might be anticipated to oppose any effort to redefine take that might be perceived as reduc ing the scope of activities pr ohibited or regulated under the mmpa trade in marine mamma l parts and products the us government has experienced pressure from the world trade organization wto regarding the trade barriers inherent in many us environmental statutes importing marine mammals and their products into the united states is prohibited by 16 usc 1371a except under special permits for scientific re

through the impose additional restrictions on trade of certain listed marine mammals given the desire of several nations to commercially trade in ma rine mammal products par ticularly whalemeat and pinniped products some suggest that cong ress could act to possibly forestall wto challenge to us prohibition of such trade by amending the mmpa to allow limited trade137 or in some other limited manner to make the mmpa more compatible with wto rules138 such proposed change would likely be vigorously opposed by some in the environmental scientific and animal protection communities who fear that opening us markets could promote increased kills in nations less protective of marine mammals139 they further assert that if such proposal were enacted us policy would be inconsistent prohibiting domestic commercial exploitation of marine mammals while encouraging or allowing foreign commerce in these same protected animals products in the united stat they also argue that the availability of foreign marine mammal pr oducts on the us market could encourage the illegal harvest of domestic marine mammals for these same markets an alternative although likely more difficult approach s eeks to broaden wto rules such that the mmpa could be found compatible management of robust stocks populations of california sea lions and pacific harbor seals have been increasing along the washington oregon

84page scientific document on management conflicts related to rapidly increasing populations of west coast harbor seals and california sea lions140 how to manage these stocks is expected to be an issue during mmpa reaut horization the issue is seen by some as whether an increasing human population on the west coast can coexist with truly robust pinniped population or whether these pinnipeds will be adversely affected by coastal development and marine resource exploitation or will themselves have an adverse effect on coastal resources141 while some local residents and fishermen fear that these pinniped stocks may be overpopulating scien tists environmentalists nd animal protection advocates counter that populations may be merely returning to thei r historic carrying capacities after overexploitation diminished their abundance earlier in the 20th century fishing industry or local government officials may propose that the mmpa be amended to permit selective culling or additional lethal nuisance animal control nmfs has recommended that congress consider amending the mmpa to create new framework that would allow state and federal resource managers to immediately address sitespecific conflic ts involving california s ea lions and pacific harbor seals142 in this report nmfs suggests that streamlined approach provide procedures for lethal removal of these species where they are harming severely depleted salmonids including some popula tions listed as threatened or endangered under the where they are harming sa lmonid populations identified as being of special concern by states and where they are in conflict with human activities while the mmpa in 16 usc 1389 already provide s for the lethal removal of pinnipeds to protect human safety and fish stocks fe deral and state managers view the process for implementing the existing provisions as lengthy and overly cumbersome environmental animal protec tion and scientific critics however condemn the idea of culls and lethal nuisance animal control as excessive they believe that such an approach deflects resources from addressi ng other expensive and contentious human activities that contribute to fish stock d eclines eg habitat degradation siltation water diversions fish pa ssage at dams overfishing143 and that nonlethal deterrents have not been adequately explored furthermore they express concern that authorizing the killing of marine mammals in teracting with wild fish stocks appears counter to the mmpas mandate to manage on an ecosystem basis144 in addition these critics are adamant that nuisance animal control not be authorized for humanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs40 145 in addition international dialogue on whal conservation has occurred under the auspices of the international

international coopera tion between the united states and foreign countries on marine mammal issues under the mmpa intern ational cooperation funding exchange programs and cooperative research has been limited largely to the industrycentered dolphintuna issue145 mmpa funds for such activities are at least an order of magnitude less than the millions of dollars in federal us endangered species funds that are used to foster in ternational cooperation to protect elephants tigers rhinoceros great apes and other species146 proponents of increased international cooperation ar gue that similar progra m for marine mammals is provided in the mmpa or elsewhere in us law for example although the us managed north atlantic right whale is endangered and its population is not reboundi ng the southern right whale population is flourishing brazilian right whale project focuses on reducing humanwhale interactions where ship strikes have been major cause of death cooperative activities that might be promoted include sharing whale monitoring and collision avoidance procedures as well as whale reproduction health and population inform ation with latin american authorities marine mammal scientists suggest that congress may want to consider the benefits of encouraging internationa l cooperative relationships on marine mammals by us agencies most marine mammal constitu encies appear supportive of efforts to encourage more internationa l cooperation as long as ch action does not promote invasive research or commercial ventures some also suggest there may be critical need for expanding international cooperative programs for arctic species because of the virtual total demise of russian research and manage ment programs and the incr easing pressure by protein impoverished native peoples to take thes species for subsistence purposes many of these species are shared because their ranges include the waters of both the united states and the russian federation decline of russian management effort has hampered population ssessment programs for these shared species critics however warn that if congress acts in this area specific language might need to be incorporated to preven t potential abuse ie expenditure of funds intended to recover and prot ect us marine mammal st ocks on questionable studies of exotic marine mammals in interesting places and to require appropriate guidance and accountability to ensure that internati onal efforts are recipr ocal and relevant harassment the 1994 mmpa amendments revised the definition of harassment to distinguish between two levels of interaction those with the potential to injure level harassment and those with the potential to disturb levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs41 147 16 usc 136218 148 in addition some scientists believe the current definition is meaningless and possibly counterproductive these critics suggest that an expert panel be convened to redefine this term 149 for example animal protection advocates report that pod of perhaps 5075 spinner dolphins in calexico bay hawaii can be surrounded on some days by as many as 50 swimmers 35 kayaks and several motorpropelled boats on other days more than about 20 dolphins come into the bay where they are pursued from early morning until late afternoon when they leave the bay nmfs doesnt have an enforcement agent on the big island where these violations occur and an agent from the hawaii department of land and natural resources is responsible fo r responding to possible violations 150 others suggest the problem is regulatory wondering why us agencies do not adopt an approach similar to that of mexico where the number of vessels that can be in the proximity of any whale or group of whales is strictly limited and enforced some suggest that the revised operational guidelines for whalewatchi ng vessels in the northeastern united states 64 fed reg 2927029271 june 1 1999 are positive step and that additional region or areaspecific guidelines or regulations of similar nature should be developed 151 others however find mmpa management inconsistent in making it illegal to swim with wild dolphins who willingly approach humans while allowing commercial ventures to hold dolphins captive and charge humans fo r the chance to swim with them 152 current requirements for prosecuting harassm ent violations are stringent requiring timedatestamped video of the incident and court appearance by the complainant to testify against the offenderb harassment147 some federal manage rs have found the new definition of level b harassment to be particularly difficult to enforce148 and potentially harmful human interaction with marine mammals continues149 other critics suggest whalewatching vessels are insufficiently monitored for compliance with mmpa regulations150 animal protection advocates suggest that the mmpa should be amended to require specific and more strictly enforced regulations concerning swimmer151 kayaker and boater harassment of dolphins and whales including provisions to significantly increase the possible fines against comme rcial operators who introduce large groups of swimmers into protected bays where dol phins rest others suggest authorizing more funding specifically targeted to be tter educate private watercraft operators concerning mmpa regulations and to increase mmpa enforcement efforts152 including additional observers aboard whal ewatching vessels to assess compliance some scientists on the other hand woul d like to see the definition of level b harassment revised to where it would be pplicable only to situations where actions would reasonably be expected to constitute significant threat to an entire marine mammal stock rather than to just few individual animals changes to the harassment definition applicable to military readiness operations and to scientific research activities conducted by or on behalf of the federal government were enacted in 319a of pl 108136 the new language defines harassment as any action that injures or has the significant potential to injure marine mammals rather than any action that has the potential to injure environmental and animal pr otection organizations generally oppose the modified definition of harassment arguing that it raises the burden of proof that military readiness activity would affect marine mammal making it more

that such changes are premised on an unrealistically high assessment of our ability to differentiate between biologically significant and insignificant responses by doing so they believe the modified definition effectively reverses the precautionary burden of proof that has been the hallmark of the mmpa since its inception supporters of the modifi ed definition believe that it ensures that activities are restricted only when scientific evidence demonstrates that such protection is necessary these changes re main highly contr oversial and could be revisited during mmpa reauthorization management cons istency between fws and nmfs the division of responsibility for various marine mamma l species between nmfs and fws is provided for in 16 usc 136212 within th definition of secretary when the mmpa was enacted in 1972 this division of species was seen as artificial and temporary by many in congress and the administration awaiting the creation of contemplated department of environment and natural re sources in addition the differing management appro aches taken by nmfs and fw s have often confused the commercial fishing industr and alaska natives154 some native american and scientific interests suggest that it may be time for congress to revisit this division of management responsibility and consider amending the mmpa to promote greater consistency in marine mammal management several approaches are suggested including the current movement toward an ecosystem approach to managing living resources and minimizing possible conflicts of interest where marine mammals and fisheries interact that may have bear ing on which agency should manage which species or groups thereof others suggest that nmfs and fws might be directed to develop joint regulations for all their marine mammal programs to achieve greater consistency in ma nagement policy155 directed research program although the mmpa emphasizes research it does not create national integrated marine mammal research program emphasizing this need recommendation in the secretary of commerces february 1999 report to congress included list of in formation needs with suggestion as to how or by whom

ed that congress might wish to consider whether these information needs should b ecome the focus of an mmpa amendment creating national integrated research pr ogram possibly under the direction of the independent marine mammal commission with specific funding authorized157 federal agency roles some scientists suggest that conflicting federal agency interests may hamper marine mamma l protection and recovery one example of an interagency issue where conflicting agency authority may be problematic relates to understandi ng and addressing the potential for endocrine disruption in marine mammals158 some critics suggest that the mmpa be amended to direct an external panel eg the marine ma mmal commission or the national academy of sciences to carefully review the programs and proce dures of federal management agencies for potential conflicting interests among their management regulation permit administration scien tific research and funding ro with respect to marine mammals and recommend actions that should be taken to address any problems identified agency delays in compliance with mmpa deadlines various constituencies were frustrated over federal agency delays in implementing provisions of the 1994 mmpa amendments see 1994 mmpa reauthorization for more detail this led to critics within the conservation and animal protection communities as well as the fishing industry to seek additional means to force nmfs and fws to comply with mmpa deadlines159 these agencies contend in reply that the problem can be traced to limited funds provided by congress to finance these activities160 for more information on funding concerns s ee the following section appropriation of agency funding others suggest that the pattern of repeated failure to complete assigned tasks on time should first be ddressed through an office of management and budget or similar study on overall agency administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs44 appropriation of agency funding an issue that nmfs fws and the mmc might raise during reauthorization discu ssions is that in an era of stable or slightly declining federal appropriations federal agen cy responsibilities and duties have expanded much faster than their budget s for example requirements for stock assessments of all marine mammal populations observer m onitoring aboard the us commercial fishing fleet and administration of an expanding mmpa permit program place significant demands on federal agency resources specifically implementing the provisions of the mmpa is significan t undertaking requiring the coordination among headquarters and regional offices of nmfs and fws as well as with the mmc nmfs and fws may claim that th ey are underfunded and that delays in implementing th 1994 mmpa amendm ents were directly tied to budgetary constraints in addition some scientists environmen tal interests and animal protection advocates assert that congress will to implement the mmpa through the appropriations process has not kept p ace with the desire expressed in the authorization process providing insu fficient funding for federal management programs and thereby exposing federal agencies to harsh criticism when they fail to meet public expectations some suggest th at congress might consider amending the mmpa to increase the authorization of appropriations for marine mammal programs of nmfs fws and the mmc increasing the actual funds appr opriated under these authorizations or including specific instru ctions about how funds are to be used congressional outlook congress has enacted measures to protect marine mammals including specifically the mmpa while the history of the mmpas implementation includes numerous court challenges to agency inte rpretation of congressi onal intent congress generally

similar recommendation specifically acoustics and noiserecommendation 20 8 congress should increase support for research into ocean acoustics and the potential impacts of noise on marine mammals this funding should be distributed across several agencies including the national science foundation us geological survey and minerals management service to decrease the reliance on us navy research in this area the research programs should be well coordinated across the government and examine range of issues relating to noise generated by scientific commercial and operational activitiesno similar recommendationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs48 issue us commission on ocean policy pew oceans commission and toxics similar recommendation sufficient resources should be devoted to studying the effects of toxic substances in the marine environment needed research includes the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and other toxic substances on marine mammals particularly in the polar regions conservation decision makingno similar recommendation core cons ervation decisions should be made by nmfs or revamped fishery service within new independent oceans agency these decisions should originate at the regional offices with oversight by the national headquarters office at minimum these decisions include setting specific protected species requirements threatened and endangered marine mammals sea turtles seabirds and fish regulation of soundno similar recommendation activities that generate significant amounts of potentially harmful sound should be regulated consistent with the requirements of federal law including the marine mammal protection act permits streamline an interagency processrecommendation 20 6 the national marine fisheries service and the us fish and wildlife service should implement programmatic permitting for activities that affect marine mammals wherever possible more resource intensive casebycase permitting should be reserved for unique activities or where circumstances indicate greater likelihood of harm to marine mammals the national ocean council should create an interagency team to recommend activities appropriate for programmatic permitting those that are inappropriate and those that are potentially appropriate pending additional scientific information enforcement efforts should also be strengthened and the adequacy of penalties reviewedno similar recommendationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30120crs49 issue us commission on ocean policy pew oceans commission clarify what activities require permitsrecommendation 20 4 congress should amend the marine mammal protection act to require the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to more clearly specify categories of activities that are allowed without permit those that require permit and those that are prohibitedno similar recommendation attention to bycatch reductionrecommendation 19 25 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration working with the us fish and wildlife service and the us department of state should design national plan of action for the united states that implements and is consistent with the international plans of action adopted by the united nations food and agriculture organization and its 1995 code of conduct for responsible fisheries this national plan should stress the importance of reducing bycatch of endangered species and marine mammalsno similar recommendation
