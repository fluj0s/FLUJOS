from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to stefan rahmstorf rahmstorfozeanklimade subject re wg1ar4ch06 followup from christchurch date mon 19 dec 2005 213237 0700 cc wg1ar4ch06jossucaredu xflowed hi stefan and team great david rind is getting the solar forcing series jour latest lean i expect keith back on line soon and then he can help us figure out what type of simulations wed like and what other forcings we ought to use my take is that it would be good to use the same forcing used in the runs currently in fig 610 or at least the best of those runs subjective im sure and all with the old larger amplitude lean solar but with the new reduced amplitude forcing fig 610 currently has the bauer et 2003 run w climber is it climber2 couldshould we just rerun with the new solar in place of the old solar i dont have the paper here was the solar used scaled to lean ill cc this to the entire team as there might be other ideas on how to do this i think we would want two simulations over the last 400 years one w the old lean solar one with the new if we could use one of the existing plotted runs as the old lean run then we only need one new run the idea is to show what difference tar solar old lean vs ar4 solar new lean means so lets see what keith and others say and then line things up to get the run done if we can do it w climber great if we need to involve another emic assuming were not going to get aogcm run done in less than month then we need to line that up whatever model we use it should be one already in use by the ar4 so we dont have to worry about the results being published just the model make sense thanks again for the quick reply best peck dear jonathan concerning item 8 we can deliver millennium simulation with any given forcing provided to us within days actually takes just about 1 hour to run on the computer with climber2 cheers stefan jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu _______________________________________________ wg1ar4ch06 mailing list wg1ar4ch06jossucaredu httpwwwjossucaredumailmanlistinfowg1ar4ch06 xflowed
