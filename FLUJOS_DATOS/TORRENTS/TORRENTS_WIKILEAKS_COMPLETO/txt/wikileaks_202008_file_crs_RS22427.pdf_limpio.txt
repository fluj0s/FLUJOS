chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 11 usc 1101 et seq corporate management oversees the reorganizati on althoug h trustee is always appointed in chapter 7 chapter 11 is premised on the supposition that reorganiza tion is most likely to be successful and creditors and the public are most likely to benefit from continued operation of the business by existing management2 under chapter 11 manage

bankruptcy see crs report rl33138 continuedwhen company files for reorganization all of its operations may be s ubject to the courts oversight but by practice and design the court holds hearings to review only those activities outside of the ordinary course of business or that by statute requires court authorization such as sales of assets or the assumption or re jection of executory contracts one treatise states that the discretion to act with regard to ordinary business matters without prior court appr oval has been said to be at the heart of the powers of trustee or debtor in possession and cour ts have shown reluctance to interfere or to permit other parties in interest to interfere in the making of routine daytoday business decisions4 so when debtor files under chapter 11 it receives permission pursuant to 11 usc 503 to continue its operations includi ng the payment of management and non management employees permi ssion to continue operations in bankruptcy is granted as part of firstday orders5 recent highprofile bankruptcy reorganizations such as those in the airline and auto industries however frequently result in significant reductions in wide spectrum of jobs and employee benefits including wages retirement and health benefits in climate of employee financial loss there has been increasing scrutiny of the compensation of the executives who seek bankruptcy courts permission to reduce employee compensation especially through the rejection of collective bargaining agreements cbas6 indeed the general issue of the growth of executive co mpensation in relation to value provided and nonmanagerial employee compensation is one that receives considerable scrutiny outside of bankruptcy7 postfiling expenses incurred in the operation of the business may be considered administrative expenses with respect to an individual executives claim for any non routine compensation like all bankruptcy claims its disposition may depend upon many factors such as when and how it was earned andor paid that is before or after the bankruptcy filing nonroutine postpetition payments are generally subject to greater scrutiny by the court and prepetition payments to more limited extent may be subject to avoidance neverthele ss retention bonuses and similar compensation for executives are commonly sought and approved by the courts8 but they may be challenged by partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22427crs3 8 continued employmentrelated i ssues in bankruptcy by robin jeweler 9 for more background on delphi and the automotive industry see crs report rl 33169

corporation the largest usbased auto motive parts manufacturer which filed on october 8 20059 the bankruptcy court has for example authorized both an executive incentive compensation program and an early retirement incentive plan for 13000 employees amendments to executive compensation in the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act bapcpa enacted on april 20 2005 and taking effect on october 17 2005 the bapcpa imposed new limitations on nonroutine executive compensation10 amendments to 11 usc 503c limit both the circumstances under which severa nce and retention payments may be made to debtors officers and directors as well as the amount of such payments subject to court approval based on evidence in the record retention pa yments may only be made when essential to retain the individual because he or she has bona fide job offer from another business at the same or greater salary the services are essential to the survival of the business and the payment is less than 10 times the amount paid to similar nonmanagement employees in the preceding year or if retention bonuses were paid in the preceding year then more than 25 of any similar executive be nefit in the preceding year 503c1 severance payments may not be made unless the paymen t is part of program generally applicable to full time employees and is limited to 10 times the average amount of severance payments made 503c2 other payments outside the ordinary cour of business including payments to executives officers managers and consultants who are hired after the bankruptcy filing may not be made unless they are justified by the facts and circumstances of the case 503c3 the statute as amended by the bapcpa imposes the highest burden of proof on retention payments ie the individual must be found to be essentia l to the business and have another job offer whic h must be supported by evidentiary findings introduced into the record severance payments are capped nd must be available to all nonmanagement employees as well other payments outside the ordinary course of business must be justified s 2556hr 5113 limitations on compensation section 4 of the proposed bills would amend 11 usc 503 c1 to broaden the requirements imposed on retention payments to include performan ce incentive or other bonus or any other compensation enhancement thus any bonus or incentive would require an evidentiary finding that the executive had nother job offer and that his or her services are essentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22427crs4 11 broadening the scope of compensation enhanc ements subject to 503c may make sense since one treatise predicts that the narro w scope of subsections 503c1 and c2 will basically result in the elimination of progra ms that provide compensation to officers for remaining employed with the debtor or that pr ovide severance when such persons leave it speculates that different methods of inducing mana gers to stay with the debtor will need to be found 4503 c ollier on bankruptcy 15th ed rev 503174 12 for example would the judge look to exec utive compensation at comparable businesses outside of bankruptcy or mandate comparable management and nonmanagement benefit reductions for the individual debtor to the survival of the business these payments would also be subject to the 10times multiplier or 25 cap in subsection c1c11 section 4 would replace the requirement in subsection c3 that payments outside the ordinary course of business be justifie d by the facts and circumstances of the case the new standard would disallow all pre and postpetition transfers or obligations for the benefit of officers manage rs and consultants whether w ithin or without the ordinary course of business unless the court makes an evidentia ry finding on the record without deference to the debtors request that the payments are essential to the survival of the business or in liquidation ssential to maximize the value of the estate and in either case because the services provided are esse ntial and the payments are reasonable under the circumstances under current law the court may authoriz pursuant to 503b1 the payment of wages salaries and commissions for servi ces rendered after commencement of the case subsection c3 disallows other transfers out side of the ordinary course of business unless justified by facts and circumstances of the case the revised language would disallow other transfers or obligations whet her or not outside th ordinary course of business there is some ambiguity as to whether that language includes wages and salaries referred to in subsection b which are generally considered to be obligations in the ordinary course of business the amendments are very broad in natu re and appear to repudiate the underlying theory that the debtors management is be st positioned to reorganize it instead of overseeing the ongoing operations of the debt or the bankruptcy judge would be charged with holding hearings to determine an appr opriate level of compen sation for the debtors executives the standard by which the judg would determine the appropriate level of executive compensation is not specified in the provision12 proponents of the bill are likely to support new increasingly adversarial approach to establishing and possibly limiting executive compensation for the reorganizing debtor many will view this approach as more equitable given the financial sacrifices that many nonmanagement employees are required to make some may feel that bankruptcy courts oversight of executive compensation has often been inadequate andor ineffective and that the growth in executive compensation in relation to the value of services provided is simply not justified within or without of bankruptcy thes changes would be consistent with view that corporate bankruptcy is not result of business conditions beyond managerial control and that they should be requi red to have greater financial stake in

more of the debtors assets for other business purposes incl uding distribution to the debtors creditors like many vexing problems such as pension underfunding nd health insurance costs many will question whether perceived imbalances in executive compensation are best addressed in bankruptcy opponents are likely to object on the ground that lengthy compensation proceedings will substan tially increase the costs of bankruptcy administration the specter of these proceed ings may diminish managerial zeal for reducing nonmanagement employ ee benefits in the course of reorganization whether that will actually benefit or hinder the likelihood of successful reorganization is impossible to predict some will argue that talented managerial executives will simply opt out of troubled businesses to void the bankruptcy process all together that could leave the struggling business enterprise in the hands of those who have few options the greater philosophical and policy questions are whether if debtors avoid re organization they will have greater or lesser like lihood of maintaining solvency and staying in business and which is more desirable outcome treatment of foreign affiliates section 5 of the bills would require the bankruptcy court to specifically consider in two situations the ongoing impact on the debtor of the debtors relationship with all subsidiaries and affiliates regardless of whether they are domestic or foreign or whether they are in bankruptcy the first would be in the determination of whether to permit debtor to reject collective bargaining agreement under 11 usc 1113 the second is in connection with debtors application to modify retiree health bene fits under 11 usc 1114 the law generally accepts corporation as freestanding legal entity although there is large body of law that considers wh and where it is appr opriate to pierce the corporate veil and view separately incorporated entities as sharing assets andor liabilities general discussion of this body of law is beyond the scope of this report13 the language of the bill does not suggest that the assets or liabilities of affiliates and subsidiaries be consider ed those of the debtor14 hence how the court is to evaluate the impact of the debtors relationship with subsidiaries and affiliates for purposes of deciding matters before it is not explained the specific operation of this provision though not immediately apparent may be developed as the legisla tion wends its way through the legislative process
