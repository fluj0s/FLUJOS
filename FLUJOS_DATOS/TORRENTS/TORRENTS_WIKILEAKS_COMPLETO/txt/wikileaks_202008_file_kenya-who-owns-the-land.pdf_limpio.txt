who owns the land blood and soil issues in the kenyan rift valley part 1 the passion with which millions of citizens valued their presidential vote in the stolen 2007 presidential elections can be reflected in scenes of the bloody postelection clashes today that engulfed rift valley nyanza coast nairobi western and to less extent in other parts of the country nakuru was the latest epicenter of inter ethnic murders the violent reactions to rigged elections may reflect the pain of deep and historically rooted injustices some of which predate kenyas independence in 1963 they are in fact motivated and exacerbated by landlessness joblessness and poverty believed to be heavily contributed towards by the prevailing political status quo that has dominated kenya since independence this is system that has continuously perpetrated in successive fashion socioeconomic injustices that have been seamlessly transferred from one power regime to the next the land issue with fast growing population in kenya limited resources including land and jobs have severely been put in extreme pressure responsive political operatives cognizant of this reality have appreciated the importance of incorporating progressive policies that seek to aggressively address poverty landlessness unequal distribution of resources and unemployment as matter of priority in their party manifestoes if any social stability is to be maintained in kenya without doubt the opposition party odm sold an attractive campaign package that sought to address historic land injustices unemployment inequitable resource sharing and poverty through radical constitutional transformation under the framework of the peopletailored bomas constitution draft odm proposed to tackle the land problem through clauses in the bomas draft captured under devolution and land chapters with specific plans to form national land commission to address the issue of landlessness and historic injustices of expropriation of native land by colonial and postcolonial powers the roots of the land conflicts in rift valley land lie with the former colonial power britain postindependence land policies by the jomo kenyatta daniel moi and mwai kibaki administrations and the tendency for ethnic favouritism and patronage by power wielders colonial expropriation of native lands in rift valley and coast in nutshell the british settlers literally grabbed native maasai and kalenjin lands in rift valley and mijikenda taita and taveta land at the coast at the coast there was also the added grabbing hand of the middleeast sultans who lay claim to another coastal strip millions of voters from these commu nities now deeply affected by landlessness and poverty are today largely drawn towards odms reform policies that seek to address these injustices long before independence vast arable tracts of the rift valley were designated as white highlands reserved for european settlers the pastoralist commu nities mainly kalenjin and maasai were simply moved away the 1904 and 1911 anglomaasai land agreements details the unjust grabbing of maasai lands in laikipia naivasha ngong karen and tracts along the uganda railway line whereby uneducated maasai laibons either friendly to or fearful of the british christened paramount chiefs like lenana ole mbatian were cajoled and intimidated into giving away native fertile maasai land to the colonialists the words in the agreements read like w the undersigned being the laibons of clans of maasai have of our own free will decided that it is for our best interests to remo ve our peo ple flocks and herds into definite reservations away from the railway line and away from european settlements and in conclusion we wish to state that we are quite satisfied with the foregoing arrangement and we bind ourselves and our successors as well as our peo ple to observe them as long as the maasai as race shall exist the next thing we knew was that the maasai were crumbled into arid portions of present day kajiado and narok districts grazing fields and the very pastoral lifestyle of the maasai instantly became threatened and continues to do so as we speak without any restitution compensation or proactive rehabilitation into another life 100 years later when asked to address this burning maasai land issue former lands minister appointed by mwai kibaki mr amos kimunya now finance minister once told the maasai that there was nothing to address since the wise maasai forefathers had given away their land to the british in binding agreemen t which continues to apply to date well similar horrid but true stories applied in kalenjin lands of rift valley and at the coast too before independence kenyan political parties argued over whether the native land should be returned to the indigenous population under federalist system of government or kept firmly under the control of centralised state needless to add those who favoured the latter option in the form of the kenya african national union kan u which went on to form government under jomo kenyatta prevailed part 2 1963 independence enter jomo kenyatta and gema landbuying companies trouble is we had majimbo constitution at independence jennifer widner explained in her 1992 book the rise of partystate in kenya from harambee to nyayo that kanu urged central control of all regions in an effort to forestall local majimbo legislation restricting land transfer to those born in the area and to maintain the foothold of the partys kikuyu supporters in the rift valley land market many settlers were returning to britain kenyatta and his cronies quickly formed the settlement transfer fund schemes stfs and asked the british for loan to the kenyan government to buy off land from colonial settlers returning to britain good idea up to this point britain having been reassured by kenyatta that those settlers still wishing to stay on in kenya would not have their land repossessed advanced the money this money was used to buy settler land which was officially sold into the kenyatta initiated settlement transfer fund schemes stfs next kenyatta began to give away and sell for peanuts these government stfsacquired former colonial land parcels to himself his family and cronies around 1964 and 1965 this is the point when the rain started beating kenya kenyattas then vice president jaramogi oginga odinga cried foul and rejected these acts of wanton land grabbing the opportunity to choose nationalism and selflessness over greed and ethnic tendencies was lost rather than address this land issue once and for all kenyatta opted to replace the settler colonialist in land they had initially grabbed from natives we have began harvesting the seeds of the mustard sown by kenyatta in the 1960s it will not be sweet at all the seroneys and other nandi and kipsigis leaders imme diately cried foul when kenyatta ensued in his land grabbing tendencies so were many maasai and mijikenda leaders like ronald ngala their cries were feeble and over run today and tomorrow their descendants will demand justice and restitution in an exercise that threatens to tear apart kenyas social fabric who will shoulder the burden of the fruits enjoyed by kenyatta and his cronies moi and his cronies and kibaki and his latter day cronies will it be the poor kenyan taxpayer taking the bill in form of blood and more taxes going backdown memory lane in the imme diate postindependence era the moment the seroneys and ogingas started crying foul and nothing was done we entered dangerous phase of our nations sociopolitical path the political leadership of kenya began carving out into two distinct groups the prokenyatta land beneficiaries sycophants and apologists were tom mboya daniel moi paul ngei and others another force resisting the greedy postindependence governance by kenyatta was led by jaramogi oginga odinga and included several former kadu operatives like ronald ngala jean marie seroney masinde muliro martin shikuku and others kenyatta soldiered on with his grabbing he concurrently went ahead with the help of tom mboya to change the constitution to give immense imperial powers to the presidency he further began using such powers to allocate more land to his cronies and sycophants his salivating appetite for rift valley land largely motivated his choice of rift valley natives as vice president after oginga odinga first he chose maasai joseph murumbi who read the scheme of landbetrayal on his people and resigned in huff then kenyatta selected daniel arap moi tugen not drawn in the nandi and kipsigis land battles as his next loyal vp he then descended upon grabbing rift valley and coastal land in business as usual and mtafanya nini attitude that kibaki is trying to emulate today kenyatta cronies including mbiyu koinange njoroge mungai and others devised clever scheme to further benefit themselves from the land transferred from the colonialists they formed landbuying companies through loans which were actually funded with taxpayer money at the height of land buying companies most of the power brokers acquired huge chunks of land at the expense of the landless who were meant to be the initial beneficiaries of the scheme acco rding to widner in her book by 1971 more than 60 largescale farms around nakuru and 40 of small scale settler farms were held by kikuyu who fared very well from this arrangement at the expense of other kenyan commu nities another scholar noted that using the political and economic leverage available to them during the kenyatta regime the kikuyu took advantage of the situation and formed many landbuying companies these companies would throughout the 1960s and 1970s facilitate the settlement of hundreds of thousands of kikuyu in the rift valley wrote walter oyugi in politicised ethnic conflict in kenya periodic phenomenon in 1969 jean marie seroney leading nandi politician and mp issued the nandi hills declaration laying claim to all settlement land in the district for the nandi his demands went unheeded aping the british kenyatta government used policy of divideandrule to neutralise such opposition by parcelling out land to other ethnic groups and thus winning their allegiance daniel arap moi the then tugen vicepresident was allocated the settler farms of the lembus forest and the essa geri salient to divide the tugen from the nandi like seroney part 3 the grabbers of the rift valley most of the power brokers in the kenyatta regime who formed landbuying companies established huge farms in the rift valley either jointly or on their own they included njenga karume the then chairman of gema holdings who acquired 20000 acres in molo where he is growing tea coffee pyrethrum and potatoes and 16000 acres in naivasha gg kariuki acquired his 5000 acres at rumuruti laikipia division while former attoneygeneral charles njonjo bought into the 100000 acre solio ranch dont forget grabbing of settler land in central by many colonial collaborators at the expense of the mau mau fighters was part of the scheme senior chief munyinge from muiga took 400 acres initially senior chief munyinge was allocated only 70 acres but with time he managed to acquire 330 more acres mwai kibaki acquired 20000 acres in nanyuki former mp the late munene kairu has 32000 acres at rumuruti mr isaiah mathenge

ngatende former government engineer has 500 acres too mathenge also ownsjointly with former provincial commissioner lukas daudi galgalothe 10 000acre manyagalo ranch in meru back in rift valley as jaramogi and the rest of kenyans were saying not yet uhuru it was land grabbing business as usual landbuying companies were heisting big the result was big acquisitions for instance munyeki farmwhich stands for muranga nyeri kiambu 4000 acres wamuini farm 6000 acres amuka farm 2000 acres gituaraba farm and githatha farm 1000 acres each and gema holdings 12000 acres few of them are being utilized

spanning both taita and taveta districts safely watched by his soninlaw and former mp marsden madoka and another close friend to uhuru kenyatta and current minister in kibakis coalition government naomi shaban part 4 kenyattas land holdings kenyas two former first families and the family of president mwai kibaki are among the biggest landowners in the country the extended kenyatta family alone owns an estimated 500000 acres approximately the size of nyanza province according to estimates by independent surveyors and ministry of lands officials this report first appeared in the standard newspaper report by mr otsieno namwaya the kibaki and moi families also own large tracts most held in the names of sons and daughters and other close family members all concentrated within the 172 of kenya that is arable or valued remember that 80 per cent of all land in kenya is mostly arid and semi arid land acco rding to the kenya land alliance more than 65 of all arable land in kenya is in the hands of only 20 per cent of the 35 million kenyans that has left millions absolutely landless while another 67 per cent on average own less than an acre per person the building land crises in the country experts say will be difficult to solve because the most powerful people in the country are also among its biggest landowners the tracts of land under the kenyatta family are so widely distributed within the numerous members in various parts of the country that it is an almost impossible task to locate all of them and establish their exact sizes during kenyattas 15year tenure in state house he used the elaborate stfs scheme funded by the world bank and the british government to acquired large pieces of land all over the country other tracts he easily allocated to his family among the bestknown parcels owned by kenyattas family for instance are the 24 000 acres in taveta subdistrict adjacent to the 74 000 acres owned by former mp basil criticos others are 50 000 acres in taita that is currently under mrs beth mugo an assistant minister of education and niece of kenyatta 29 000 acres in kahawa sukari along the nairobithika highway the 10 000 acre gichea farm in gatundu

000acre ranch in naivasha there is another 200 acres in mombasa and 250 acres in malindi other pieces of land owned by the kenyatta family include the 52000acre farm in nakuru and 20000acre one also known as gichea farm in bahati under kenyattas daughter margaret besides mama ngina kenyatta widow of the former president owns another 10 000 acres in rumuruti while close relative of the kenyatta family mrs kamau has 40000 acres in endebes in the rift valley province uhuru owns 5000 acres in eldoret 3000 acres in rongai and 12000 acres in naivasha 100 acres in karen and 200 acres in dagoretti 1000acre farm in dagoretti is owned by kenyattas first wife wahu it is also understood that part of the land on which kenyatta and jomo kenyatta universities are constructed initially belonged the criticos family the government bought the land from him in 1972 under the settlement transfer fund scheme and transferred to the kenyatta family the same day criticos sold it to the government land for the two universities was subsequently sold partly and portion donated by the family part 5 kibakis and mois land grabbing one of president kibakis earliest grabs is the 1200acre gingalily farm along the nakurusolai road and in the 1970s kibaki who was then the minister for finance under kenyatta via stfs transferred to himself 10000 acres in bahati from the then agriculture minister bruce mckenzie kibaki also owns another 10000 acres at igwamiti in laikipia and 10000 acres in rumuruti in naivasha these are in addition to the 1600 acre ruare ranch just next to kibakis bahati land are mois 20000 acres although his best known piece of land is the 1600 kabarak farm on which he has retired it is one of the most well utilised farms in the area with wheat maize and dairy cattle the former president owns another 20000 acres in olenguruoni in rift valley on which he is growing tea and has also built the kiptakich tea factory torched early 2008 post election violence he also has some 20 000 acres in molo he also has another 3 000acre farm in bahati on both sides of the nakurunyahururu road where he grows coffee and some 400 acres in nakuru on which he was initially growing coffee the former president also owns the controversy ridden 50 000 acre ol pajeta farmpart of which has ol pajeta ranch in rumuruti laikipia some time in 2004 moi put out an advert in the press warning the public that some unknown people were subdividing and selling it can solutions be found to address these land problems this is clearly sociopolitical problem that requires political solution it involves digging up the archives consulting experts policy makers local politicians and community elders to find comprehensive solution such formulated blueprints can then be sold to kenyans of all creed race religion and ethnicity in publicity campaign that seeks to draw in as many supporters as possible responsive political party genuinely keen to tackle this tough problem can actually sell comprehensive and just land reform policy as part of its manifesto these must be cognizant of the constitutional implications concerned in addressing past and present land issues what we are witnessing in rift valley may just escalate to new heights considering the fundamental weight of the underlying blood and soil issue of land
