status of the 368 million americans aged 65 and older who were living in households in 20071 older persons receive income from variety of sources including earnings pensions personal savings and public programs such as so cial security and supplemental security income the substantial variation in the number of people receiving income from each source and the amounts they receive from each source are the main topics of this report using data from the march 2008 current population survey this report describes the number of elderly individua ls and households receiving income from earnings pensions social security assets veterans benefits public assistance and other sources it also describes how th proportion of total income received from each source differs between highincome individuals and households and lowincome individuals and households in addition to looking at sources nd amounts of income the report examines the income of the elderly relative to th federal poverty thresholds in 2007 97 of americans 65 and older had family incomes below the federal poverty thresholds of 9944 for single person and 12550 for couple the 2007 poverty rate for americans 65 and older was lower than both the poverty rate for the population 18 to 64 years old 109 and the poverty rate among children under age 18 1802 although income is an important meas ure of persons economic wellbeing it is not the only such measure nor is it always the best one individuals with the same cash income may have significantly diffe rent levels of financ ial assets or other forms of wealth some own their own hom while others rent some receive non cash benefits from their former employers such as fully or partially paid health insurance while others have to pay for health services or insurance outofpocket the federal and state governments also pr ovide many noncash be nefits and services such as medicaid food stamps and the lowincome home energy assistance program that improve the financial circumstances of lowerincome families but which do not show up in measures of cash income finally some older americans live with family members or receive considerable nonfina ncial assistance from their families while others live one and pay someone to perfo rm household chores or to provide personal care services even w ith these limitations however the amount ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32697crs2 3 family income differs from household income in households in which more than one family resides or in which family re sides with other unrelated individualsincome that older americans receive is an important measure of their ability to purchase the goods and services that contribute to their economic wellbeing the data the findings in this report are base d on data collected in the march 2008 current population survey cps conducted by the bur eau of the census the march 2008 cps consisted of interviews with approximately 75900 households comprising representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the united states each march the rvey includes detailed questions on sources and amounts of income received during th previous calendar year the cps is widely used by researchers in government academia and the private sector and it is the source of the official statistics published annually by the census bureau on median family income the number of amer icans living in poverty and the number of people without health insurance like any survey the cps is subject to error sampling error occurs if the households selected to participate in the survey are not representative of the population nonsampling error occurs if survey participants provide inaccurate informati on or if their responses are incorrectly recorded individual income and household income income figures in this report are shown both for individual persons and for households individuals are classified by the individuals age oneperson households are classified according to the age of the householder marriedc ouple households are classified by the age of the older of the householder or the householders spouse this differs from the census bureaus methodology which classifies households by the age of the householder the methodology adopted by crs has the advantage of including in the count of elderly house holds all households in which either the householder or the householders spouse is 65 or older the number of persons in poverty is based on the census bureaus poverty thresholds the familys income and the number of persons in the family3 median individual and household income in 2007 965 of individuals aged 65 nd older had income from one or more sources the median total income of these individuals was 17382 see table 1 of all households in which either the householder or the householders spouse if present was 65 or older 989 had inco from one or more sources and the median income of these households was 29730 see table 2 in general because more than one member of household may have income from one or more sources elderly households were more likely to have income from each source and had greater income from each source than derly individuals for example 347 of households in which the householder or householders spouse was 65 or older had income from earnings and the median earnings of those households were 30000 in contrast just 197 of individuals ag ed 65 or older had income from earnings inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32697crs3 2007 and the median earned income of these individuals was 20000 because most individuals aged 65 and older receive social secur ity the proportion of elderly households that had income from social security in 2007 was only slightly higher than the percentage of elderly individuals with social security income eightynine percent of households in which the hous eholder or householders spouse was 65 or older had income from social security

receive pension income in retirement some workers not covered by pension plan today may have earned pension at previous job or they may ear n pension benefit in the future others who are currently participating in pension plan may never fully vest in their pension benefit or they might take their accrued benefit as lump sum before retirement and spend all or part of the distribution to receive pension income in retirement an individual must remain participant in the plan long enough to ear n pension benefit nd must not spend the accrued benefit before retirement in 1986 congress shortened the maximum vesting period the length of time it takes to earn pension benefit from 10 years to 5 years thus making it easier for employ ees whose employer sponsors pension to earn benefit under the plan5 on the other hand many employers offer separating employees the opportunity to take their accrued retirement benefit as lumpsum distribution most defined contribution plans such as t hose author

ponsored pension plans in 2007 the disparity between the percentage of jobs that are in the government sector and the percentage of retirees with govern ment pensions is accounted for mainly by two

by employer contributions and i nvestment earnings defined contribution or dc plans are much like savings acc ounts maintained by employers on behalf of each participating employee the em ployer contributes specific dollar amount or percentage of pay which is invested in stocks bonds or other assets the employee usually contributes to the plan too in dc plan it is the employee who bears the investment risk at retirem ent the balance in the account is the sum of all contributions plus interest divi dends and capital gains or losses the account balance is usually dist ributed as single lump sum many large employers recently have converted their traditional db pensions to hybrid plans that have characteristics of both db and dc plans the most popular of which has been the cash balance plan in cash balance plan the be nefit is defined in terms of an account balance the employer makes cont ributions to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however these

sources although social security benefits pensi ons and income from assets are the most common income sources earnings also are important especially for those under age 70 there are large disparities in the amounts and types of income that older americans receive income from assets in the form of interest and dividends for example make up significant percentage of the aggregate income of the elderly population however most elderly indi viduals receive only modest amounts of interest and dividend income whereas relatively small number of people receive large amounts of income from these sources social security is both the largest source of aggregate income among the elderly and the biggest single source of income for majority of americans aged 65 and older compared to the great disparity in interest and dividend income there is relatively little difference between the average monthly social security benef it and the highest monthly benefit this is because the social security benefit fo rmula limits the maximum amount paid to retired highwage earner to about 150 of the amount paid to careerlong average wage worker social security and public assistance together provide more than 90 of all income for the poorest 25 of the elderl population these public programs have contributed greatly to reducing poverty among the elderly the reduction in poverty among older americans is
