southern sudan suspended the participation of its ministers state ministers and presidential advisors from the government of national unity to protest measures take n by the national congress party and to demand full implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement cpa the sudan peoples liberation m ovement splm has been complaining and urging the sudanese g overnment to implement key provisions of the cpa and to consult the first vice president on key issues they complained that president omer bashir has been taking important decisions with little or consultation with the first vice president since the signing of the peace agreement in 2005 on darfur president bashir has been waging war and deliberately sidelining the splm on key decisions for example the eastern s udan agreement was negotiated and signed between the national congress party nd the eastern rebels without serious consultation with the first vice president according to the cpa the president shall take decisions with the consent of the first vice president on declaration and termination of state of emergency declara tion of war appointments that the president is required to make according to the peace agreement summoning adjourning or proroguing the national assembly request by the first vice president to reshuffle southern ministers in the government of national unity was held up for several months by president bashir in large pa rt due to bashirs opposition to the proposed change of the foreign minister in october the splm leadership submitted number of demands to president bashir in letter to president bashir first vice president salva kiir wrote15 at this critical juncture of the history of our country the sudanese people the region and the international community at large do follow with concern the evolving situation in our country in par ticular they follow closely with concern what both of us and the parties we lea d are doing to enhance and consolidate peace in our country the comprehensive peace agreement cpa is the corner stone of that peace it is with this spirit that i am addressing you today on behalf of the splm and on my own behalf as partner in peace the splm was encouraged by the creation of bilateral permanent mechanisms for the resolution of outstanding issues on cpa implementation as well as for the enhancement of cooperation and partnership between our two parties despite the progress made on several issue areas critical flash points remain thereby giving rise to the impression that the mechanisms we have created were mere vehicles for public relations exercises and not meant to help the parties in resolving critical differences the above impression was reinforced by recent provocative actions emanating from authorities within the government of national unity gonu of which we are part indeed the major partner to th ncp the height of these provocations was the raids in khartoum on splm premises and the mess of spla senior officers in the joint defense board jdb the jdb is the highest military organ created by the cpa and inc to oversee the smooth implementation of security arrangements those indecorous acts were compounded by the unrepentanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33574crs8 reaction by their perpetrators to splms protest the perpetrators include ncp ministers and officers in the law forcement agencies who are dutybound by the inc to steer away of politics it became clear to us however that the provocations reflected pattern of behavior intended to humiliate the splm the splm therefore should not be expected to take that behavior lightly indeed the situation called for pause and deep reflection on the way and spirit with which we are handling the implementing of cpa to that end the splm interim political bureau ipb met in juba from october 4th 11th 2007 to assess and evaluate the status of cpa implementation and draw concrete actions for the way forwar d in that evaluation the ipb identified cpa violations and enumerated unacceptable deliberate actions demeaning to the splm and its leadership i am enclosing herewith copy of the ipbs resolutions encompassing violations to the cpa as well as actions to which the splm takes serious exception in presenting these reso lutions i am confident that you shall address with wisdom and statesmanship the serious i ssues raised therein truly those violations and actions constitute major challenge to the sustenance of peace and consolidation of unity in our country on my part i remain committed to the full implementation of the cpa and i do not wish for moment to contemplate the collapse of the cpa t alone take part in that collapse furthermore the ipb expressed deep c oncern with your excellencys inaction on the reshuffle of splm ministers in gonu which in the spirit of collegial decisionmaking i proposed in doing th at i was exercising my constitutional rights and prerogatives as the chairman of the splm to effect the recommendations of my party in view of the perception that this inaction amounts to an encroachment on the firs t vice presidents constitutional powers the ipb recalled all splm presidential ad visors ministers nd state ministers in gonu and they have been directed to stay away from their duties till considerable progress is seen in addressing the issues raised in the attached resolutions in order not to paralyze the work of gonu i am again presenting to your excellency our new list of ministerial changes in gonu i am confident that you shall address this matter together with other pressing issues contained in the resolutions of ipb with due regard to the risks inherent in the present stalemate this stalemate if left unres olved may degenerate into crisis which none of us wants it is our political dut and national obligation to avert actions that might endanger the cpa it is also our moral and constitutional responsibility to provide the necessary lead ership so that our country is enabled to enjoy peace stability democracy nd unity based on the free will of its people in response to these demands and unexp ected developments president bashir reportedly accepted number of the government of south sudan goss demands in late october except those related to the abyei issue according to senior splm officials the acceptance of their demands by president bashir does not resolve the crisis they would like to see timeline and roadmap for implementation of their demands before they return to government president bashir accepted new list of ministers submitted by the first vice

people has been the scene of intermittent conf lict an estimated 2 million people died over two decades from war related causes and famine in southern sudan and millions more were displaced the

current government dominated by the mostly muslimarab north southerners who are christian and animist reject the islamization of the country and favor secular arrangement social and economic disparities were also major contributing factors to the sudanese conflict former president jaafer nimeris abrogation of the 1972 addis ababa agreement in 1983 which had ended the first phase of the civil war in the south is considered major factor triggering the civil war the national islamic front nif government which ousted th democratically elected civilian government in 1989 pursued the war in southern sudan with vigor previous governments both civilian and military had rejected southern dema nds for autonomy and equality northern political leaders for decades treated southerners as sec ondclass citizens and did not see the south as an integr part of the country southern political leaders argue th at under successive civilian and military governments political elites in the north have made only superficial attempts to address the grievances of the south reluctant to compromise the norths dominant economic political and social status in r ecent years most political leaders in

enga ged the government in critical dialogue and offered the normalization of bilateral relations as an incentive for the resolution of the darfur crisis and settlement of the northsouth conflict according to us officials and sudanese sources us policy toward sudan is complicated because the same government that signed the peace agreement with the south is also the one implicated in atrocities in darfur which the us government has declared is genocide this reality has led to some cr iticism of the bush administr ation although many praise the administrations sustained engagement in the northsouth talks according to some critics the administration did not initially consider the darfur crisis to be priority instead the administration was largely focused on the talks between the government of sudan and the splm the first statement on darfur by the white house they point out was issued in early april 2004 the bush administration and congress however have been at the forefront

the crisis in darfur began in februa ry 2003 when two rebel groups emerged to challenge the national congress party n cp government in darfur the sudan liberation army sla and the justice and equality movement jem argued that the government of sudan discriminates against muslim african ethnic groups in darfur and has systematically targeted th ethnic groups since the early 1990s the government of sudan dismisses the sla and jem as terrorists the conflict primarily pits three african ethnic groups the fur zaghawa and massaleit against nomadic arab ethnic groups periodic tens ions between the largely africanmuslim ethnic groups and the arab inhabitants of darfur can be traced to the 1930s and had surfaced again in the 1980s most observe rs note that successive governments in khartoum have long neglected the afri can ethnic groups in darfur and have done little to prevent or contain attacks by arab militias against nonarabs in darfur nonarab groups took up arms against succe ssive central governments in khartoum albeit unsuccessfully in the early 1990s the national islamic front nif government which came to power in 1989 began to arm arab militias and ttempted to disarm the largel african ethnic groups the conflict in darfur burgeoned when the government of sudan and its allied militias began what is widely characterized as campaign of terror against civilians in an effort to crush the rebellion and to punish the core constituencies of the rebels at the heart of the current conflict is struggle for control of political power and resources the largely nomadic arab ethnic groups often venture into the traditionally farming communities of darfur for water and grazing at times triggering armed conflict between the two groups darfur is home to an estimated 7 million people and has more than 30 ethnic groups which fall into two major categories african and arab both communities are muslim and years of intermarriages have made racial distinctions difficult if not impossible fighting over resources is one of several factors that has led to intense infighting in darfur over the years many observers believe that the nif government has systematically and deliberately pursued policy of discrimination and marginalization of the african communities in darfur and has given support to ar ab militias to suppress nonarabs whom it considers threat to its hold on power in 2000 after the ouster of the founder of the nif hassan alturabi and after split within the islamist movement the government imposed state of emergency and used its new authority to crack down on dissidents in darfur by 2002 little known self defense force emerged as the sla challenging government forces in darfur with the ncp regime internally in turmoil and mounting international pressure to end sudans northsouth conflict the sla and jem we re able to gain the upper hand in the initial phase of the conflict against government forces in early 2003 and appeared well armed and prepared the re bels also enjoyed the support of the local population as well as officers and soldiers in the sudanese army significant number of senior officers and soldiers in the sudanese armed forces come from darfur the sla reportedly benefitted fro m outside support including from fellow zaghawa elements in chad and financia l support from some darfur businessmen in the persian gulf region in late 2004 another darfur armed group the national movement for reform and development nmrd emerged initial reports suggestedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33574crs15 that the nmrd was created by

the return of refugees from chad to darfur regional officials and sudanese opposition figures assert that the nmrd is backed by the government of chad and that the rebels wear uniforms and carry arms

the five criteria fo r genocide enumerated in article 2 of the convention on the prevention and punish ment of the crime of genocide on september 9 2004 then secretary of state co lin powell in his testimony before the senate foreign relations committee declared the atrocities in darfur genocide secretary powell stated that after reviewing evidence collected by the state department team genocide has been committed in darfur and that the government of sudan and the jingaweit bear res ponsibility and that genocide may still be occurring powell further stated that because the united states is contracting party to the geneva convention washington will demand that the united nations initiate full investigation shortly after powells testimony draft resolution 1564 was adopted the resolution requested the secretary general of the united nations to establish an international commission of i nquiry in order to immediately investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in darfur by all parties to determine so whether or not acts of genocide have occurred and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable the declaration of genocide by the bush administration did not lead to major shift in us policy or threat of intervention to end genocide instead bush administr ation

of peace in darfur human rights groups secretary general kofi annan and us officials have criticized the deployment of these troops and stated that this action violates the peace agr eement meanwhile senior commanders of the slm the only gr oup that signed the peace agreement have stated that continued government attacks in darfur and continued rejection of force could lead to the collapse of the peace agreement the janjaweed background since the crisis in the darfur region began in 2003 the name janjaweed also spelled as janjawid janjawad jingaweit jinjaweed has become very familiar name to many in the international community the janjaweed and the government of sudan have been accused of committing genocide against civilians in darfur by the united states government in 2004 and accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the united nations and other governments the existence of the janjaweed goes b ack over decade in the mid1980s the government of sudan began to arm arab

crimes against civilians darfuri leaders link the janjaweed to manifesto called the quresh the principal objective of the quresh they argued was to create re gion called darelara b land of the arabs the architects of the manifesto and those who signed it are senior members of the national islamic front gove rnment currently known as the national congress party the 19911992 rebellion against the nif regime failed in large part due to lack of preparation inside darfur and major ja njaweed and government operations against the small spla force in the region th commander of the spla force decided to withdraw his troops after the government and arab militia for ces discovered the location of the spla force before final preparation for operations elements within the government intensified their campaign to bring bolad back into the nif for talks with pledges to change policies and address the concerns of the darfuris bolad decided to return to engage nif officials against

tortured and ex ecuted according to sudanese sources for many darfuris the war between th various groups started well before 2003 darfuris who experienced the atrocities in the mid1980s in large part

responsibility of amis possible policy options concerning darfur there are number of unilateral and multilateral policy options available to consider in facing the darfur crisis these options are complicated by number of factors members of the international community are divided over sudan and some governments are allies of th regime in khartoum since the late 1990s the european union has adopted policy of engagement instead of containment while the united states pursued policy of isolation and containment of the government of sudan sudans neighbors are also divided relations between eritrea and sudan were poor although in recent years rela tions have improved while re lations with chad are poor for some of the options outlined below to be successful close cooperation and coordination between the united states and the international community especially the security council and sudan s neighbors is pivotal some of the other options are not dependent on close cooperation w ith the international community engagement one option is engagement with the government of sudan the government of sudan is eager to appease the international community as long as it can avoid punitive sanctions and ensure its own political survival in this scenario engaging the government might yield some positive results shor t of full cooperation and accountability by the government past gagement with the current government however has not succeeded in changing its behavior the government of sudan signs peace agreements or shows flexibility when it feels that it is in its interest to do so sanctions many observers assert that the current regime only responds to real pressure the clinton administration imposed comprehensive economic and trade sanctions in 1997 the impacts of th sanctions are mixed over the past decade number of punitive measures ve been imposed on the government of sudan the government of s outhern sudan is exempted from these sanctions but the government of sudan has survived years of sanctions imposed by the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33574crs22 moreover some countries oppose sanctions against the government of sudan especially those countries with business in terests in sudans il sector multilateral targeted sanctions including oil embargo travel ban and asset freeze might have serious impact especially if enforced by the international community another option is prohibiting foreign businesses from raising capital or trading their securities in the united states if they are engaged in business activities in sudan regime change some observers and sudan opposition leaders argue that the regime is incapable of change they argue that since the national congress party government came to power in 1989 it has committed war crimes in south sudan the nuba mountains and now in darfur they also maintain th regime has ties to international terrorist and extremist groups regime change in khartoum they argue could bring swift end to the crisis in darfur and help implement the north south agreement bu t oppos ition groups are not strong or united enough to pose serious threat to the regime moreover 21years of war with the spla and other armed groups did not lead to the collapse of the regime in khartoum for this option to be viable the opposition would have to be united and assisted nonetheless the only force capable of countering the regime in khartoum is the spla proponents of the regime change concept argue that strengthening the spla militarily unifying the darfur factions and assisting other opposition elements in the north could pose threat to the regime in khartoum international intervention another option involves military intervention by the international community the international community could disarm the janjaweed enforce nofly zone and provi protection to civilians in darfur by deploying large numbers of peacekeepers with chapter vii mandate the government of sudan has rejected the deployment of united nations peacekeeping force after the security council passe d resolution 1706 ployment without government consent is an option although there seems to be strong support for such forceful measure bilateral targeted military measures another forcebased option is the targeting of certain military assets of the sudanese government these targets might include the
