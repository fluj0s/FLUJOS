25 1997 south koreas economic reforms and us interests raymond j ahearn specialist in trade relations foreign affairs and national defense division summary from the perspective of us exporters and investors gaining fair and effective access to south koreas market is part of broader problem of doing business in an economy that limits the role of market forces extensive government intervention and regulation of economic activity nontransparent and often discriminatory bureaucratic actions and strong drive for autonomy all make south korea one of the most difficult markets in the world to do business in to the extent that the south korean government implements economic reforms that expose more segments of its economy to market forces the sources of ussouth korean trade tensions are likely to dissipate over time south korea appears likely to implement fundamental economic reforms in order to bolster its international competitiveness but the recent dramatic drop in president kim young sams popularity combined with the politics of presidential election in december 1997 have all but eliminated the possibility of new reform initiatives this year loss of momentum for reform in turn has varied implications for uskorean economic relations some past reforms that have facilitated increases in us exports primarily of capital goods and raw materials and investment should not be affected coupled with falling south korean competitiveness the recent us trade surplus with south korea should persist but little or progress in liberalizing other sectors of koreas economy that are of considerable interest to us business particularly consumer goods and finished manufactures that compete directly against koreanmade products can be anticipated and backsliding in other areas is also possible as result 1997 may witness an increase in us south korean trade tensionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97395crs2 1burton john slowdown in seoul financial times january 9 1997 p 11 2burton john

research service report 96299 f march 26 1996 32 pbackground in south korea today there are growing concerns among elites as well as the public that the countrys economy is offtrack slower economic growth rate the economy grew at 67 in 1996 compared to the 89 growth rates in the previous few years large 22 billion and growing current account deficit depressed stock market and continuing outsourcing of production to other asian countries by the countrys large conglomerates or chaebol are behind the fears that the countrys competitiveness may be fading the slowdown in the economic growth rate is due to combination of cyclical temporary and structural deeply rooted factors weakening of the japanese yen and falling prices for some of koreas major exports are the major cyclical factors the weaker yen has made it more difficult for korean exporters of cars and ships to compete against japanese producers and declining global demand for semiconductors which account for 20 of korean exports has contributed to the widening of the trade deficit1 number of structural weaknesses are increasingly recognized by koreans as the source of the countrys declining competitiveness rigid labor markets an inefficient financial system an overburd ened infrastructure system and difficult environment for foreign direct investment have all contributed to the countrys rising production costs and declining competitiveness2 to curb rising business costs and attract the technology and foreign capital that are necessary to meet rising competitive pressures many korean economists and technocrats have long urged the government to initiate fundamental and comprehensive economic reforms they have called upon the government to radically reduce its role in the economy to curb monopolistic practices of the chaebol to reform an outdated labor management system and to open the economy further to foreign goods and services3 president kims reform record korean reformers pinned considerable hopes on president kim young sam when he assumed office in 1993 leading opposition figure for over three decades and critic of heavy government regulation of the economy president kim proposed blueprint for new korean economy based squarely on the principles of private sector autonomy fair competition and open markets despite the considerable powers of the korean presidency and high initial popularity ratings president kim to date has enacted only few significant yet partial reforms relating to tax avoidance real name reform and membership in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97395crs3 4kristoff nicholas d korean tycoons dodge bullet new york times december 8 1995 p a7 and hoon shim jae what we worry south koreas chaebol remain unscathed by scandal far eastern economic review november 23 1995 p 79more importantly two recent events the bankruptcy of hanbo iron and steel and weak revision of koreas labor law have contributed to president kims popularity dropping to around 15 and have undermined his credibility as force for economic reform in addition the december 1997 presidential election is largely viewed as major reason why president kim is unlikely to adopt reformist positions on economic issues during the remainder of 1997 as the opposition parties headed by perennial presidential candidates kim dae jung and kim jong pil have adopted relatively populist and nationalistic positions on most economic issues president kim has become more cautious real name reform in part to loosen the traditional close and collusive ties between government and business the kim administration in august 1993 implemented realname system for financial transactions in the past it had been possible to open accounts and conduct business under false names directly and indirectly fostering institutionalized corruption tax avoidance and other illegal financial dealings the reform was intended to reduce collusive aspects of governmentbusiness relations and allow funds once channeled into bribes to become available for more productive uses the realname reform did reveal major political scandals in 1995 with the arrest trial and sentencing of two former presidents on corruption charges the kim administration howeve r did not use the public outrage as lever for reducing the tight economic regulations that give rise to illicit payments in the first place concerns that such reforms could harm some of koreas largest chaebol thereby undercutting the growth of the korean economy seemingly deterred the administration from heading in this direction4 realname reform has been more successful in freeing up capital for more productive uses before the law was passed many small and medium size companies borrowed from wealthy individuals who held their money in false name accounts to avoid taxes this was necessary because the banks consistent with government guidance mostly lent to the chaebol but when real name reform was implemented this important source of funding dried up as many people shifted their money from false name accounts to taxfree bonds oecd membership in late 1996 the south korean national parliament approved seouls membership in the organization for econom ic cooperation and development oecd grouping of advanced industrialized countries designed to coordinate economic policies and promote economic growth despite domestic political opposition president kim supported making korea the 29th member of the oecd and the second asian member largely on the grounds that admission to this club would confer on korea advancedcountry status and prestigehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97395crs4 5burton john s korea braces for restructuring financial times october 14 1996 p 4

economy with regard to the banking system which now is heavily controlled and protected by government regulations korea will have to lift certain kinds of restrictions on capital flows allow market forces to determine interest rates and provide foreigners substantially more freedom to make portfolio and direct investments however according to the terms korea negotiated for its accession these reforms could take number of years to implement korea accepted only 65 of the various oecd financial liberalization obligations as compared to the organizations average of 89 seoul promised to proceed with full liberalization once the gap between korean and internat ional interest rates falls by 2 from its current 67 percentage points and inflation falls to 3 from its present 45 level some analysts believe that these economic preconditions are unlikely to be met until well after 20005 hanbo bankruptcy hanbo koreas 14th largest chaebol filed for bankruptcy in january 1997 amid allegations that kim administration officials exerted pressure on banks to provide loans to hanbo in return for illegal political contributions besides the political corruption issue the scandal exposed continuing government efforts to support ambitious but risky industrial projects that result in production overcapacity and heavily indebted companies hanbos attempt to build the worlds fifth largest steel mill precipitated the crisis management greatly underestimated the cost of the mill from the beginning and ended up amassing debt that totalled 22 times its shareholder equity so large was the debt that even under best case projections of operating profits few analysts thought that it could be retired why banks continued to lend hanbo enormous sums of money for this project without feasibility study or without demanding adequate collateral is matter under investigation6 the bankruptcy filing on march 18 1997 by sammi steel one of koreas 30 largest chaebol has heightened concerns that other industrial conglomerates could be near collapse unlike number of past chaebol financial crises however the government has not rushedin to bailout creditors as result chaebol management may become more cautious and hesitant to expand into noncore business areas in the future labor law reform president kim did try to reform koreas rigid labor laws in late december 1996 but rising public opposition including several weeks of strikes and public protests caused him to reverse course and support watered down version this compromise legislation which was supported by the opposition parties was

updatedpresident kims initial bill which was passed by his ruling new korea party in predawn secret session on december 26 1996 without the presence of opposition parties gave employers greater rights to layoff or terminate workers at the same time the bill failed to provide workers with greater freedom to organize commitment that the government had made to the oecd the compromise version by postponing manageme nts right to lay off workers by two years and by maintaining governments capacity to severely restrict union activity made neither side big business or organized labor happy president kims retreat prompted one korean government official to comment that he appears to have lost courage in pushing economic reforms7 implications for us economic interests while fundamental economic reforms are likely to be implemented over time to bolster south koreas declining international competitiveness the recent dramatic drop in president kims popularity and the impending presidential election make further reforms problematic this year this development in turn has varied implications for ussouth korean economic relations in the nearterm some reforms that have facilitated significant increases in us exports and investment should not be affected however little or progress is likely in liberalizing some sectors of koreas economy that are of considerable interest to us business and backsliding in other areas is also possible as result 1997 on balance may witness an increase in ussouth korean trade tensions8 due to tariff and nontariff barrier reforms implemented over the past 15 years the korean market has become more accessible to us and other foreign exporters and investors many of the reforms have eliminated reduced or redressed some of koreas most formidable barriers that had been erected at the border to keep the korean market for korean producers in the process us exports to south korea have recorded steady increases commensurate with the rapid rise of the korean economy over the past ten years in 1996 us exports totalled 265 billion making korea the fifth largest market for us exports the united states now exports more to korea than it does to france and italy combined and runs trade surplus in 1996 in excess of 3 billion the bulk of us exports consist of capital goods and raw materials that are used by korean chaebol to modernize factories and build products such as cars ships and electronic goods for exports in addition korea is the third largest export market for us agricultural products mostly bulk commodities such as feed grains cotton and wheat as long as the korean economy continues to grow at healthy pace the korean market should continue to absorb growing volumes of these kinds of us products the story on the investment side however is somewhat different the total stock of us foreign direct investment is less than 5 billion relatively low level compared to us investment position in other asian countries while us foreign direct investment flows to korea increased substantially in 1995 and 1996 due in part to liberalizinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97395crs6 9lee charles s buy korean imports get the blame again far eastern economic review march 6 1997 p 58foreign investment regime major sustained increases are unlikely to occur in the absence of basic reforms that address koreas high cost environment the same considerations that are deterring foreign companies to invest in korea high costs for land labor and capital are also the same factors driving korean chaebol to invest abroad the areas where little or progress can be expected this year in opening koreas market to us exports are ones where us products compete directly with korean products or services and where market reforms have lagged other sectors or industries on the product side one would not expect for example additional reforms to be forthcoming that would accelerate us sales of pharmaceuticals automobiles or telecommunications these are all sectors that still provide korean producers with considerable protection from foreign competition and on the services side one would not expect any accelerated movement on financial sector reform this year an area where korean banks insurance companies and securities firms are relatively inefficient and protected more ominous is koreas current attempt to address its current account deficit by promoting frugality campaign korean businesses and citizens groups are currently sponsoring boycotts of foreign products in response to president kims call last year to end luxurious consumption and there are signs that the government may be indirectly hampering imports of consumer durables this development has the potential for reversing gains the korean government recently has made in shedding its image as oneway free trader9 beyond 1997 and the december presidential election major unknown is whether the next korean president will embrace reformist economic policies and push hard to dismantle the various instruments of state control over the economy procrastination is likely only to hurt the korean economy and ussouth korean economic ties
