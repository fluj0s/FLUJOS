105th congress introduction it is widely recognized that the nazi holocaust ranks as one of historys greatest crimes against humanity less well understood is the fact that the holocaust also constitutes one of the largest acts of theft in history virtually all property of holocaust victims was seized by the nazis accomplices and others1 it is difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the va lue of this property study done for the world jewish congress in 1944 with fragmen tary data arrived at figure of 9 billion 1944 dollars2 after the war the governme nt of the federal republic of germany frg undertook an extensive program of repara tion payments to holocaust victims their heirs and to the state of israel holocaust survivors and victims heirs in central and eastern europe suffered double loss postwar communist regimes in central and eastern europe prevented them from receiving reparations payments from the frg in addition those regimes took possession of most of the looted property on their territo ry denying it to holocaust survivors and individual and communal claimants half century after these events several developments revived interest in holocaustrelated issues following the collapse of communism in central and eastern europe in 1989 and the emergence of democratic regime s there previously secret government records were opened nd large numbers of holocaust survivors and their heirs sought to make claims for longlost property and for reparation payments at about the same time group of holocaust survivors and victims heirs brought class action law suit against thr ee large swiss banks charging them with having illegally seized the deposits of holocaust victims and of refusing thereafter to return these assets to survivors and their heirs3 these developments plus the recalcitrance of swiss banking and govern ment officials in responding to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98903crs2 4 see crs reports 98296 the

holocaustrelated issues the executive and legislative branches have been largely cooperative in these efforts in testifying at house international relations committee hearing on holocaust property issues on august 6 1998 mr eize nstat now under secretary of state commended the many congressional initiatives in this area and urged the congress to be even more active in encouraging the governments of central and eastern europe to be more responsive on such issu as restitution of holocaustera property more than thirty holocaustrelated bills and resolutions were introduced in the

and resolutions have been enacted or adopt ed as of october 19 1998 s 1564pl 105158 holocaust victims redress act summary title i of this act directs the president to instruct the commissioner representing the united states on the tripartite commission for the restitution of monetary gold to seek and vote for time ly agreement under which all signatories to the paris agreement on reparations with claims against the monetary gold pool in the commissions jurisdiction contribute ll or substantial portion of such gold to charitable organizations to assist surv ivors of the holocaust as an inducement to do so it authorizes the president to obligate up to 30 million for such distribution this sum represents the present value of the difference between what congress originally authorized as compensation for the assets of heirless victims of the holocaust either seized or frozen in the united states at the onset of world war ii and the amount actually paid in 1962 of the 30 million authorized 25 million is to go to organizations paying restitution to holocaust victims and 5 million for archival research to assist in the restitution of assets looted or extorted from victims of the holocaust and such other activities that would further holocaust remembrance and education title ii expr esses the sense of the cong ress that all governments undertake good faith efforts to return work s of art confiscated from rightful owners during the period of nazi rule status introduced by senator damato november 13 1997 signed into law pl 105158 february 13 1998 analysis this legislation has multiple purposes first it seeks to redress perceived inequity in earlier holocaust legislation second it both instructs the united states to work toward speedy re solution of the claims some 15 countries have on stock of gold seized from thei r central banks by the nazis during world war ii that is now under the control of the united states britain and france and urges these countries once distribution is ma to use all or substantial portion of this gold to aid holocaust survivors third it expresses the sense of the congress that all governments undertake good faith fforts to return works of art confiscated from rightful owners during the period of nazi rule brief discussion of history is necessa ry to understand the first goal of this legislation at the outbreak of world wa r ii the us government seized germanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98903crs4 5 the implicit nominal rate of interest by wh ich 25 million in 1962 is translated into 30 million in 1998 is approximately 715 the average rate of interest on us treasury securities over this 36year period ranges from 627 for 3month secu rities to 765 for 10year securities if inflation as measured by the consumer price index is taken into consideration the real or inflation adjusted rate of interest by which 25 million is translated into 30 million is approximately 225 6 part of the impetus for this legislation cam from the tgcsponsored london gold conference of december 1997 where british foreign secretary si r robin cook proposed the creation of the international fund for needy victims of nazi pe rsecution to which the united states pledged an initial 4 millionassets in the united states worth so 198 million and froze assets worth some 12 billion belonging to swiss nationals and institutions among both groups of asset holders were thought to be jewish holocaust victims or their beneficiaries after the war was over congress recognizing that some of the victims of the holocaust whose assets were either seized or frozen might not have had legal heirs enacted legislation authorizing the transfer of up to 3 million of such assets to organizations dedicated to providing relief and rehabilitation for holocaust survivors for variety of reasons it proved unworkable to transfer the 3 million as intended to fulfill the intent of the legi slation congress in 1962 agreed to lump sum settlement and 500000 wa s provided to the jewish restitution successor organization of new york one purpose of t itle 1 of the current bill is to recognize the moral claim of victims of the holocau st to the unrestituted portion of the amount originally authorized in the immediate postworld war ii legislation 3 million and the amount actually appropriated in 1962 500000 it does so by authorizing the payment to jewish relief organizations of the present value of the difference between these two sums the present value in this legislation is placed at sum not to exceed 30 million5 the payment of this sum is also relate d to the second goal of title 1 which encourages certain foreign countries to behave in similar fashion this goal concerns the final undistributed gold reserves of the centr banks of 15 countries that were seized by the nazis during world war ii this gold approximately 6 metric tons worth about 58 million dollars in 1998 had been under the joint control of the united states britain and france through the trilateral gold commission tgc the postwar agency dealing with nazi looted gold6 this legislation calls for the united states to press for speedy resolution of outstanding claims so that the gold can be distributed and urges the claimant nations to transfer all or substantial part of what they receive to charitable organizations assisting survivors of the holocaust title ii expresses the sense of congre ss that consistent with the 1907 hague convention all governments should undertake good faith efforts to return private and public property including works of art to the rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated during nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that the claimant is the rightful owner currently there are reliable estimates of the number of artworks confiscated or of th market value of these works of art hr 3662s 1900 pl 105186 us holocaust assets commission act of 1998 summary the 105th congress

analysis this bill came to congress in the context of some unusual developments in the insurance industry nd international efforts to resolve issues surrounding holocaustera insurance claims this bill would require all insurance companies operating in the united states between 1920 and 1945 to report to the comme rce department on the current status of insurance policies issued during that period reportedly thousands of holocaust victims and their families have been unable to collect on life insurance policies sold before world war ii insurance was an important means of doing retirement planning providing for dowry or sa ving for the education of children according to holocaust survivors and jewish leaders who testified during public hearings sponsored by the national association of insurance co mmissioners naic european insurance companies have refu sed to honor holocaustera claims for several reasons 1 many ea stern european insurers had their insurance assets confiscated by the nazis during world war ii or nationalized by communist regimes after the war 2 insurers paid the proceeds on the policies to the nazi government and the modern german government compensated individual holocaust victims for specific claims as well as ge rmanys general responsibility for the nazi genocide 3 the beneficiaries lacked death certificat to redeem their murdered relatives insurance policy 4 insurers typically inserted war clause in their policies that provided for return of premium rather than payment of the face amount of the policy if the insured died under exclude d circumstances 5 policies frequently lapsed canceled when premiums were not maintained 6 claims were invalidated by the passage of time 7 inflation caused the present value of these old policies to become infinitesimal and theref ore not worth paying claim9 in addressing the issues raised by this legislation it is important to consider three related points the holocaust victims were mainly european residents many of whom held insurance coverage with alien10 insurance companies before world war ii insurance coverage was purchased from european insurers who did not have presence in the united states and although european insurers may have reinsured some portion of their risk with an american insurer or reinsurer the financial responsibility for paying claims remained with the

of this act status introduced by rep foley februa ry 3 1998 referred to the commerce committee subcommittee on finance and zardous materials february 11 1998 also referred to the committee on banking and financial services subcommittee on financial institutions and c onsumer credit february 20 1998 analysis this bill would require alien in surers as condition for operating in the united states to disclose to the attorney general the name of any individual with whom they had any financial dealing who is holocaust survivor or victim the names of these alien insu rers would be made public and banks and financial institutions would be prohibited from doing bus iness with or on behalf of these alien insurers until the attorney general publishes in the federal register that such company has complied with the disc losure requirements establishing disclosure requirement for alien insurers or re insurers is not new beginning in the early 1990s for example alien reinsurers were required to provide state insurance departments with detailed financial information to ensure that the assets on their books were accurate thus ve rifying their ability to pay claims what is new however is the historical elements and that federal entity the attorney general and not the state insurance depa rtments or the naic would be collecting this information this may be perceived as being inconsistent with the current state regulatory system httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98903crs12 16 42 usc section 10111015 17 the bill does not define the meaning of the wordrelocate since the passage of the mccarran ferguson act of 194516 the state insurance regulatory system has required all companies engaging in the business of insurance in the united states to be licensed by their states and therefore subject to state insurance regulation some observers contend th at the naic is perhaps better prepared than the attorney general to develop this list of alien insurers who may have had financial dealings with holocaust survivors or victims hr 4138 stolen artwork restitution act of 1998 summary this bill deals with the restitution of stolen artwork to the original owners or to family members the attorney general would be the coordinating official authorized to make grants to research organizations in the identification and the relocation of stolen art work the ttorney general would also be required to undertake an inquiry of all artwork in th possession of the fe deral government to determine whether any such artwork is stolen property status introduced by rep schumer j une 25 1998 referred to the house committee on the judiciary on june 25 1998 and referred to the subcommittee on crime on july 7 1998 analysis this bill directed toward the location and recovery stolen art work does not specifically focus on holocaust er stolen art although it may cover such materials the bill provides that the attorney general may make grants to certain research organizations to identify and relocate17 stolen artworks the attorney general is authorized to establish the terms and conditions for such grants and must require reports from the grant recipients in turn the attorney general must submit an annual report to congress listing the or ganizations which have received grants the bill stipulates that if request is made concerning an artwork with sales price of 5000 or more that at any time s been shipped in interstate or foreign commerce the seller or purchaser of the ar twork shall before the sale undertake an inquiry into the ownership history of the artwork and consult one or more of the missing or stolen art registries provi ded that the requesting individual produces adequate evidence that the artwork in ques tion was stolen from the individual or from member of the individuals family the attorney general is also directed to undertake study of all artwork in the possession of the federal gove rnment to determine whet her any such artwork has been stolen and to report to c ongress the results of this study the bill expresses the sense of congress that 1 seller or purchaser who fails to undertake an inquiry required by this act should not be permitte d to assert in court in the united states legal claim of ownership or former ownership of the artwork 2 all museums nd auction houses should undert ake inquiries with respect to artwork in their possession to determine whether any such artwork has been stolen 3 all governments in possession of artwork stolen from victims of the holocaust should return that artwork to its original owners and 4 parties attempting to resolve ownership disputes should utilize alternat ive means such as arbitration before seeking judicial remedieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98903crs13 the bill specifically excludes published or unpublished literary works as artwork it provides definitions for the concept of family members and registries of missing or stolen art appropriations to the attorney general are authorized concerns arise as to the potentially br oad scope of the rm stolen artwork presumably the bill could cover claims extending back to the napoleonic wars the colonial period in american history or even farther the bill does not address issues of restitution compensation to unknowing andor innocent purchasers and the ownership of the artworks if and when they may be returned to family members another concern is expressed regardin g the attorney generals inquiry into artwork in the possession of the federal government first artwork does not appear to be defined in this section second the magnitude of the task raises questions of feasibility and cost for example researching the ownership history of only portion of the holdings in the smithsonian institution would be major undertaking let alone all artwork in the possession of the federa l government the bill provides time guidelines for such an inquiry hr 4563 amending the internal revenue code to exclude income received for settlement of cl aims of holocaust victims summary this bill would amend the in ternal revenue code of 1986 to exclude from gross income amounts receive d for settlement of certain claims of holocaust victims or their heirs status introduced by rep mcintosh september 14 1998 referred to the ways and means committee september 14 1998 analysis whether amounts received for ttlement of claims of holocaust victims or their heirs would be subject to us federal income tax under current law depends on the type of damages that are awarded first us residents and citizens are generally subject to tax on their worldw ide income thus for us individuals at least awards would fall within us tax jurisdiction regard less of whether or not they originate abroad beyond this there is uncertainty damages received as compensation for loss of property are not ta xable under current law but only to the extent of the taxpayers basis in the property or its acquisition cost any excess of property damages over basis is generally taxable personal physical damages are excluded from gross income for tax purposes but punitive damages are taxed thus the import of hr 4563 depends on the char acter of prospective damage awards or settlements for some characterizations the bill may simply repeat an exemption contained in current law in othe r cases it would be striking new ground
