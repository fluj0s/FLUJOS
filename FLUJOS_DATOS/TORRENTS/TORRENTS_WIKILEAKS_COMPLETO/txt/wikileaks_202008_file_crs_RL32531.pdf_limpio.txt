priorities and allocating resources for critical infrastructure pr otection none of these recommendations advocated change in the direction of or the organizational structures that have evolved to

critical infrastructure protections the 911 commission report introduction federal efforts to protect the nation s critical infrastructure predate the september 11 2001 attacks on the world trad center and the pentagon since the attacks critical infrastructur protection has evolved to include countering that type of an attack because the purpose of the commissions report was to answer how did the terrorist attack of september 11 2001 happen and how can such tragedy be avoided in the future most if not ll of the recommendations made in the 911 commissions report deal indirectly with cr itical infrastructure protection however there are relatively few recommendations that specifically address critical infrastructure protection this report will identify those recommendations and briefly discuss the possible impacts those recommendations and the subsequent congressional response might have on the nations efforts to protect its critical infrastructure recommendations related to critical infrastructure protection much of what the commission recommended for critical infrastructure protection can be found in chapter 12 section 124 of the commissions report protect against and prepare for rrorist attack starting on page 383 the majority of this section is devoted to the importance of disrupting terrorists ability to travel unchallenged around globe nd into the united states it discussed the integration of travel intelligence gathering and analysis with border protection and law enforcement operations it discu ssed screening techni ques and technologies to be integrated at all points in the process from visa application to walking through detectors at entry points to checking id entification upon entrance to certain sensitive facilities this section also discussed at some length the need to incorporate biometric screening technologies into the processes these issues however are beyond the scope of this report for mo re discussion of these issues see the homeland security border and tran sportation security page on crss congressional legislative issues webpage1 section 124 of the commissions report also focused on issues related to securing the nations transportation s ector from attack see page 390 of the commissions report strategies for aviati on and transportation security inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs2 2 the commission continues to make this point in subsequent congressional hearings see deadlines urged for terror fixes washington post august 17 2004 p a13this section the commission mentioned the aviation and transportation security act pl 10771 which established the transportation security administration tsa which is now part of the department of homeland security among other tasks the act assigned th tsa the responsibility of developing strategic plans to provide security for critical parts of the us transportation system the commission expressed concern that 90 of the annual fe deral investment made in transportation security goes toward commercial aviati on security without systematic risk assessment to determine if this is the most costeffective allocation of resources the commission noted that major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation and that the security improvement s in commercial air tr affic may shift the threat to ports railroads and mass transit systems the commission noted that the tsa has yet to develop an integrated plan for the transportation sector nor specific plans for the various transportation modes the commission reiterated the need for the federal government to identify those transportation assets that need to be protected set riskbased priorities for defending them select the most practical and costeffective ways to do so develop plan and budget and then fund implementation the commission went on to recommend that congress set specific date for the completion of the plan and hold the tsa and the department of homeland security accountable for achieving it2 in regard to aviation security the commission recommended the timely implementation of improved nofly and automatic selectee lists including the recommendation that air carrier s be required to supply info rmation to help develop these lists and that greater priority be given to detecting explosives on passengers and on studying human factors affecting the effectiveness of screeners performances also in section 124 the commission again discussed the need for systematic assessment of risks vulnerabilities threat and need when allocating federal resources to help states nd localities protect against and respond to terrorist attacks see page 395 of the commissions report setting prior ities for national preparedness the commission suggested that these federal funds should act as supplement to state and local funding in those instances where additional protection is merited based on the systematic assessmen t and not as part of general revenue sharing mechanism the commission suggested that these assessments should consider such factors as population population density vul nerability and the presence of critical infrastructure within each state furthermore the commission recommended that panel of experts be convened to develop set of benchm arks by which to evaluate communitys needs and by which to distribute federal funds th rough the state to those localitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs3 3 for more thorough review of national po licy and its evolution and implementation see crs report rl30153 critical infrastructures background policy and implementationfinally the commission made recomme ndation at the end of chapter 13 section 134 see page 428 in the commission s report which speci fically addressed all critical infrastructure the commission in discussing the different roles assumed by the department of defense and th department of homeland security in homeland security noted that dhs is respons ible for identifying within the sectors that possess critical infrastructure those elements or assets that need to be protected the commission recommended that dhs and its oversight committees should regularly assess the types of threat s the country faces to determine the adequacy and status of the governments plans to protect critical infrastructure and b the readiness of the governme nt to respond to those threats potential impact of commission recommendations on critical infrastructur protection activities the commission recommendations specifically directed at critical infrastructure protection while lendi ng the weight of the commission to certain elements of existing federal policy do not advocate an change in the direction of or the organizational structures that have volved to implement that policy the recommendations however could speed up imp lementation is some areas given the attention and renewe d urgency expressed by the commission federal policy on critical infrastructure protection is laid out in law presidential directives and na tional strategies3 as noted by the commission the homeland security act of 2001 pl107296 enacted in november 25 2002 assigned to the department of homeland security the task of coordinating the national effort in critical infrastructure prot ection specifically it gave dhs the responsibility to identify and assess the nature and scope of rrorist threats to the homeland understand such threats in light of actual and potential vulnerabilities of the homeland carry out comprehensive assessm ents of the vulnerabilities of the key resource and critical infrastructure of the united states including the performance of risk assessments to determine the risk posed by particular types of terrorist attacks within the united states integrate relevant inform ation analyses and vulnerability assessmentsin order to identify priorities for protective and s upport measures develop comprehensive nati onal plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastru cture of the united states recommend measures necessary to protect the key resources and critical infrastructure of the united states

protection priorities using this methodology dhs will build comprehensive database to catalog these critical facility systems and functions8 homeland security presidential decision directive number 7 hspd7 released by the current bush administr ation in december 2003 reiterated these tasks including directing sector specific ag encies ie those agencies acting as lead agency liaison with certain critical infrast ructure possessing sectors to conduct or facilitate vulnerab ility assessments and encourage risk management strategies to protect against and mitigate the effects of attacks these responsibilities actually predate the september 11 attack as aut horized by the clinton administrations presidential decision directive number 63 released in may 1998 hspd7 also reiterated that the secretary of homeland security is to produce comprehensive integrated national plan for critical infrastructure and key resources protection and set date of december 17 2004 by whic h that report should be developed implicit in these directives to integrate threat and vulnerabilities and to use risk assessment and risk management techniques to set priorities and allocate resources is the need to do so on continuous basi s as new information becomes available also the administration has budgeted for activities aimed at validating protection plans and to anticipate new potential thr eats by using red teams and other performance measures httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs5 9 httpwwwcrsgovproductsbrowseishomelandsecurityshtml 10 the urban area security initiative grant program was first established in the consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 p l 1087 in part to address the issue raised by the commission port security grants were first established in the usa patriot act pl 10756 and continued in the mar itime transportation security act pl 107295 the emergency wartime suppl emental appropriations act of 2003 pl 10876 allowed the secretary of homeland secu rity to provide funding for the protection of critical infrastructure unde r that authority the secretary provided funds to 14 ports and 25 transit authorities the port security gr ants initially started by the usa patriot act have been transferred to the office of state and local govern ment coordination and preparedness and administered as part of the urban areas grant program the transit grants have continued as transit system security gran ts also administered as part of the urban areas grant program these grant programs have been combined to promote comprehensive regional planning and coordination however congress continues to specify appropriations to both transit system grants and port security grants and other areas like security for intercity bus systems for more discussion of what is happeni ng in specific infrastructures see both the homeland security critical infrastructures protection page and the homeland security border and transportation s ecurity page of crss congressional legislative issues webpage9 in regard to the allocation of funds to state and localities dhs administers number of infrastructurerelated security grants one of these grants the state homeland security grant prog ram established soon afte r the september 11 attacks by the usa patriot act pl 10756 enacted on october 26 2001 and primarily aimed at firstresponders is th general revenue shar ing grant alluded to in the commissions report every state the district of columbia the commonwealth of puerto rico and us territories receive minimum fixed percentage of the progra ms appropriated resources in addition to the state homeland security grant program are the urban areas security initiative grant program to which have been added port security grants and transit system security grants10 according to these grants application guidelines the urban areas ports and tran sit system security grants are allocated to selected cities and port areas based on formula developed by dhs which considers current threat estimates critical assets within the urban area and population density one reason for consolidatin g these grants was to allow states and localities more flexibility to direct grant resources to those critical assets that warrant additional protection as deter mined by risk assessment according to grant application guidelines grantees must provide risk assessment for review the risk assessment must include threat and vulnerability assessments for each potential target th vulnerability assessment is to consider factors such as target visibility its critica lity to the jurisdiction its impact outside the jurisdiction the potential access of threat element to the target the targets population capacity and the potential for mass casualties in turn the risk assessment is supposed to inform capabilities and needs assessment to justify expenditureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs6 11 stephen mchale deputy administrator transportation security

transportation infrastructure basing resource allo cation on risk assessment across all transportation modes timely implementation of improved nofly and automatic selectee lists use of biomet ric technology in travel doc uments and other forms of identification and giving priority to imp roving the ability to screen passengers not just baggage or cargo for explosives ar all in various stages of implementation already according to hearing testimony by tsa official11 at hearing of the subcommittee on infrastructure and border security of the house select committee on homeland security may

vulnerabilities identifying protective measures assessing the performance of those protective measures and prioritizing research and development models have been developed for assessing the criticality of particular transportation asset and for assessing its vulnerability according to the testimony these assessment are in progress and in some cases build upon earlier assessments performed shortly after september 11 especially in the rail transit and ports sectors also mentioned in the testimony are pilot efforts under way to test equipment used to detect trace amounts of explosives on individual passengers for more discussion of the issues related to transportation security and the how the recommendations of the 911 commission may impact those issues see crs reports listed on the homeland securityborder and transportation security page of crss congre ssional legislative issue website12 congressional action in response to the 911 commissions re port members introduced number of bills which addressed some or all of the commissions recommendations most of these bills took on the issue of reorga nizing and reforming the intelligence community few addressed direc tly or indirectly those commission recommendations discussed above which relate to critical infrastructure protection13 two bills were chosen as the legislative vehicles s 2845 and hr 10 some of the provisions of the other bills found their wa into these two bills as amendmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs7 14 the commission emphasized the need to reevaluate on regular basis the terrorist threat and then to assess the adequacy of government plans to protect against and respond to that threat the senate language emphasized developing plans and reporting on progresss 2845 passed the senate october 6 2004 as introduced the bill primarily addressed intelligence reform however on the floor amendments to bill expanded coverage to many of the other reco mmendations of the 911 commission the provisions most relevant to this report include the re quirement as recommended by the commission that the secretary of ho meland security deve lop implement and revise as necessary national strategy for transportation security the strategy is to identify transportation assets that in the interest of national security must be protected those assets span the all tran sportation modes the strategy must also develop riskbased priorities for addressing security needs the assignment of roles and missions across federal state local and private entities the prioritization of securityrelated research and development and budgets to meet the objectives of the strategy also as recommended by the commission the bill sets deadline for this strategy the secretary must provide the strategy to congress later than april 1 2005 and less frequently every ev numbered year after that in addition the bill reiterated the dhss responsibility under the homeland security act and hsdp7 to develop plan that identifies prioritizes and coordinates the protection of ll critical infrastructures in slightly different language than that used by the commission14 the bill required the secretary of homeland security to identify those elements of th nations critical infrastructure that need protection develop plans to protect them and exercise mechanism to enhance preparedness the secretary must report to congress 180 days after enactment and annually thereafter the pr ogress being made in assessing the vulnerability and risk associated with the nations critical infrastructures the adequacy of the governments plans to protect them and the read iness of the government to respond the bill also provided for more specific protections aimed at aviation including expanded use of explosive detection per imeter security securing cockpits and reporting on the efforts to protect aircraft from manportable air defense systems ie shoulderfired missiles the bill also sought to streamline federal assistance to states and localities it established an interagency committ ee to coordinate and eliminate duplication in grant programs it also established homeland security information clearinghouse to interact with grant recipients the bill language essentially put in statute the guidance associated with the current grant program applications listed above states must submit homeland security plans that include strategies for mitigating the risks associated with attacks on critical infrastructure and identify protective measures that need to be taken by private owners of critical infrastructure in addition the allocation of urban area s ecurity initiative grant program funds were to go to localities with high degree of threat risk and vulnerability to their critical infrastructure the senate bill however did not eliminate the formulae based state homeland security grant program wh ich the commission implied should be donehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs8 hr 10 went beyond some of the recommendations made by the 911 commission while remaining silent on others the bill as introduced included many of the same specific aviationrelated secu rity measures as those added to s 2845 including expanded explosive detection perimeter security and report on the protecting aircraft from manportable ai r defense systems it did not include provisions relating to the development of national strategy for transportation security nor the reiteration of the dhss responsibilities across all critical infrastructures and associated reporting requirements it did set deadline of december 31 2004 for the national maritime transportation security plan and the facility and vessel assessments called for in the maritime transportation security act of 2002 pl 107295 in another critical infrastructurerela ted provision hr 10 also included the emergency securities response act of 2004 t itle v subtitle g chapter 2 this provision would expand the authority of the securities exchange commission and the secretary of the treasury to intervene in security markets under their jurisdictions to protect those markets in times of emergencies hr 10 included provision that ame nds the homeland security act of 2002 by elevating the division chief of the national cybersecurity division to position of assistant secretary under the unders ecretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection th is addresses somewhat the concern of some in the cybersecurity community that the current position is too low in the bureaucracy given their perception of the importance of cybersecurity to national security hr 10 also included title title xv iii f unding for first responders devoted to modifying the current federal ssistance programs the grants covered by this title included the state homeland s ecurity grants the urban area security initiative grants and the law enforcement terrorism prevention grants and the citizens corps grants this title required that the secretary of homeland security develop standard ssential capabilities states and localities should have to be adequately prepared for terrorist attack these capabilities were to be determined in part based upon the most current risk assessment available for the information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate and the types of threat vulnerability and cons equences with respect to th nations population and critical infrastructure grants were to be awarded to assist states and localities achieve the essential capabilities fo r first responders as currently is the case states would be required to submit state homeland security plan which included priority lis t of what the state or locality needs to achieve the essential capabilities noted bove these needs should be prioritized based on threat vulnerability and consequences the allocation of grants was to be prioritized based upon the degree to which th funds would by virtue of enhancing or preserving essential cap abilities lesse n the threat to vulnerability of and consequences for persons and critical infrast ructure while the funds for these grants would still focus on first responders they still could be spent on protecting critical infrastructure including the addition of ba rriers fences and other devices also while the allocation of these grants were to be made primarily based on threat vulnerability and consequences ie risk the bill still guaranteed states and other qualifying entities minimum vel of funding the t itle did liminate the granthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs9 formula developed by the usa patriot act the house bill arguably went further in basing the allocation of federal assistance grants on threat vulnerability and risk the house and senate rec onciled their bills and pproved s 2845 as amended on december 7 and 8 2004 respectively the inte lligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 was signed december 17 2004 the final bill included language in title iv similar to the senates language on transportation security requiring the s ecretary of homeland security with the secretary of transportation to devel op implement and update national strategy for transportation security across all modes and relevant assets the strategy is to include an identification of assets that must be protected riskbase priorities and the identification of practical costeffective means for defending those assets the strategy is due april 1 2005 and progress reports due ev ery two years after that title iv of the final bill also included the series of specific aviation security provisions found in both the house and sena bills this title also included compromise language on deadlines for various plans strategies and reports called for in the maritime transportation security act regarding the more generic provision on critical infrastructure protection planning the final version of the bill included much of the senate bills language sec 7306 it requires the secretary of homeland security to report to congress on the progress being made in completing vulnerability and risk assessments on critical assets the adequacy of plans to protect them and the readiness of government to respond it does not include the senates language specifically instructing the secretary to identify assets and to develop protective nd readiness plans the final bill did not adopt either the hous or senate modifications of the grant programs the final bill articulated sense of the 108th congress sec 7401 that the 109th congress must pass legislation in the first session to reform the system for distributing grant funds the final bill did adopt house language although slightly more restrictive regarding the security exchange commissions and the secretary of treasurys authority to intervene in financial mark ets during emergency situations sec 7803 and 7803 the final bill also added langua ge sec 7802 requiri ng the secretary of treasury to report on efforts to establish pub licprivate partnerships to protect the nations critical financial infrastructure it also added language sec 7804 suggesting that insurance and creditrating entities consider companys compliance with private sector standards for disaster and emergency preparedness when relevant the final bill did not include the hous language elevating the information assurance and infrastructure protection directorates chief of the cybersecurity division to an assistant secretary position httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32531crs10 concluding remarks the above discussion indicat that for some time fe deral policy has called for the integration of threat information with vulnerability assessments and to use risk assessment and risk management to info rm the planning for and allocation of resources to protect critical infrastructure the dhs is supposed to use this approach in coordinating the overall na tional effort sector speci fic agencies are supposed to use it when working with their individual sectors states and localities are supposed to use it when applying for the urban ar eas ports and transit system security grants also tsa already has some effo rts underway in thos more specific areas discussed in the commissions report rega rding improved transportation security in this regard the 911 commissions report less breaks new ground than points attention to continuing shortcomings in efforts to follow through on prior policy goals and objectives similarly the bills introduced in cong ress to address some or all of the commissions recommendations and the final bill that passed and was signed into law primarily reinforce or strengthen current policies regarding critical infrastructure protection and the need to prioritize the allocation of resources to protect critical infrastructure based on risk progress to date has been mixed depending on the sector and it is not clear how coordinated this effort has been across s ectors nor is the allocation of resources transparent enough to know to what extent the allocations actually have been based on risk assessments also congress continue s to appropriate grant funds to specific areas not necessarily with the benefit of an overall risk mitigation strategy by giving attention to these issues the commissi ons report and subse quent congressional debate may have provided some political momentum to speed up implementation in some of these areas however with much of the attention focusing on the issues related to reorganizing the intelligence community the effect the commissions report and the intelligence reform and rrorism prevention act of 2004 will have on critical infrastructure protection activities remains to be seen
