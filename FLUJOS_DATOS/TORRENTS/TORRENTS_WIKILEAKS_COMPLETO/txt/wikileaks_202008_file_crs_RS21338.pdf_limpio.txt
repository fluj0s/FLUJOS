congress ronald orourke specialist in naval affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the navy has implemented new kinds of na val formations more flexible forward deployment schedules and ship readine ss plan called the fleet response plan or frp for surgedeploying several aircraft ca rriers in short period of time to respond to contingencies the navy has also forwar dhomeported dditional ships experimented with longduration deployment s with crew rotation which the navy calls sea swap investigated multiplecrewing of ships and is experimenting with new forward deployment concept called globa l fleet stations or gfss these actions raise several potential issues for congress this re port will be updated as events warrant background new kinds of na val formations the navy previously organized itself into aircraft carrier battle groups cvbgs and amphibious ready groups args an arg typically included 3 amphibious ships that together were capable of embarking marine expeditionary unit meu which is force of about 2200 ma rines their groundcombat equipment and an aircraft detachment args traditionally operated overseas in the company of cvbgs navy officials more recently decided that the cvbgarg combination offered insufficient flexibility for deploying signifi cant naval capability in several locations around the world at the same time they also decided that with the increasing capabilities of navy ships naval formations other than the large cvbgarg combination could now be sufficient to perform certain missions as result the navy has implemented new global concept of operations conops that reorganized the navy into larger number of independently deployable strikecapable form ations the most significant change was the conversion of args into independently deploy able formations called exped itionary strike groups esgs an esg is an arg that has been reinforced with 3 surface combatants an attack submarine carrying tomahawk cruise missiles and perhaps landbased p3 orion longrange maritime patrol aircraft the global conops also created independently deployable surface strike groups ssgs each consisting of few surface combatants most or all tomahawkarmed and independent operations by 4 trident ssgn submarines th at have been converted to carryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21338crs2 tomahawks and special operations forces cvbgs under the global conops plan were redesignated carrier strike groups csgs implementing the global conops changed the navy from fleet with 11 independently depl oyable cvbgarg formations into one with 20 major independently deploy able strike groups 11 csgs and 9 esgs and additional independently deployable capabilities in the form of ssgs and trident ssgns more flexible forwarddeployment schedules the navys traditional means of maintaining forwarddeployed pr esence had been the standard sixmonth deployment although the sixmonth limit on deployment length and the predictability of the rotational deployment schedule were considered key to the navys ability to maintain its forward deploy ments while meeting its pers onnel recruiting and retention goals navy officials concluded that the dete rrent value of forwarddeployed naval forces might be enhanced by making naval forw ard deployments more flexible and less predictable navy officials also concl uded that orienting navy readiness toward maintaining standard sixmont h deployments resulted in fl eet that offered insufficient flexibility for surging large numbers of naval forces in short time to respond to major regional contingencies as result although sixmonth and now sevenmonth deployments will still take place the navy s put more flexibility into its deployment plans by deploying some csgs and esgs for ss than or more than six or seven months as operational needs dictate fleet response plan frp the navy has implemented an initiative called the fleet response plan frp that is intended to increase the navys ability to surge multiple formations in response to emergencies u nder the frp csgs and esgs that have just returned from deployments will be kept for time on alert for potential shortnotice redeployment if needed and csgs and esgs that are appr oaching their next scheduled deployment will be main tained in higher readiness status so that they too could be deployed on short notice prior to their sche duled deployment dates implementing the frp with 11 csgs the navy says permits the navy to deploy up to 6 csgs within 30 days and an additional csg w ithin another 60 days after that for this reason the frp is also referred to as 61 febr uary 2008 government accountability office gao report stated the navy has taken several positive steps toward implementing sound management approach for frp but has not developed implementation goals fully developed performance measures or comprehensively assessed and identified the resources required to achieve frp goals gaos prior work has shown that key elements of sound management approach include defining clear missions and desired outcomes establishing implementation goals measuring performance and aligning activities with resources the navy has made progress in implementing frp since gaos prior reports for example it has established goal of having three carrier strike groups deployed three ready to deploy within 30 days of being ordered to do so and one more within 90 days referred to as 331 the navy also has established framework to set implementa tion goals for all forces established some performance measures that are linked to the frp phases and begun efforts to identify needed resources however the navy has not yet established specific implementation goal for expeditionary strike groups and other forces in addition the navy has not fully developed performance measures to enable it to assess whether carrier strike groups have achieved adequate readiness levels to deploy in support of the 331 goal moreover the navy has not fully identified the resources required to achieve frp goals until the navys management approach fully incorporates the keyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21338crs3 1 government

increasing the mission capability of the attack submarine force march 2002elements the navy may not be able to measure how well frp is achieving its goals or develop budget requests based on the resources needed to achieve expected readiness levels the navy has not fully considered the longterm risks and tradeoffs associated with the changes made as frp has been implemented such as carrier operational and maintenance cycles and force structure the navy has extended the intervals between carrier drydock maintenance periods from 6 years to 8 years and begun test program that will extend some carrier drydock intervals to as much as 12 years and it has lengthened operational cycles for carrier s and their airwings to 32 months gao previously advocated that the departme nt of defense adopt risk management approach to aid in its decision making th at includes assessing the risks of various courses of action however the navy has not fully considered the longterm risks and tradeoffs of these recent changes because it has not performed comprehensive assessment of how the changes taken as whole might affect its ability to meet frp goals and perform its missions in addition while the navy has developed force structure plans that include two upcomin g periods when the number of available aircraft carriers temporarily drops from 11 to 10 the plans included optimistic assumptions about the length of the gaps and the availability of existing carriers and did not fully analyze how the navy would c ontinue to meet frp goals with fewer carriers until the navy develops plans that use realistic assumptions and accurately identify the levels of risk the navy is willin g to accept during these gap periods senior navy leadership may not have the informa tion it needs to make informed tradeoff decisions1 forwardhomeporting additional ships homeporting navy ships in overseas locations called forward homeporting can reduce transit times between home port and operating area and thus permit the navy to provide larger number of ship days on station in overseas operating areas the us navys principal forward homeporting location is japan where the navy since th early 1970s has forward homeported cvbg now csg and an arg now the core of an esg the navy traditionally has also forwardhomeported small num ber of other ships such as fleet command ships and repair ships in forward locations such as italy and the us territory of guam the navy in recent years has forwardhomeported four mine warfare ships at bahrain in the persian gulf and three attack submarines at guam increasing the number of ships forwardhom eported in the pacific can improve the navys ability to respond to contingencies in locations such as the korean peninsula or the taiwan strait2 march 2002 cbo report presented an option for homeporting as many as 11 attack submarines at guam3 the final report of the 2005 quadrennial defense review qdr directed the navy to provide at least six aircraft carriers and 60 of its submarines in the pacific the navy is implementing these two measures which do not necessarily require additional forwar d homeporting they can be accomplishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21338crs4 4 see for example statement of admiral vernon clark usn chief of naval operations before the senate armed services committee february 10 2005 pp 1719 5

puget sound area longduration deployments with crew rotation sea swap the navy in recent years has experimented with the concept of longduration deployments with crew rotation this concept which the navy calls sea swap is nother way to reduce the amount of time that deployed ships spe nd transiting to and from operating areas sea swap involves deploying navy ships overseas for periods such as 12 18 or 24 months rather than 6 or 7 months and rotating ccessive crews out to the ships for 6month periods of duty sea swap can reduce the num ber of ships the navy needs to have in its inventory to maintain one such ship on st ation in an overseas operating area by 20 or more potential disadvantages of sea swap include extensive wear and tear on the deployed ship due to lengthy periods of time at sea reduced sense of crew ownership of given ship which might reduce crews incentive to keep the ship in good condition and reduced opportunitie s for transit port calls whi ch have diplomatic value and are beneficial for recruiting and retention the navy in recent years has conducte d sea swap experiments with surface combatants and mine warfare ships that navy officials have characterized as successful in terms of ship days on station total costs ship maintenance and material condition and crew reenlistment rate s during deployment in 2004 it was reported that review of the sea swap experiment conducted by the cent er for naval analyses found that although sea swap was successful in these terms cr ew members participating in the experiment who were surveyed viewed the concept negatively and indicated they would be less likely to stay in the navy if all deployments were conducted this way the navy made changes in later sea swap experiments to address issues that led to crew dissatisfaction including lost liberty calls and increased training and work in 2005 navy officials testified that applying sea swap somewhat widely throughout the fleet could help permit the fl eet to be reduced from thenplanned range of 290 to 375 ships down to range of 260 to 325 ships4 more recently navy officials have expressed less enthusia sm for extending sea swap beyond surface combatants july 2006 press article reported that the navy may limit sea swap in the surface fleet to smaller combatants such as patrol craft littoral combat ships lcss and frigates5 the navy plans to use sea swap to keep two of its four ssgns continuously deployed6 may 2008 gao report stated rotational crewing represents transf ormational cultural change for the navy while the navy has provided leadership in some rotational crewing programs the navy has not fully established comprehensive management approach to coordinate and integrate rotational crewing efforts across the department and among varioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21338crs5 7 government accountability office force structure ship rotational crewing initiatives would benefit from toplevel leadership navy wide guidance comprehensive analysis and improved lessonslearned sharing gao08418 may 2008 summary pagetypes of ships the navy has not assigned clear leadership and accountability for rotational crewing or designated an implem entation team to ensure that rotational crewing receives the attention necessary to be effective without comprehensive management approach the navy may not be ab to lead successful transformation of its crewing culture the navy has promulgated crew exchange instructions for some types of ships that have provided some specific guidan ce and increased accountability however the navy has not developed an overarching instru ction that provides highlevel guidance for rotational crewing initiatives and it has not consistently addressed rotational crewing in individual shipclass concepts of operations the navy has conducted some analyses of rotational crewing however it has not developed systematic method for anal yzing assessing and reporting findings on the potential for rotational crewing on curre nt and future ships despite using comprehensive datacollection and analysis plan in the atlantic fleet guided missile destroyer sea swap the navy has not devel oped standardized datacollection plan that would be used to analyze all types of rotational crewing and lifecycle costs of rotational crewing alternatives have not been evaluated the navy has also not adequately assessed rotational crewing options for future ships as new ships are in development dod guidance requires that an analysis of alternatives be completed these analyses generally include an evaluation of the operational effectiveness and estimated costs of alternatives in recent surface ship acquisitions the navy has not consistently assessed rotational crewing opti ons in the absence of this costeffective force structure assessments are incomplete and the navy does not have complete picture of the number of ships it needs to acquire the navy has collected and disseminated lessons learned from some rotational crewing experiences however some ship communities have relied on informal processes the atlantic s ea swap initiative used systematic process to capture lessons learned however in other ship communities the actions were not systematic and did not use the navy lessons learned sy stem by not systematically recording and sharing lessons learned from rotational crewing efforts the navy risks repeating mistakes and could miss opportunities to more effectively implement crew rotations7 multiple crewing another strategy for increasing the percentage of time that navy ships can be deployed is multiple crew ing which involves maintaining an average of more than one crew for each navy ship potential versions include having two crews for each ship dual crewing 3 crews for every 2 ships 4 crews for every 3 ships 5 crews for every 4 ships or other combinations such as 8 crews for every 5 ships the most basic version of sea swap maintains an average of one crew for each ship in inventory but sea swap could be combined with multiple crewing for many years the navys nuclearpowered ballistic miss ile submarines ssbns have been operated successfully with dual crews the abovementioned ma rch 2002 cbo report presented the option of applying multiple crewing to the attack submarine fleet potential disadvantages of multiple crewing include the costs of recruiting training and retaining additional crews the difficulty of achieving fully realistic training using landbased simulators whose use would be more necessary because given cr ew would not always have access to shiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21338crs6 8 for more on the lcs program see crs report rl33741 navy littoral combat ship lcs program oversight issues and options for congress by

shipbuilding plans ba ckground and issues for congress by ronald orourkefor training reduced sense of crew owner ship of given ship and increased wear and tear on the ship due to more intensive use of the ship at sea which can reduce ship life the navy plans to use dual crewing for its first few lcss and then switch the lcs fleet to 431 crewing strategy when the tota l number of lcss grows to larger number under the 431 plan four crews would be used for every three lcss to keep one of those three lcss continuously deployed8 global fleet stations gfss the navy is experimenting with concept first announced in 2006 called global fleet stations or gfss the core of gfs is an amphibious ship or highspeed sealift ship that is forward deployed to region of interest smaller navy ships such as lcss might then operate in conjunction with this core ship to perform various missions the navy in 2007 is conducting sixmonth pilot gfs in the caribbean built around the highspeed sealift ship swift and plans to follow this in late 2007 with second yearlong gfs in the gulf of guinea off the western coast of africa that is to be built around an amphibious ship9 the navy states that the gfs concept offers means to increase regional maritime security through the cooperative efforts of joint interagency and multinational partners as well as nongovernmental organizations from its sea base each gfs would serve as selfcontained headquarters for regional operations with the capac ity to repair and service all ships small craft and aircraft assigned additionally the gfs might provide classroom space limited medical facilities an information fusion center and some combat service support capability the gfs concept provides leveraged highyield sea based option that achieves persistent presence in support of national objectives add itionally it complements more traditional csgesg training and deployment cycles10 issues for congress potential oversight issues for congress include the
