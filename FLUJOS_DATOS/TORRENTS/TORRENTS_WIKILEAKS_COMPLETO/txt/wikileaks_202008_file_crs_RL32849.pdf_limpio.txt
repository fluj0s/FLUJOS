issue overview summary child welfare programs are designed to protect children from abuse or neglect services may be offered to stabilize and strengthen childs own home if this is not safe option for the child however he or she may be placed in foster care while efforts to improve the home are made in those instances where reuniting the child with his or her parents is found to be impossible child welfare agency must seek new permanent often adoptive home for the child in fy2003 the most recent year for whic h complete data are available the federal government provided states with some 69 billion in funding dedicated to child welfare purposes most of this fundi ng is authorized under title ivb and title ive of the social security act apart from these dedicated federal child welfare funds however states also use nondedicated federal fundsincluding the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant medicaid and the social services block grantto meet ch ild welfare needs the most recent data available for state fi scal year 2002 suggests that st ates spent at least 48 billion in nondedicated funds for child welfare purposes while nondedicated funding streams have increased resources to child welfare agencies current legislative and administrative proposals may jeopardize th eir continued use for child welfare the way that the federal government di stributes dedicated child welfare money to states has been criticized as inflexible out of sync with federal child welfare policy goals and antiquated becau most dedicated federal child welfare funding about 65 in fy2003 may be used only for foster care critics charge that states have inadequate funds to prevent removal of children from their homes or to allow children to be reunited with their parents in addition states ability to claim most of the dedicated child welfare funds is dir ectly related to the number of foster and adoptive children it assists who meet the income family structure and other program rules of the now defunct aid to families with dependent children afdc program as that progra m existed on july 16 1996 attention to federal child welfare financing has focused almost exclusively on dedicated child welfare funding streams and is driven in part by the belief that the current structure hampers the ability of state child welfare agencies to achieve positive outcomes for children this assumption is not easy to prove however it is possible to say that the afdc link whic h ties federal funding in foster care and adoption assistance to increasingly antiquated income standards over time will erode the share of program costs for whic h states may seek fe deral reimbursement recent proposals to alter how dedicated fe deral child welfare funds are distributed included some that would link eligibility for federally supported fost er care and adoption assistance to tanf income rules and others that would remove income restrictions entirely the latter proposals which would greatly expand the number of children for whom the federal government would be co mmitted to providing s upport have typically sought to cap or block grant some or all of what is now opene nded federal funding for foster care and adoption assistance andor to reduce the share of costs paid for each eligible child by the federal govern ment this report will not be

h joe richardson carmen solomonfears and karen spar for their insightful comments on this report child welfare financing an issue overview current law links states ability to claim federal foster care and adoption assistance to the 1996 income and other pr ogram rules of the former cash welfare program aid to families with dependent children afdc this means that as the number of foster care and adoptive children who meet the static income rules of the nowdefunct afdc program inevitably declin the federal governments share of support for all children in need of protecti on will decline apart from this specific concern about the federal financing stru cture some advocates and policymakers consider the way that federal funds for child welfare programs are distributed to states to be counterproductive to the overa ll goals of federal child welfare policy common charges are that the current structure does not grant states the flexibility needed to meet the needs of children and their families and that it encourages states to rely too heavily on foster care connection between the specific federal financing structure and the ability of states to achieve positive outcomes for the children and families is hard to establish nonetheless the assumption of link between these two factors has helped drive recent attention to the federal child welfare financing structure the purpose of this report is to describe the federal interest in child welfare as expressed by congress descri be the current level and st ructure of federal dedicated child welfare financing and examine trends in the appropriation nd spending of this money and to review the extent to whic h states rely on nondedicated federal funds for child welfare purposes finally th report discusses th future federal commitment to child welfare financing along with the concepts of flexibility and accountability as these relate both to curre nt law and to recent proposals to alter federal child welfare financing1 background total spending by child welfare agencies has been increasing and all sources of public fundingfederal state and localhave contributed to this growth according to the most recent available survey by the urban institute in stat fiscal year sfy 2002 child welfare agencies expended more than 222 billion on child welfare purposes of which just over half 113 billion was from federal sources the federal share of total child welfare sp ending has risenfrom 43 in sfy1996 to 51 in sfy2002and at least for the most r ecent years nearly all of this increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs2 2 see cynthia andrews scarella roseana bess erica hecht zielewski lindsay warner and rob geen the cost of protecting vulnerable children iv how child welfare funding fared during the recession washington dc urban institute press 2004 pp 68 13 hereafter cited as scarella et the cost of protecting vulnerable children iv states report on spending for their own state fiscal year to the urban institute some states have fiscal year that mirrors that of the fede ral government ie oct 1 through sept 30 however other states use differe nt months for fiscal year eg july 1 through june 30funding has been from federal funds not speci fically dedicated to child welfare ie tanf and medicaid2 over roughly the same time period the number of children reported as victims of child abuse and neglect and the number of children in foster care have declined while the number of children adopted out of the foster care system has risen significantly whether these positive demographic trends are in some part related to the increased child welfare spending has not been determined at the same time and despite these positive trends state child welfare agenciesas wholehave been found unable to meet many of the outcome m easures established with regard to the central goals of federal child welfare policy these goals are related to safety and permanency for children and primarily seek to prevent child abuse and neglect and to protect and care for children who must be removed from their homes find permanent stable homes fo r children who must be removed primarily through family re unification or adoption and enhance the wellbeing of children and the ability of families to meet their childrens needs the failure of states to meet the federal outcome measures established may be linked to any number of thingsfor inst ance perhaps the federal measures do not accurately capture what states achieve or the degree to which states were unable to comply with federal outcome measures s been overstated or perhaps states are struggling to meet more complex needs than ever before some child welfare advocates and administrators however believe that the current federal financing system contributes to states difficulties or at the least hampers their efforts to achieve positive outcomes for children this assumption combined with concern about the l ook back to afdc may prompt the 109th congress to consider proposals to alter the federal child welfare financing structure recent proposalsincluding legislation introduced in the 108th congress recommendations from the nonpartisan pew commission on children in foster care released in may 2004 and policy option again offered in the administrations fy2006 budget proposalhave in some part focused on the perceived need for greater flexibility in state use of federal funds and removing or replacing eligibility rules that link openended titlement funding for adopti on and foster care costs to the 1996 program rules of the now defunct afdc programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs3 3 see crs report rl31242 child welfare federal program requirements for states by emilie stoltzfusfederal interest in child welfare the central focus of federal child welfare funding is to ensure safe and adequate care is provided to all children in many cases this requires providing support and services to both children and their caretaking families under the us constitution the wellbeing of children and families has trad itionally been understood as primary duty of state governments nonetheless congressional interest in improving child welfare is longstanding and as congress has authorized new funds for state child welfare programs it has also required states to enact policies and meet certain standards related to those pr ograms thus while state and local governments are the primary administrators of child welfare pr ograms and policies and practices can and do vary significantly by political jurisdicti on certain federal sta ndards must be met in all locations to ensure conti nued federal child welfare funding3 the largest federal funding streams speci fically for child welfare purposes are authorized to support children in foster care and children who are adopted out of foster care primarily some children need to be removed from their homes and placed in foster care to ensure their safe ty and wellbeing which is another way of saying for their own welfare this is tr ue without regard to their parents income or resources however when congress in itially authorized funds for federal foster care 1961 it did so as part of what wa s then the nations cash welfare program afdc thus its focus was not on ensuring the safe ty and wellbeing of all children removed from their homes but only thos children who congress had already defined to be of federal c oncern ie children in poor fa milies who were eligible for federal cash aid in 1980 when congress established fede ral foster care as an independent program rather than component of af dc and for the first time established federal adoption assistance it relied on this prior law to define the population of foster and adoptive children for whom the federal government w ould assume specific and openended fina ncial responsibility at the same time the 1980 legislation sought to give states an incentive to provide the protections and services to all children in foster care and it linked the new foster care and adoption assistance program to the much longer standing ch ild welfare services program since 1935 that program has been authorized to serve all childrenwithout regard to income however congress has provided much mo re limited funding nd on discretionary basis for this purpose during the 1990s congress passed add itional laws asserting that nearly every protection required of child for whom the federal governme nt provides funding must be extended to all children in foster care rega rdless of whether the federal government pays any of their foster care expenses examples of these protections are written case plans and regular reviews of those plans thus while the federal government has expanded the group of childre n in which there is federal interest at least from the perspective of provi ding protections and monitoring the achievement of outcomesit has not similarly expanded the share of children inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs4 4 the dedicated funding sources described in th is report are appropriated and made available to all eligible states by

dec lined since fy1983 and has been relatively stagnant since fy1990 source congressional research service crs adoption assistance among the four categorie s of federal dedicated child welfare funding

peaked in fy1999 at 567000 and has declined each year since then reaching 523000 in fy 2003 most recent year for which data are availablethe substantial growth in spending for doption is consistent with strong federal support for adoption as permanent placem ent option for children who cannot return to their biological parents in additi on growth in program spending between fy1983 and fy2003 should be expected both because the program was in its infancy in fy1983 and because the 1980 law that blished adoption assistance pl 96 272 provided it with an open ended and mandatory funding authorization this kind of funding authority allowed the program cost to grow along with the number of adopted children eligible for subsidies in fy1983 just over 5300 children r eceived federally subsidized adoption assistance payment fraction of the mo re than 314700 who received such subsidy in fy2003 over this same time period th average monthly cost to the federal government for each programeligible child has fluctuated while remaining relatively stablerising about 6from 367 in fy1983 to 383 in fy2003 see table 4 thus the substantial growth in the caseload largely explains the

include adoption subsidy related administration training and demonstration costs therefore the sum of the per child subsidy and administration costs do not equal the total per child cost for the program adoption assistance cost s projected to increase with the 1997 adoption and safe families ac t asfa pl 10589 congress sought to encourage adoption by enacting newshorter time frames for required case permanency planning for children in foster care and by providing incentive funds to states that increased the number of children adopted out of foster care the number of children adopted out of foster care was an estimated 37000 in fy1998 climbed to 51000 by fy2000 and despite decline in the fo ster care caseload size has remained relatively stable in number since that year6 in its march 2005 baseline the congressional budget office cbo projects the number of children receiving adoption assistance will continue to grow reaching an estimated 482000 childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs11 7 afdc eligibility rules including income appl to the child and the family from which the child was removed federal law prohibits app lication of an income test to an adoptive family to determine childs eligibility for adoption assistance children who are eligible for supplemental security income ssi bene fits do not need to meet the afdc rulesby fy2010 and an estimated 586000 by fy2015 this growth is projected despite the current link between the program rules of the now defunct afdc program as it existed on july 16 1996 and eligibility for federal adoption assistance7 the majority of children adopted from public foster care are eligible for adoption assistance roughly estimated as 74 the median age at which these children are adopted remains at just ove r six years of age and children remain eligible until their 18th birthday thus children w ho receive adoption assistance nowand who were adopted immediately fo llowing asfawill likely continue to receive these federal subsidies until at l east fy2010 meanwhile as states continue to complete high numbers of foster child adoptions they are joined each year by increasing numbers of newly adopted children the policy goals and dynamics of adopti on assistance are very different from those of foster care foster care is assumed to be temporary setting good practice dictates that foster children be reunited w ith families or if necessary placed for adoption within the shortest time frame possible thus the policy goal is generally to reduce the length of time child would be counted as part of the foster care caseload by contrast if adoption is the best permanency option for child the goal is to have the adoption completed as early as possible in the childs life and thus to increase the length of time child r eceives adoption assistance overall and consistent with the strong support of doption by congress spending of dedicated child welfare funds for adoption assistan ce has been rising steadily and can be expected to continue to rise foster care federal spending for foster care continues to represent the largest share of total dedicated child welf are funding at the same time its share of that funding pie has been in decline for about decade in large part due to the growth in the share of spending for doption assistance in fy1983 just under one third 65 of all dedicated federal ch ild welfare funding was expended under the foster care program that share increased at least through fy1990 and in that year through fy1994 stood at approximately 78 of total dedicated child welfare spending beginning with fy1995 the share of federal dedicated child welfare funds expended for the foster care program began to decline by fy2003 it had essentially returned to its fy1983 share of the pie see figure 2 above across those same two decades federal dollars expended fo r foster care have increased by 513 virtually the same as the rate of increase for total dedicated child welfare spending from 732 million in fy1983 to 45 billion in fy2003 because the foster care program lik adoption assistance receives federal funding on an openended and mandatory f unding basis some of the change in program spending might be attributed to changes in caseload size however an analysis of state claims for foster care shows that changes in the size of the federally eligible caseload cannot alone explain the ch ange in federal program costs the sizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs12 8 the eligible caseload referred to here is the average monthly number of children for whom state may claim reimbursement for foster care maintenance payment claims as reported by hhs in its annual title ive expenditure data the total foster care caseload including children who are eligible for federal reimbur sement and those who are not and expressed as the number of children in foster care on the last day of the given fiscal year was an estimated 269000 in fy1983 the total caseload rose through fy1999 when it was an estimated 567000 and has since declined in each year to 523000 in fy2003 9 this analysis begins with fy1987 because data on administrative claims separate from training claims are not available before that year there were large changes in claims for sacwis ie data system development and ope ration and for training within this time frame however

those linked to the old afdc program 13 third factor that might affect administra tive claims is the practice some states had of making title ive administrative claims fo r candidates on broader basis than hhs now allows and also the practice of claiming admi nistrative costs for otherwise eligible children who were placed in unlicensed homes usually those of relatives hhs has already ended or in the case of claims for the otherwise elig ible child placed with relative is seeking to end these practices in july 2001 asserting that some states had too expansively interpreted the meaning of candidate hhs issued policy announcement acyfcbpa0102 detailing which children may be considered candi date for foster care most of this policy guidance was subsequently incorporated into the official child welfare policy manual although provisions that would have denied states the ability to make title ive administrative claims for children living in licensed foster care homes were delayed and then placed on indefinite hold pending release of formal rules on jan 31 2005 hhs published notice of proposed rulemaking concerning title ive administrative claims with regard to candidates for foster care child ren placed in unlicensed relative homes and children temporarily moved to ineligible placem ent settings hhs estimates that the policy continuedsource congressional research service crs based on title ive foster care expenditure data by administrative claim category fy1999fy2003 provided by us department of health and human services fy2003 data are estimates because not all states report administrative spending in each category and especially because some states report all or most spending as other this figure is expected to have overstated the other categories if only data from the 40 states including the district of columbia that reported spending in each of the category for all four years of the analysis are included the the average fy1999fy2003 shares of spending by administrative category would be 54 for case planning 21 for preplacement 3 for determining eligibility and 22 for other the cost of foster care administration then may be substantially related to the permanency planning and other require ments imposed by federal law in 1994 congress made provision of preplacement services mandatory condition of funding effective later than the first day of fy1997 and required hhs to establish new monitoring system to ensure state compliance with these and other federal child welfare policies pl 103432 in 1997 the adoption and safe families act increased the frequency of certain perman ency planning requirements from every 18 months to every 12 months and added new caseworker res ponsibilities related to seeking termination of parental rights second important factor and one that clearly skews the pereligiblechild cost of title ive foster care administrati on is the ability of states to make pre placement claims federal law requires that the child welfare agency must make reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of children from their homes accordingly federal policy permits states to seek reimbursement for applicable costs for these foster care candidates eg caseworker time related to providing referrals to services or for case planning etc12 the ability of states to claim reimbursement of such preplacement costs means that the universe of children for whom states may make administrative claims is larger than the universe of children for whom they may make foster care maintenance payment cl aims although hard data on the number of children for whom states make candidate claims are not available hhs has recently estimated that in fy2002 the aver age monthly number of children for whom states made candida claims was

payments for foster care in explaining its estimated total foster care costs for those years14 the total foster care caseload both federally eligible and those not eligible has been in decline however both the administra tion and cbos projected reduction in the eligible caseload may be in large part due to the program rules that require child to have been removed from family that would have met the income eligibility requirements to receive cash aid under the former afdc program as they existed on july 16 1996 the statute does not provide any mechanism for inflation adjustment of these 1996 rules thus th amount of money state used nearly decade ago to determine whether family wa s financially needy continues to apply for purposes of determining title ive fost er care eligibility because the real value of this dollar amount continues to erode over time fewer and fewer children are expected to be eligible for federal foster care for more discussion of the link between afdc and title ive eligibility see the look back below overall federal spending for title ive foster care claims makes up the largest share of total dedicated child welfare spending but federal spending for title ive foster care is longer growing and due largely to the shrinking caseload is expected to continue to decline ad ministrative claims have recently overtaken claims for foster care maintenance payments as the largest share of title ive claims the bulk of these administrative claims are for case planning and preplacement costs associated with federally re quired protections for childre n and some of these costs are associated with children who are not yet in foster care but who require services to prevent their removal from the home services for child welfare federal spending for services

are described in us congress house committee on ways and means green book 1990 pp 775776most often repeated criticisms of the fede ral child welfare funding structure is that the bulk of the funding is only available once child has been removed from his or her home funding to prevent removal is more limited this is true however as noted above great deal of foster car funding in fact supports the work of developing and reviewing both preplacement and inplacement service plans or activities which might legitimately be called service outside of that critical support for the logistics of case planning however funding for services eg counseling mental health or substance abuse treatment servi ceswhether intended to prevent removal support nd preserve family or to allow for reunification or improve child and family wellbeingis relatively scarce in 1980 when congress debated enacting th current foster care and adoption assistance programs pl 96272 the need for services to prevent the removal of children from their homes was key cons ideration and congress included number of measures designed to ensure that st ates used new funds authorized in the legislation for services as opposed to foster care that legislation expressly linked the title ivb child welfare services program with the new title ive foster care program capped the amount of child welfar services dollars that states could spend for foster care and allowed states to transfer some of their title ive funds for use in the child welfare services title ivb program under certain conditions that is states that wished to transfer funds were required to have in place certain protections for children in foster care and so to select title ive funding ceiling for given fiscal year if the state had greater claims than the ceiling it would not be reimbursed for those costs if however the state submitted fewer claims for title ive funds than its selected ceiling the extra funds subject to certain limits could be transferred to the states child welfare services title ivb program between fy1981 and fy1991 states transferred approximately 218 million or 406 million measured in fy2003 dollars from their title ive funds to the title ivb child welfare services program16 the design of the transfer provisions how ever meant that as appropriations for title ivb grew the value of the transfer to states declined although between 20 and 29 states transferred funds under the provision in each of fy1982fy1985 by fy1990 just two states transferred any money and effective with fy1994 congress repealed these provisions tirely pl 103432 just be fore this repeal congress enacted significant new source of fundi ng pl 10366 established subpart 2 of title ivb of the social security act and provided funding fo

fy2002 and fy2003 although congress continued to fund the program at prior year levels for fy2004 capta was authorized at 200 million and it is au thorized at such sums as necessary for fy2005fy2008 the fy2005 comparison of appropria ted to authorized funding level then uses the most recent specific amount of author ized funding in addition because of the way the authorization level is written in the law the comparison is made between funding authorization and appropriation for three capta grants even though only two of these are distributed to all eligible states by formulastates to spend some funds on two ne w categories timelimited 15 months reunification and adoption promotion and support despite these efforts dedicated child we lfare funding for services remains small relative to funding for doption assistance and foster care the most obvious reason for the difference is that none of th dedicated service f unding is available on an openended basis and w ith the exception of some of the promoting safe and stable families program mone none is mandatory au thorization of openended mandatory funding allows actual funding to move with changes in the value of the dollar inflationdeflation si ze of the eligible populati on and changes in program requirements by contrast discretionary funding authoriz ation mean that each year the needs of given program will be weighed against multitude of other discretionary budget needs and while mandatory capped funding authorization usually guarantee minimum level of money will be available it does not necessarily provide for increases to match infl ation or new program costs see table 2 for description of kinds of funding authorizations congress has consistently used the discretion afforded by capta and title iv b of the social security act to fund gr ants under these programs below their full authorization levels child welfare services title ivb subpart 1 has been authorized to receive 325 million in every year since fy1990 but its funding peaked in fy1994 at 294 million in fy2005 it received 290 million laying aside the difference in the value of 325 million in fy2005 compared to its value in fy1990 this means that actual appropriations for this program peaked at about 90 of its funding authorization and have since declined even less of the programs authorized funds have been appropria ted under capta in fy1996 when capta funding was first appropriated under the current gran t structure actual funding was 58 million or roughly onethird 35 of the 166 million authorized wh ile this may have been program

of funding for the promoting safe and stable families program grew in each year for which the authorizing statute provided that it would additional discretionary appropriations that were first authorized for fy2002 have ra nged between roughly onethird and one half of the total 200 milli on authorization level overall funding for services in child welfare has lagged far behind growth in funding for foster care and adoption assi stancedespite longer standing funding authorization and great deal of rhetorical support the type of funding authorized ie mostly discretionary is key distinc

the administrations fy 2006 budget proposes to reduce the amount of federal matching funds most states may claim for targeted case management services and also to clarify reimbursement policies for both targeted case management and rehabilitative services38 the administration projects savings of 3 billion over five years from these proposals because these services are available to many more medicaideligible individuals than foster care children the share of these savings expected to come from state child welfare agency budgets is not known at the same time this budget proposal illustra tes the uncertainty that can surround the availability of nondedicat ed federal funding sources for child welfare proposals for change proposals intended to alter federal ch ild welfare financing have

the federal child welfare financing structure have sought to amend the eligibility requirements for the title ive foster care and adoption assistance programs specifically to end the look back provision other proposals have sought to cap or block grant funding for some or all of the title ive foster care pr ogram which is currently funded on an open ended basis still others ve sought new mandatory ope nended funding streams for particular services eg subsidized gu ardianship new mandatory capped funding for particular purposes and other funds that would be made available only to those states that improve their performance in specific areas incentive funding the following section discusses some of the issues raised by the kinds of proposals made39 the look back foster and most adoptive children for whom the state may claim federal reim bursement of costs under title ive of the social security act must meet certain eligibility requirements of the now defunct afdc as that program existed on july 16 1996 in the given state these program rules include determinations that 1 the family from which child was removed would have been found needy under the 1996 income standards in the states afdc program 2 the child is deprived of parental care or support because one of the childs parents is absent from the home incapacitated dead or unemployed and 3 the child meets age rules under 18 years of age for most children recent financing proposals have sought to change the link from the prior afdc program rules to the current state tanf prog ram rules or to remove any link to other programs for eligibility however because foster care and adoption assistance are funded on an openended basi sstates may seek reimbursement for all eligible claimsany change to the eligibility rules that increases the number of eligible children represents an additional cost to the federal treasury thus number of proposals that remove the link entirely have been coupled with some form of funding cap andor reduction in federa l matching funds for eligible claims proposals to link title ive eligibility to tanf would likely have cost as well the exact effect of this change on eligibility rates is hard to pr edict although the cost is presumed to be less policymakers first establishe d federal funding for foster care in the early 1960s at the time child welfare advocates were concerned that arrangements to ensure the safe and proper care of children were be ing made by states that routinely denied cash aid ie afdc to families in cluding children upon deeming home unsuitable40 the practice reached national ttention in 1960 after newly passedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs30 40 continued aid to families with dependent children afdc by the 1962 public welfare

include children who would have been declared needy under the states afdc program rules if they were still living in their homes and if an application for this aid had been made when congress created the adoption assistance program in 1980 it largely mimicked the then existing foster care program with regard to establishing eligibility 43 number of the welfare reform proposal s under discussion in 19951996 included major changes to child welfare financingincludi ng block grant of all identified child protectionchild welfare related funding stre ams these changes would have removed income eligibility requirements however they did not become part of the final law and in the end congress appears to have sought status quo solution by continuing to link continuedlouisiana state law effec tively removed 22501 children from the states welfare caseload by declaring as unsuitable any home where mother bore child out of wedlock after receiving cash aid check further investigation revealed that other states had similar laws or policies in place that denied aid to needy children the us department of health education and we lfare hew predecessor to hhs responded to the controversy by informing states that as of july 1961 if child otherwise eligible for afdc was denied aid because hisher home was declared unsuitable the state would be out of compliance with federal policy and thus ineligible for any federal reimbursement of their afdc costs the new regulation provided that assistance to such child must be continued during the time efforts are being made to either improve the home conditions or to make arrangements for the child elsewhere41 responding in turn to this federal re gulatory move congress acted to ensure that states received funding for any foster care placements that might be expected to result from the new afdc policy in essence federal cash aid was to follow the needy child to new suitable home and t hus the link between openended federal funding for foster care and eligibility fo r cash aid afdc was established at the beginning of the program42 in 1980 when congress established foster care as an independent program and created the doption assistance program pl 96272 it relied on the prior law to establish for what group of children the federal government would share fi nancial responsibility subs equently the 1996 law pl 104193 which abolished the afdc pr ogram and replaced it with tanf maintained this connection by including the look back provision the continuation of link between newly abolished pr ogram and an ongoing program likely occurred as matter of legislative convenien ce and because the cost of changing the link was unknown43httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs31 43 continued eligibility for most federal adoption assistance and all federal foster care to the old afdc program rules 44 calculations are based on an annualized monthl need standard for family of three and the federal poverty guidelines for family of three some states had more than one need standard eg need was considered to vary by location in state this analysis relies on us department of health and human serv ices hhs compilation of 1996 need standards which assigned single need standard to represent the entire state 45 the need standard is the maximum level of counted income that family may have and still be considered needy some states determ ined the amount of benefits available in way that meant not all needy families received ca sh aid ie state need standard was higher than its maximum cash benefit however for purposes of title ive child may be an eligible child if the family income met the states need standard that is regardless of whether or not the family would have been eligible for cash benefit 46 readers should be aware that data on the shar of all foster care children who are eligible for title ive maintenance payments are notor iously bad that the share of these ive eligible children varies greatly by state nd also may vary depending on source of data the national percentages discussed here are based on comparison of the total estimated foster care caseload on the last day of the given year compared to the average monthly number of children for whom ive claims were made in the same given yearvirtually one believes that the look b ack to repealed program makes sense today apart from administrative costs and presumed difficulties of determining eligibility based on rules of longer existing program given the lack of any inflationadjustment the pool of title ive eligible children could eventually shrink to zero this will result in shif t of costs to states andor to nondedicated federal funds eg tanf in 1996 when the look back was established the median state need standard under afdc for family of three equaled 60 of the federal poverty level by 2005 that median was 4844 this means that in as many as 25 states eligibility for the title ive foster care program may only be established for children removed from families with inco mes less than half the fe deral poverty level roughly 8000year for family of three45 in fy2003 an estimated 46 of all children in foster care nationally were eligible for federal foster care maintenance payments this is down from the mid to late1990s wh the share of all foster care children eligible for title ive s upport ranged from 5155 but higher than the mid to late1980s when that rate ranged between 354046 while the first consideration is often cost the most basic question concerning changing the look back provision isfor which children does the federal government believe there is an obligation to provide some support for foster care and adoption assistance proposals to link foster car andor adoption assistance eligibility to current state tanf rules seek to mainta in federal commitment to support the needs of children from the poorest families rem oving all income ligibility rules would have the advantage of eliminating the admin istrative burden of determining program eligibility and would suggest federal commitment to the protection of all children in need of foster care at the same time b ecause fewer than half of all foster children are now eligible for title ive foster care payments timated 46 for fy2003 without other changes to the law elimina tion of any income test could double or more the cost of the federal foster car program federal eligibility under thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs32 47 us department of health and human services administration for children and families cbo

this is due to how income and resources ar counted for child living with his or her parents the income and resources of the parents must be considered in determining afdc eligibility for child not living with his or her parents but who is living with specified relative only the income or resources of the child need be consideredadoption assistance program is estimated to be closer to 74 thus costs for this program would rise significantly albeit not as dramatically accordingly proposals to remove all income eligibility for these programs have sought to simply cap the amount of funds available for the programs ndor to reduce or neutralize cost to the federal treasury by reducing the federal matching rate for certain foster care and adoption assistance claims home of removal and the rosales decision in both its fy2005 and fy2006 budgets the bush administration has proposed amending the statute to clarify title ive eligibility rules that relate to childs home of removal legislation has yet been introduced howeve r as stated in the budget documents the intent of such legislation would be to effectively nullify march 2003 decision in the ninth circuit court rosales v thompson 321 f 3d 835 in its fy2006 budget the administration projects the savings fo r the proposed clarification of this statutory language to be 399 million for five years cbo projects the savings at close to the same amount fo r those five years431 million47 prior to rosales hhs had held that states may only claim title ive eligibility if child would have been eligible for afdc as the program existed on july 16 1996 in the given state in the home from which the child was removed for hisher protection the rosales decision however held that if the child was longer living in the home considered unsafe but was instead living with another relative at the time hisher parental home was found unsafe ie contrary to his or her welfare then the childs title ive eligibility could be based on the relatives home rather than the home found to be unsafe under afdc program rules child who is not living with hisher biological parents but is living with specified relative would nearly always be considered eligible for cash aid48 thus the rosales decision could expand the ability of states in the ninth circuit californiawhere the case originated washington oregon arizona montana idaho nevada alaska hawaii to determine that children are eligible for title ive foster care hhs has instructed states in the ninth circuit that they are to amend their plans to comply with this court decision st ate claims under this revised definition of eligibility are expected to have only recently been made if they have been made at all and the process of changing state plans and modifying how

programscblawsimim0403pdfalter their state plans in this same way but must continue to determine eligibility based on the childs home of removal49 the rosales decision would primarily impact projected federal child welfare funding if legislation to ma ke the statutory clarificati on is not made as responded to by hhs the decision effectively establishes different rules for afdc eligibility in the ninth circuit states than for those in the rest of the nation states in other circuits may also choose to challenge th hhs interpretation of the statute with regard to home of removal and determining afdc eligibility but it is not clear that another court would reach the same conclusion as did the rosales court for ninth circuit states the decision unless nullifie d by congress would allow greater access to title ive funds and c ould change policy and practi ce with regard to relative placements capping or block gran ting foster care funds advocates of capping funding for foster care argue that doing this would give states more flexibility in how they spend federal child welfare dollars and that it would be consistent with the federal governments commitment to ensuring that foster care remains temporary setting for most children recent proposal s have not suggested capping adoption assistance funding opponents of the bloc k grant argue that funding cap amounts to the federal government reneging on its commitment to protect vulnerable children even in the best run state child welfar agency caseloads may rise and children who must be removed from their homes need to be provided care in any case many also question whether these proposals meaningfully increase state flexibility in use of child welfare funds and they fear th at block granting will ultimately mean less federal money for foster care th an would otherwise be the case amount and distribution of capped foste r care funding proposals to cap or block grant foster care funding have usually based those capped funding levels on recent expenditure amounts and ve made some provisions to expand the amount of funding using an inflation ad justment or other method over fixed period of time because federal foster care spending has been decliningand is expected to continue to do sochoosing base historical spending period is an increasingly critical part of any financin g proposal in addition the share of funds each state is expected to r eceive from this grant remains key question here again recent proposals typically rely on past state expenditures or states share of overall past expenditures for given period to tablish distribution of capped funds for host of reasonsbecause states are eligible to receive different federal matching rates because they have shown differe nt ability to draw down federal funding because they have made different choices about which federa l funding sources to pursue because foster care reimbursement claims within given state are notoriously uneven from year to year nd because some states have experienced recent changes in the size of their caseloa ds that effect the distribution of funds states with caseload growth get more dollars those with declines fewerthis piecehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs34 of any financing proposal is also critical see appendix c for title ive funding amounts and overall share by state for fy2001fy2003 setting total funding at or slightly bove current spending for program and establishing distribution of that money based on prior distribu tion patterns has the strong political advantage of ensuring or limited and measured increased cost to the federal treasury enabling guarantee that state sees reduction in nominal dollars available for foster care at the same time freezing the distribution levels based on the amount of past claims made by given state locks in any current inequities in the federal child welfare financing structure and provides mechanism for changes in need for federal funding based on demographic changes eg size of child population or the number of poor ch ildren in each state may shift over time foster care caseload spikes or other factors not currently identifiable see appendix d for hypothetical distributions of foster care funds using variety of baseline data some proposals have suggested availa bility of contingency funds to meet unanticipated caseload spikes critical questions regarding contingency proposals include when could the funds be accessed g what indicates th at caseload spike is outside of the control of the child we lfare agency how much contingency funding should be available and are there othe r unpredictable circumstances that might require access to contingency funds flexibility in the context of changing how federal child welfare funds are distributed flexibility usually means nixi ng the look back provision states could serve children without regard to the 1996 eligibility provisions of the now defunct afdc program and allowing states to sp end what are now foster care program funds on any of the broad range of child welf are purposes including services some proposals have coupled broade r eligibility for title ive foster care either complete removal of the income test or modernizing the test by allowing states to use their tanf income rules with continued ope nended funding for foster care and authorization of new opene nded andor capped mandatory funding for new services or other child welfare purposes these proposals would grant states flexibility to spend federal dollars on more childre n and for greater number of purposes although those purposes would remain fined by the federal government and would generally expand the use of federal funds to permit this flexibility other proposals have advocated allowing states to spend federal funds on any foster care child and for broad range of services while simultaneously seeking to cap foster care funding andor reduce the share of fe deral funding available for every eligible child thus these proposals attempt to pe rmit flexibility with little or increase in the amount of federal funding for child welfare proponents of flexibility as part of ca pped funding proposals suggest that this change would allow states to spend mone on children before they are removed from the home and thus to prevent their removal and costly placement in foster care they cite the continued desire of states to waive program rules and spend title ive dollars on range of services as an indication of states belief that they can accomplish more with the same money if they have flexibility to spend funds howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs35 50 under section 1130 of the social security act states may seek waivers of certain federal child welfare rules contained in title ivb

state and federal spending split 50 50 for eligibility determinations averag ed 177 million annually this is small share of the overall foster care administrative cost at the same time it is significantly more than the combined funding availa ble to states under capta in fy2005 70 million critics of capped funding proposals argue that the authority to use program funds for the whole range of child welfar services could prove an empty promise given that or relatively modest new funds would be available while they acknowledge that decrease in the size of states foster care caseload could give states some flexibility they also point out that any unplanned increase in the size of the caseload would apparently constrain state flexibility in spending more than is the case now further one has proposed re duction in the far more costly federal program rules related to case planning indeed many of these rules are aimed at central goal of the child welfare systemachieving timely permanency for children in care between fy1999fy2003 the average annual total case planning and management costs for title iveeligible children alone was 20 billion as this cost and the still more costly provisi on of room and boa rd the fy1999 fy2003 average annual federal and st ate maintenance payment cost s for title ive eligible children was 34 billion will remain re latively unchanged critics charge that finding money to spend on prevention of placement might not be possible flexibility and kind of funding with regard to federal dedicated child welfare funding programs that grant states the greatest degree of choice in how they spend their money are the least well funde d and have discreti onary appropriations ie capta and child welfar services under subpart 1 of title ivb while the programs that most constrain state choi ce in spending receive openended funding ie the title ive foster care and doption assistance programs and offer states virtually ability to direct how they use these dollars outside of waivers there is some logic to this federal lawmakers like to know what they are buying without closely defined program authority an open ended funding stream is akin to writing blank check limited simply by the ability of states to imagine ways to spend the money and provide their own ma tching dollars to protect the federal treasury then lawmakers create rules that limit the federal matching rate and closely define on whose behalf the money may be used and for what purposes by contrast fixedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs36 funding programs may simply offer dollars w ith the directive that states spend these resources to achieve certain broad purposes for some the appeal of capped f undingprovided it is available on mandatory instead of discretionary basisis that states may create plan of services within the guaranteed funding leve l with regard to child welfare services in particular defining eligible children and families and the services for which child welfare should pay is sticky in general any child ma be the victim of abuse and neglect by family member the fact that poor children tend to experience maltreatment more often than those who are not poor does not mean that all or even most poor children are maltreated neither does it mean that child from middle or high income family will experience such maltreatment thus eligibility for services related to child welfare needs tends to be broadly written and the need for such service is essentially decided by the caseworker based on social work principles further many services eg counseling mental health treatment substance abuse treatment might be considered the pr imary function of other public agencies does the child welfare agency and by extension federal child welfare fundingbear responsibility for these servi ce costs or should the responsibility of the child welfare agency be to simply bring the child or parent to the service paid for out of another public source and if the service which might be costly doesnt exist eg appropriate subs tance abuse or mental health treatment services can be accessed is it the job of the child welfare agency and by extension federal child welfare funds to build such capacity capped mandatory funding c ould relieve federa l lawmakers of some of these eligibility and service need decisions and mig ht also allow states to design programs that mesh best with their own needs and resources at the same time if the amount of funding is decided without regard to curre nt resources and needs or if it is static meaning its value does not at least rise with inflation it would seem to give states less opportunity to alter the status quo accountability advocates of change to the federal child welfare structure have not called for less acc ountability butin keeping with the proposed shift to cap more of the dedicated child welf are fundingthe meaning of accountab ility has shifted from fiscal rules to outcome meas ures indeed over more than two decades congress has established mandatory data reporting for child welfare agencies required establishment of new federal review system to gauge how well states achieve the goals of federal child welfar policy and has added significant new program rules intended to better ensure th goals of safety and permanency for children are achieved while there is broa d bipartisan appeal and support for these efforts the focus on accountability without si gnificant new funding to achieve higher standards like the discussion of flexibility without new funding has drawn criticism from some advocates as well as those policymakers who believe the system is fundamentally underfunded calls for new funding sources some proposals have called for new funding tied to achievement of specific goal s eg lower caseworker to client ratio or achievement of certain outcomes eg reduced length of stay other recent proposals have supported new or increased access to federal funds for training of child welfare workers or to implement program improvements the most ambitioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs37 51 for more information see crs report rl32296 child welfare the adoption incentives program by kendall swenson 52 two additional states completed fiveyear waivers of which guardianship was component these states either withdrew their original request for an extension md or were not granted an extension of the waiver deproposals have sought new ope nended funding for particul ar categories of services or individuals including subsidized guardianship incentive or performance funding on the whole proposals for this type of funding are relatively small in scal and may be popular with both those who believe the current system is adequately funded as well as with those who think it is underfunded the enactment of doption incentives pl 10589 which provides bonus funds to states that incr ease the number of children who are adopted out of public foster care coincided with continued and expanded growth in these adoptions and encourages th idea of performance funding51 along with the significant task of ensuring that whatever measure is used adequately reflects states true performance incentive proposals must be designed to avoid perverse incentives for instance if state is to be reward ed for reducing the amount of time child is in foster care how will the states performance be measured and will this incentive encourage the state to reunify child too quickly compromising hisher safety while many of these performance fundi ng proposals would roughly follow the adoption incentives modelauthorizing relatively small pot of funding to be divvied out to states that meet the performance goalsa much broader kind of performance funding proposal would link sign ificant parts of existing federal funds to achievement of certain performance goals although formal legislation of this type has been offered informal proposal s have suggested ma intaining openended funding for foster care but li nking the amount of federal ma tching funds to the states achievement of specific outcome for specific foster care child as purely hypothetical example state could receive 75 federal match of program costs for child during the first year of hisher stay in foster care this federal match would be reduced to 50 if the child remained in care for more than three years and to 0 for state extending more than five years subsidized guardianship new spending for subsidized guardianship has been the focus of numerous proposals in recent years guardianship is legal relationship that grants custody and deci sionmaking rights eg with regard to education to an adult caretaker of ch ild proponents argue th at federal support of guardianship for children who cannot otherw ise be adopted and who might otherwise remain for many years in foster care is consistent with the federal goal of finding permanent home for every fost er care child currently five states are operating under waivers of the title ive program that allow them to use title ive funds for subsidized guardianship il mt nc nm or requests from two additional states mn wi to implement such waivers have been recently approved and at least six additional states ak ia nj va have simila r requests pending52httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs38 53 childrens defense fund state subsidized guardians hip laws at glance oct 2004 of the states listed in this report as using t anf for subsidized guardianship programs only nj is now seeking title ive waiver to fund this purpose however one of these states in had at least temporarily stopped adding new children due to reduction in available tanf funds at least half made guardianship payments under the foster care payment level and not all of them directed this guardianship assistance to children leaving foster careeleven states use tanf to fund subsidized guardianship and at least one state sd uses ssbg funds for this purpose53 there appears to be broad sympat hy for the provision of subsidized guardianship however the cost of ne w openended program continues to raise concerns proponents argue that in additi on to better meeting the needs of children the cost of guardianship primarily due to less case management cost is far less than foster care thus moving child out of longterm foster care into permanent guardianship saves money opponents might suggest that because many times guardians are relatives these family memb ers should bear the largest responsibility for the cost of raising their kin and further that such caretakers regardless of their own income are usually eligible to receive tanf cash aid on behalf of the child childonly benefits conclusion federal policymakers ma choose to alter how dedicated federal funds for child welfare purposes are made available to states this change might be prompted by the belief that the current system encourages states to over rely on foster care or otherwise hampers states ability to achieve positive outcomes for children and families alternatively more limited change may be tied to the concern that the federal statute currently links states ability to receive their largest share of child welfare funds to static 1996 income rules and that if unchanged this provision the look back will erode federal support for children in need of protection any changes made to the amount andor distri bution of dedicated fe deral child welfare funds would occur in the context of greatly varied use by states of other federal funds for child welfare particularly tanf medi caid and ssbg the varied use of these nondedicated funds and their less certain ava ilability for child welfare purposes adds complexity to the picture of federal support for child welfare congress could choose to eliminate or replace the look back provision and to leave unchanged the current structure for distributing child welfare funds for instance they could strike the look back entirely or they could replace the current afdc link with link to tanf to give n percent of the fede ral poverty level or to some other eligibility standard costs for these options would vary in relation to their effect on the size of the eligible title ive caseloads more children eligible more cost and vice versa but any of these options would address the declining federal support for foster care and adoption assistance that appears inherent in the look back provision and would not need to address other aspects of the current distribution of federal funds dedicated to child welfare eg mix of openended mandatory capped mandatory and discretionary fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs39 more sweeping changes as included in several recent proposals would greatly expand title ive ligibility but would reduce the resu lting cost to the federal treasury by capping certain funds andor re ducing the federal matc hing rate for some program purposes if policymakers choose to design more sweeping changes to the federal child welfare structure they may need to explore for what purposes federal child welfare funding might best be provi ded on capped basis affording states the greatest ability to direct th use of these funds if th ere are certain categories for which they want to insist that states mu st spend certain am ount of federal dollars eg family preservation serv ices adoption promotion and support or training for child welfare workers who assess need for services and if there are categories for which the federal government should open or keep open its checkbook eg subsidized guardianship foster care room and board case planning for children in foster care adoption assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32849crs40
