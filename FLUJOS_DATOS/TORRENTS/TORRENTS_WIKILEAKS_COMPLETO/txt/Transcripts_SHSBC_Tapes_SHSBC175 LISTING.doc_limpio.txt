listing lecture given on 14 june 1962 okay this is short lecture about listing this is lecture two 14 june ad 12 saint hill special briefing course listing listing is an activity which is engaged upon after one has found goal i gave you talk the other evening about how to find goal well the way you list goal is relatively simple if the goal is init stays in after being duly checkedyou begin listing now you may run into some problems of listing and the first problems you run into is the goal has been found the goal has been checked out the goal isthats fineand the first thing you run into are the first invalidations the pc is being careful not to make with his newfound possession so the first action of listing is prepcheck now you see wethis has nothing to do with checking out goals or anything like that only lets emphasize lists and listing all over again this person has had lot of prepchecks on this subject but he now has anew expansive opportunities to invalidate now this goal that hes got there is going to do peculiar things in the next few sessions its going to read and not read and its going to do this and its going to do that because its reads are going to go over on to lists and these reads are going to go onto items and its going to flick back and forth and itd be funny if it didnt because you are using the most powerful method of getting rid of an aberrated prime postulate that has been devised 3ga so of course its going to do something to the goal so the first thing we must know about listing is that when we start listing we prepcheck and make very sure that the goal is there to be listed thats for surebecause thats the last pure clean opportunity were going to have to nail it down now we make this as specification for this particular reason goals have often been found by other auditors and checked out by other auditors but remember if you are listing auditor who did not find the goal your responsibility for listing is tremendously great so you should start it with prepcheck now if the goal is partially listed and been partially listed youre kind of around the bend now youre not so sure about this whole thing and i know of other way to go about it than to check the line wordings for read if the goal doesnt read perhaps the line wordings will read if line wording reads of course the goal is valid now this means then that your prepcheckif youre taking over case thats had partially listed goalyour prepcheck must include discussion of items youre going to ask about goals and youre going to ask about listing and you must also ask about items specific items and auditing sessions for items why because you could get line ticking merely because it was arc broke see now these line wordings are just as vital as the goal itself so dont skimp them and theyre going to offer you some very tricky problems the usual and ordinary goal is something like to catch catfish all right thats fine thats perfectly ordinary goal that listsyou can form up the wording very easily because you simply add want not want oppose not oppose before the goal and then before each one of those who or what would see the formula is very simplenothing to this who or what would want to catch catfish who or what would not want to catch catfish who or what would oppose catching catfish who or what would not oppose catching catfish so those are perfectly valid lines in most cases but you have changed the goal havent you to catch catfish has been changed to catching catfish so theres one little alteration there that you should be rather careful of usually you will get away with it this is quite valid and everything is fine but if theres any question in your mind you had better put the goal in front of the goal itself who or what would want the goal to catch catfish who or what would not want the goal to catch catfish who or what would oppose the goal to catch catfish who or what would not oppose the goal to catch catfish now that is not perfect alternate but it might be all right not perfect but it might be all right you must realize that there is perfect wording youve got to have however want to not want to oppose and not oppose as the subject and character of your lines but goals vary and for that reasonand pcs reaction to goals vary semantics gets in the road of it now any way that you can get the actual goalas originally wordedexpressed is the best way to word it that is the best way to word it now i can give you an alternate wording butof various kindsbut wording would fail to have in it want not want oppose and not oppose those are the four lines they are not necessarily in that order while you list them but those are certainly the proper ways and each one is preceded by who or what would not could or can or anything but would who or what would always who or what would and now we get into interesting things i have not seen many negative goals prove out but negative goals can existnot to invalidate negative goals and its very very remarkable that negative goal does not lend itself to good listing at allwordingdoesnt lend itself to good wording lets take the goal not to be detected thats the goal not to be detected not even to not to be see its not to be detected thats my goal not to be detected thats it its not to not to be detected see just not to be detected what the hell are you going to do with this well it depends on your meter your problem is to get want not want oppose and not oppose in front of that goal and who or what would in front of each one of those in some fashion that underscore registers on the meter like the goal its got to register got to make sense to the pc so theres two tests there that you can immediately resort to now if you word it wrong youre going to get cows dinner youre going to have three lines worded right and one line at right angles to the federal church incorporated and has nothing whatsoever to do with the case theres going to be one line missing now that the pc can or cannot list on line is actually test thats not test because the line not oppose is always something on the order of reaching into the wild blue nowhere because it has never offered any resistance it is the bull and the cape see nothing solid to push against every time he lunges at the cape theres nothing there so you say to the pc who or what would not oppose catching catfish and the pc goes nothing there you know makes him feel bad dandy its nothing wrong with that so he feels bad but thats test so he feels bad but if you were running that and the pc was telling you he has lot of trouble with itmost pcs will tell you they have lot of trouble with it believe its vital line because its one of the four flows well lets suppose you worded it up in some fashion who or what would not oppose catfish see you make horrible error like that see everything else was catching catfish or to catch catfish but this last onethis last one was would not oppose catfish well hes going to have very interestingvery interesting list doubt its going to be fine list but that needle is never going to go free its going to park the case you see mess now the negative goal offers you the problem of the double negative who or what would not oppose not being detected isnt that horrible so the word the goalby the wayby the way dont say that thats impossible not to use the double negative because for some reason or other pc has already listed well on double negative and wouldnt have it any other way and just listed fine but we cant count on all pcs doing this that well so we get the goal interposed in there as method of separating out the double negative who or what would not oppose the goal not to be detected now when youre doing that question enters into it on the first line who or what would want the goal not to be detected doesnt work does it audience mmmm mm well its mess now youd better reach into the truth of the situation because that first line is basically concerned with an item which does have this goal so in that particular case you can test the line who or what would have the goal not to be detected so we drop out want and wed substitute have but notice all the rest of them fall into line quite well but that one changes do you see that youve got to get four flows that operate against this linenow this particular goalfour flows that operate around and with and in this goal now what do those flows consist of the goal is prime postulate which has accumulated on to itself number of identities by which the purpose could be executed it has assumed these identities because there were bunch of people that didnt want the goal and those were stupid and incomprehensible so one had to prove it to them that the goal was okay and there were bunch of more people who violently and desperately opposed this goal and there were bunch more people who didnt oppose it and nevertheless were in some peculiar way associated with it now if you cant express those flows on your four listings directly and immediately surrounding this prime postulate of course the thing is not going to go clean this thing is going to mess itself up one way or the other now to change wording in midflight can be quite upsetting to the pc so after youve prepchecked and fixed up the goal and it registers and it reads and it bangs like mad and everything is fine and any little dabs at listing or monkeying with it or invalidationthese things are all knocked out and theyre all cleaned up beautifullyyou make sure of that wording and that wording should register now after youve gone into the wordingmake sure that you go into it well enough and thoroughly enough with discussion with the pc and that sort of thingthat this wording actually works out to be the wording for the four flows for that goal because after that to change it is going to be upsetting now this doesnt say that you will never change the linethe wording of listing because youll pull bloomer sometime or another on something and youll suddenly find out this line never has listed you know nothingno item on the line has anything to do with anything youve been doing and something like that that would be almost catastrophic however try desperately to hold to your original solution having established it so establish it with care and then hold to it unless the spot is absolutely untenable if every time you say to the pc who or what would not be catfish or whatever the goal is he says ii cant answer it see and you get the middle rudiments in beautifully polish it all off and he still cant answer ityoure faced with some kind of super emergency of this particular character in other words your wording was wrong in the first place and now it has moved into full view and the moon shines piteously down upon it all and your crime lies stark upon the moor well the thing to do is be right before you start it isnt saying you cant recover from it but itd be upsetting if you had topc now feels all confused now in listing you probably will list against lowsensitivityset tone arm in other words you just turn the thing on barely and keep your needle more or less at set so as to get your relative tone arm read and position now you get your relative action without having to madly shift the tone arm all the time to keep your needle on the dial in other words it can be neglected for periods while youre busy writing and the fur flying in all directions now every fifth session youre going to prepcheck the whole subject of goals listing auditing and so forth newly just as you did in goals assessment and youre going to run the middle ruds regardless of how often you prepcheck them every time you stop running listregardless of whether it needs it or not youre going to get the middle rudiments in every time you stop listing on list now youll find that theres periodic order of frequency of action for each list which diminishes boy didnt that sound complicated tisnt ill say it in english it decreases the length of time list is active for one listing before you leave it to the next becomes progressively shorter youll get good action on the ta on list and then the action will slow and become less impressive get your middle rudiments in go to your next list and list that and youll find out youve got your ta action back again and then that will diminish so you re always running to diminish ta action now i couldnt tell you because we cant hazard guess where this prime postulate is going to sit on the pcs track what gpmwhat track or rather what cycle gpm is this thing preceding well we dont know that so we dont know how much bank were relieving and so forth but ordinarily id say half hour of listing on list seems overly long but you probably you probably at the beginning on very muckedup pc would only be able to listif youre going to list all the ta action out see all the ta action is going to come out and so onyoud probably find it sessioni just want to give you an examplea session per list see youd listlist one for session list two for session list three for session list four for session you understand im not recommending that dont put that down as recommended im just giving you how long that list would remain active before the ta action went out of it it is however very unbalancing and impractical to do anything like this its impractical so you just dobetter do it by the count at first or by the minutes or any other way but if you stop pc in the middle of an automaticity he gets suppression so allowallowing for automaticities you more or less list an arbitrary number for each list making perhaps fifteen minutes list early onsomething of this sort you list maybe fifteen minutes on each list list fifteen minutes get your middle rudiments in list your next list fifteen minutes get your middle rudiments in list your next list fifteen minutes get your middle rudiments in list your next list fifteen minutes and get your middle rudiments in go back to your first list and list it now of course none of those lists were exhausted so your ta action there is deceptively high now if pc gets into an automaticity for heavens sakes dont stop him in his tracksplease please dont stop him in his tracks because hell do suppress so if pc is listing rapidly and freely let him go on listing but that doesnt mean four sessions you understand doesnt even mean one session because none of these automaticities will run more than maybe 135 150 175 items thats an awful lot and thats an extreme automaticity but theyll just start firing off you know waterbuck tiger clock policeman you know and youre having hell of time keeping up with him now on listing it is very very bad form to do either one of two things to tell the pc to wait while you write the thing down and to fail to write it down either one of those things is crime you pays your money and you takes your chance however the pc will comm lag in the ordinary course of human existence adequately as he runs along on list line to give you lags at which moment you can catch up of course if you got into 135item automaticity that was firing off like machine gun youve practically had it now how you handle that i dont know as far as solution to the thing is concerned its wrong to stop the pc and its wrong to miss the items well you say well i guess ill just have to write faster yeah thats good answer thats good answer another thing you could do of course is set tape recorder going back of younot advised you wont find that you have too much trouble with this but there is some little problem comes up in connection with it now when youre so busy writing how do you ever find time to keep your auditors report thats difficult too but actually pcs can be encouraged to comm lag you say well you think theres any more on that particular list now who or what would not want to catch catfish you already knew hed run out see thats not advised either but im afraid i would subterfuge to it in more agonized moments of auditing now your setup on listing is that your lists must be kept of parity length try to keep them somewhere on the equal number of pages dont let one list run madly ahead of others and you will see this tendency before you have been listing on four lists very long you will all of sudden look over at list three who or what would not oppose catching catfish ahumpf it has twenty items on it and everything else has two hundred now youre up against the horrors of trying to catch that list up now how do you do it well you dont encourage any additionals on any of the other lists thats all you list some on who or what would not oppose catching catfish you list quite few see you list as many as you can possibly get listed and then you list briefly the other three lists just almost as many as are volunteered you just say the name of the list and the fellow gives you one item and you say fine and you say the name of the list and he gives you one itemthats the next listand you say the name of the next list and he gives you one item and then you of course have gotten your middle rudiments in very carefully when you left this other list do you see well get them in again very carefully you know and then list eighty on it you can bring list back to balance but really its quite wrong to get the list far out of balance now in the first part of listing you list more or less arbitrarily in other words you list arbitrarily as in terms of time you keep an arbitrary number increasing that is to say youyoure listing maybe twenty per each and so forth because its not important early on its such mass anyhow that it doesnt make much difference as long as they all get listed and then as long as theres some equality in the lengths of the lists youre not going to get lost as you go along the line but later on theres another factor enters into listing as you come on down the homestretch you will find that you are up against the terrible thing called free needle now let point out to you that it is an auditors code break to list line on which free needle has appeared why is it code break because then youre running process that is not producing change see that so you come on down the line and youve listed six eightsomething like thatand all of sudden the needle is floating and free well dont sit there admiring it stage four needle can be mistaken by the way for free floating needle but only by very amateur amateur stage four is repetitive sweep up and stick and fall and so forth well the free floating needle just drifts its beautiful thing to see you never make the mistake of reading one after youve seen one oncethat is free needle well when you list down to free needle youre now going to upset the interesting pattern of your way because youre only now going to list the next line that produces needle reaction so you list down to free needle and then you read the next line to the pc with the forecast of this is test see and if that free needle isnt upsetthat is to say if it doesnt stick or bop or do somethingyou dont list that line you skip that line you go on to the next line after that and test it if it remained free you go on to the next line and you test it and if it remained free you go on to the first one and test it and if it remained free and you couldnt get any of the four lines to react at all you better find new goal because that one is dead but toward the end of listing you will discover that you had better list by testyou better list by test in other words line one all of sudden has taken it into its head to float free and line two doesnt upset it but line three does so youd better list line three to free needle but if it doesnt go to free needle after little while you figure youre running on too far and too fast youd better go to line four do you see what youre trying to achieve there is listing by test youre only going to list against the needle in other words if you dont get needle reaction when you read the line who or what would want to catch catfish then you dont list it youll find this way at the end of the case you catch up all the inequalities of lines when those inequalities are all caught up by the way theyre not numerical inequalities theyll just be charge inequalities dont you see your lines now at the end by doing this might get quite uneven they wont become double the length or anything like that but they will become uneven just because youre listing against needle reaction now i must caution you against the sins of overlisting the of overlisting is of course an auditors code break the needle is free and it isnt upset by line and it isnt upset by further itemsyoure of course listing flat process it is like running process that longer produces change on the case and itll upset the pc but that isnt why you mustnt overlist you can fix up an upset im sure you can keep in rudiments now thank god but your goal that youre operating with on this pc is not the prime postulate of his entrance into this universe it is only the beginning of some cycle or another that you have laid your paws on through goals assessment and it might be more ancient than few centuriesmight be that close to pt now look this thing has some dim harmonic against some other goal earlier or something because theres earlier material that can be pulled up and you get too enthusiastic and you start yanking in earlier track because youre pressing the pc to give you items and the pc obligingly starts picking up the wrong gpm so you list just to free needle you dont list beyond free needle on each one of the lists my you know ill tell you this on the side its great relief to be able to talk to you about what you do with free needle so anyway its little merrygoround and you keep going around one two three four one two three four one two three fourlike well ordered engine and it batters down the gates of jericho like bang so theres nothing much to handling it providing you are listing the right lines and you kept your rudiments in when you did so now toward the end you will find that getting the middle rudiments in every time you list one item gets to be just little bit of strain and more tends to throw the pc out of session than in so i would only get them in as i went around each time there was beefy line listing going on or you did fifteen items or you did ten items or you did something like that now get the middle rudiments in and now youve got two and that only took one or two items each and then the third one it took ten items well get your middle rudiments in against the ten do you see and youll find out youll make more progress otherwise than that early on in listing you run it every time you have finished listsee every time youve stopped listing on this now the reason pc stops listing is because the pc has some middle rudiment outjust mark that up that is the only reason pc stops listing whether hes listing goal or hes listing any kind of line proceeding from goalonly one reason is the middle rudiments are out pc however can accumulate sufficient residual charge on the subject between sessions and so on that the middle rudiments have to be prepchecked to get it all swept in so you could perhaps find that the fourth session after your prepcheckyour last prepcheck of the middle rudsran more arduously than the one that ran immediately after the prepcheck session but listing stops andtake it from its absolutely trueit only stops when the middle rudiments are out it does not stop because the pc is out of items it doesnt stop for any other reason you could probably force pc with middle rudiments to list thousand items on single one of these lines the fantastic imbalance which this would cause in bank would be absolutely frightful but you could use middle rudiments to make him list quite happily on all thousand before you touched the other three if you did such thing you ought to be shot but im just showing you the extent of the middle rudiments in assisting listing never get the idea that the pc has run out of items never get the idea that this is oh well naturally he cant think of any more and so forth this is not true he hasnt thought of single one since you started auditing him he hasnt he hasnt thought of single item pcs dont think of items they deal them off the bank if he had more items to deal off he would have gpm so obviously he stops listing only when the middle rudiments have gone out and he therefore cant get into communication do you see now what do you do after you have brought one goal and four lists down to free needle on each list that is the end of your first stage in earlier days you would have called this clear and gone around and patted everybody on the back well well still call it clear why not because we havewe can say stable clear we can say theta clear we can say other states of case dont you see that guy is sure clear you can clear up his needle almost any time by cleaning up the middle ruds on the goal or something see or on lines or on life or something you can always get your free needle back he wakes up in the morning he finds out that hes at 324 constantly or do little prepcheck and you can get that out of the road and he 11 happily wake up every morning deadon at 30 do fish and fumble for fifteen minutesyou could probably accomplish that you see ten minutes eight minutes so your listing is auditing and is done as the sole operation of auditing now you want to watch your acknowledgment in listing this is another little tip the fellow says grizzly bear lion wolf asomething other so on well now of course the fact youre writing these things down is an acknowledgment all by itself thats quite an acknowledgment but you keep up little humming song of mmhm and let tell you you will be lot lot better off than he says lion you say thank you well thats the end of that man the guysits back andwhat happened youre not now going to get the next two items until you get the middle rudiments in its operated as an invalidation you ended cycle of course end of cycle is the end of the list so listing is sort of on the basis of he says lion catfish grizzly bear wolf and the auditor each time is sayingor as often as he gets around to itsaying mmhm any more all right saying mmhm got that all right thank you and so on hes just going on now an auditor doing listing very often feels so much like secretary obeying the boss that they lose control of the session ive noticed this as phenomenon they get so willing to be inflowed on that they dont control the session and that is the first great auditing error in listing you just keep writing and you never do anything else and the next darn thing you know the pc is out from under all the rudiments are outnot just the middle rudimentsand youve got hell to pay so when youve stopped listing you give him good acknowledgmentnot to blow him out of the chair or something like thatbut you give him good acknowledgment and say now were going to do the middle rudiments and you go ahead and do the middle rudiments in very brisk fashion now in listing you peculiarly must look much more like an auditor at the time you are doing rudiments and middle rudiments than you would in prepcheck session you must really look like an auditor when you were doing these things because youve so little looked like an auditor before then there you are scribbling away and saying mmhm mmhm yes mmhm fine and you write and you write and paper and trying to catch up and the pc sees hes got sweat streaming off your brow he sort of slows down and we see that we have two pages here nowweve listed two pages on everything else so that sounds good so we say all right now were going to do some middle rudiments and right about that moment you fix him with your beady eye you know and man you really do those middle rudiments now in this session is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal yes what have you failed to reveal hmmm all right good ill check that on the meter in this session is there anything you have failed to reveal good get that cleanclean as wolfs toothfinish it up you say all right now were going back to listing put in the rfactor and you read off your next lineread it off as good auditing command thats really the last auditing command youre going to give him till youve listed two pages dont you see youre going to read it to him occasionally going to remind him of it your first one is who or what would not oppose catching catfish and he says grizzly bear and so forth and heyou go ahead and you write mmhm mmhm mmhm fine fine fine your actual acknowledgment is when youve finished listing for that list then you give him the cheery thank you and youve got to take over control of the session again its one of these awfully long auditing answers you see who or what are not singular you consider them as plural auditing request and if you consider it as plurality of auditing request then youre not always getting in his road by sayinghes saying grizzly bear lion aaaa wolf and and right about the time he said grizzly bear you see you said thank you now who or what would not oppose catching catfish what are you doing burning up time man he knows what hes talking about he hasnt lost the auditing command see what are you doing getting in his road well he sort of runs down and you know you got to make two pages on this sprint see he sort of runs down and you say all right now who or what would wantwould not oppose catching catfish see got some more there see and go on running and he thinks about it and so forth and hell get some more now supposingsupposing you had ayou had goal set and you actuallyyourselfand you had to get two pages out of this pc how are you going to get the two pages out well its by throwing the middle rudiments in when he just refuses to go on well he says thats all i can think of well you see he hasnt thought of any anyhow so you get theyou get the middle rudiments in and also get them in when you have finished the list you see so thats the additional use you must get them in when you have stopped listing list of any length you see you must get them in but you coax him into additional listing by getting them in when he stops hes sitting there and hes saying ah mmmm hrrrr i just cant think of any more i mean its all too dreadful and youve got two pages to go and youve only done one you see so you better roll up your sleeve and you say all right well thank you see and now lets get some middle rudiments in before we go on listing on this list you get the reality factor in there see never let him think youre going over to some other list get them in square them up find out what it was and hell come back up pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketa you see you got your two pages you say all right thats it we hit our quota here thank you very much all right we got that nowthank you good thank you thank you hes now going to run four pages on you dont you see you say all right were going to do some middle rudiments here before we go on to the next list all right good good all right and go ahead and do so pc takes handling on lists and you sit there as an animated woundup stenographer see youre going to have bad time youve got to control that session but the liability of listing session is you look like youre so little in control when youre writing the thing but of course you in resumption of control you have to do with little more power than you would ordinarily do so but its all very delicate and its very easy to smash these items down its very easy to glum it up one way or the other now if you fake one item just like listing goals listif you fake one you know very well you may never null these things you probably never will and supposing you say because were never going to null these things it doesnt matter whether i understood did he say wolf or wuff youve entered missed withhold into the session and its going to blow up so you have to ask him right then when you missed it i didnt get that did you say wolf he said i said wuff you say wuff whats wuff see remember remembertr 2 whats wuff well wuffs wuff well theyre big boundy things thattheyre big boundy things you know and they have hair all over them and someoh they were on some other planet around here oh kind of animal on another planet is that it oh yeah he said wuff ohho you say well good good and you write it down but you just let it go on the basis of mmhm im just going to fake it in you know and the next thing you know hes slowing down and youre slowing down and your auditing is tiring you out and you dont know whether youre going or coming now keep your rfactor in but also keep those missed withholds off the auditor huh tr 2 says that you understand and he gives you bunch of porridge and you dont know where to pour it you better find out man he sounds quitequitequite raspy sometimes hell sound quite snarly to you sometime what are youidiot whats the matter with you you dont know what wuff is you know wuff you know wuff wuff wuff wuff wuff well the reason hes acting like this is because he thinks heyou have missed withhold thats the only reason the asperity and as soon as you eventually get it if you really do get itthe apparency of the missed withhold disappears and that makes it all right see the thing to do wrong at that time is not to get it you want to know what wuff is he can tell you what wuff is of course it really doesnt matter to hill of beans whether factually whether you get that its wuff or wolf or what because youre never going back over it again except if you didnt understand it and falsity enters into the session there which can crash the whole session you see next thing you know you dont like auditing this pc your hand gets so tired when you write therell be all kinds of things like this its just missed withholds you didnt know what the hell the pc was talking about you were missing them then the pc gets sensitive to these things you know and then it enters into the tone of your voice and next thing you know his session is going out and he doesnt feel like listing and you cant keep the middle rudiments in and god help us all keep your rfactor up and for gods sakes understand what the pc is saying before you go on very very important now you look over the lists quite routinely count them up make sure theyre in parity do good administration on the thing make it so these things can be looked over and so on one of the things you do with list or one of the things you will notice about list is when an actual goal is being listed out that the items will transfer over from list to list and it almost is test that when an item has been on all four lists why thats about the way it is its very funny but i mean the item will transfer officer an officer is something that would want to catch catfish and then an officer is something that would not want to catch catfish and then an officer is something that would oppose catching catfish and then an officer is something that would not oppose catching catfish as idiotic as it may seem hes even thinking of game warden you know he would not oppose catching catfish by this time its gone the full route and all four flows are discharged off the item and the item is fully discharged against other items and it lies null so you find the whole list tears on through this pc is trying to do this or is trying to strain at it or something like thathe will soon fall wise to the whole thing well now that is listing after listing is completed find yourself new goal i wish i could tell you how many goals there should be on the new list forto find the new goal i cant at this particular time however i can make very good forecast founded on very accurate information that the list would only be about half as long and that the length of time it would take to find it is briefer and the amount of items it would take to list it out are less and you getas we already have had ample experience of in routine 3syou get dwindling quantity of everything and eventually you cant get anything and nothing will stay in and so forth and you hit the pc on the rim and he rings for an hour you should with this particular thing wind up at the other end of the line with awith theta clear now its also my guess that on most pcs you will eventually find type of goal that you find in the basics of scientology these things will registersuddenly register why didnt they register before is there one basic goal for all pcs oh yes but they darent reach it and its not real you want the goal that registers nownot the perfect goalbecause they eventually get back earlier and earlier and earlier and earlier on the track and they will eventually run into prime prime prime exclamation point postulate which sweeps all before it you will see then that theres broader generality going into this thing and its regular progress back on the track different areas are being tapped different subject matter being hit what happens to the gpm as it is being listed actually the repetition of items gets the discharge off of the basic postulate which you call goal and the definition of goal is basic postulate for whom the individual has taken full responsibility therefore as that tends to be dischargedthat is to say the items bricks built up on that postulatetend to not resist the postulate anymore the postulate itself runs out and because it is the only brick that is keeping the house built you dont get the house falling downthis is not the result of it you dont get the house being blown away and moved over into the next county you dont get the house being disintegrated or sold as scrap its just oddly enough the house diminishes and diminishes and the bricks get thinner and thinner and you eventually have nobrick nobasement firstfloor noroof nochimney edifice the pc is now sitting there with all the experience accumulated on the line and none of the mass because theres alteris connected with it theres way known to man or beast to get prime postulate back earlier than his experience so of course hes had it you say how stable is clear clear is stable as youre unable to put prime postulate ahead of the whole track again see thats how stable clear is and of course you cant do it now that doesnt say that you couldnt get the pc sitting there gritting his teeth making new prime postulate and going out and fighting the whole world to make that postulate stick and not have him accumulate gpmin another two hundred million years hed have something to show for gpm hed be in rather serious trouble let us say in fifteen
