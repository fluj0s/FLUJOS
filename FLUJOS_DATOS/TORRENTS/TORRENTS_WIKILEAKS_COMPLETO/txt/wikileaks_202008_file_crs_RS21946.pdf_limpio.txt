exemptions from the acts wage and hour standards section 13a1 of the act provides that section 6 and s ection 7 will not apply to any employee employed in bona fide executive administrative or professional capacity or in the capacity of outside salesman to it was subsequently dded language exempting certain academic administrative personnel and teachers i n elementary or secondary schools congress did not define the veral terms but rather left them to be defined and delimited from time to time by the departme nt of labor in october 1938 the first federal wage and hour ad ministrator elmer f andrews provided the original regulation governing the section 13a1 ex emption and in it defined the concept of bona fide executive administrative or prof essional workers the andrews rule took up twothirds of one page in the federal register 1 through the years andrews successors have modified that original ru by administrative action adding qualifying standards and tests for exempti on and defining applicable cepts as the regulation hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21946crs2 2 federal register mar 31 2003 pp 1556015597 see also crs report rl32088 the fair labor standards act

and education may 4 2004evolved two general tests for exemption have emerged first an exempt worker had to be paid at rate befitting an execu tive administrator or professional second the worker had to perform the duties of an executiv administrator or pr ofessional several standards were developed for outside sales workers and for those in educational fields with the passage of time the threshold of the salary or earnings test eroded until it closely approximated the federal minimum wage the duties test very slowly expanded taking into account new types of work that had developed since the 1930s some argued that each of the tests had become by the end of the 20th century considerably outofdate on march 31 2003 wage and hour admin istrator tammy mc cutchen published new proposed rule governing section 13a12 during threemonth comment period on the proposed rule dol received about 80000 pieces of testimony on april 23 2004 the department published final rule that would take effect on august 23 20043 the newfinal rule which is now operational provides for an increase in the salary level to qualify for exemption provision generally acceptable to labor persons earning less that 23660 would automatically be protected by flsa minimum wage and overtime pay requirements those earning more than 100000 and performing any executive administrative or pr ofessional function may be exempt between 23660 and 100000 however coverage or exemption would be determined by the duties test substantially redefined and some argue broadened significantly to expand exemption under section 13a1 labor has objected strongly to th is redefinition employers generally appear to be more supportive of the initiative4 in its current printed form in the federal register the final rule is of two parts regulatory analysis and statement of intent followed by the precise language of the rule per what its impact will be is not clear labor secretary elaine chao declared that the rule strengthens and clarifies overtime protection5 administrator mccutchen affirmed that the final rule is clear straightforward and fair6 but not everyone is so sanguine ross eisenbrey of the labororiented economic policy institute argued that the department has chosen to adopt new defin itions that are unclear and new tests for exemption that require casebycase analysis that will be almost impossible for wagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21946crs3 7 eisenbrey testimony senate appropriations committee subcommittee on labor health and human services and education may 4 2004 8 senators

rule reportedly stated that the rule will spawn lots of litigation lots of class actions senator tom harkin d ia critic of the final ru branded it as antiemploy ee and an attack on the 40hour workweek8 still representative john boehner roh chair of the house committee on education and the workforce was upbeat is it the final rule going to be perfect is it lot better than it was absolutely9 the section 13a1 exemption is potentia lly the broadest under the flsa the government accountability office gao s estimated that between 19 and 26 million workers in 1998 under the old rule fell in to the category of executive administrative or professional employees10 not all of these workers would necessarily be affected by the new rule but many could be puty wage and hour administrator alfred robinson addressing the potential impact of the final rule projected that some 107000 employees earning over 100000 year satisfy ing other requirements of the rule could be classified as exempt but added that dol believed even that was unlikely italics in the original robinson added few if any workers earning between 23660 and 100000 are likely to lose th right to overtime pay11 eisenbrey suggested that the rule could strip away the right to overtime pay for over six million workers12 methodologies differ and so do underlyi ng economic assumptions how many workers will be affected and which groups of workers they may be is unclear at this point much depends upon how the department of labor fines the various terms and concepts imbedded within the rule what actions employers may take to accommodate their operations to the rule and the general economics of the marketplace but it may not be unreasonable to expect the impact to be at least potentially substantial release of the
