updated august 19 2003 benjamin jones research associate christopher bolkcom specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress longrange bombers background and issues for congress summary the air forces longrange bombers were designed during the cold war to deliver nuclear strikes against the soviet union although they can be vulnerable to enemy defenses if detected they combine the ability to fly extended distances much farther than most other combat aircraft with the ability to carry weapons payloads many times larger than that of fighters over the past decade the air force has taken advantage of these characteristics by migrating its bomber fleet from nuclear to conventional role today the air force maintains three bombers the b1b the b2 and the b52 and each has been outfitted with variety of precision and dumb weapons for conventional strikes in recent conflicts in afghanistan 2001 and iraq 2003 bombers have played prominent roles questions remain however about where bombers fit into air force spending priorities some argue that because bombers can be vulnerable against advanced air defenses scarce resources are best spent on other programs that can address the full spectrum of potential future conflicts such as the fa22 raptor others counter that the range and payload of the bombers many times that of fighters like the fa22 make them extremely valuable and believe that modernizing them building additional aircraft and developing nextgeneration bomber should be top budget priorities decisions in congress and the department of defense regarding bombers may have important longterm implications each of the three bombers is in need of expensive upgrades and decisions about the funding of these upgrades may affect the continued utility of these aircraft second debate has arisen over whether to expand or contract the bomber fleet third military observers and policymakers disagree about when to begin nextgeneration bomber program some push to begin new program immediately while others advocate waiting decade or more before initiating development of new bomber this report discusses the background status and current issues surrounding the air forces longrange bomber fleet before addressing each of the three bombers individually this report analyzes issues

longrange bombers background and issues for congress background during the cold war the primary mission of longrange bombers was to deter nuclear attack on the united states by threatening the soviet union with retaliation manned bombers the airborne leg of the us strategic triad were designated as secondstrike force that would hit back after soviet attack in the cold warera policy makers envisioned fleet of over four hundred bombers enabling the united states to overwhelm perceived ongoing improvements in soviet air defenses during the late 1980s and early 1990s the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union led policymakers to reconsider the value of bombers at the same time us economic recession led to military spending cuts because bombers are among the most expensive systems in the air force inventory they were ripe targets for funding cuts during this period the planned procurement of b2s was reduced many b52s were retired and an ongoing debate began about retiring number of b 1s in 1992 the bomber force was combined with other powerprojecting assets of the air force when strategic air command and tactical air command merged to form air combat command acc according to the air force this restructuring reflected an integrated way of thinking about air power the role of longrange bombers within the acc is to combine mass large payloads reach long range and immediacy quick response with the ability to conduct precision strikes with nonnuclear weapons today the united states air force maintains three longrange bombers the venerable b52 stratofortress the supersonic b1b lancer and the stealthy b2 spirit table 1 lists the characteristics of each since the end of the cold war their primary mission has shifted from nuclear deterrence to conventional bombing and all three have been reconfigured to carry variety of modern conventional bombs and airtosurface missiles since the debut of precision weapons in the late 1990s the bombers have seen their role increase with bombers increasingly used for precision strikes and close air support to us and allied ground forces despite the shift to conventional missions some bombers retain nuclear capabilities the b2 is certified to deliver nuclear weapons and twelve b52s are held ready for nuclear missions1 1 secretary of defense annual report to the president and the congress 2000 washington dc crs2 in 1999 the three bombers were used together for the first time in air strikes against yugoslavia under natos operation allied force the b2 bomber made its operational debut flying to yugoslavia from whiteman air force base in missouri all three bombers also played prominent roles in operation enduring freedom in afghanistan in 2001 and in operation iraqi freedom in 2003 table 1

considerations introduction despite prominent and widely praised role in the recent operations in afghanistan 2001 and iraq 2003 there is little consensus among military leaders and policymakers regarding the future of longrange bombers while some advocate increasing todays bomber fleet and beginning development of new bomber immediately others are pushing to cut the fleet and postpone new bomber program supporters point to bombers ability to carry massive weapons payloads to loiter over battlefields for long periods of time and to strike targets around the globe from bases in the continental united states detractors contend that large lumbering bombers are vulnerable to enemy air defenses including surfacetoair missiles as well as enemy fighters in the highthreat environments for which the air force plans the role of most bombers would be reduced and fighterstrike aircraft which are more survivable but have much shorter range and fraction of the payload would have to take up the slack bomber advocates counter that the conflicts the united states has faced in recent years and those it is most likely to face in the foreseeable future would not involve highthreat environments and that even if they crs3 did bombers would likely play an important role once enemy air defenses have been destroyed moreover they say bombers should be upgraded so they can penetrate advanced air defenses at issue then is what priority to give bombers in the overall defense budget advocates argue that the united states does not have enough bombers that they are not being modernized quickly enough and that the air force needs to begin investing in next generation bomber immediately there are currently open production lines for bombers although some have advocated for reopening production of b2 stealth bombers bomber detractors believe that defense dollars are better spent elsewhere on programs that address the full spectrum of missions the air force might confront not just the lowthreat environments faced in afghanistan and iraq these detractors say that even though the bombers performed well in afghanistan and iraq those conflicts were anomalies the former was among the poorest states while the latter had had its air defenses destroyed by the first gulf war and more than 10 years of sanctions and air strikes contingencies in other parts of the globe they argue could involve more extensive air defenses requiring more survivable aircraft such as the fa22 to knock down the door and clear the way for followon aircraft others disagree and contend that the wars the united states is likely to fight in the foreseeable future like those it has fought over the past 30 years have been against poorly defended opponents in the developing world longrange bomber issues that may confront congress include the following what types of conflicts does the united states need to prepare for and how relevant are bombers to those scenarios how many bombers does the air force need to meet the requirements of these conflicts to what extent if at all do the bombers need to be upgraded to meet these requirements is nextgeneration bomber needed and if so when this report will address these bigpicture issues which relate to the entire bomber fleet before turning to each of the three bombers individually the role of bombers in current and future conflicts key consideration in decisions about modernizing the bombers expanding or contracting the fleet and developing nextgeneration bomber is the type of conflict the united states might face in the foreseeable future the three bombers have different roles in different types of conflicts the large but vulnerable b52 serves as bomber in lowthreat environments dropping variety of precision and dumb bombs while in higherthreat environments it serves as standoff missile launcher firing airtoground cruise missiles from beyond the range of enemy defenses the b1 in addition to serving as bomber in low threat environments is capable of penetrating some air defenses because of its speed antimissile defensive systems and reduced radar signature stealth the b2 which has superior stealth can undertake penetration missions against more sophisticated defenses in recent conflicts the united states has faced opponents with rudimentary or battered air defenses and all three bombers have been able to attack targets with impunity against an opponent with sophisticated defenses however the b52 and possibly the b1 could be reduced to standoff role in the case of the b1 the planes existing defensive systems will soon become obsolete and the program to crs4 design replacement was cancelled by the department of defense dod in late 2002 see b1 dsup below as result the b1 like the b52 could be relegated to standoff role against even modest air defenses although the b1 and b52 are being outfitted with more sophisticated standoff weapons the b2 of which the air force maintains only 16 combatready aircraft would be the only longrange strike aircraft capable of penetrating air defenses other than the 16 b2s the air force would need to rely on fighterattack aircraft such as the fa22 and the joint strike fighter jsf despite their shorter range and smaller weapons payload to attack ground targets in highthreat areas table 2 projected range and airtoground strike capabilities of

years usaf fact sheets air force almanac various years note stated numbers for the jsf and fa22 assume an airtoground strike configuration and that fuel and weapons are carried internally although both are capable of carrying external fuel tanks and weapons doing so can compromise stealth data for the jsf is projected flight testing has not been completed the fa22 cannot carry the 2000 lb jdam it can carry two 1000 lb jdams internally for strike missions b numbers for the sdb are estimates sdb development has not been completed the air force points out that against the most sophisticated air defenses the fa22 will be the most survivable and effective aircraft because of its stealth speed and agility even though its range is shorted and its payload smaller in comparison to the b2 the air force and other observers contend that the fa22 will be the only aircraft that can reliably penetrate advanced defenses and break down the door for followon aircraft resources are therefore best spent on such aircraft rather than on upgrading or building more bombers b1s and b52s will continue to play role as standoff platforms and as followon strike platforms and b2s will continue to serve as penetrators but to ensure access in highthreat environments these observers say the bulk of air force investment should go to fighters bomber advocates on the other hand argue that building more b2s and upgrading the b1s defensive systems are cheaper more effective ways to address the highthreat environment than developing advanced fighters modernizing crs5 existing bombers and expanding the fleet will not only address the highthreat environment they say but also will improve capabilities in lowerthreat environments they point to several advantages of bombers longrange bombers are designed to operate from faraway bases and can strike targets around the globe from the united states if necessary allies sometimes restrict the air forces use of bases close to conflicts in the recent war in iraq saudi arabia and turkey prohibited the use of their air bases for combat missions and other countries denied rights to fly through their air space even with aerial refueling shortrange aircraft require bases close to the conflict zone to operate effectively and their value in future conflicts could be severely diminished if nearby countries deny access even if neighboring countries provide access to bases near future conflict opponents could use surfacetosurface missiles to disable those bases again limiting the capabilities of shortrange aircraft new targeting technologies have dramatically increased the capabilities of bombers because of gps and laserguided munitions and new targeting pods highflying bombers now conduct precision strikes previously conducted only by lowflying short range aircraft in afghanistan and iraq bombers performed close air support missions previously the exclusive domain of lowflyers like the a10 warthog bombers long range and massive payload enable them to loiter for hours above conflict zones so they can respond rapidly to newly designated timesensitive targets bomber advocates point out that these new capabilities have substantially increased demand for bombers in recent conflicts in operation iraqi freedom for example b1s were in such demand that centcom air component commander lt gen michael moseley personally managed their scheduling2 since 12 of the 36 combat ready b1s were deployed to guam in case of an emergency in korea and another 12 were undergoing maintenance or modernization only 12 were available for the war the demand for bombers is also apparent in statistics for recent conflicts in afghanistan bombers accounted for 20 of combat missions and dropped 76 of the bomb tonnage in the first three weeks of the air campaign3 in iraq the b1 flew fewer than 2 of the total number of combat sorties yet dropped roughly half of the jdams4 bomber advocates also contend that few potential opponents are likely to obtain advanced air defenses because they are expensive and difficult to operate in recent 2 david fulghum and robert wall baghdad confidential aviation week april 28 2003 3 bruce rolfson bombers shine in air war but remain budget targets air force times november 26 2001 4 david fulghum and robert wall baghdad confidential april 28 2003 crs6 wars and in the most likely scenarios for future conflict air defenses are modest at best bomber advocates therefore say that bomber fleet with upgraded defensive systems will remain valuable in the vast majority of future conflicts inventory how many bombers does the air force need how many will it need in the future the air force currently maintains 183 longrange bombers of which 96 are combat ready it plans to reduce the number of b1s to 60 although some members of congress oppose this consolidation see b1 consolidation below likewise dod has sought to cut 18 b52s from the fleet but has met with resistance from congress see b52 consolidation below table 3 inventory status and age of air force bombers b1 b2 b52 total active inventory 78 21 84 183 reserve inventory 0 0 9 9 combat ready 36 16 44 96 average age 152 81 408 source air force almanac 2003 september 2002 when evaluating the inventory requirements for tomorrows longrange bomber force number of factors must be weighed including the anticipated politico military environment the numbers and capabilities of other military platforms that can deliver longrange weapons eg navy ships and improvements in targeting and weapons technologies what impact will the conversion of ballisticmissile submarines ssbn into cruisemissile carriers ssgn each converted trident submarine would carry 154 tomahawk cruise missiles have on the required number of b52s can bomber variants of the fa22 or joint strike fighter be developed that could contribute to the longrange bombing mission can unmanned aerial vehicles uavs be armed so they can take on bombing role if so would this reduce the needed number of b1s or b2s5 bomber advocates including some members of congress contend that more bombers are needed given the expanded roles of these aircraft in recent conflicts and the possibility that the united states will be denied access to overseas bases in the future in particular some in congress have argued for reopening production of the b2 to augment the bomber fleet and improve longrange penetration capabilities see b2 below 5 see crs report rl31673 for more information on potential bomber variant of the fa 22 crs7 the air force and dod however remain opposed to expanding the bomber fleet and continue to press for cuts in the numbers of b1s and b52s the air force contends that the current number of combatready bombers is adequate for current and projected needs and that other needs are more pressing than expanding the bomber force air force chief of staff john jumper when asked if todays bomber fleet is sufficient for future challenges replied theres nothing ive seen that informs we dont have enough bombers6 the air force contends that the current bomber force is sufficient because bombers today are vastly more capable than in the past where previously several bombers and scores of bombs were required to eliminate single target today single bomber can reliably destroy dozen or more targets using precision weapons thus the air force and others turn around the argument that increased capabilities have increased demand for bombers to reason that increased capabilities mean fewer bombers are needed moreover the air force is developing smaller and more precise weapons that will enable bombers and other aircraft to attack more targets with great accuracy 500 lb version of the jdam and the 250 lb small diameter bomb sdb will greatly increase the capabilities of existing bombers in coming years and even smaller weapons are planned improved accuracy it is hoped will give these smaller munitions the same destructive power as todays larger less accurate weapons today the b2 carries sixteen 2000 lb jdams but soon it will carry an estimated eighty 500 lb jdams which are scheduled to debut in 2004 general jumper believes these new weapons will reduce the number of bombers needed ten b2 bombers with 90 weapons each will take care of the target decks that we have prepared for conflicts in most parts of the world7 each b2 is anticipated to carry over 300 sdbs which are expected in 20078 thus 21 b2s could theoretically attack over 6000 separate targets in single operation today such an attack would require nearly 400 b2s assuming 16 weapons each bomber supporters counter that the math doesnt always translate to the battlefield if the united states were to face two simultaneous conflicts for example the 16 combatcoded b2s would be stretched thin regardless of how many bombs each carries moreover enhanced capability has increased not decreased demand for bombers in recent conflicts lastly bomber advocates note that neither the 500 lb jdam nor the sdb has been successfully fielded yet and it may be imprudent to make decisions about the future size of the bomber inventory based on weapons that have not yet been deployed 6 john roos holding the heading air force chief shares his view of transformational activities armed forces journal international may 2002 7 ibid 8 john tirpak bomber questions air force magazine september 2001 crs8 next generation bomber key consideration regarding nextgeneration longrange bomber is when to begin development program other questions that may confront congress include the desired characteristic of future bomber and how it will fit into future fleet structure urgency how urgent is the need for next generation bomber program current air force plans call for new longrange bomber to come on line in 2037 about the time when it predicts that corrosion fatigue or other problems will render substantial numbers of existing bombers inoperable the air forces 1999 bomber roadmap states that 190 bombers are needed to fulfill its longrange strike mission requirements and estimates that the numbers of existing bombers will drop below that level in 20379 figure 1 economic service life and attrition us air force white paper on long range bombers march 1 1999 the bomber roadmap laid out the following schedule for research and development of next generation bomber that would enter service in 2037 event date mission area assessment 2013 mission needs statement 2014 concept exploration 2016 new acquisition program 2019

will be needed before 2037 recently added 100 million to the bush administrations fy2004 budget request to accelerate research and development of next generation bomber10 the armed services committee expressed concern that the air forces schedule will not ensure sufficient bomber force for future requirements and states that it expects the air force to update its future years defense program to include funding to develop and procure new bomber well prior to its previous plan11 the arguments put forward by advocates of new bomber include the following the need for more and better longrange highpayload strike aircraft that can penetrate advanced air defenses the old age and vulnerability of the b52 the youngest b52 is now over 40 years old while its remarkable durability and flexibility has sustained the b52s relevance at some point fatigue will catch up to it additionally because the b52 lacks sophisticated defenses and is easily detected by radar its capabilities are limited unless enemy defenses have been suppressed the possibility that the united states will be denied access to overseas bases for future conflicts the heavy reliance on bombers in recent conflicts bomber advocates contend that the air force tends to be biased toward fighter aircraft and has chronically underfunded bomber programs one noted aviation historian argues they usaf leaders recoil at the idea of sending air force fighter pilots into airtoair combat during the first decade of the 21st century in f15c which were first built in the 1970s but upgraded and produced into the 1990s yet they apparently have qualms about condemning bomber pilots to fly the ancient b 52hs which were last produced in 1962 into combat during the first three decades of the 21st century12 these observers argue that the air force gives priority to fighters because the generals who run the service tend to be tactical fighter pilots their bias some say is indicated by the increasingly lopsided ratio of dollars invested in tactical fighters versus bombers which increased from slightly less than 51 in 1999 to more than 301 in 200313 this funding imbalance is reflected in growing imbalance between 10 house

technology march 27 2002 p66 13 ibid crs10 tactical fighters and bombers in the air force inventory in 1950 the ratio of fighters to bombers was two to one but by the late 1990s the ratio had grown to 16 to one meaning that less than 5 of the services 4000 aircraft were bombers14 the air force has opposed accelerating development of followon bomber because it believes other priorities are more urgent major general dan leaf director of air force operational requirements has said that we cant realistically afford to modernize everything at once fielding the future strike platform is not as pressing problemas continued modernization of the fighters15 leaf also argues that the air force plan favors fighter modernization not only because fighter capabilities need to be upgraded but also because there have not been major technological leaps that apply to bombers the next generation bomber studyled the service to postpone development of future strike platform because there wasnt significant technological advance anticipated in the near term to merit going forward right now leaf explained16 air force chief of staff general john jumper also states that existing bombers including the venerable b52 meet foreseeable needs theres nothing that would prompt to begin retiring the b52s that continue to work very well and carry large loads17 desired capabilities what characteristics should nextgeneration bomber have among the factors to be considered are range payload speed unit cost stealth and whether the aircraft will be manned or unmanned reportedly air combat command acc is examining four options the b3 an upgraded version of the b2 that has greater payload and range along with better stealth and communications hypersonic cruise vehicle hcv an aircraft that would operate in the upper atmosphere at hypersonic speeds mach 12 it would be virtually invulnerable to enemy defenses because of its speed and altitude and could reach east asia from the

platform takes back seat to fighter modernization inside the air force march 1 2002 crs11 there are two general approaches to developing next generation bomber leap ahead and incremental the former favors the development of expensive revolutionary technologies while the latter prefers to build upon existing technologies the air force appears to favor leap ahead approach former chief of staff general mike ryan states the air force wants to make big leap in capability with its next strategic systemwe need to go to the next level of strike capability beyond the b220 supporters of the leap ahead approach argue that competitors may arise to challenge us air power in the future the proliferation of advanced russian surface toair missiles for example is just hint of the kind of weapons that may emerge tomorrow potential adversaries are also developing antiaccess systems and techniques like gps jamming antistealth radars and terminal defenses that will require serious technological advances to defeat they argue incrementalists on the other hand point out that the united states has dominated the air in every conflict since vietnam and especially since the persian gulf war in 1991 they argue that while we should improve on todays capabilities we can strive toward cost effective solutions developing leap ahead capabilities will be difficult and expensive air force officials say that research into hypersonics has advanced little beyond the x30 national aerospace plane which was cancelled in 199521 yet it is unclear that we need such exotic capabilities in tomorrows long range bombers retired air force general richard hawley argues for example that it is not even clear that supersonic flight is desirable much less required attribute for future longrange strike platform from the standpoint of military utility loiter capability appears more valuable than speed given the strategic premium now being placed on dealing with mobile and other timecritical targets22 incrementalists believe tomorrows bomber could leverage existing platforms and technologies adapting technologies developed for the fa22 for example or outfitting the global hawk uav with more powerful engines and stateoftheart weapons such as the small diameter bomb might be costeffective ways to expand strike capabilities some even argue that commercial aircraft such as the 767 could serve as the foundation of new bomber savings would be achieved by using parts and structures built in large numbers for airlines23 because the united states can achieve air supremacy quickly and because bombs have become so accurate some incrementalists argue that bombers have essentially become trucks for hauling large quantities of ordnance over great distances they argue that only few bombers with expensive capabilities such as stealth and supersonic speed are needed 20 john tirpak bomber questions air force magazine september 2001 21 nick cook usaf hones future bomber requirement

renewed debate aviation week space technology april 2000 p30 crs12 there is an important role they say for cheap commerciallyderived aircraft that simply carry lots of weapons and fuel fleet diversity versus uniformity dod currently operates three different bombers this diversity offers advantages in terms of planning flexibility in different types of conflicts at the same time diversity challenges enemy air defenses because system that may be effective against one plane might be ineffective against another further diversity avoids single point failure if one bomber were to experience serious problem such as airframe fatigue software bug or vulnerability to new air defense technology other types of bombers may not be affected while fleet diversity has advantages it also has drawbacks primarily in terms of cost describing the current bomber force general richard hawley remarked the fact is that weve got three small fleets of airplanesevery time you own fleet of airplanes you incur lot of overhead costyou have to fund that overhead for each system so were carrying three software maintenance facilities were funding three small armies of engineers to support each of these three bombers and what we ought to do is neck down to one bomber24 as point of reference the joint strike fighter jsf program was designed in part to reduce the costs of fleet diversity the jsf attempts to reduce operations maintenance and training costs by increasing the commonality between the air force navy and marine corps variants of the aircraft while maintaining enough diversity so that one basic platform will satisfy the unique requirements of three different users25 policy makers will have to weigh the costs and benefits of fleet diversity when contemplating next generation bomber 24 laura

overview the 40yearold b52 has remained relevant to changing battlefield although nuclear strikes were its primary mission during the cold war the b52 has carried out important nonnuclear missions in conflicts going back to the vietnam war air force secretary james roche stated recently that the b52 has transformed three times in its history from highlevel bomber to lowlevel intruder to standoff cruise missile carrier to close airsupport aircraft26 the b52 is the only platform that can operate with more than 20 types of bombs and cruise missiles in the u s inventory in highthreat areas where enemy defenses are robust b52s employ air launched cruise missiles 20 per aircraft to attack ground targets from distance in lowthreat environments such as afghanistan or iraq b52s can use jdam precision bombs or various gravity bombs figure 2 b52 stratofortress source usaf eighty five b52s are on active duty and nine are in the reserve of these 44 are combat ready in accordance with plans stated in the 1992 bomber road map all g models have been retired and their role has been assumed by h models which have more powerful engines longer range and lower operating cost according to current air force plans b52s will remain in service through 2037 when next generation bomber should come on line 26 lance m bacon think bombers are bad now just see what they get next air force times june 16 2003 crs14 program status b52 consolidation for several years the air force has tried to retire 18 b52s much like the b1 consolidation plan the rationale is to save money that could be spent to improve the readiness and effectiveness of the remaining aircraft air force officials argue that these 18 attrition reserve aircraft are unneeded according to march 1999 usaf white paper on long range bombers p2 21 the air force needs only 76 b52s to support its full range of mission taskings27 in july 2001 air force secretary james roche reiterated the air forces desire to retire 18 b52s28 congress has consistently resisted this retirement citing the lack of an active bomber production line and the importance of the long range bomber force in june 2001 the house appropriations committee refused to sanction move that would have prevented upgrade of 18 b52s29 in several recent years congress has increased funding for b52 operations and maintenance and has directed the air force to keep all 93 in the inventory electronic warfare with the ea6b prowler approaching the end of its service life the air force has explored adding radar jamming equipment to b52s as part of the air forces diversified approach to jamming b52s which are vulnerable in highthreat environments to enemy air defenses would serve primarily in standoff jamming role while other aircraft would conduct closein

engines to improve performance and lower costs after lull interest has been renewed by march 2003 report form the defense science board dsb unanimously recommending that the air force reengine the b52 without delay33 according to the dsb replacing the aircrafts 1950sera engines with four modern engines would increase range by 46 while reducing aerial refueling needs and maintenance costs the benefits of reengining particularly less demand on refueling tankers would far outweigh the costs according to the dsb they state that new engines would cost 3 to 35 billion but savings would total between 6 and 9 billion between 2011 when the new engines are completed and 2037 when the b52 is retired in july 2003 the air force asked boeing to investigate the feasibility of replacing the b52s eight engines with eight modern engines rather than four as had been suggested earlier an eightengine upgrade could boost the b52s performance and expand is mission possibilities as well as increase efficiency according to the air force34 the air force states that although it is interested in reengining it does not currently have adequate funds35 it is exploring alternative funding such as the federal energy savings performance contracts espc program which uses private sector financing to improve energy efficiency and then pays back investors with the savings in early 2003 however congress moved to block use of the espc for the b52 by capping the program at 100 million some in congress apparently objected to the use of nonappropriated funds such as the espc or lease arrangement36

force the b1b was designed to carry nuclear weapons deep into soviet territory during the cold war the planes supersonic speed reduced radar signature and large payload gave it important advantages over the b52 even though its range was shorter since the end of the cold war the air force has adapted the b1b to carry conventional weapons although its value in conventional warfare has only been tested in the recent conflicts in afghanistan 2001 and iraq 2003 the b1b has the largest payload capacity of the three bombers and can carry broad array of precision and non precision weapons ongoing upgrades will increase the variety of weapons it can carry and will enable it to deliver three different munitions to separate targets in single sortie first among us warplanes figure 3 b1b lancer source usaf photo by msgt rose reynolds the b1 entered service in 1986 and the total order of 100 aircraft was completed in 1988 however the plane has been controversial throughout its history in 1977 president carter cancelled the program in development believing that existing air and sealaunched missiles provided adequate nuclear strike capability president reagan revived the b1 program in 1981 and following modifications to the original design the plane was designated the b1b after it sat out or played marginal roles in the conflicts of the 1990s secretary of defense donald rumsfeld crs22 suggested in 2001 that the b1 be retired in response the air force decided to reduce the b1 fleet by roughly one third or 33 aircraft although the retirement process is underway supporters of the b1 in congress and elsewhere are fighting to reinstate all or some of the decommissioned planes they argue that the b1s performance in afghanistan and iraq demonstrate its value on the modern battlefield debate over the future of the plane continues under current plans the air force will maintain and upgrade the b1b for service through 2040 by which time new long range bomber should enter the fleet54 program status consolidation in early 2001 advisors to secretary of defense donald rumsfeld suggested that the air force retire the entire b1b fleet55 study commissioned by rumsfeld highlighted the b1 as one of four programs least compatible with the pentagons future plans the study recommended that dod place higher priority on b2 and b52 modernization and consider purchasing more b2s to replace the b1 in the fleet56 at the time the air force was 2 billion short in modernization funds for the b1b to address this shortfall without eliminating the plane the air force opted to retire third of the fleet reducing the number of b 1s to 60 from 93 and consolidating basing to two active duty locations from three active duty and two air national guard locations when the air force publicly justified its consolidation plan it cited not only budgetary constraints57 but also the need to improve b1 maintenance and supply58 the b1 has historically suffered from severe parts shortages that forced technicians to cannibalize parts from one plane to keep others flying by 2001 the plane had the highest cannibalization rates in the air force by wide margin parts shortages also contributed to some of the lowest mission capable rates in the air force in the late 1990s and 2000s59 further the b1 is among the most expensive planes to fly costing 14343 per flying hour or more than double the cost for either the b2 or the b5260 54 us air force longrange strike aircraft white paper november 2001 p 27 55 jefferson morris gao criticizes air force on handling of b1b consolidation aerospace

april 2003 crs23 another argument behind consolidation is that with more and more effective precision weapons single bomber is vastly more capable than in the past in operation desert storm in iraq 1991 for example numerous bombs and possibly multiple sorties were needed to destroy individual targets in operation iraqi freedom 2003 however single bomber could reliably destroy as many as two dozen separate targets effects of consolidation the air force reports that consolidation has brought substantial savings and improved performance to the remaining b1 fleet for two reasons first consolidation has expedited modernization of the remaining fleet because according to an air force spokesman the usaf is aggressively reinvesting dollars saved from the b1 consolidation to significantly increase the capabilities of the remaining aircraft61 in the first year since consolidation savings amounted to 130 million according to the air force62 initial estimates pegged total consolidation savings over five years at 14 billion but subsequent estimates lowered that figure to roughly 800 million63 second consolidation has boosted b1 performance both by reducing the demand for spare parts and by enabling the air force to take needed parts from retired planes by early 2003 the cannibalization rate had dropped dramatically while the mission capable rates during operation iraqi freedom have been the highest yet reported for the aircraft 79 criticism of the consolidation plan september 2002 gao study criticized the plan for failing to analyze how the reduction would affect national security needs or detailing how the air force would replace the capabilities of the lost b1s using other aircraft the study also found that the air force was inconsistent in its methodology for implementing consolidation and incomplete in estimating savings64 the gao report further criticized the decision to move planes from the air national guard to active duty finding that guard units had lower flying hour costs higher mission capable rates and more experienced crews65 1998 gao report argued that moving b1s from active duty to the national guard could save millions of dollars while maintaining bombing capabilities66 others have criticized the b1 consolidation for failing to live up to its promise the primary justification for reducing the number of aircraft was to free up funds to modernize the remaining aircraft yet the air force subsequently cancelled the b 1s defensive systems upgrade program see dsup below decision that could 61 hampton stephens air force

even meager enemy antiaircraft systems the b1 would then essentially become standoff platform like the b52 and the only remaining longrange highpayload aircraft capable of penetrating air defenses would be the 16 combatready b2s critics of consolidation question whether the air force needs additional standoff aircraft and whether 16 longrange bombers capable of penetration missions is enough these critics also ask why the b1s capabilities should be downgraded substantially when the purpose of the consolidation was to free up funds for upgrades reinstatement of retired b1s some members of congress have fought the consolidation plan since it was first proposed the decision concerned some in congress because dod did not consult with them beforehand shortly after the plan was announced in 2001 senator larry craig introduced an amendment to the fy2001 defense supplemental appropriations bill to prevent dod from using money authorized or appropriated in that year to implement the consolidation plan this amendment was withdrawn67 on august 1 2001 the house armed services committee amended the fy2002 defense authorization bill to prevent b1 consolidation at the request of representative saxby chambliss68 in conference however congress modified its position and required the air force to conduct study of the bomber force structure before proceeding with consolidation sec

air force spokesman the fy2004 funding authorized by the house armed services committee would not go far in reinstating and modernizing the planes let alone ensuring adequate future parts supplies72 the air force has estimated that it will need an additional 1 billion in operations and maintenance funding through fy2009 to operate the 23 planes and the house armed services committee in its fy2004 authorization bill strongly urges dod to budget an additional 11 billion for the b1b reconstitution in future year requests73 despite its concerns about funding some within the air force do believe more b1s are needed pointing out that two thirds of the combatready fleet was deployed during iraqi freedom leaving an inadequate buffer against other potential conflicts74 separately b1 supporters

enemy radar and attack targets without escort or us air superiority during the 1990s the air force adapted the plane for nonnuclear bombing missions taking advantage of its long range large payload and stealth today it can carry 16 independently targeted 2000 lb jdam precision guided bombs eight massive 4700 lb bunker busters or variety of other weapons the b2 is slower and has smaller payload than the other bombers but its role is different because of its stealth it is the only bomber capable of operating in well defended airspace and is intended for early strikes in conflict the b2 along with the fa22 is the centerpiece of the air forces global strike task force concept which is designed to attack antiaccess targets in future conflicts opening the way for followon platforms like the joint strike fighter and the other bombers105 figure 4 b2 spirit source usaf photo by msgt rose reynolds 105 representative norm dicks in marty kauchak focus on oefs air campaign funding new doctrine

funding in fy1993 enabled the purchase of 20 aircraft subsequent funding has upgraded the b2s capabilities as conventional bomber in 1996 the air force enlarged the fleet to 21 by adding an existing test aircraft to its force sixteen b2s are combat coded and the entire fleet is based at whiteman afb missouri with the 509th bomb wing program status new production advocates want the air force to order more b2s to enlarge the fleet initially the air force ordered 165 aircraft but the end of the cold war and enormous cost increases led the air force to reduce the number to just 21 proponents in congress and at northrop grumman the lead contractor contend that new version of the b2 would be far less expensive than the original northrop grumman has twice provided the air force 1995 and 2001 with unsolicited proposals to reopen the production line the most recent projected unit price of 500 million for 40 new aircraft compared to more than 2 billion each for the original planes northrop grumman officials say they can substantially reduce costs for modified version of the b2 dubbed the b2c by eliminating the expensive electronic hardening which protects against nuclear blast and by using offtheshelf electronics rather than custom designed systems maintenance parts training and support for the b2c could raise the price to nearly 735 million each for total bill of 294 billion for the 40 aircraft106 senior air force and dod officials have publicly expressed opposition to restarting the b2 line107 some suggest that dods lack of interest in the b2 may be caused by concern that it would conflict with funding other procurement programs such as the fa22 raptor other air force officials have called for larger b2 force and suggest replacing b1bs and b52s with an additional 60 to 80 stealth bombers108 they contend that b1bs and b52s are lowthreat environment aircraft unable to address the full spectrum of bombing missions the b52s cruise missile launching capabilities they say

recently representatives duncan hunter and howard mckeon stated that the b2 is the kind of technology the united states need to support and advocated production of the cheaper version112 supporters argue that building more b2s would send clear message to potential enemies that the united states was serious about maintaining long range strike capability113 however history may not be on the b2s side in regard to restarting production the air force has reopened only two assembly lines the u2 surveillance aircraft and the c5 heavy air lifter forward deployment the b2s radarabsorbing skin must be serviced under controlled environmental conditions in special hangars the air force does not have any permanent hangars for the b2 overseas new deployable shelters however enable the air force to station b2s much closer to conflicts reducing flight times and increasing the number of sorties each plane can fly previously all b2 combat missions began and ended at whiteman air force base in missouri requiring extremely long sorties to reach faraway conflicts during the conflict in afghanistan for example b2s had to fly sorties in excess of 40 hours to reach their targets and return home with the new deployable shelters the air force can set up temporary b2 base in about one month however it appears that the air force intends to use the shelters to set up semipermanent bases at fairford royal air force base in england and on the indian ocean island of diego garcia114 some have speculated that the air force may also station b2s on guam in the pacific b2s conducting missions against iraq during operation iraqi freedom were the first to use the shelters for combat missions flying from diego garcia the hangars cost 25 million each and the air force currently has five each

add new components to the existing radar rather than simply modify the existing radar or develop an entirely new system this hybrid option incorporates raytheons active electronically scanned array aesa antenna to the front end of the existing radar117 according to air force officials it will provide the greatest bang for the buck118 increasing performance by 40 in addition to resolving the

weapons upgrades several modifications are being pursued or considered to increase the b2s payload capabilities the smart bomb release assembly sbra will enable the b2 to carry 80 500 lb jdams instead of the 16 2000 lb jdams currently employed the sbra upgrade began in may 2003 and should be completed in mid2004 estimated costs are 317 million123 plans have also been drawn to equip the b2 with the small diameter bomb sdb although the precision 250pound sdb is still in development the air force hopes to equip all b2s with the weapon by fy04 the air force estimates that the b2 could carry between 320 to 360 independently targeted sdbs124 in addition two unused bays on the b2 called the lib28 bays are being evaluated to carry either additional weapons or jamming devices additional weapons could improve weapons flexibility while jamming equipment may increase the b2s survivability or enable new missions readiness mission capable rate the mission capable rate for the b2 fleet is low compared to many other aircraft in the air force inventory the b2s mcr was 422 in 1999 and only 37 in 2000 as noted by dods office of operational testing and evaluation these rates are far below the service requirement of 60 the b2s mcr dropped even lower in 2001 to 31 which is about half the mcr of the b1b125 more recently in june of 2002 the b2s mcr rose to 42126 the air force reported b2 mcr of 85 during operation iraqi freedom however mcrs are typically much higher during wartime127 the b2s low mcr may be tied to maintaining the aircrafts stealthy features due to treatment needed to keep the aircraft stealthy the maintenance time spent between b2 flights is longer than that of other aircraft air force officials contend the mcr would be as high as 80 without the lowobservability requirements128 maintenance the radarabsorbing materials ram used to coat the wings and fuselage have to be applied after each mission the time needed to cure these 123 northrop grumman to produce

requires 52 to 70 hours of maintenance of which 208 hours are for lowobservability coating and treatment129 some hope that this time will be significantly reduced with sprayon ram the alternative high frequency material ahfm that northrop grumman finished testing in october 2000 not all aircraft surfaces can be treated with this spray but it is expected that the b2s maintenance time will decrease sharply from 208 to 92 hour per flying hour the upgrade will improve the mcr by 8 according to the b2 program office deputy director at tinker afb130 spare parts another issue that presents risks of lowering b2 readiness is an expected engine parts shortage that could begin as early as 2005 the b2 uses analog engine controllers which are projected to be scarce in four years at the rate they are currently being replaced advances in digital technology will likely make it harder to find suppliers for analog engine hardware dod suggests replacing the b2s analog engine controller with digital model in addition to alleviating spare parts shortage switching to digital engine controller may also provide better airspeed control131 cracks cracks appeared in the aft deck of several b2s in 1990 but were fixed at cost of 200 million after change in the design of the aircraft second series of cracks located on titanium plates behind the jet engines exhaust appeared in 2000 on 16 of the 21 b2s132 the cause of these cracks is being reviewed both the air force combat command and northrop grumman are working on fix and at this stage it is difficult to predict how much these cracks will cost to repair in its fy2004 appropriations bill the house armed services committee added 27 million to dods budget request for repairing the cracks133 according to northrop grumman the money in the
