not meant to predict future budget outcomes 2cbo estimated that extending the expiring provisions immediately would reduce cumulative revenues over the 10year period by 735 billion this implies that extending the tax cut would reduce the cumulative surplus over the 10 years by at least that much and probably more when higher interest costs are included 3the administration also produced variant of the standard baseline the alternative assumed reasonably that the increased m ostly emergency spending in fy2002 flowing from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks was onetime event and would not be

cumulative surplus reflecting the deficits and relatively small surpluses expected over the period was 437 billion president bushs fy2003 budget proposed receipts of 2048 billion outlays of 2128

each year affect in some cas substantially the funding levels or policy choices available to congress in future years uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are i nherentlyuncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial uncertainty and variation makes budget estimates and projections sceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes as is obvious from the data in table 1 nonetheless budget estimates can help differentiate the budgetary effects f alternative proposals and the approximate magnitudes of various policies even if the estimates do not match the actual outcomes the uncertainty of budget estimate s was apparent over the fy2002 budget cycle beginning in january 2001 the estimates for fiscal year 2002 produced

components and relationships underlying the budget estimates the unavoidable inaccuracy of budget projections is also obvious over longer periods of time as cbo stated in its january 2002 budget report uncertainty compounds as the projection horizon lengthens even small annual differences in the many key factors that influence the budget projections factors such as inflation increases in productivity economic growth the distribution of income and growth rat from medicare and medicaid spending can add to substantial differences in the budget outcome 10 years from now6 budget projections are dependent on unde rlying assumptions about the direction of the economy future government policy and the technical assumptions of the budget m odels and how these interact any deviation from expected underlying assumptions such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation changes in assumed spending and tax po licy or alterations in the fundamental underlying relationships between the budget and economic variables the underlying technical assumptions can have substa ntial effects on the budget projections budget action congress passed an
