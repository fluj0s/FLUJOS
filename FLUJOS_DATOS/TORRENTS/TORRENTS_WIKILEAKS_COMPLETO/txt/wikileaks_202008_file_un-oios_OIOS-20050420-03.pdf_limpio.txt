to seychelles by eca were managed by herself the acgd officer and the undp officer in port louis sey chelles she further stated that the amount transferred to pay the remaining 50 per cent of dsa was only made available after the end of the conference which created chao s in paying participants before their departures in addition barclays did not have suff icient smaller us denominations and proposed the use of french francs consequently it was agreed that the acgd officer would give barclays the list of participants and th bank itself would make the remaining dsa payments 15 that memorandum also stated that 6 the acgd officer had received us5000 and us 3500 to cover miscellaneous expenses he also received us22000 in notes late 18 february 1999 us3327 in notes and us3300 in

official 2 had asked him to pay miscellaneous expenses and dsa to the partic ipants of the seychelles conference he said that eca had written to undp mauritius who asked undp hq for authority to transfer funds to barclays in seychelles the acgd officer then cashed the funds and disbursed dsa to participants 18 he said that on 17 february 1999 he paid the first group of participants at the hotel in the presence of the undp officer he indi cated his payment to participants on the list by placing asterisks against their names on 18 february 1999 barclays paid the other participants using the attendance list suppli ed by the acgd officer upon receipt of identification from the payees the bank tellers had the participant sign hisher name on the attendance list and paid the dsa the acgd offi cer said that he was present when the bank tellers paid the remaining participants an d that after the payments were made the attendance list was returned to him 19 the acgd officer confirmed that it was his re sponsibility to ensure that participants received their dsa and signed their na mes against the attendance list upon receipt of their dsa lack of signature against name meant that that person did not attend the conference 20 the acgd officer provided idoios with the at tendance list during the course of his interview of the three queried payments th ere was an asterisk only against participant 1s name on the attendance list 21 he said that for persons who did not attend t he conference instructions had to be given for their pt8s to be cancelled there were cancellations before the conference but they were four to five after the conference 7 22 idoios investigators observed that the pt8 s for participant 1 participant 2 and participant 3 were all cancelled after the conf erence by official 2 23 the acgd officer explained the cancellation f pt8s after the conference by saying that some governments substituted participan ts few days before the conference as result of such late cancellations andor subst itutions it is only after the conference that instructions are given to cancel and amend the relevant pt8 forms accordingly 24 idoios showed the acgd officer three cancell ed pt8s the acgd officer examined the cancelled pt8 fo r participant 1 and said that she had not attended the conference but when shown signature and asterisk against her name on the attendance list indicating payment of us1000 in dsa he said that he could not confirm whether he had given inst ructions to cancel the pt8 and that it was possible that it had been done by the director b the acgd officer was shown cancelled pt8 for participant 2 upon seeing signature against this name but asteri sk as having received us1068 in dsa he told idoios that the secretaries could hav gotten the wrong information or the director may have given the wrong instructions for the travel to be cancelled c the acgd officer was shown cancelled pt8 for participant 3 upon seeing signature against this name but asteri sk as having received us943 in dsa he said that it was mistake similar to that of th case of participant 2 d in all of these cases the pt8s were cancelled by official 2 on 19 march 1999 after the conference 25 the acgd officer explained these discrepancie s by suggesting that bank employee might have tampered with the dsa list and forged signatures of participants who did not attend and then pocketed their dsa he said that he dealt with the manager teller and gobetween person and that any one f them could have falsely signed the dsa list however he had previously acknowledged t hat he had witnessed the payments being made by the bank staff and he had not raised any questions or concerns then or at any time before being questioned by idoios investi gators on this point however he claimed to be surprised by the discrepancies pointe d out by idoios he then acknowledged that he had received memoranda from of ficial 4 asking him to account amongst other things for the moneys that he had be given for dsa but he thought that the matter had been settled despite the unaccounted discrepancies 26 idoios in telephone interview with particip ant 3 asked if she had attended the seychelles conference and she stated that she had n ot she added that she had not been invited to attend and had not received any dsa for this conference 8 27 in second interview with the acgd officer by phone he was told that participant 3 confirmed that she had not attended t he conference he again said that he had not paid all the participants barclays had pai d some and that the situation during payment was chaotic he said it was difficult to re member whom he paid and there could have been errors 28 idoios attempted to interview participant 1 and participant 2 but was unable to locate them at the contact numbers provided idoio s also attempted to locate the undp officer but the undp liaison office had been c losed in 1999 and attempts to locate her through other undp contacts proved futile the acgd officer was unable to provide idoios with the names of bank personnel wh were involved with the dsa payments 29 idoios interviewed staff member who said that each person attending the conference was required to register and that list of these attendees were then compiled and included in report that was prepared on the c onference she told idoios that this list is usually accurate but could at times co ntain errors for instance if the list was prepared before the conference rather than from the register it might not be accurate idoios reviewed the list included in the report an d noted that the names of participant 1 participant 2 and participant 3 were not include d 30 when idoios first asked the acgd officer on pril 28 2003 how much money he had received for the payment of dsa he said tha t he had only received us5000 for miscellaneous expenses however when id investigato rs showed the acgd officer barclays documents with his signature indicating that he had received us22000 he admitted that it was his signature and that he had in fact received us22000 from the bank for payment of dsa although the bank records show that the acgd officer had also received us3327 in cash for dsa payment and us3300 in travellers cheques total of us28627 the acgd officer said that he c ould not remember having received these sums of money he also confirmed that he had signed for the receipt of the funds barclays paid out id reminded the acgd officer of the contents of his memorandum of 18 february 2000 where he acknowledged receipt of dditional sums and he admitted the contents of that memorandum 31 the acgd officer said that in june 1999 he pr epared report and submitted certificate of expenses to officer 8 of the disburs ement unit the report was reviewed by official 2 who signed the memorandum forwarding the report 32 official 2 was not present at the time of id oioss mission to eca consequently idoios forwarded certain questions i n relation to the seychelles conference and she furnished answers 33 idoios asked official 2 if she was satisfied that the acgd officer gave proper explanation for the apparent discrepancies nd whether there was final report she responded by saying that the acgd officer had p rovided comprehensive explanation of the apparent discrepancies to offici 4 she placed the blame for 9 improper payment of dsa on barclays since the bank staff made the payments but does not take into account the acgd officers acknowledg ement of witnessing these same payments or his responsibility for the safeguarding of the funds entrusted to him she also said that following the acgd officers corresp ondence of 24 march 2000 meeting was called by official 5 to discuss the iss ue with the acgd officer and official 3 subsequently instruction was given by the direc tor of ppfd to close the account with the submitted supporting documents 34 idoios reviewed the acgd officers memorandu m dated 24 march 2000 in that memorandum the acgd officer confirmed that dsa was paid to the bearers of the five pt8 numbers to which official 4 referred he agreed that payment of dsa to non attendees was serious matter but as had officia l 2 placed the blame on barclays claiming that the bank had paid the dsas 35 idoios observed that official 2 and the acgd officer stated in their joint memorandum of 18 february 2000 that the acgd office r had paid some participants dsa and barclays paid the rest however both offi cial 2 and the acgd officer when interviewed and the acgd officer in his memorandum of 24 march 2000 claimed barclays had paid all the dsa 36 in memorandum dated 13 april 2000 from offici 3 to official 4 official 3 recommended that an independent investigation be co nducted into the matter because despite requests for more documentation and explana tions the acgd officer did not properly account for the expenses of the meeting vi findings of fact issue 1 did the acgd officer inappropriately use his office for financial gain 37 the acgd officer confirmed at his interview s that he was entrusted with payment of miscellaneous expenses and dsa to participants t the seychelles conference in his interoffice memorandum of 18 february 2004 see pa ragraphs 14 and 15 he admitted that he had collected us28627 for these payments although the allegation was that us12000 had been misappropriated idoios found t hat only us3011 was unaccounted for see paragraph 11 the attendance list used for payment of dsa had asterisk against the name of participant 3 and part icipant 2 indicating that the barclays had paid them but there was an asterisk against the name of participant 1 system devised by the acgd officer which was used by him t indicate that he had made specific payment in this instance indicating that the acgd officer had paid her see paragraph 18 38 the acgd officers theory that the barclay bank staff were responsible does not withstand scrutiny first he acknowledges that he witnessed the payments made by the bank second while the bank may have performed thi s service for him he retained responsibility for the accounting for the funds giv to him third nowhere else had the 10 acgd officer claimed that the bank staff took the f unds until he was questioned by investigators including at the time the disbursemen ts were made and later when questioned about the discrepancies by eca managers issue 2 did the acgd officer appropriately safegu ard the cash advances for the conference and did he properly account for these advances as requ ired by financial rule 1049 39 official 3 asked the acgd officer for an ccounting of us49000 he had received for payment of dsa and other expenses at t he conference in his interoffice memorandum of 19 january 2000 see paragraph 10 in his interoffice memorandum of 18 february 2004 the acgd officer admitted collect ing us38627 for payment of dsa to participants at the conference see paragrap h 15a however in his interview of april 28 2003 he first claimed that he had only r eceived us5000 for miscellaneous expenses but then admitted he had received us22 000 see paragraph 30 the acgd officer blamed the chaotic atmosphere during paymen t of dsa for any discrepancies however it is apparent that he did not safeguard nd protect the cash advances for the conference as required by financial rule 1049 nor did he provide proper accounting of these funds issue 3 did the acgd officer keep proper records of payment of dsa and other conference expenses as required by financial rule 1 0410 b and c 40 by the acgd officers admission in paragra ph 27 payments of dsa at the conference were chaotic and there could have been rrors for which he bears full responsibility as the person assigned to make the d isbursement of these united nations funds in addition receipt of funds was indicated only by signature next to name on the attendance list this is not proper recording of d isbursements as required by financial rule 10410 b and c vii conclusions 41 the signatures for three people on the attendan ce list who did not attend the conference were forged and the disbursements to th em unaccounted for resulting in loss of us3011 to eca there are only two possibi lities first that the acgd officer forged the signatures and retained the money and cond that bank employee forged the signatures and kept the money despite the acgd officers presence during the disbursement process and he failed to notice or to raise the issue either way the acgd officer is responsible for the loss of funds 42 it is of additional concern that despite questi ons raised regarding the loss of the funds and the failure to safeguard the money on the part of the acgd officer eca managers did not take measures to hold him accounta ble or to determine whether the manner of handling the funds in this case might war rant further scrutiny for the purpose of avoiding similar problems in future 11 viii recommendations recommendation 1 it is recommended that appropriate action be taken against the acgd officer including for being in breach of financial rule 1049 and 104 10 b and c id rec iv0120201 recommendation 2 it is recommended that eca management review its ca sh disbursement practices for additional gaps and examine this case for lessons l earned to avoid similar problems in future id rec
