hoseanddrogue updated june 5 2006 christopher bolkcom specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress air force aerial refueling methods flying boom versus hoseanddrogue summary decisions on the composition of the air force aerial refueling fleet were made decades ago when the primary mission was to refuel longrange strategic bombers modifications have been made to many of these tanker aircraft kc135s and kc 10s to make them more effective in refueling fighter aircraft this report which will be updated examines the balance between two different refueling methods in todays refueling fleet flying boom and hoseanddrogue contents introduction 1 background 2 effectiveness of the current air force fleet 3 potential issues 6 list of figures figure 1 usaf kc10 refueling b52 with flying boom 1 figure 2 usmc kc130 refueling fa18s with hoseanddrogue 2 figure 3 current and hypothetical air force aerial refueling profiles 5 air force aerial refueling methods flying boom versus hoseanddrogue introduction air force aerial refueling received considerable attention in the 108th and 109th congresses much attention has focused on recapitalizing the kc135 fleet and proposed and ultimately rejected lease of 100 boeing kc767 aircraft1 in light of proposed replacements to the tanker fleet this report examines the department of defenses dod mix of aerial refueling methods currently air force fixedwing aircraft refuel with the flying boom the boom is rigid telescoping tube that an operator on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into receptacle on the aircraft being refueled figure 1 figure 1 usaf kc10 refueling b52 with flying boom air force helicopters and all navy and marine corps aircraft refuel using the hoseand drogue nato countries and other allies also refuel with the hoseand drogue as its name implies this refueling method employs flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft drogue small windsock at the end of the hose stabilizes it in flight and provides funnel for the aircraft being refueled which inserts probe into the hose figure 2 all boomequipped tankers ie kc135 kc10 have single boom and can refuel one aircraft at time with this mechanism many tanker aircraft that employ 1 see crs report rl32056 the air force kc767 tanker lease proposal key issues for congress for more information crs2 the hoseanddrogue system can simultaneously employ two such mechanisms and refuel two aircraft simultaneously the boom however can dispense fuel faster than hoseanddrogue figure 2 usmc kc130 refueling fa18s with hoseanddrogue single flying boom can transfer fuel at approximately 6000 lbs per minute single hoseanddrogue can transfer between 1500 and 2000 lbs of fuel per minute unlike bombers and other large aircraft however fighter aircraft cannot accept fuel at the booms maximum rate todays fighter aircraft can accept fuel at 1000 to 3000 lbs per minute whether from the boom or from the hoseanddrogue2 thus the flying booms primary advantage over the hoseanddrogue system is lost when refueling fighter aircraft as decisions are made regarding the air force tanker fleet an issue that may arise for congress is whether to examine the mix of boom and hoseanddroguerefuelable aircraft in the air force what might be the benefits and costs of any changes would dod benefit in terms of increased combat power if so would this benefit justify the cost background air force aircraft have not always used the flying boom all us combat aircraft used the hoseanddrogue system until the late 1950s the air forces decision to field boomequipped tankers was based on the refueling needs of longrange bombers which required large amounts of fuel the air forces fighter community resisted eliminating the hoseanddrogue but was overruled by the strategic air command which operated the tanker fleet and during the cold war placed higher value on refueling bombers3 2 kc135 aerial refueling manual to 11c13 3 for more information on ths history of air refueling see httpwwwcentennialofflight crs3 the perceived shortcomings of using single boom to refuel fighter aircraft is reflected in 1990 air force initiative to standardize dod fighter aircraft refueling on the hoseanddrogue method as initially conceived the initiative consisted of three elements 1 placing probes on all f15 and f16 fighters 2 incorporating probe in the design of the f22a and 3 adding two drogue pods to at least 150 kc135s to provide redundancy and flexibility air force fighters would retain their boom receptacles4 the 1991 war with iraq operation desert storm heightened dod concerns over lack of uniformity in aerial refueling methods navy leaders expressed frustration and dissatisfaction with the number of air force aerial refueling aircraft capable of employing the hoseanddrogue postconflict analyses recommended that the navy purchase its own fleet of landbased kc10sized tankers to increase the number of hoseanddrogue aircraft and reduce its reliance on air force aerial refueling5 navy concerns were mollified by air force promises of increased cooperation and undermined by lack of budget to purchase new refueling aircraft6 the air forces hose anddrogue initiative was also scaled back instead of pursuing the three elements described above the air force equipped 20 kc135s and 20 kc10s with multi point refueling system mprs kits that allow them to employ hoseanddrogue systems either from wing pods or attached to the end of the boom effectiveness of the current air force fleet the air forces aerial refueling fleet is often described as high demandlow density hdld force the fleet is in high demand because of the operational benefit derived from aerial refueling the long distances us combat aircraft often must fly and the multiple operations in which they are engaged despite numbering well over 500 aircraft the fleet is considered low density few in number for two apparent reasons first the demand for hoseanddrogue refueling across dod does not appear to be well matched by the air forces hoseanddrogue capabilities this can create refueling bottleneck as some have observed operation desert storm operation allied force in 1999 over yugoslavia and operation enduring freedom in 2001 demonstrated that requests for fuel offload do not always match the capacity to deliver it7 it appears that limited access to air force tankers has handicapped or complicated the navys long range strike capability in some conflicts because kc135 aircraft employ single hose 3 continued govessayevolution_of_technologyrefuelingtech22htm 4 multipoint refueling planned for air force kc135 fleet aerospace daily mar 12 1991 p 420 and government accounting

crs4 navy fighters must cycle six to eight aircraft through the refueling queue by the time the last aircraft has refueled the first one requires more gas this process can require three to four refueling hits for each aircraft before reaching distant target navy and marine corps strike packages often composed of 24 aircraft have required as many as four kc135s to meet their refueling needs8 suggesting dearth of air force tanker support us navy pilots who flew early missions against the taliban during operation enduring freedom described the uk royal air forces raf six vc10 tankers that supported them as godsend and the silent heros of the air war navy pilots expressed clear preference for raf tankers over usaf tankers9 to ameliorate deficit in refueling assets during operation iraqi freedom the navy flew refueling sorties with fa18ef aircraft10 while using the super hornet for aerial refueling demonstrated flexibility and reduced the navys dependence on the air force for refueling these desirable attributes came at cost fa18ef aircraft and the pilots that fly them are very specialized using these assets for aerial refueling rather than combat is seen as suboptimization of scarce and valuable resource fa18ef squadron vfa115 flew 623 sorties between march 21 2003 and april 9 2003 216 were refueling sorties when equipped to refuel other aircraft super hornets carry only self defense weapons and are not equipped to conduct attack operations11 the second reason the 500 aircraft tanker fleet is considered low density is that it does not appear that the flying booms fuel transfer rate is fully taken advantage of leading to an underexploitation of the tanker fleet by most air force aircraft in 2005 96 of air force aircraft that are aerial refuelable use the flying boom however only 20 of the current air force fleet 669 bombers and surveillance aircraft of 3227 aircraft can use the refueling boom to its full capacity four percent of the air force fleet 139 helicopters of 3227 aircraft cant use the boom at all seventy four percent of the fleet 2419 fighters of 3227 aircraft could potentially refuel with the hoseanddrogue with reduction in fuel transfer rates12 the following two scenarios illustrate the potentially more effective exploitation of aerial refueling assets by air force aircraft if the air force were to replace its 1356 f 16s and 356 a10s which are outfitted with boom receptacles with 1763 jsfs that are equipped to refuel with refueling probes only 43 of the fleet 1470 of 3372 aircraft would need to be refueled with booms the black and blackandwhite columns in figure 3 air force boomrefuelable aircraft would be evenly divided between large aircraft that can use this method at its full transfer rate and small aircraft that use the boom at reduced transfer rate 8 ibid 9 david graves britains flying tankers hailed as godsend london daily telegraph nov 10 2001 10 david fulghum tanker puzzle aviation

systems because the f22 design is more mature than that of the jsf changes to the aircraft to convert it from boom to hoseanddrogue refueling may be more expensive and potentially infeasible the air force wants 381 raptors the current budget plan supports the purchase of 179 f22as13 if the air force were to modify the f22a to refuel by the hoseanddrogue method and if the air force were to replace its 777 legacy aircraft with 381 raptors the percentage of the total fleet that would require boom refueling would drop to 23 669 of 2932 aircraft all these aircraft use the boom at its full transfer rate seventyseven percent of the fleet 2243 of 2912 aircraft would use the hoseanddrogue refueling system and be interoperable with navy marine corps and allied refueling aircraft14 figure 3 current and hypothetical air force aerial refueling profiles potential issues considering changes to the mix of refueling methods in the air force tanker fleet appears to raise two overarching issues potential operational benefit and potential cost the primary potential operational benefit of increasing the number of aerial refueling hoses has already been described above more effective use of aerial refueling assets another potential benefit of increasing the number of aerial refueling hoses may include 13 see crs report rl31673 f22a raptor by christopher bolkcom 14 this analysis assumes changes to other aircraft in the air force fleet if the number of longrange bombers strategic airlift aircraft and aerial refueling aircraft capable of being refueled themselves increases in the future the percentage of aircraft most in need of boom refueling would also increase crs6 greater interoperability and thus more effective coordination among the air force navy marine corps and allied air forces calculating the potential costs of increasing the proportion of hoses to booms in the air force tanker fleet would depend in large part on how dod and congress might decide to recapitalize and upgrade the current fleet one option would be to replace the oldest kc135s with new aircraft equipped with two refueling hoses structural modifications to commercial aircraft to accommodate flying boom are more significant than the modifications for hoseanddrogue mechanisms the boom itself also costs more than the hoseanddrogue and is more complex thus these new aircraft would likely be less costly than new boomequipped tankers newer kc135s and kc10s with booms would need to be retained to refuel large aircraft another option would be to replace the oldest kc135s with new boomequipped tankers and to outfit the remaining tankers with the multipoint refueling system mprs estimates by the gao and crs suggest that the cost of producing and installing the mprs could be roughly 51 million per aircraft in 2004 dollars or 510 million for 100 aircraft air force program officials estimate it takes approximately 7000 manhours or up to seven months to modify kc135s to accept the mprs15 this cost estimate does not consider newer systems being developed that could be more or less expensive than mprs16 regardless of which approach is taken to recapitalize the kc135 fleet legacy usaf fighter aircraft would need to be retrofitted and new aircraft would need to be manufactured with refueling probes if they were to exploit multipoint hoseanddrogue refueling it may be that the costs incurred by these modifications could be offset by the cost savings derived from improved aerial refueling effectiveness and corresponding reductions in tanker force structure according to 1991 air force estimates the 13 billion cost to modify about 3000 f15 and f16 fighter and 250 tankers to hoseand drogue configuration could be offset by reduced operating and support costs from the retirement of about 26 kc135 tankers17 at least five studies have examined the pros and cons of single boom versus multipoint hoseanddrogues18 because these studies considered different operational 15 michael gething kc135 upgrades continue apace international defense review may 14 1999 16 gaonsiad96160 estimated that the air force would spend 204 million to equip 45 kc135s with mprs on january 27

18 enhancing usaf aerial refueling capabilities rand 1990 utility of kc135 continued crs7 factors in their analyses and made different assumptions they came to different conclusions however all found that tankers equipped with multipoint hoseanddrogue refueling would refuel combat aircraft more effectively than boom equipped aircraft and could therefore allow reduction in the tanker fleet reduction estimates ranged from 17 to 5019 these reductions would result from the increased speed with which multipoint hoseanddrogueequipped aircraft could refuel multipleaircraft strike packages the following evaluation illustrates how increasing the speed with which combat aircraft are refueled could translate into increased efficiency and potentially lead to reduced tanker force structure and cost savings by refueling two fighters simultaneously the time that the fighters spend refueling can be reduced by approximately 75 percent this reduced refueling time in turn would enable the tanker to have considerably more fuel available to offload to other receiversthe less fuel burned by either the tanker or the receivers during aerial contact the more that is available to conduct the fighter mission at fighter refueling speeds kc135a burns something in excess of 200 pounds per minute reducing the air refueling time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes 75 percent makes approximately 6000 pounds of additional fuel availablethe fuel savings in four tanker formation could be enough to refuel an extra flight of four fighters or allow the same mission to be accomplished with one less tanker20 advocates of the flying boom argue that it is prudent to maintain large number of these tankers in the air force while fighter aircraft receive much media attention the contribution of longrange bombers to recent conflicts has been noteworthy21 these aircraft may become even more important as the united states reduces its overseas basing and deploys over greater distances bombers and other large aircraft can spend as much as 20 minutes refueling at the booms maximum capacity refueling such aircraft with the hoseanddrogue is infeasible22 further boom advocates argue technological advances are being made in new booms which reduce operator workload and should make them safer and more reliable than the hoseanddrogue method23 industry is incorporating commercial offtheshelf technology in booms currently under development hoping to make them fail safe24 18 continued multipoint modifications afsaa 1992 impact of multipointreceptacle modifications amcxpy 1993 aerial
