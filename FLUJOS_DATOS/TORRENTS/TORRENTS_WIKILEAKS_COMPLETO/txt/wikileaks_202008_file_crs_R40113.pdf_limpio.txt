him requested lineitem veto authority which congress granted in 1996 in the line item veto act but was invalidated by court action in 1998 state and local government officials were instrumental in

recommended changes in budget structure and procedure that have been adopted the federal budget process is rooted in constitutional mandates statutory requirements house and senate rules and practices and administrative directives thus there are several avenues through which budget process changes can occur either chamber may focus on changes in its rules thereby minimizing the time needed to effe ct the change and the scale of potential conflict needed to be resolved but at the same time possibly minimizing the impact of the changes broader and potentially more consequential changes involving statutes or constitutional amendments may entail larger set of participants in the decisionmaking ie the other chamber the president state legislatures likely escalating the effort required to reach

includes at least several proposed changes in budget procedure 2 in his final budget submission for example president george w bush advocated proposals involving such matters as enhanced controls over mandatory and discretionary spending stricter standards for emergency spending designations changes in how baseline calculations are made earmark reform lineitem veto biennial budgeting joint budget resolution and an automatic continuing resolution 3 in late november 2008 presidentelect barack obama signaled his interest in pursing budget process reform during the 111th congress when he announced

challenging times when we are facing both rising deficits and sinking economy budget reform is not an option it is an imperative4 perhaps more than any other factor over the years concern about the size and persistence of the federal deficit has animated calls for budget process reform the federal deficit which amounted to 162 billion for fy2007 jumped to 455 billion for fy2008 in the face of significant economic downturn several research organizations have indicated that the deficit for fy2009 driven upward by further economic deterioration and the need for economic stabilization and stimulus legislation may reach or exceed the 1 trillion level 5 the dramatic increase in the deficit and its likely persistence at high levels in the short term can be expected to fuel strong interest in procedural reform g3g159g142g151g158g142g156g561g152g143g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 the federal budget process is rooted in constitutional mandates statutory requirements house and senate rules

process were comprehensive the budget and accounting act of 1921 established the executive budget process the congressional budget act of 1974 created the congressional budget process and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 and the budget enforcement act of 1990 imposed additional budget controls on temporary basis in other years such as 1987 1993 and 1997 existing budget

president enacted statutes changing only selected aspects of the budget process the line item veto act of 1996 is one example finally in every congress the house and senate have modified existing rules and practices affecting the budget process and sometimes instituted new ones like other types of legislation statutes making changes in the budget process are subject to review by the judiciary in several major instances the supreme court has declared procedures established by congress and the president to be invalid on constitutional grounds the onehouse legislative veto found in many acts including the impoundment control act of 1974 for example was invalidated by ins v chadha in 1983 103 sct 715 1983 the triggering of sequester by the comptroller general under the grammrudmanhollings act was invalidated by bowsher v synar in 1986 478 us 714 1986 and the line item veto act was invalidated by clinton v city of new york in 1998 118 sct 2091 1998 in the wake of court decisions congress and the president may successfully modify legislation eg 1987 legislation modifying the grammrudmanhollings act vesting the authority to trigger sequester in the director of the office of management and budget but sometimes persistent efforts to enact corrective legislation do not succeed eg lineitem veto proposals given that nearly every committee of the house nd senate has jurisdiction over legislation with budgetary impact interest in the budget process and proposals to change it radiate throughout both chambers although jurisdiction over executive and congressional budget procedures generally resides with the budget oversight and government reform and rules committees in the house and with the budget homeland security and governmental affairs and rules and administration committees in the senate other house and senate committees particularly the appropriations and tax committees may exert influence over budget process changes affecting their legislative interests

g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 the first opportunity in new congress to change budget procedures usually occurs on the first or second day of session the house which unlike the senate is not continuous body must adopt its rules anew at the beginning of each congress traditionally the house adopts its rules from the previous congress with modifications that may include changes in the budget process in the form of simple resolution the rules package for the 110 th congress hres 6 contained several changes in the budget process including payasyougo paygo rule for the house8 second opportunity for budget process changes typically comes in march and april when the two chambers consider the annual budget resolution for the fiscal year beginning on october 1 under authority referred to as the elastic clause in section 301 of the 1974 congressional budget act either chamber may include procedural provisions in the annual budget resolution that are consistent with the purposes of the 1974 act several procedural provisions were incorporated for example into the fy2009 budg et resolution sconres 70 including house and senate restrictions on the use of advance appropriations procedures to adjust budget levels to 8 for detailed discussion regarding the changes in the budget process made by hres 6 see crs report rl34149 house rules changes affecting the

integrity initiatives and senate points of order pertaining to shortterm and longterm deficits and provisions of appropriations legislation that constitute changes in mandatory programs with net

quite significant it is possible that such legislation also may be the vehicle for strengthened budget enforcement provisions congress also may express its interest in the budget process in venues that do not involve legislative activity in the past consideration in the senate of nominations to the position of omb director often has afforded the opportunity to discuss budget process reforms

process reform propos als that may be considered during the 111th congress many pertain to categories such as internal payasyougo paygo rules in the house and senate restoration of the statutory

statutory limits on discretionary spending and paygo requirement for direct spending sometimes referred to as mandatory spending and revenue legislation both these budget constraints were established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration process by which violations were remedied by automatic acrossthe board spending cuts these statutory budget constraints were extended in 1993 and 1997 and further modified by other legislation but the discretionary spending limits expired at the end of fy2002 and the paygo requirement effectively was terminated in december 2002 9 the house and senate reached final agreement on the fy2009 budget resolution by agreeing to the conference report on sconres 70 hrept 110659 may 20 2008 by vote of 4845 in the senate on june 4 2008 and by vote of 214210 in the house on june 5 10

three fiscal years with the return of sizeable deficits in the short term due to economic decline and in the long term due principally to the growth of medicare medicaid and social security some have argued for restoring such statutory mechanisms to strengthen fiscal discipline principal point of contention with regard to the paygo requirement has been whether it should apply to revenue legislation while some maintain that revenue reductions should not face the hurdle of statutory paygo requirement because they are needed to continue the economic growth that fuels growing revenues others assert that accommodating further revenue reductions in paygo requirement ie by applying it only to direct spending like ly would undermine efforts to achieve significant deficit reduction in part by encouraging some spending initiatives to be reformulated as revenue losing provisions the fy2008 and fy2009 budget resolutions included senseofthecongress statements that statutory paygo requirement should be reinstated to help control the deficit section 508 of sconres 21 and section 515 of sconr 70 respectively but the 110 th congress did not take any action in this regard in the current economic climate congress and the president are likely to address additional legislation that would increase the deficit in the short term in order to promote economic stimulus and recovery consequently it may be more difficult at present to deal with restoring the statutory paygo requirement while not impeding current economic stimulus efforts in the case of the statutory limits on discretionary spending one issue has been the period of time for which they should be established advocates of two or threeyear limits argue that the five year framework employed earlier leads to limits that are too unrealistic in the later years due to changing circumstances limits that are unrealistically high fail to impose discipline while limits that are unrealistically low encourage evasions through gimmickry and other means shorter term limits they argue are more apt to be realistic and effective constraints on spending

in 1993 as provision in the fy1994 budget resolution the rule which operates differently than the statutory requirement has been modified several times over the years several unsuccessful efforts were

revised its paygo rule as part of the fy2008 budget resolution section 201 of sconres 21 the revised senate rule conforms closely to the house rule applying to the same two time periods and eliminating any exception for revenue or direct spending proposals assumed in the budget resolution it expires on september 30 2017 in addition the revised senate paygo rule is buttressed by other senate rules designed to discourage legislation that increases the deficit in both the short and longterms these rules can be waived only by the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant the operation of the house and senate paygo rules was confounded in 2008 during the second session of the 110 th congress by the need to enact legislation dealing with the housing crisis and economic downturn in manner that substantially increases the deficit in the short term the expectation that additional legislation will be addressed in 2009 to stimulate the economy and facilitate recovery with the associated increase s in the deficit makes the issue of potentially revising the house and senate paygo ru more complicated and uncertain

senate with the adoption of new rules in the 110th congress in late 2008 house republicans rejected proposed moratorium with respect to earmark requests through midfebruary 2009 special 10member panel of house republicans is expected to report on further earmark reforms at that time 11 other proposals regarding earmark reform are expected to be proposed in the house and senate during the 111th congress as well while definitions of earmarking vary an earmark generally is considered to be an allocation of resources to specificallytargeted beneficiaries either through earmarks of discretionary or direct spending limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits earmarks may be proposed by the president or may be originated by congress concern about recent earmarking practices arose because some of them were inserted into legislation or accompanying reports without any identification of the sponsor and the belief that many earmarks were not subject to proper scrutiny and diverted resources to lesserpriority items or items without sufficient justification thereby contributing to wasteful spending or revenue loss the essential feature of earmark reform proposals is bar against the consideration of legislation that does not identify individual earmarks and the members who sponsored them the distribution of such information in way that makes it readily available before the legislation is considered and certification by earmark sponsors that neither they nor their spouses have financial interest in the earmark earmark reform provisions requiring the identification of earmarks and their sponsors before legislation may be considered and imposing other restrictions on the use of earmarks were contained in title iv section 404 of the houses rules package for the 110

the congressional budget act of 1974 requires the house and senate to adopt budget resolution each year setting forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional categories for at least five fiscal years the budget resolution which is concurrent resolution and therefore does not become law provides an overall budget plan that guides congressional action on individual spending revenue and debtlimit measures the 1974 act includes an optional reconciliation procedure that provides for the development and consideration of revenue spending and debtlimit legislation to carry out budget resolution policies enforcement of budget resolution policies also occurs by means of various points of order that may be raised on the floor budget resolutions and reconciliation measures are considered under expedited procedures in both chambers some members of congress as well as the president have argued that the budget resolution would be more effective in enforcing budget policy by making it joint resolution requiring the presidents approval joint budget resolutio n would directly involve the president in congressional actions on the budget early in the process if the president and congress reach an impasse on joint budget resolution however some are concerned that action on spending and revenue bills might be significantly delayed during the 1980s and much of the 1990s reconciliation was used principally as means of reducing the deficit while some reconciliation measures included spending increases or revenue reductions the net impact of the legislation was to reduce the deficit in recent years the reconciliation process has been used mainly to expedite the passage of legislation that increases the deficit primarily through revenue reduction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40113g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343

when regular appropriations act or continuing resolution is not in place after the start of the fiscal year on october 1 an agency does not have the legal authority to incur obligations in order to function and must shut down resulting in the furlough of federal employees and disruptions in service in order to prevent government shutdown or the threat of one due to the expiration of funding some members have proposed establishing an automatic continuing resolution an automatic continuing resolution would provide an uninterrupted source of funding for discretionary activities in the event one or more regular appropriations acts are not enacted by the start of new fiscal year while such device could eliminate or reduce employee furloughs and service disruptions some view an automatic co ntinuing resolution as substituting formulaic response for deliberate and informed decisionmaking

considerable attention has been focused recently on the large imbalances projected in the federal budget over the long term particularly with respect to the social security medicare and medicaid programs one device advocated by some as means of compelling action on long term budgetary issues is bipartisan commission or task force empowered to recommend legislative changes that would correct or mitigate the imbalances advocates of the commission or task force approach argue that it would be an effective means of surmounting political opposition and achieving an end result because of the bipartisan nature of the group the avoidance of preconditions with respect to policy options ie all options would be on the table and the actionforcing nature of expedited legislative procedures adherents to the use of regular legislative procedures to deal with these issues maintain that while they may entail more timeconsuming and difficult route they afford more openness and participation in the decisionmaking process and are more likely to lead to widespread acceptance of the results

and spending is merged together into unified budget information on capital budgeting however has been provided for many years as separate chapter in one of the volumes of the presidents budget interest in adopting capital budget for the federal government has been examined from time to time in 1999 commission established by president bill clinton pursuant to executive order 13037 march 3 1997 the presidents commission to study capital budgeting recommended several changes in budgetary practice but did not recommend the adoption of formal capital budget advocates of capital budgeting generally regard it as means of boosting resources for infrastructure needs eg surface transportation and aviation systems struggling to meet capacity and deteriorating water infrastructure overcoming an alleged bias against capital spending in the current budget process and rationalizing decisionmaking in this area critics of capital budgeting assert that shifting significant portion of the budget to an accrual basis in which costs are apportioned over the lifetime of an asset rather than accounted for up front would unduly complicate the budget process and undermine the task of setting priorities over the full range of governmental activities as first step toward improved budgeting for infrastructure needs some have advocated more information gathering and analysis in this area one
