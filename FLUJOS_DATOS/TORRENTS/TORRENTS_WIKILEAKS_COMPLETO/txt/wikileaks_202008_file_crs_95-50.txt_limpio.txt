development wendy h schacht specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division summary the federal government has traditionally played role in fostering technological progress this has involved both direct federal research and development rd funding and indirect measures that create incentives for increased private sector investments in innovation however this mix of initiatives has been challenged since the 104th congress while support for all ongoing efforts continues some programs have been funded at reduced levels however since fy2001 appropriations appear to have reversed this trend as programs are implemented and mature concerns are being raised as to the appropriate balance between the importance of bringing new and improved products and processes to the marketplace and protecting the public investment in rd technology development the federal role1 the federal government funds research and development rd to meet the mission requirements of the departments and agencies eg defense public health environmental quality it also finances work in areas where there is an identified need for research primarily basic research not being performed in the private sector federal support reflects consensus that while basic research is the foundation for many innovations the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in such work is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the performing institution this often leads to underinvestment in research by the business community over the last 20 years congressional initiatives have expanded the governments role in rd to include the promotion of technological innovation to meet other national needs particularly the economic growth that flows from the commercialization and use of new products and production processes technological advance can drive the economy because it contributes to the creation of new goods and services new industries new jobs

library of congress crs2 and new capital it allows for an expanded range of services and extends the geographic distribution of those services the application of technology also may contribute to the resolution of those national problems that are amenable to such solutions experts widely believe that technological progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force in longterm economic expansion and increases in the nations standard of living dual approaches congress often has been the source of federal inducements to technological progress the legislative approach generally reflects the basic tenet that while commercialization of technology is the responsibility of the private sector there are benefits that may be derived from additional mechanisms to stimulate industrial innovation as result of bipartisan efforts various laws have removed barriers to technology development in the business community and provided incentives for increased private sector rd many legislative initiatives involve promotion of cooperative relationships among government industry and academia the laws affecting the rd environment have included both direct and indirect measures to facilitate technological innovation in general direct measures are those that concern budget outlays and the provision of services by government agencies indirect measures include financial incentives and legal changes eg liability or regulatory reform new antitrust arrangements supporters of an indirect approach argue the market is superior to government in determining those technologies worthy of investment mechanisms that enhance opportunities for the market to make such choices are preferred it is assumed that reliance on the discretion of federal agencies to promote one technology in preference over others will inevitably be subjected to political pressures from entrenched interests conversely proponents of direct government assistance maintain that indirect methods can be wasteful and ineffective and may compromise other goals of public policy in the hope of stimulating innovative performance advocates of federal spending argue it is important to put the countrys scarce resources to work on those technologies with the greatest promise as determined by industry and supported by the communitys willingness to match government funding in the past while republicans tended to prefer reliance on free market investment competition and indirect federal support participants in the debates generally did not make definite or exclusionary choices between the two approaches nor consistently favor one over the other for example some proponents of stronger direct role for the government in innovation are also supporters of enhanced tax preferences for rd spending an indirect mechanism opponents of direct federal support for specific projects eg sematech flat panel displays nevertheless may back similar activities focused on more general areas such as manufacturing or information technology however many of these activities were called into question during the 104th congress as reflected in the house republican contract with america associated budget proposals and various authorization and appropriations legislation similar issues have been raised in subsequent congresses but appear subject to less conflict while most of the programs survived termination challenges such efforts implied significant change from the past under former president bush governments stated role was to support the development of generic or enabling technologies at the precompetitive stage crs3 of rd and included direct federal costshared funding for several industrial programs increased private sector investment was encouraged as was publicprivate collaboration through the national technology initiative also proposed were reductions in the capital gains tax rate making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit increasing international intellectual property protection limiting product liability and eliminating unwarranted regulation the clinton administration expanded upon this approach in the context of national strategy for commercial technological advancement as part of defined national economic policy there have been efforts to increase direct federal funding for industry led technology programs with matching private sector commitments to augment cooperation among all levels of government industry and academia to move from defense rd toward civilian rd support and to shift emphasis from basic research to include development of commercial products and processes the administrations strategy for civilian technology investment was based upon support of both direct and indirect federal assistance current initiatives an overview of the current mix of indirect and direct measures designed to facilitate technological advancement is offered below indirect measures among the most visible indirect mechanism is the research and experimentation tax credit originally mandated by the 1981 economic recovery tax act pl 9734 extended several times the most recently through june 30 2004 the law allows 20 credit for increases in firms qualified research costs above the average expenditures for the previous 3 tax years qualified costs include inhouse expenditures such as wages for researchers materials and payments for use of equipment 65 of corporate grants towards basic research at universities and other relevant institutions and 65 of payments for contract research the credit is applicable to 75 of companys tax liability small startup firms also are eligible various legislative initiatives have been enacted to facilitate cooperative ventures among government business and academia in recognition of the fact that investments in research and development are often costly long term and risky it is argued that collaborative rd ameliorates these factors and permits work to be performed that crosses traditional boundaries of expertise and experience to encourage increased private sector rd activity the national cooperative research act pl 98462 clarifies the antitrust laws as they relate to joint research efforts and eliminates treble damage awards for those ventures actually found in violation if prior disclosure to the government has been made these changes came in response to industrys reluctance to enter into cooperative efforts because of the threat of antitrust prosecution through fy2002 over 765 joint research ventures have filed with the department of justice since passage of this legislation in addition the success of this law precipitated the enactment of the national cooperative production amendments act of 1993 pl 10342 which extends the provisions of the national cooperative research act to joint manufacturing ventures with certain reservations concerning location and ownership of the participating enterprises crs4 another indirect approach to augment commercialization involves the transfer of technology from federal laboratories and contractors to the industrial community mandated by the stevensonwydler technology innovation act pl 96480 as amended2 this law created institutional mechanisms by which government agencies and their laboratories can move technology to the private sector as well as integrate industrial expertise into the federal rd enterprise additional incentives are contained in the federal technology transfer act pl 99502 and the defense authorization act of 1990 pl 101189 which enable government laboratories to enter into cooperative rd agreements cradas with universities and industry in pursuing joint efforts the laboratory may accept funds personnel services and property from the collaborating party and may provide personnel services and property but not funds to the other organization the work performed must be consistent with the laboratorys mission preference for cooperative ventures is given to small businesses companies that will manufacture in the united states or foreign firms from countries that permit american companies to enter into similar arrangements to date over 5000 cradas have been signed including nasa space act agreements pl 96517 amendments to the patent and trademark act commonly referred to as the bayhdole act utilizes the ownership of inventions arising out of governmentsponsored rd to encourage development of new technologies the law provides for title to inventions made with federal rd funding to be vested in the contractor if it is small business university or notforprofit institution patent ownership is seen as way to promote the additional private sector investment necessary for commercialization certain rights are reserved for the government3 direct measures government programs directly funding technology development experienced the most scrutiny since the 104th congress several times the house has acted to delete appropriations for the advanced technology program while many of these activities require cost sharing of at least 50 with nonfederal partners and usually are responsive to industryled priorities there are indications that some members view them as inappropriate federal government involvement in market choices the advanced technology program atp provides seed funding matched by privatesector investment to companies or consortia of universities businesses and government laboratories for development of generic technologies that have broad application across industries4 managed by the national institute of standards and technology nist laboratory of the department of commerce this program was established by the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl100418 awards based on technical and business merit are made for work which is highrisk and past the basic research stage but not yet ready for commercialization initial funding for 2 for further detail see crs

partnerships and intellectual property implications for us policy by wendy h schacht 4 for more information see crs report 9536 the advanced technology program by wendy h schacht crs5 atp in fy1991 was 36 million by fy1995 this had expanded significantly to 341 million after rescissions support began to decline in fy1996 attempts were made by the house to terminate the program although funding has continued fy2002 atp appropriations totaled 1845 million also created by the 1988 trade act was program of regional manufacturing technology transfer centers now known as the manufacturing extension partnership mep5 knowledge and technologies developed under the auspices of the national institute of standards and technology are used to assist small and mediumsized companies to date all states have manufacturing technology centers or smaller outreach centers beginning with 119 million in fy1991 the partnership expanded in fy1994 to include the centers program the manufacturing outreach effort and the state extension program new program links was added in fy1995 to tie together federal state and local agencies the private sector and the manufacturing outreach institutions through communications and computer data systems recently funding has remained stable as additional financial responsibilities are taken over by the nonfederal partner fy2002 funding for the program is 1065 million the small business innovation research program mandated by pl 97219 as amended is an activity to assist small high technology companies perform research development and commercialization in areas of interest to the government6 each federal agency with an rd budget over 100 million is required to set aside percentage of that funding 25 through the end of fy2008 for grants to small firms financing is in part dependent on companies obtaining private sector support for the commercialization of the resulting products or processes pilot effort the small business technology transfer program also was created to encourage small firms to work with universities or federal laboratories to facilitate the commercialization of research performed in these institutions this activity is funded by setaside originally 015 and increased to 03 initially expected to sunset in fy1996 the program has been extended through fy2009 issues for consideration new approach in the past government support for technology development has been reflected in the balance between legislatively mandated incentives for private sector investment and direct government financing of rd the activities of the 104th congress displayed preference for the first approach while subsequent congresses further explored technology policy within the context of budget decisions although ongoing programs were funded some support was at reduced levels what happens next might be dependent on how the debate is framed will federal funding of specific technology ventures continue to be seen by the majority as picking winners and losers or will spending for efforts such as the advanced technology program be seen as fostering productive collaboration among firms is the government making decisions which should best be left to the marketplace or is there an overriding national need for federal investment in these industryled programs 5 see crs report 97104 the manufacturing extension partnership by wendy h schacht 6 additional detail in crs report 96402 the small business innovation research program by wendy h schacht crs6 there appears to be agreement with the basic premise that the government does have role in fostering technological advancement in the private sector the debate is over how this is best achieved within existing and future budget constraints in place of direct federal appropriations some have suggested the creation of tax incentives which proponents argue would provide the capital resources necessary for industry to invest in additional rd thus efforts such as permanent and expanded research and experimentation tax credit are considered viable substitute for government costshared programs changes in the capital gains tax to encourage long term investments particularly in high technology companies also have been proposed to increase the amount of funding available for industrial use regulatory reform may be used to facilitate technology development by diminishing the costs associated with bringing new product or process to the marketplace disincentives to new technology development embodied in the threat of large punitive damage awards might be addressed by liability reform in addition other ideas might be considered to encourage collaborative work among industry university and government these include changes to the antitrust laws pertaining to cooperative development andor commercialization activities increasing state government participation in relevant federal decisionmaking and strengthening intellectual property protection legislative activity has emphasized creation of an environment conducive to such cooperative ventures to date congress has determined that efforts that provide title to inventions made under federal funding to contractors andor collaborating parties should be used to support innovation and technology development in return for patent ownership congress has accepted as satisfactory the anticipated payback to the country through goods and services to improve our health welfare and standard of living these benefits have been considered more important than the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantage of one company over another in cooperative venture however as such efforts become more widespread and as new issues emerge additional decisions may need to be made on how to maintain balance between the importance of bringing new products and processes to the marketplace and protecting the public investment in rd research and development funding constitutes the largest single portion of total federal discretionary spending and is therefore subject to cuts as legislators move toward balanced budget as result priorities concerning the allocation of financing may need to be established the 107th congress may find it productive to explore new methods to encourage increased activities by other parties in the innovation process particularly if the goal is to continue the technological advancement which has been so instrumental to this nations economic growth and high living standard for other versions of this
