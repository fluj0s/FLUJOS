6406c30 shspec25 cause level ot and the public what is wrong with you is this you are so birddogged onto the glories of ot that you are going to leave the rest of the world suspended between the lower rung of ot and the ground the bottom rung of ot does not sit on the ground there is large gap so there has to be another ladder there the lower ladder could be called cause level see fig 267 person cant vanquish the sun and stars who is having hell of time with his wife figure 26 cause level and the ladder to ot graphics inserted we have had the definition of causativeness for long time if you could imagine an expansion of reach from an inverse self notimagined unbelieved self which he cant reach because it aint because he doesnt know he actually sort of has to reach in in order to reach out if you can imagine reach that is this confused that person doesnt even know which direction to go to get it youve got level and 99 of the human beings on the planet they are following the pied piper of science the blind alley of science is that man is intelligent meat machine this leaves out the being himself according to this view man is thinking brain nothing more there are two kinds of sciences 1 classification or naming things 2 extrapolative science that derives answers modern science is just classification science eg biology is nothing but classification it doesnt let you learn anything to modern science the science of man is just another classification science when they dont know anything they name everything if you dont know the right name for the nonexistent parts of the brain then you know nothing about the mind they go on the basis that man never creates they try to understand the mind on the basis of the law of conservation of energy ie that nothing is ever created or destroyed from that viewpoint man doesnt make any sense something would have to be done to him before he could do anything to anybody else this isnt true so neither is stimulusresponse theory since man isnt really understandable on the basis of his never creating the stimulusresponse mechanism is likewise untrue after making wrong assumptions about the mind modern science cant understand it so they sweep it aside as an incomprehensible subject the humanities so we just classify and appoint authorities is it and say that it is an unworkable field then the scientologist comes along and says heresy man is not machine hes thetan being weve taken that as our basic assumption because we can demonstrate it this violates the idea that the scientist has that nothing is ever created or destroyed the fact is however that man mocks up his own mind this disagrees with the law of conservation of energy when you say mind the scientist receives brain when you say that you can run out troublesome part of the mind he thinks that it would be easier to cut out part of the brain he has already accepted two falsehoods 1 man is machine 2 man never creates anything you can prove the scientist wrong by getting result on preclear that is difference between us and the humanities form is more important to the nonscientologist than the result they have end results so theyve begun to believe there are end results in the field of the mind you say an end result can occur in the field of the mind you have to follow very exact discipline to get this end result and they dont believe that the end result is more important to us than how you arrive at it they lost interest in end results because they couldnt produce any they couldnt produce any end results because they couldnt accept these basic premises 1 man is being independent of his body 2 he is capable of creating his private universe including his mind complete with mass and spaces we cure leukemia case and the doctors say they couldnt have it must have been misdiagnosed in the first place you ask why couldnt he have had leukemia and the answer is he couldnt have had it because it is incurable ie leukemia is incurable by definition they are trying to protect authority in an unworkable rationale that they themselves down deep know has failed their question is how long can we put up the big bluff all analysts know that they arent getting results to get workable results one must accept two things 1 being is an independent thing that can exist independent of body 2 being is capable of autocreation all by his lonesome by doing this he builds mind persons own universe or his bank is not stuck in his skull but is plastered all over the physical universe the scientific premises about the origin of man require at least as much assumption as our premises about mans nature the life springing from an electrified sea of ammonia bit is at least as bizarre as the virgin mary story science starts assuming that man is an inflow mechanism the reverse is actually true the former assumption wont cure anyone the latter assumption will always if you want to help man dont get him to inflow get him to outflow that is why scientists cannot make man well or solve the problems of the mind man is actually an outflow mechanism you solve his problems on the basis of outflow if you want to prove this watch what happens if you run someone on an inflow eg think of motivator this will give you high stuck ta and pc who feels worse and worse sicker and sicker fuzzy and foggy etc actually mans basic action is outflowing and his basic error was an outflow he is restraining himself from outflow because of his experience of causing bad outflows he learned not to outflow so he decided to inflow only then he thought he could only inflow then he caved in we get an end result by operating on this assumption we rehab the ability to outflow and win however society and religion train people to operate on this reverse basis we are really in the line of religion rather than science if science means conservation of energy science has only recently ie in the past hundred years presumed to have anything to do with the field of the mind in spaceopera of course science took over the mind but without comprehension so you got oddball damaging actions however spaceopera science was capable of more damage than modern science our assumptions about the nature of man are violently opposed to the assumptions of science that is the first ladder that you have to jump with people they have to get past the current belief that if you stuff something in the body something beneficial will occur this is something that has confronted us in the past few weeks wi h violence practically one comes to st hill who is low on causativeness since it takes outflow and causativeness to get here out in central organizations or in the world at large you run into more noncommunication than is comfortable if you flee the nonscientology world after standing it for just so long its the level of causation that gets on your nerves it isnt that they dont talk your language its their noncommunication its the fact that they dont seem to connect with anything people have to be gotten up to recognition of the world around them total introversion has to be changed to slight extroversion before there is any way that they can asis items guy cant go ot until he has been gotten out of his total introversion the grades enable the individual to break through to the environment they get person reaching causative to degree extroverted and able to asis person has to be able to cause slightly at least before he can asis something when person cant asis the bank he is the effect of it small percentage of the level iv coauditors were type b when they started they werent really low on cause but only when they were spoton on the exact item with all ruds in could they asis it these were people who had had fair amount of auditing if you put green pc into gpm even spoton he would do nothing to the gpm the gpm would make him sick you can take type pc who can usually asis anything and if he is underfed run down or underslept so that his body is soaking up energy he will run poorly with packedup meter if someone cant asis his personal problems he wont be able to asis gpm this barriered lovely idea that lrh had which only works on him if he finds himself thinking too hard about something he can always skip down through the endwords and pick out the one that has gotten into restimulation and let it blow down this is bit heroic he thought that you could just take someone at level iv and assess the end words but you cant the meter packs up almost at once when person cannot asis his bank because his cause level is too low he will be the effect of his bank and he will get disappearance of that is worrying him so whatever process you use your whole task is to put the pc more at cause you run ow to raise someones cause level since ow is big barrier to his cause level in that he has done something he regrets and furthermore isnt communicating about it you run ow to raise his certainty of having done not just to asis regretted doingness you will find that it is probably that few of your pcs have been answering the auditing question since while you are looking for something they have done they are looking for an explanation of what happened to them some pcs go plunging madly into the bank searching madly for some answer that explains it all such pcs invent things or give things that they are not sure of in an effort to find the right answer a11 you have to do is be sure the pc is certain that he did the thing without alterises in other words you want an asising of doneness all you want is the answer to your question what have you done not what have you done that is bad antisocial etc i ate breakfast and that is probably why is not an answer to the auditing question as auditor all you have to do is police and make sure the person is certain he did do that it isnt the quality of the deed its just whether or not he has done it just make sure the pc is sure that he did that otherwise ow will not work so you build up the persons idea of what he can cause and what he can reach until he can reach the lowest rung of the upper ladder you can convert sop 8c and run it in such way that the pc is sure of doing it distance has to do with reach so on sop 8c you get wider perimeter of what person can reach then on subjective processing you get gradient of what the pc can asis in his mind the object of all lower level processing up to level vi is to raise the cause level of the individual dont expect recognition or appreciation from society around you when they dont even recognize themselves as existing we dont really have opponents except ourselves if we neglect the lower ladder that people need to climb before getting on the ladder to ot ow is the only thing that will key out gpm without the pcs having to pay attention to the gpm this is because ow is senior to the bank and can therefore make keyout clear then you can erase the bank to asis person must have done something promote the idea of raising cause level not so much the idea of going ot people could understand that
