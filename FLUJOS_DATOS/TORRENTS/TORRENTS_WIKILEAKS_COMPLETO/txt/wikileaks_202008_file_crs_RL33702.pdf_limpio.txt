roles in ensuring the availability affordability and adequacy of private health insurance these roles complement one another but even together the market and government have limitations the market provides variety of insurance pro ducts for consumers and employers with different needs and preferences these products differ on many dimensions including the breadth of provider networks amount of beneficiary costs haring and techniques for managing the use of health care services large employers small employers and individuals have different health insurance options but all must make tradeoffs between the cost of coverage and desired features strength of the market is its flexibility to adapt over time to changing circumstances as economic conditions consumer preferences and government policies evolve the market generates different products with different features the primary limitation of the market is its failure to provide affordable options for all consumers the federal government helps ensure access to health coverage through public programs such as medicare and medicaid and it influences the market for private insurance through tax and regulatory policies some tax subsidies help people purchase insurance and othersincluding those for health savings accountshelp pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance by far the largest subsidy is the tax exclusion for employerprovided health benefits because of this exclusion most people get health insurance through work tax subsidies make health insurance and health care seem more affordable for certain taxpayers but do not provide equivalent support to everyone in addition subsides may increase health care spending by reducing the apparent cost of health insurance and health care services regulations affect both access to insurance and the adequacy of benefits states have primary responsibility for regulating insurance but the federal government has sought to address selected issues regarding health coverage for example the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 include provisions that allow certain people to obtain or continue health coverage under certain circumstances in addition several federal laws mandate coverage for specific health benefits although regulations provide some protection for consumers neither federal nor state rules guarantee access to coverage for everyone in addition even where regulations require insurers or employers to offer coverage consumers may find this coverage unaffordable this report will be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33702g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g4g138g156g146g140g156g561 g561

individuals and families from catastrophic health expenses1 both the market and government have important roles in helping ensure the availability affordability and adequacy of private health insurance in 2006 about twothirds of americans had private coverage including about 60 with employmentbased and 9 with directly purchased health insurance in the same year about 27 of the population had government benefits through medicare medicaid and military health programs about 16 of the population was uninsured 2 the market for private insurance excels in creating new products and adapting to changing demand but is not set up to ensure that everyone gets coverage consumers who are sick or poor may not be able to find adequate insurance at an affordable price while others may decide that premiums are more than they are willing to pay if health insurance were another good or service people might not care about consumers who cannot afford it or choose not to buy it but many think that health insurance and the health care it pays for are different from other goods and services government helps ensure access to health coverage where the market might not it does this through public programs such as medicare and medicaid and through policies that affect the market for private insurance federal policies include tax subsidies and regulations subsidies make health insurance more affordable for consumers and employers and regulations help ensure access to insurance and the adequacy of benefits states play fundamental role in regulating health insurers and the products they sell functions vary by state and may include licensing insurance companies and agents ensuring financial solvency through standards and oversight approving rates and assessing insurance companies to fund programs for consumers of course there is bright line between the market and government market limitations prompt government policies and government policies in turn shape market trends in addition differences among state policies and the interaction between federal and state requirements create complex landscape for consumers employers and insurers who wish to buy or provide health benefits this report analyzes the roles of the market and government in providing financing and regulating private health insurance it focuses on federal policy and shows that although both the market and government play important roles both also have limitations 1 for more information about private health insurance see crs report rl32237 health insurance primer by bernadette fernandez 2 us census

insurance products and by adapting to different and changing conditions the market for private health insurance provides choices for consumers and employers who have different needs and preferences g17g143g143g142g155g146g151g144g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g156g561g160g146g157g145g561g6g146g143g143g142g155g142g151g157g561g8g142g138g157g158g155g142g156g561 consumers and employers want affordable yet generous coverage they also want unfettered access to health care providers and services but generally they must make tradeoffs between cost on the one hand and generous coverage and access on the other for example some may be willing to pay higher premiums in exchange for unrestricted access to health care providers while others accept restrictions or higher costsharing to make coverage more affordable to meet demand the market offers variety of health insurance products these products include traditional indemnity insurance relatively restrictive health maintenance organizations hmos and highdeductible health plans with associated savings accounts certain products are characterized by certain features for example indemnity coverage is associated with choice of health care providers while hmos are associated with restricted choice including limited provider networks and constrained access to care in practice distinctions between the product types are not clear any type of product may have nearly any combination of features including broad or restricted access to health care provider s low or high costsharing and limited or fully integrated programs for managing patients use of services consumers and employers choose among different products according to their preferences although individuals small employers and large employers tend to have different options in addition to having more options large employers can choose between purchasing insurance and selfinsuring and buying administrative services from an entity that processes paperwork but does not bear financial risk g3g141g138g153g157g146g151g144g561g157g152g561g5g145g138g151g144g146g151g144g561g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 in addition to providing variety of products the market adapts over time to changing circumstances health insurance products evolve and different features become more or less prominent in the early 1990s the trend was toward managed care with restricted access to health care providers low beneficiary costsharing and health plan management to limit use of services these strategies slowed growth in premiums for he alth insurance but also led to complaints by patients and providers about restrictions on access to care and interference in the practice of medicine in response to these complaints the market began to offer more flexible products with higher premiums by the late 1990s with booming economy and low unemployment employers were willing to pay more for health in surance in an effort to recruit and maintain qualified workforce more recently as prices have continued to rise renewed concern by consumers and employers about the cost of health benefits has led to more changes in insurance

restrictions on access to care and instead rely on higher costsharing to influence consumers use of services3 in addition to responding to changing circumstances the market responds to policy changes for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma authorized new taxadvantaged accounts to pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance or other reimbursements these health savings ac counts hsas must be paired with high deductible health plans and the market has responded by developing such plans4 the mma also established medicare drug coverage private insurers provide this coverage through medicare advantage ma and standalone prescripti on drug plans pdps depending on where beneficiaries live they may be able to choose among one or more ma plans with drug coverage and more than 50 pdp options5 g14g146g150g146g157g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g561 although private insurers offer variety of products and respond to changing conditions they do not serve everyone equally premiums and access to health insurance vary across and within geographic markets and for different consumers and employers across markets premiums vary with differences in the cost of living in patterns of health care practice in the mix of medical providers and in the relative market power of heal th care providers and insurers within markets premiums vary both because products differ and because individual consumers and employers differ differences in consumer and employer characteristics affect not just premiums but also access to insurance including the number type and generosity of plan options some people and firms have many choices while others have few large firms and their employees tend to have more options than smaller firms and their employees many people have employmentbased option either because their employer does not offer coverage or because they are not working lack of employmentbased coverage can be particular problem for highrisk populationsincluding people who are older sick or disabledas they may have few or choices in the private market large number of choices may or may not improve insurance coverage on the one hand many options increase the likelihood that consumers and employers will find satisfactory combination 3 for more on changes in health care and

on medicare medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip is expected to total 634 billion6 these programs serve primarily older lowincome and disabled people populations that otherwise would have difficulty finding adequate and affordable coverage in the private market for vulnerable individuals who lack access to employerpaid insurance government benefits may be the only viable alternative in addition to providing health benefits for vulnerable populations the federal government uses tax and regulatory policy to influence the market for private health insurance tax policy supports access to care through subsidies for insurance and medical care expenses while regulatory policy supports access by laying ground rules that affect the availability and adequacy of insurance coverage g22g138g161g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 federal law includes significant tax benefits for health insurance and medical care expenses in addition to supporting access to care these benefits have shaped the market for private health insurance largely because of tax policy in 2006 about 60 of americans got health benefits through work g21g158g139g156g146g141g146g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 by far the largest healthrelated tax benefit is the exclusion for employerpaid insurance for people receiving employerpaid benefits premium costs are not counted as income and therefore not subject to income and employment taxes in 2007 the income tax exclusion for employer paid insurance is expected to be about 100 billion 7 employers also do not pay employment taxes on health insurance premiums these tax benefits help make insurance more affordable for consumers and employers but they also reduce federal revenue that otherwise could be used for different purposes in effect consumers who receiv employerpaid insurance transfer part of the cost of coverage to taxpayers8 other tax benefits for health insurance include deduction for selfemployed taxpayers and tax credit for limited group of individuals who either lost manufacturing jobs or receive payments from the pension benefit guaranty corporation these tax benefits serve fewer people than the 6 us congressional budget office the budget and economic outlook an update august 2007 pp 1213 7 us

for qualified medical expenses not covered by insurance taxpayers who itemize may deduct health insurance premiums and other costs to the extent that qualified expenses exceed 75 of adjusted gross income agi 10 because eligibility depends on high spending relative to income this deduction limits financial loss for people who face catastrophic costs in 2007 this tax benefit is expected to be about 8 billion people also can use several taxadvantaged accounts to pay for qualified medical expenses these accounts include health savings accounts hsa s archer medical savings accounts msas health reimbursement accounts hras and flexible spending accounts fsas the newest such option hsas is expected to provide about 300 million in tax benefits in 2007 11

governmentlike the marketdoes not serve everyone equally people may or may not be eligible for various benefits and if they are eligible support may or may not affect access because many tax benefits are tied to employment workers may receive support that is not available to the unemployed in addition higherincome workers realize greater tax savings than lowerincome workers because tax benefits are based on marginal tax rates tax support does not guarantee access and lack of support does not preclude it lowincome people may be unable to afford coverage or all of the care they desire even with support conversely highincome people may be able to buy insurance and whatever care they need even without support in addition to failing to distribute support based on need tax benefits may increase health care spending with subsidies people can afford more insurance than they would otherwise and with insurance people may use more care 12 9 jct p 39 for more information on the tax credit

certain consumers get or keep access to coverage under certain conditions for example the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa helps ensure access to new insurance coverage for individuals and their families when the policyholder changes jobs this protection is called portability the act also helps ensure continuing coverage when beneficiary gets sick hipaa accomplishes these guarantees by requiring insurers to sell or renew both individual and group insurance policies without regard to health status or claims experience the law similarly helps small businesses insurers that offer coverage in the small group market must accept every applicant without regard to the claims history of the group 13 the consolidated omnibus budget reconcilia tion act of 1985 cobra also helps ensure access to health insurance cobra allows certain workers and family members who lose eligibility for group coverage to continue to purchase this coverage for limited time period14 under the law firms that employ at least 20 people must allow beneficiaries to continue health coverage following qualifying event for workers qualifying events include loss of coverage due to job termination reduction in work hours or firms reorganization due to bankruptcy for family members qualifying events include loss of coverage due to the death of or divorce from covered employee g3g141g142g154g158g138g140g162g561g152g143g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561 in addition to helping ensure access to insurance regulations address the adequacy of coverage almost all such regulations come from the states according to the council for affordable health insurance an industry group the number of statemandated benefits currently tops 1900 these mandates require affected insurers to cover specific health benefits providers and patients examples include mandated coverage for cancer screening tests chiropractors and handicapped dependents 15 13 for more information

everyone equally for example although hipaa and cobra require insurers and employers to offer coverage to certain individuals under certain circumstances these acts do not guarantee access to insurance for everyone in addition even where regulations require insurers to sell or employers to offer coverage eligible people may find coverage unaffordable benefit mandates also do not serve everyone equally sometimes the issue is uniform protection and sometimes the issue is variable protection on one hand while some argue that benefit mandates help guarantee adequate coverage others maintain that mandates increase costs and limit coverage options for consumers on the other hand because most benefit mandates come from the states consumers may or may not be protected depending on where they live in addition while policies sold by insurance companies generally must comply with state mandates firms that selfinsure are exempt from the requirements

developed legislation regarding access to and the adequacy of private insurance for example the senate budget committee has held series of hearings on health care costs and universal coverage17 in addition committees in both the house and senate have reported legislation that would regulate private insurance one set of house and senate proposals would extend and expand federal requirements affecting mental health coverage under group health insurance policies 18 another set would prohibit the use of genetic information by insurers in making enrollment determinations and setting insurance premiums19 state policy makers have been more proactive in pursuing policies to increase the availability and affordability of private health insurance for example both massachusetts and

system21 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 both government and the market have important roles in helping ensure the availability affordability and adequacy of private health insurance the market excels in creating new products and adapting to changing demand but is not set up to guarantee that everyone gets coverage government complements the market through tax and regulatory policies aimed at improving access to coverage and the adequacy of benefits ideally these policies would reflect widely held social values but setting priorities is difficult should the priority be affordability and if so for whom for consumers and employers purchasing insurance for taxpayers who subsidize coverage or should the priority be facilitating access to benefits again for whom for workers for people with lower income for people who are older sick or disabled or for everyone policymakers face challenge in improving access to health insurance while making efficient use of limited public resources and avoiding unnecessary regulations that might hinder market innovation g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
