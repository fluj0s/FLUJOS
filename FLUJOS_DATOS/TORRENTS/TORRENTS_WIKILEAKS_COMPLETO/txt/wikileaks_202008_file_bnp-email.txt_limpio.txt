by the enemies of our country to disrupt our growth has failed new members are joining faster than ever as result of the publicity following the publication of our stolen membership list show the enemy what you think of their pathetic and disgusting attempt to intimidate us contribute now towards the eastern regions european election campaign send cheques payable to british national party to po box 287 waltham cross herts en8 8zu the following is message from party chairman nick griffin on the membership list leak number of members have expressed concern over the leak of an old bnp membership list onto several neonazi crank internet forums the list is essentially genuine but has been slightly modified presumably in an attempt to cause further mischief it appears that number of individuals who were not at the time or who are not and never have been members of the party have been added the vast majority of names and addresses on it arehowever from the november 2007 membership and skills list sent to kenny smith in his capacity at the time as head of admin this is the same list that was used to send via snail mail the bogus british nationalist membersbulletins last december and january detailed analysis by tina wingfield in our membership department proves conclusively that the core list dates from between 30th november and 2nd december 2007 and that the genuine detailson it are identical to the list sent to smith as was routinely done at the end of the month for the next months bn mailing the confused neonazi crank sharon ebanks phoned bnp elections officer eddy butler late last night to gloat and to claim that the list first surfaced as an anonymous comment on her blog and was then taken from there by persons unknown and put on to separate blog the police will shortly be investigating the possibility that she was responsible for both postings we are certainly not fooled by her pitiful attempts to put the blame on john walker who she hates on account of his having very properly refused to give her bnp money to pay parts of legal bill that had already been paid and who at stage in his entire time in the party has ever had access to the combined membershipskills list we have already sent formal demands to the web hosts to remove the listpointing out to them that the fact that the publication of this yearold list constitutes contempt of court because court order preventing its release or use was made and consented to by the group of disgraced former employees who first misappropriated it the web hosts legal departmenthas already acknowledged receipt of our detailed analysis and demands solicitor has been asked to consider the implications of this for the final stages of that legal action which is still not concluded and we will be taking advice as to what can be done by way of enforcement of the contempt of court order one good thing here is that even former doubters will now be able to see that we were absolutely right to take court action regardless of the potential cost in order to try to secure our members right to privacy while we regret that this has now failed we did at least try and we have since radically changed procedures to avoid repeat of this problem in the future as well as getting rid of the staff members behind this disgraceful act of treachery we have also already made complaint to dyfedpowys police and will be giving formal statements shortly to support our demand for serious and thorough police investigation into series of very serious potential crimes including breaches of the data protection act theft and receipt of stolen goods and breaches of the human rights act unless those involved have been extremely careful to cover their tracks they are liable to find themselves in very serious trouble and in prison although it is not normally our practice to either confirm or deny whether any individual is member in the case of any of those whose names have apparently been maliciously added to this list suffering any problems as result we will gladly confirm their nonmembership status genuine members who are concerned over possible problems that could arise may like to note that even the leftist bigots of the general teaching council accepted openly at adam walkers disciplinary hearing yesterday that he had every right to be teacher and member of the british national party the fire service has already accepted the same point while the gtcs use of technical infringement of rule that adam hadnever been told about is obviously motivated by political malice the fact remains that police officers and prison warders are the only people whose jobs involve specific and probably illegal ban on them being members and candidates as long as they do not bring their politics into the workplace the recent equality act makes it clear that discrimination against an individual on political grounds constitutes breach of contractual employment law in the highly unlikely event of any individual one of our many thousands of members being exposed to their employers and suffering discrimination as result substantial compensation payout will be on the cards we would recommend very strongly that anyone who believes this might become as issue for them joins the independent nationalist trade union solidarity straight away while leftist unions will turn their backs on or even demand the persecution of bnp members solidarity has already built up great record of fighting and winning cases for its members the time when our opponents could bully our people with impunity are now overregrettably and thanks to the treachery of the now long dissipated searchlightlinked smithblakegraham rebel faction the entire list has not only already been bombarded with liefilled antibnp propaganda but it has also without doubt been available to the farleft for the best part of year already fortunately however the laws brought in to prevent animal rights extremists from harassing their opponents also serve as huge deterrent to the use of such information to harass our members it is to be expected that the press will trawl the list for nationwide version of the story which broke in the guardian when their undercover journalist ian cobain provided them with details of bnp members in london back in december 2006 at the time this led to huge fuss not only about lead english ballet dancer simone clarke but also member of staff at buckingham palace medical practitioners city highflyers and other figures of note once all the fuss had died down not one of them had lost their job or suffered any other problem other than the worry to which they were unfairly subjected the story did however greatly aid our credibility and helped to break down the older image of the bnp as party mainly for the northern working class in the end all such attempts to bully and intimidate our people blow up in the faces of our opponents you can reassure any members who do come to you to express concern that this time wont be any different seasoned observers and switchedon members will recognise clear pattern every december theres big push to try to put people off the huge spikeof members who are due to renew at the end of one year and the beginning of the next two years ago it was the guardian infiltration leak which blew upin their faces exactly year ago six months before the gla electionthere was desperate attempt to destabilise the party and to hit our election warchest by frightening people away it failed and we made the big london assembly breakthrough and this december just six months before the proportional representation european parliamentary elections give us the chance for gigantic leap into the mainstream bigtime we get another leak intended to frighten the fainthearted it was absolutely obvious that the sensational bnp byelection victory in boston at the end of last week would spark desperate reaction from the establishment and their plausibly deniablefarleft allies we effectively hoovered up the entire ukip vote in that contest in the area where they got their best result in the entire country in the last european elections this latest attack is not really directed against our own people who are already toughminded and know that nothing ever comes of this sort of bluster so much as against the thousands of ukipers who are thinking of joining us it probably will frighten some of them but its water off aducks back to the stouthearts of the british national party lets enjoy the publicity bonus
