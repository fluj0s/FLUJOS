government and finance division june 23 2008 abstract recently the critics have urged that the multiple policy goals of the federal reserve fed be replaced by single goal of price stability critics believe that central bankers tend to use their discretionary powers to achieve political as well as economic objectives notably to create good times through monetary expansion since these good times do not last long such policy imparts costly inﬂationary bias to an economy and hence is not economically optimal over time among other virtues it is argued that single goal would provide an explicit

american model of central banking for featuring multiple policy goals discretion on the part of the central bankers as to which goal to emphasize freedom in the choice of instruments to achieve the policy goals and rather vague accountability for policy failures if indeed these can even be identified recently the critics have urged that the multiple policy goals of the federal reserve fed be replaced by single goal of price stability critics believe that central bankers tend to use their discretionary powers to achieve political as well as economic objectives notably to create good times through monetary expansion since these good times do not last long such policy imparts costly inflationary bias to an economy and hence is not economically optimal over time among other virtues it is argued that single goal would provide an explicit anchor for the american monetary system the current model has strong support as well since an economy faces many unforeseen contingencies supporters argue that giving central bankers multiple goals and high degree of discretion is optimal they question whether price stability goal would be flexible enough to allow the fed to remain the lender of last resort to the us financial system and to cope with short run stabilization problems that beset the country at times they note that the fed has successfully delivered price stability for over two decades under the current multigoal regime both proponents and opponents of price stability goal are supported by an array of economic theories and empirical studies to formally replace the current multigoal mandate of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates with single goal of price stability would require legislation members from both parties have introduced such legislation in past congresses but fed chairman ben bernanke longtime advocate of inflation targeting has argued that the fed could independently adopt an inflation target without changing the multigoal mandate number of countries have recently made price stability the sole goal of their monetary policy in practice these countries have not focused their monetary policy solely on price stability but have responded to changes in output as long as it did not undermine longterm price stability this arrangement has been coined constrained discretion the price stability goal while simple and straightforward raises number of technical questions about definition in terms of goal of inflation or constant prices whether point or band target should be used and the appropriate price index to measure price stability the goal may also place constraints on fiscal debt management and exchange rate policiespolicies not delegated to the fed accountability should be greater than under the current regime but the degree of accountability depends on how the goal is defined since it is infeasible to expect the central bank to keep inflation right on target at all times consideration should be given to the exceptions granted to the goal and the permissible time interval over which the targets must be met but these exceptions in turn make accountability more difficult this report will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9816g21g145g152g158g149g141 g561g157g145g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g20g142g156g142g155g159g142g561g3g141g152g153g157g561g138g151g561g11

inflation served to motivate public policy in number of countries major impetus of these initiatives was to focus central banks on one major policy goal the achievement of price stability in some cases this has taken the form of legislation specifying this goal to the exclusion of all othe rs in other cases the central bank was granted greater autonomy in the expectation that this would lead to the desired outcome during recent years canada the united kingdom new zealand sweden australia and israel among others have adopted inflation targeting as the major go of monetary policy and since the european central banks inception price stability has been its main objective these developments have not gone unnoticed in the united states the ultimate objectives of federal reserve fed policy are currently specified in the federal reserve reform act of 1977 as maintaining the long run growth of monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economys long run potential production so as to promote the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates1 both democratic and republican members of congress have introduced legislation that would replace the current multigoal mandate of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates with single goal to maintain stable prices in some proposals stable prices is defined as low inflation rate in othe rs the overall price level would remain constant an early example of democratic efforts along these lines was the zero inflation resolution introduced by representative stephen neal of north carolina in 1989 in the 109th congress representative jim saxton republ ican of new jersey introduced the price stability act of 2005 hr 498 to mandate price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy two bills were introduced in the 110 th congress the first the price stability and inflation targeting act of 2008 hr 6042 was introduced by representative jim saxton republican of new jersey the second hr 6053 the price stability act of 2008 was introduced by representative paul ryan republican of wisconsin both would commit the fed to inflation targeting t able 1

made by crs the federal reserve takes official position on inflation targeting governors and regional bank presidents of the federal reserve are perceived to have mixed views on making inflation the sole goal of monetary policy with recently retired chairman alan greenspan perceived to be opposed to congressionally mandated inflation target2 his successor ben bernanke is long time advocate of inflation targeting3 william j mcdonough former president of the new york federal reserve bank said it is often said that there is worldwide commu nity of central bankers i certainly feel that way central bankers in all countries share number of concerns perhaps the most important of these is the desire for price stability while central bankers may differ in the way they seek price stabilitydifferences grounded in our respective histories customs and institutionsthe goal we all strive for is less important 4 although the purpose of this proposal is straightfo rward it raises many technical issues that this report will consider as preface to this discussion the report will begin with pro and cases given by economists who either favor or oppose the legislation focusing the federal reserve on an exclusive goal of achieving price stability 2 vivien lou chen feds debate on inflation targets may shape postgreenspan era bloomberg news march 22 2005 3 see for example ben s

of refocusing the federal reserve on price stability goal is to increase the amount of real goods and services available to the nation not as the late professor james tobin reminded us because price or inflation stability is an ultimate social good5 thus it must be shown that inflation has pernicious effect on economic growth the efficiency with which the economy works the choices available to americans to satisfy their needs and wants or on employment such case can be made 6 but should price stability be the sole goal of monetary policy proponents make that case based on five powerful strands of economic theory and empiricism as well as one political argument g507g343g508g561g22g145g142g561g16g142g158g157g155g138g149g146g157g162g561g152g143g561g15g152g151g142g162g561 the basic case made by economists for refocusing the federal reserve is built on very old economic doctrine known as the neutrality of mone this is the view that the influence of money and changes in the money supply are neutral with respect to changes in the real economy where economic growth employment real interest rates and relative prices are determined these depend on such factors as the choices individuals make between leisure and work the technical means by which labor and capital are combined and the savinginvestment decisions by economic agents money on the other hand influences only money things such as the price level money wages the money value of output and the nominal or market rate of interest since this is moneys primary economic effect and changing price level can have harmful effects on an economy the doctrine of the neutrality of money can serve as powerful rationale for focusing monetary policy on achieving price stability 7 8

changes in the money supply can affect the pace of economic activity and prices with lag that is both long and of variable length ie given change in the rate at which the money supply grows does not always affect the pace of economic activity and prices within the same length of time this may be due to changes in the underlying structure of the economy as well as to 5 prof tobins full quote is as jacob marschak gently reminded henry wallich in memorable yale seminar years ago prices are not in anybodys utility function price or in flation stability is not an ultimate social good but must be justified as an instrument that will deliver more utilityladen goodies to the society see james tobin panel discussion in j c fuhrer ed goals guidelines and constraints facing monetary policymakers federal reserve bank of boston june 1994 pp 232236 6 the case is made in crs report rl30344 inflation causes costs and current status by marc labonte and gail makinen 7 the neutrality of money was viewed by early economists and some of their later followers as long run proposition in the shorter run variations in the growth rate of the money supply could affect the growth rate of real output and employment 8 the classic work exploring moneys effect on the economy is milton friedman and anna schwartz monetary history of the united states 18671960 princeton university press 1963 see also

g346g561changes in policy regimes as might be expected to occur when country moves from system of fixed to system of flexible exchange rates because of the long and variable lag of monetary policy changes in policy undertaken today can have their effect on the economy after the underlying cause of the original disturbance may already have corrected itself if so countercyclical monetary policy could be destabilizing for that reason some economists argued against using monetary policy to promote such goals as full employment rather they argued it should be geared to producing stable prices since moneys lasting effect on the economy is on nominal magnitudes g507g345g508g561g20g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g7g161g153g142g140g157g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 third there were developments in specifying how economic agents formed their expectations expectations especially of inflation are important in many forward looking pricesetting activities in market economies such as wages the prices of individual goods and services and interest rates the revolution in this area occu rred with the introduction of socalled theory of rational expectations rational expectations is the theory that economic agents make use of all relevant information including information about monetary policy in formulating their expectations about the future wage earners for example would strike wage bargain with an employer only after considering what monetary conditions would likely prevail over the period of the employment contract 9 rational expectations do not mean that individuals are always right it only means that they do not make systematic mistakes this method of forming expectations has powerful implication it implies that systematic monetary policy or that expected by economic agents can have effect on the real sector of the economy since it would have been anticipated by economic agents and become part of their market behavior thus systematic monetary policy is also neutral in the short run as well as in the more general case of long run neutrality if monetary policy does affect the pace of economic activity in the short run it must be because it comes as surpriseit is unanticipated and nonsystematic its nonneutral effects will last only until economic agents incorporate it into their wage price and interest rate decisions this leads to the socalled misperceptions theory of business cycles the question might arise why the federal reserve would want to spring monetary surprises on the economy major reason given in the literature is that it yields to political pressures to boost economic activitycreate good timesprior to presidential elections this notion of political business cycle enjoys some support among economists it should also be noted that surprise based monetary policy is not an optimal policy since ultimately the cost of avoiding inflation reduces welfare and output is higher than it would have been in the absence of the surprise 9 while this may seem to the reader as the natural thing for individuals to do in empirical approaches to expectation formation economists often reasoned that economic agents would merely extrapolate the past in forming notions about the future thus expectations about the future rate of inflation were taken to be some weighted average of past inflation in this formulation economic agents would

as the time inconsistency problem the notion of rational expectations supports focusi ng federal reserve policy on the single goal of price stability this is because according to rational expectations the only way the federal reserve can alter employment is by engineering surprise surprise changes in monetary policy can at best have only short run effect on em ployment the longer run effect is only on the inflation rate and inflation has harmful side effects on the economy

economic agents as cause of business cycles if errors of predictability and errors of understanding are an important part of misperceptions then making monetary policy more predictable consistent and understandable should reduce errors and misperceptions furthermore this theory suggests that over time surprises will become less and less effective at stimulating the economy until they ultimately become counterproductive conversely the theory ggests that monetary policy changes such as disinflations could be faster and less costly if credibility were greater it is thought that under credible central bank individuals might change their inflationary expectations more quickly making the economy more flexible as result thus monetary policy based on precommitment and credibility should be conducive to economic stability single goal such as price stability it is argued can increase the clarity and understandability of monetary policy by anchoring expectations and thus contribute to this

the 1960s there was broad consensus in macroeconomics that relationship existed between inflation and unemployment known as the phillips curve this theory posited that rise in inflation would lead to predictable fall in unemployment and vice versa11 there was as shown in figure 1 considerable empirical support for this notion in the late 1960s two economists professors edmund phelps of columbia university and milton friedman of the university of chicago independently rejected the phillips curve framework and in its place put forth the notion of the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment or nairu as definition of the unemployment rate consistent with the full employment of labor12 13 this refers to an unemployment rate consistent with stable rate of inflation in the long run the economy will return to the nairu with any inflation rate be it zero or any positive number and so there is permanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment phelps and friedman suggested that the empirical finding shown in figure 1 occurred because individuals during the 1960s had not anticipated the inflation that had occurred because they based their expectations upon the 1950s when inflation was low once they built into their expectations the inflation that had occurred both phelps and friedman wrote before the rational expectations revolution phelps and friedman predicted the stability of the phillips curve would vanish the curve would shift up and to the right the only way monetary policy could then keep the unemployment rate below the natural rate would be to engineer continual surpriseskeep accelerating the inflation rate the contribution of phelps and friedman was important and prescient what these economists predicted seemed to come to pass as the data plotted in figure 2 show the tradeoff that is apparent in figure 1 vanishes after the 1960s the large amount of dispersion in the data suggests that there is stable tradeoff between the two variables if anything the relationship becomes positiveas the unemployment rate fell so did the inflation rate the nairu cannot be influenced by monetary policy because it is determined in the real sector of the economy by such things as the workleisure choices of individuals thus the function of monetary policy it is argued should be to keep aggregate demand growing at rate consistent with price stability 14 if aggregate demand grows at rate consistent with price stability then the 11 it should be noted that long run tradeoff of unemployment for inflation violates the neutrality of money for it suggests that inflation monetary phenomenon can have permanent effect on employment phenomenon that according to the neutrality doctrine is determined exclusively in the real sector of the economy note the notion of the nairu discussed below is embodied in the concept of the neutrality of money 12 see edmund phelps phillips curves expectations of inflation and optimal inflation over time economica ns vol 135 1967 pp 254281 and milton friedman the role of monetary policy american economic review vol 58 march 1968 pp 117 13 economists have always been both uneasy about and somewhat vague in defining what is meant by full employment clearly it has never meant zero unemployment rate for some economists who believed in permanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment full employment had at best an ambiguous definition other economists were content with accepting an arbitrary rate of 4 such as em bodied in the humphreyhawkins act also known as the full employment and balanced growth act of 1978 14 this however does not by itself support monetary policy geared to producing zero rate of inflation since the economy can be at its nairu at any constant rate of change of prices other factors such as the losses to an economy from positive rate of inflation must be invoked to support monetary policy committed to price stability httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9816g21g145g152g158g149g141

little effort is exerted in the reports to explain why when the effort is made the explanation frequently attributes it to unexpected events federal reserve policy is seldom if ever the culprit formal

proponents of single pricestability goal base their case on several basic tenets of economic theory first money is neutral in the long run meaning it cannot affect real economic activity it can only affect inflation which in excess is harmful to the efficient market allocation of resources this makes price stability the natural goal of monetary policy in their eyes second unemployment tends to natural rate which is dictated by labor market conditions and policies since monetary policy cannot affect this natural rate of unemployment the federal reserve cannot be held responsible for achieving goal of full employment third people have rational expectations and cannot be systematically fooled by monetary surprises this implies that the economy will function most smoothly if monetary policy is given predictable anchor such as price stability so people can make decisions with some degree of certainty about the future path of policy it is claimed that this anchor will make the fed more accountable for its actions and will make its decisions more credible which in turn will make policy more transparent and effective for some proponents pricestability goal is desirable because they believe discretionary monetary policy has done more to destabilize than stabilize the business cycle in the past they 17 the federal reserve now prepares and publishes forecasts on

and variable lags in policy effectiveness that make successful discretionary policy unlikely other proponents acknowledge that the responsible application of monetary policy is helpful in the reduction of economic instability but would not see responsible stabilization policy as inimical to price stability goal in most cases they would be likely to agree with bernanke and mishkins

g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 it is perhaps best to begin the case against single goal for the federal reserve with the proposition that while the current monetary system does not have an explicit anchor such as would be provided by fixed exchange rate or legislated inflation target it does have an implicit anchor the federal reserve has been extremely reluctant over the past two decades to let the us inflation rate rise above 4 without intervention rates above 4 seem to bring on monetary tightening of the type that often leads to cyclical downturn thus in practice the adoption of an inflation target cannot be supported on the grounds that the fed has neglected to pursue the goal of price stability the burden of proof should be on proponents to show that the feds past performance could have been improvedor there is reason to believe that future performance could be improvedif price stability regime had been in place the case against an exclusive price stability goal can be subdivided into six parts 19

most economists believe in the neutrality of money as long run proposition some also agree that for all practical purposes over any reasonable time horizon money is not neutral changes in the growth rate of the supply of money can over such time horizon according to this view have significant and lasting effects on the growth of real output and employment this perspective was well stated by prof richard n cooper the strong and sometimes helpful working hypothesis of the economics profession is that in the medium to long run money supplies affect only price levels not the real side of economies so that central bank action can only influence prices in the long run this working hypothesis through repetition and use has come to be accepted as fact as structural characteristic of actual economies it is dangerous assumption largely because it is rarely questioned the evidence is ample that it is false in the short run that runs for several years the best that can be said about the empirical evidence ov er longer periods is that with sufficient imagination by the estimators the hypothesis cannot be rejecteda very weak test on which to base important policy decisions 20 19 as will be explained below these six parts of the case ag ainst price stability focus are not mutually exclusive for example an opponent of the view that money is neutral could hardly believe in nairu 20

curve does exist over reasonable time periods and ought to be exploited for they argue that the costs to an economy from unemployment far exceed the costs due to inflation for the rates of inflation experienced by the united states in the post world war ii period21 from the above this can be seen as an assault on views such as those that business cycles are due to misperceptions of the actual course taken by inflation and on the concept of the nairu other economists question outright the practical significance of rational expectations they point out that there is really little evidence that american business cycles are due to misperceptions of inflation see 3 rational expectations section above and there is equally little evidence to support the view that the federal reserve somehow yi elds to political pressure to create booming economic conditions just before presidential elections the socalled political business cycle or that the federal reserve engages in policies that are time inconsistent 22 former presidents such as gerald ford jimmy carter and george hw bush might agree since they did not have the best of economic conditions when they faced reelection there is something quite fundamental in this criticism that should not be overlooked the proponents of refocusing the federal reserve on single goal of price stability do so because of their view that the continuation of inflation is due largely if not entirely to the selfinterested shortterm focus of politicians aided and abetted by the discretionary choices made at the federal reserve this criticism is aimed both at this explanation for inflation and its goal for reform the conduct of monetary policy to achieve single goal

2007 is at varian ce with the widely he ld view that for the united states nairu is about 60 if this estimate is correct the united states should have experienced rising rate of inflation since the unemployment rate has been below 60 since august 1994 except for december 2002 and the period april through october 2003 but the inflation rate followed trend during those years fluctuating between 16 and 3423 these critics are also likely to claim that monetary and fiscal policy may in fact influence the long run unemployment rate contrary to the assertions of the neutrality of money and the nairu they argue that the future employability of people is in part determined by their experience with unemployment thus severe short term downturns may affect the longer term unemployment rates of some countries 24 continued monetary policymakers federal reserve bank of boston june 1994 p 192 21 for statement of this view see james tobin inflation and unemployment american economic review vol 62 1

the gdp accounts fluctuated between 12 and 23 during that period 24 as noted above those who believe in nairu recognize that it is subject to shifts over time as conditions in labor markets change these shifts however are supposed to be independent of changes in monetary policy there is major development in some of the european countries that the critics of nairu cite as evidence against the

explain the data patterns observed in figure 2 an oil price shock or supply shock in general will cause both unemployment and the rate of inflation to rise25 thus some of the observations can be explained in this way others can be explained by the efforts of the federal reserve to reduce the unemployment caused by the supply shock which should reduce unemployment while accelerating the ongoing inflation rate g507g345g508g561g14g152g151g144g561g138g151g141g561g24g138g155g146g138g139g149g142g561g14g138g144g156g561g507g3g144g138g146g151g508g561 as it happens one of the arguments used in favor of price stability goal can also be used against it the technical difficulties in implementing monetary policy may be as problematic for price stability goal as for countercyclical policy the federal reserve does not directly control the price level rather it controls only the monetary and credit conditions of the country that influence changes in aggregate demand and it is the interaction of changes in demand with changes in supply that affect the price level and the rate of inflation to the extent that monetary policy operates with lags that are long and of variable length maintaining price stability can be difficult task were shock to the economy to move inflation away from the target policy lags would prevent the fed from returning inflation to the target immediately as explained below the lack of direct control is not fatal problem much would depend on how law would be written that is how price stability is defined and the time horizon over which stability is to be achieved it may be that the lags pose fundamental problem another possible way to deal with the difficulties posed by the long and variable lags is to use system of intermediate targets such as the monetary aggregates intermediate targets can provide much useful information about the thrust of federal reserve policy since they are the link between federal reserve action and the ultimate goals of policy in the case of the monetary aggregates however the value of the information they provide about federal reserve intentions has decreased considerably since the 1980s 26 nevertheless the case for using an intermediate target and what is required to make it work is well stated by bernanke and mishkin if credibility building is an important objective of the central bank and if there exists an intermediate target variablesuch as monetary aggregatethat is well controlled by the central bank observed and understood by the public and the financial markets and strongly continued 1950s to perhaps in excess of 80 in the 1990s they do not have an adequate explanation why this has happened but some economists hold out the possibility that it may be related in part to the longer run

financial system mit press 1995 pp 6071 see also symposium entitled the natural rate of unemployment in the journal of economic perspectives vol 11 1 winter 1997 pp 3108 25 each shock is likely to generate onetime effect on the price level since inflation is customarily defined as continuous rise in the price level there is dispute as to whether onetime adjustments to the price level are

economic systems are subject to variety of shocks some of which require changes in real magnitudes as the system returns to equilibrium supply shocks can pose particularly serious problems when they involve reduction in aggregate supply such as the opec cutoff of oil supplies in 1973 they often require fall in real wages in order to restore full employment because of the pervasiveness of contractual arrangements in the us market economy it is argued that the fall in real wages can be accomplished with less loss of output and increase in unemployment if the federal reserve allows the price level to rise rather than force an increase in unemployment to bring about fall in money wages in this case little inflation is thought to ease the return to full employment 28 for example akerlof dickenson and perry derive model based on the assumption of some downward nominal wa ge rigidity and show with us data that below certain inflation rate permanent tradeoff exists with unemployment29 in this paper nominal wage rigidity holds even though expect ations are assumed rational of course an inflation target could avoid this problem if the numerical target were set high

reserve policy point out that central bank has number of responsibilities that are not necessarily encompassed in price stability goal even if it were to give up its countercyclical role in particular central bank is responsible for the integrity and solvency of the payments system which includes its role as lender of last resort to the financial system an important reason for establishing the federal reserve was to deal with financial panics that had periodically gripped the united states 30 our central bank was to serve as lender of last resort to the financial system in time of trouble to avert serious destabilization or even collapse this important role for the federal reserve might be precluded by narrowly written law mandating single goal of price stability similarly literal and narrow interpretation of price stability goal could needlessly increase the volatility of output and 27 see ben s bernanke and federick mishkin inflation targeting op cit p 112 28 interestingly this case can also be made by those who believe in the neutrality of money the nairu and rational expectations they also realize that supply shocks often imply reductions in real wages and onetime increases in the price level may be the least cost way to accomplish this even within the confines of their model 29 the notion of downward nominal wage rigidity is popular among many economists an early statement of this proposition and the reasons for it can be found in jm keynes the general theory of employment interest and money harcourt brace and co 1936 pp 1215 see george akerlof william dickens and george perry the macroeconomics of low inflation brookings papers on economic activity vol 1 1996 pp 176 in the first section of this paper the authors provide great deal of evidence for belief in the downward rigidity of nominal wages 30 it was the financial panic of 1907 that set in motion the serious effort to reestablish central bank in the united states this was accomplished in 1913 the federal reserve failed to adequately handle the financial panic of 19291933 that brought about collapse of the us banking system in recent years fed watchers have generally applauded its efforts to deal with the failure of the continental illinois bank in chicago the mexican debt crisis of 1982 and the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 all of which it was feared could have had serious destabilizing consequences for the us financial system and economy the role of the federal reserve in dealing with the collapse of the bearsterns company in the spring of 2008 may signal more expanded commitment by it to guaranteeing the solvency of the financial system it is not yet clear what the dimensions of this will be it has not prevented fed chairman bernanke from continuing to emphasize the feds commitment to containing inflationary pressures httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9816g21g145g152g158g149g141

desirable then the goal of full employment should not be eliminated they add that most central banks that have made price stability their sole goal have continued to employ some countercyclical policy when they deem it consistent with longrun price stability thus these foreign central banks do not practice the pure price stability goal that they are mandated to follow second monetary policy is not the only policy nation has most governments have fiscal policies debt management policies and even exchange rate policies in the united states responsibility for these policies has not been delegated to the federal reserve there is doubt that goal of price stability for monetary policy can constrain these other policies it may make it impossible to achieve certain fiscal positions to intervene in the foreign exchange market should this prove necessary31 or to deal with any attempt by creditors to refuse to renew their holdings of maturing federal debt or to purchase new debt to finance an existing federal budget deficit32

continuing debate in monetary economics over whether monetary policy should be conducted by rules that limit fed decisionmaking or by allowing the fed to exercise discretion33 the debate over the desirability of refocusing the federal reserve on price stability goal is often cast in the terms of this discussion with the new goal being seen as rule critics argue that all macroeconomic contingencies cannot be spelled out in advance unforeseen circumstances can arise that cannot be accommodated within the framework of simple target for example would target have limited the feds reaction to september 1134 since targets cannot accommodate all contingencies the judgment of central bankers arguably should prevail in deciding how to conduct monetary policy indi viduals with this view likely believe that the judgment of paul v olcker and alan greenspan has produced better performing economy over the past two decades than could have been achieved if their hands had been tied by goal mandating price stability 35 critics would also argue that the empirical evidence has been unable to corroborate the prediction that more discretionary power leads to poorer economic performance and has even found the opposite to be true several studies have compared the response of the german economy and the us economy to shocks since the german central bank was presumed to inspire greater 31 the issue of permissible range of exchange rate variation becomes less relevant in system of flexible exchange rates nevertheless the federal reserve could under its current mandate intervene in the foreign exchange market should the dollar come under extreme selling pressure or should disorderly markets develop the possibility of this happening has been heightened over the years as the united states has moved from the position of an international creditor to international debtor 32 there have been historical episodes when the federal reserve has had to enter financial markets to support the price of us government securities when customers could not be found for the issues that were offered price stability goal could compromise this type of support by the federal reserve should it be required 33 see crs report rl31050 formulation of monetary policy by the federal reserve rules vs discretion by marc labonte 34 the federal reserve responded to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 by immediately flooding the financial markets with liquidity with the goal of averting possible financial panic 35 there are those who point out that under the leadership of both volcker and greenspan the federal reserve has pursued policy of low inflation httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9816g21g145g152g158g149g141

inflation germany should have experienced smaller loss in real output relative to the united states in response to given reduction in the inflation rate yet the evidence seems to suggest that the united states has experienced smaller losses36 in their previous careers as academic economists chairman bernanke and fed governor frederic mishkin have argued that in practice the price stability goal does not impose rigid rule on central bankers rather the legislation that has been enacted in foreign countries is more appropriately viewed as case of constrained discretion in which central banks are given goal but have wide latitude in determining how the goal is met the central bank in this arrangement is referred to as having operational independence bernanke and mishkin argue that inflation targeting has many of the advantages of rules and discretion with few of the drawbacks if they are correct target may not limit the fed from acting on its best judgment as much as some critics fear 37 but this then raises the question of what purpose price stability goal would serve if broad discretion is still allowed to subjugate it to other goals

proposals to make price stability the sole goal of monetary policy argue that there are other important goals that monetary policy can and should accomplish at the extreme critics argue that money is not neutral and can affect unemployment over relevant time horizons and little inflation makes adjustments easier while few economists may agree with these views today there are many who would nevertheless agree that the shortterm stabilization of the business cycle is meaningful goal of monetary policy that should not be sacrificed in the pursuit of price stability they would also argue that the feds lender of last resort function is essential for maintaining sound and stable financial system these critics believe that the economy is too complex for monetary policy to be committed to one simple goal it is impossible to foresee every contingency so discretion is necessary to allow experts to use their best judgment they might agree with certain price stability proponents that constrained discretion is the optimal form of monetary policy but they would argue that multiple goals are the best way to make certain it is achieved having presented both the case for and against

alan greenspan once said that price stability exists when inflation is not considered in household and business decisions although the utility of this definition for policy formulation can be challenged it does raise the question of whether price stability should be defined in general terms or in terms of quantified numerical target should the former be pursued legislatively some would suggest using terms of reasonable price stability congress might amend the federal reserve reform act of 1977 to require the long term growth of monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with stable prices thereby dropping goals of potential production maximum employment and moderate long term interest rates however some would argue that in practice the goal of maintaining stable prices has already dominated fed policy under paul v olcker and alan greenspan if that were the case making price stability the sole goal of monetary policy would lead to changes in policy unless numerical target was set for those preferring numerical targets discussions about the definition of price stability usually center on whether the goal should be defined in terms of keeping the value of price index stable or keeping an inflation rate stable the advantage of the former it is claimed is that economic agents would know with certainty the long r value of the price level and it would be an immense aid in planning variety of economic activities the disadvantage is that every deviation of the price level from its legislated value would have to be corrected and this it is conceded could lead to bouts of deflation and introduce great deal of volatility into the pace of economic activity and employment 40 38 the following discussion draws heavily from cae goodhart and jose vinals

g343g348g561alternatively congress could define price stability as rate of inflation and the rate could be given amount socalled point target or permissible range for example between zero and 25 the advantage claimed for this alternative is that bygones would be bygones in the sense that rates of inflation that deviated either from the point target or the permissible range would not have to be corrected in subsequent periods while this would reduce the volatility of economic activity and employment over time it would make uncertain the longer run value of the price index and this may undermine the putative beneficial effects from this legislation 41 how price stability is defined would appear to be quite crucial to any legislative effort in this area all countries that currently impose price stability goal on their central banks do so in terms of an inflation range eg canada 13 new zealand 02 rather than price level target42

these characteristics largely exclude the two price indexes that come from the series on gross domestic product because they are subject to numerous revisions this leaves the cpi which is published monthly widely reported in the news media understood by the public and not subject to revisions as presently formulated however it as well as many other prices indexes is subject to number of problems or biases which may make it poor candidate to accurately measure the true price level or the true rate of inflation in particular some economists believe the cpi overstates inflation so an inflation target of 0 as measured by the cpi might result in forcing the federal reserve to deflate the economy many economists believe this would be harmful to the goal of maintaining full employment in the presence of sticky prices 43 some have argued that the use of target that included volatile commodities such as food and energy would make monetary policy destabilizing they argue that the fed should instead target core inflation measure which excludes these commodities this argument is buttressed by the fact that energy shocks have often destabilized growth in the past and making monetary policy react to their effect on headline inflation could compound the destabilization as discussed below occasionally the core and headline rates diverge for long periods of time so focus on core could diverge from the price stability goal for example headline inflation exceeded core in five out of six years between 1999 and 2004 anothe r issue would be whether to use price index that includes imported goods or goods and services the supply of which are more vulnerable to disruptions and whose price is more sensitive to changes in the exchange rate than goods and services in general continued likely to cancel each other out over time 41 dittmar gavin and kydland demonstrate that uncertainty about the future path of prices becomes much greater if the central bank continues to

focused on the selection of point target for either price level or rate of inflation this target is specified in law with the understanding that some deviations about the point are unavoidable however the precise range of these deviations is left unspecified second approach has involved the specification in law of the permissible range or band in which the price level or rate of inflation may fluctuate such as 0 to 2 per year it is understood that such law does not impose on the central bank any obligation to keep the rate at the midpoint of the range any point within the range or band is equally good from policy perspective it is possible to view these two appr oaches in the following way point target can be thought of as the mean value of an unspecified range while fixed range or band can be thought of as specified range without mean value regardless of what approach is taken question arises about the width of the band within which prices might fluctuate if it were quite wide the public might perceive it as not very demanding and this could undermine credibility but if it were too narrow the regime could suffer credibility problems because the band might frequently be inadvertently breached 44 achieving the proper balance could be problematicestimates of how wide band would have to be for the central bank to stay within the band 95 of the time range from 3 to 14 percentage points45 at the bottom of this selection is the type of shocks likely to be faced by an economy the type of price index that should be used the lags inherent in monetary policy that hamper control and the need to maintain credibility 46 in practice the widths have been set to about 2 to 3 percentage points there is something more substantial in selecting the width of the band that is frequently absent from the discussion on the desirability of focusing central bank on single goal of price stability most economists currently hold the view that the harm inflicted on an economy from inflation comes not so much from inflation itself as from variable rate of inflation if inflation could be fixed at some moderate but constant percent per year and held there it might do little damage economic calculations on the other hand can be severely handicapped by an inflation rate that is highly variable for that reason the width of the band of permissible variations of the price level or rate of inflation becomes much more important for it constrains the possible variations in the price level or rate of inflation and thus the damage inflicted on the efficient operations of the economy 44 if inflation targeting is interpreted as targeting the forecast of future inflation it may make more sense to use point target than band in this case when the forecast of future inflation exceeded the point target monetary policy would be tightened and when it was below the target policy would eased 45 richard dennis bandwith bandlength and inflation targeting some observations reserve bank of

dollars chasing too few goods while this is true in the longer run in the short run movements in price index can be due to more than just movements in the supply of money shocks to the turnover rate of money and the supply of goods and services available to nation can have an influence on prices and the rate of inflation shocks to supply can come about through changes in such factors as domestic productivity unusual weather conditions and international flows of both trade and capital some of these shocks are random meaning that their average value over extended periods of time is zero the other shocks can be longer lasting in nature and nonrandom in character both types of shocks would bear on the width of band that would either be specified if fixed band were legislated or tolerated if point target were legislated demand shocks do not pose serious problem for single goal regime focused on price stability or for that matter multigoal regime focused on price stability and output stabilization in demand shock prices and output move together so monetary policy can be used to offset both problems at once for example after fall in consumer confidence both output and inflation would be expected to fall in this situation expansionary monetary policy would be consistent with both maintaining price stability and stabilizing output it is the supply type shocks that have been highlighted in the literature as imposing the greatest difficulty to achieving price stability objective because output and inflation move in opposite directions in supply shock supply shocks ar of several types the most commonly mentioned are the opectype oil price shocks these are often called termsoftrade shocks with singular goal of price stability an opectype shock could force the federal reserve to deflate all other prices in order to keep to the goal this would ad to rise in unemployment especially in the short run termsoftrade shocks can also occur for other reasons especially in response to international movement of capital when country is the recipient of net inflow of foreign capital its exchange rate will appreciate and the price of foreign goods will fall relative to domestic goods so that trade deficit will occur if imported goods are in the price index other things constant the index will decline under constant price level target the federal reserve could be required to inflate the value of domestic prices its policy actions could depend on the time period over which it was required to meet its goal it might be required to do the same thing to prevent negative rate of inflation ie deflation if the target were specified in terms of an inflation band another type of supply shock could occur if the united states decided to add or substitute consumptionbased tax such as v at for the current incomebased tax this is an option for the fundamental tax reform that the president has proposed in some of the countries that impose numerical price goal on their central bank such tax substitution or an increase in the v t rate is allowed as an exception to the goal the above discussion raises general issue about exceptions to the goal if too many events that cause prices to change were made exceptions to price stability goal confidence could be undermined and the directive to the central bank would be significantly diluted while some exceptions might be desirable too many might make the goal of price stability indistinguishable from current practice one way to get around the issue of exceptions is to set fairly wide range or band in which prices fluctuations are permitted or tolerated as the width of the band is httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9816g21g145g152g158g149g141

this is done with the knowledge that if the band is too wide credibility in the regime is undermined most countries have chosen not to make list of formal exceptions in the other countries exceptions are made for shocks originating in termsoftrade changes supply disruptions and changes in excise taxes and interest rates that such exceptions are allowed is testimony to the importance of supply shocks to the general ability of central banks to reach numerical targets

to answer this question one should have some appreciation for what is involved the federal reserve cannot now rely on direct and stable relationship of monetary aggregate to aggregate demand and the price level or rate of inflation because of this it manipulates short term market interest rates in an effort to shift aggregate demand and ultimately the price level and rate of inflation success requires technical expertise good models of the economy models that capture the structure of how monetary variables interact with the real economy some degree of patience and because policy operates with lag that is long and of variable length long time horizon also hampering the success of the operation is that the relevant interest rates that matter for aggregate demand are the unobservable real or inflation adjusted rates thus success in meeting goal of price stability would likely depend on the time horizon over which the goal would need to be met the technical considerations involved seem to support time horizon longer than one or two quarters among the eight countries specifying numerical price goal six specify time horizon of at least one year were numerical target selected that was significantly different from the inflation rate prevailing at the time there might also need to be transition period between the implementation of the new regime and the realization of the new target otherwise the sharp shift from the prevailing inflation rate to the targeted rate could temporarily destabilize the economy the nature of the lags inherent in monetary policy and the uncontrollable shocks to inflation and output raise the question of how literally the fed should pursue its goal under an inflation target because inflation and output do not always move in opposite directionsnotably in the case of oil shocksa singleminded concentration on stabilizing inflation over short periods of time could potentially lead to significant degree of volatility in output and unemployment arguably countries with inflation targets have interpreted the target as an intermediate goal in practice for that reason as result they try to minimize shortrun fluctuations in output because of its mediumrun effect on inflation even though this may move inflation further from its target in the short run but critics could argue that this behavior begs two questions first are the gains in accountability of an inflation target regime lost if the central bank can always claim to be aiming for the medium run and more importantly what is the purpose of claiming to have sole goal to monetary policy if in practice central banks continue to pursue an unemployment goal in the short run

corrective action is required then the goal should be smooth transition back to the target sudden and possibly large changes in monetary variables can have large and disruptive changes to output

cause extreme volatility to real income employment and financial markets alternatively the time period to reestablish the go should not be so long as to be meaningless this would undermine confidence in the new regime thus any legislation refocusing the federal reserve would be expected to pay particular attention to this issue

the adoption of single goal of price stability defined with some arithmetic precision would likely increase accountability compared to the current system where success is evaluated in subjective terms but that raises the question of what appropriate recourse should be taken if the fed were to miss its target failure to do anything would undermine public confidence in the new regime alternatively to penalize the governing board for missing legislative requirement might be selfdefeating if the failure was unavoidable the nature of unavoidable shocks to the economy argues for medium run target yet accountability is further weakened if the central bank aims to meet target only over the medium run 47 for example if the fed is mandated to target inflation one year in the future it is difficult to evaluate whether or not it is pursuing policy today that will meet the goal48 it can be punished retroactively for missing the goal today that it set last year but it can always claim that it missed its goal for reasons beyond its control and it will do better next year acknowledging the nature of unavoidable economic shocks some inflation target proponents argue that central banks should be able to change inflation targets on regular basis this would reduce accountability further since missed targets could then be revised away in the future formal accountability for meeting price stability targets varies considerably among those countries that have imposed such goal on their central bankers in few countries the central bank is required to write an open letter to the finance minister explaining why the target was missed and what measure have been taken to rectify the situation only new zealand links the tenure of the head of its central bank to achieving the inflation target in most other countries 47 price level target may result in greater accountability than an inflation target b ecause under the former policy decisions made today would be strongly influenced by whether the target was missed in the past information that is unambiguous and transparent this is in contrast to an infl ation target where policy decisions are strongly influenced by forecasts of the future which are harder for outsiders to evaluate see charles carlstrom and timothy fuerst monetary policy rules and stability inflation targeting versus pricelevel targeting federal reserve bank of clevel and economic commentary february 2002 48 lars svensson argues that if the fed made its forecasting model public over time outsiders could infer from the forecasting errors whether departures from the

important but unsettled issue it is important because if the government alone sets the target it is thought to underscore the dependent position of the central bank and it is argued may undermine central bank credibility this may be less important in country such as the united states where central bank independence is well established the joint setting of the goal is thought to enhance credibility for it would commit the government to the goal and make it more difficult to be critical of the central bank in achieving the goal in practice most countries have set the goal jointly in the united states the constitution vests monetary policy in congress congress in turn has granted the federal reserve broad operational independence but maintained responsibility for oversight and determining the goals of monetary policy if congress chose to set target for price stability it would have two general options first it could specify the target in general terms such as directing the federal reserve to achieve reasonable price stability this would allow the federal reserve discretion in implementing the law eg choosing the specific numerical inflation target of course fed implementation could be done in consultation with relevant congressional committees as is now the case in the semiannual monetary policy hearings second congress could set the target range and direct the federal reserve to achieve the goal but could an inflation target be adopted without congressional action inflation targeting and sole goal of price stability have typically been seen as going hand in hand by proponents and opponents alike as this report has stressed price stability is seen as the goal of monetary policy and inflation targeting is seen as the means for achie ving that goal indeed it is fair to say that the underlying motivation of most inflation targeting proponents was to move monetary policy away from the goal of maximum employment this is not the view of chairman bernanke however he has argued that inflation targeting is consistent with the current multigoal mandate because low inflation promotes economic efficiency 49 while this distinction may seem semantic it turns out to be highly important in the current debate because chairman bernanke has argued that if an inflation target does not require change in the mandate then the fed can adopt one independently without congressional action50 since congress gives the fed broad discretion to formulate policy as it sees fit if it wished to prevent the fed from adopting an inflation target it would probably need to do so explicitly through legislative action 49 see speech by ben bernanke at the center for economic policy studies princeton university february 24 2006 most economists would agree with his view but it does not address the main issuethat there is sometimes tradeoff between lower unemployment and lower inflation and most inflation targeting proponents argue that the tradeoff should mostly or always be made in favor of low inflation 50 the nomination of ben s bernanke of new jersey to be member and chairman of the federal reserve board of governors hearings before the

this question bears on the credibility of monetary policy focused on single price stability goal many writers on this subject have expressed the concern that if the government could override any prior decision on the target it would undermine the confidence of economic agents that price stability would remain the central goal of monetary policy for example there could be opportunistic changes in the numerical target in order to pump up the economy to meet shortterm political objectives although it is clear that credibility would be enha nced if it could be ensured that changes to prior legislation would not take place this is not possible in the american political system the possibility of change is always present that government has the power to change laws is of course the essence of democracy it may also be the essence of good economic policy g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the american model of central banking has distinctive attributes the us congress delegates to central bank its power to coin money and regulate the value thereof in doing so it specifies variety of goals that monetary policy should achieve that can be viewed as mutually inconsistent this lack of goal independence is however arguably superficial since the federal reserve has long been allowed to pick and choose the one or ones on which it will place the greatest emphasis during any given time period the federal reserve has also been given complete instrument independence in the sense that constraints are placed on the monetary powers available to it to achieve its ends the exercise of monetary policy is completely at the discretion of the federal reserve growing number of economists argue that more desirable regime would be one in which the central bank is directed to achieve single goal price stability while this regime would restrict the goal independence of the federal reserve instrument independence would continue as it is now most economists would agree that monetary policy has been highly successful in the past 25 years proponents of single price stability goal for monetary policy must contend with the time honored adage if it aint broke dont fix it while proponents are likely to agree that monetary policy has been success in the last two and lf decades they would attribute that success to the feds decision to focus singlemindedly on price stability making price stability the sole goal of monetary policy would institutionalize this success preventing any potential departure from this philosophy under future fed chairmen and insulating current policy from political pressure with the current regime of broad discretion there is always the potential for the fed to spring opportunistic monetary surprises which would lead to an inflationary bias that would create long term harm for shortterm gain furthermore they would argue that the fed pays lip service to goals that are contradictory and unattainablethereby avoiding criticismwhile focusing on only one goal this they argue further is potential threat to the credibility transparency and accountability of monetary policy in proponents ey price stability goal would lead to an improvement on all three of these fronts whereas the current multigoal regime leads to uncertainty opacity and subjectivity some proponents are motivated by desire to end discretionary policy while others view price stability goal as constrained discretion the latter believe that monetary policy can play useful role in reducing the volatility of the business cycle

g344g345g561as long as constraints are present in the form of price stability goal to prevent high inflation and monetary surprises critics would contend that price stability proponents underestimate the complexity of monetary policy and the broad and varied effects it has on the economy while most would acknowledge the salutary effects the feds pursuit of price stability has produced they would disagree that this is the only policy goal the fed can and should pursue instead they would argue that the fed has proven in the last two decades that price stabilit can go handinhand with monetary policy that minimizes the excesses of the business cycle and maintains the soundness of the financial sector if price stability goal is interpreted as precluding the fed from pursuing these other two goals then they would argue that the economy would suff er as result for example price stability goal could have limited the feds ability to ease policy in response to recent oil shocks and the attacks of september 11 it remains to be seen if the recent expansion in federal reserve activities related to the financial aftermath of bearstearns crisis will compromise its ability to maintain an inflation goal for the united states alternatively if the price stability goal is interpreted as regime of constrained discretion which still allows for the stabilization of output then critics would view the current multigoal mandate as more appropriate furthermore they would argue that the complexity of the economy means that policy must rely on expert judgment and the fed has proven in the past two decades that discretion can be pursued responsibly in conclusion the price stability goal while simple is deceptively so the long and variable lags in policy effectiveness and unpredictable nature of shocks to the economy mean that the feds control over inflation is imprecise and delayed for that reason the fed could not reasonably be expected to keep inflation on point target at all times should price stability goal be adopted this implies accountability would not be as straightforward as proponents might hope legislation can address this problem explicitly possible remedies for the problem include allowing inflation to stay within range target ing core rather than headline inflation permitting exceptions when inflation would be allowed to miss its target under predetermined circumstances and targeting forecasted rather than contemporaneous inflation but critics would argue that none of these solutions really solves the inherent complications that makes the price stability goal impractical to date congress has taken legislative action on the issue of inflation targeting or changing the current mandate but its hand may be forced in the near future fed chairman ben bernanke longtime advocate of inflation targeting has argued that the fed could independently adopt one without any change to the current mandate this is departure from the views of most proponents and opponents who see inflation targeting and changing the mandate to sole goal of price stability as going hand in hand if the fed decides to unilaterally adopt an inflation target
