of hr 5005 and the need for new human resources management system creating the right organization for homeland security is important but so is having the management tools and flexibility to create an agile 21st century workforce that can respond to the shifting threat hr 5005 grants the secretary of homeland security greater flexibility in the following areas of personnel management performance appraisal the secretary will have the flexibility to develop strategic performance management program that effectively links employee performance and accountability to the goals objectives and mission of the department ex isting laws focus on specifying minimum requirements for an employees position with consideration of its connection to mission strategic goals and objectives classification the secretary will have the flexibility to use broader approach to job classification that more effectively recognizes the strategic value of each employee the current classification is 53 years old it is obsolete it confines federal workers to 15 artificial levels or grades that longer match the needs of modern workforce or allow for quick changes of mission it defines pay too rigidly to s upport rewarding performance in meaningful way it ignores important differences across occupational lines and career paths that the department must manage pay rates and systems the department will have the flexibility it needs to attract skilled and dedicated workers with modern pay system not necessarily restricted to the rigid 15 gs general schedule pay grades annual increases in pay are most commonly automatic pay adjustments for all employ ees regardless of performance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs6 adverse actions and appeal the secretary must have the flexibility to establish system that allows employees to challe nge and appeal agency personnel actions without threatening the mission of the department the procedures for providing due pr ocess to employees subject to adverse actions are unnecessarily complex and time consuming regardless of the nature of the offense agencies must provide employees at least 30 days noti ce prior to taking any action these procedures often result in expensive and protracted litigation in both administrative and judicial forms sic the delay in reaching finality negatively impacts on an agencys ability to carry out its mission the select

government this summary describes some provisions of current law located in title 5 chapters 43 performance appraisal 51 classification 53 pay rates and systems 75 adverse actions and 77 appeals that the select committee in its report identified as being subject to adju stment during the depa rtments process of developing human resource system and that the summary characterized as lacking flexibility chapter 43 performance appraisal provision of chapter 43 section 43011 defines agency for purpose of subchapter i general provisions of the chapter as an executive agency and the government printing office but does not include the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national imagery and mapping agency the national security agency or any executive agency or unit thereof which is designated by the president and the principal function of which is th conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities or the general accounting office 5 usc 43011 emphasis supplied section 43011 grants the president aut hority to exclude an executive agency or unit thereof from coverage if the principal f unction of the agency or unit is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activitie s the version of hr 5005 that has passed the house makes chapter 43 subject to adjustment by the secretary ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs7 homeland security in regulations prescribed jointly with the director of the office of personnel management when new hum an resources management system is established if congress in later consideration of homeland security legislation were not to include chapter 43 as one that is subject to adjustment by the secretary an interesting question arises could the president nonetheless exclude the department of homeland security or any unit thereof fro m coverage under chapter 43 by exercising his existing authority in section 43011 of title 5 to exclude an agency or unit on the ground that its principal mission is to conduct foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities on the surface limiting the presidents authority to exclude agencies or entities thereof to those whose principal ssion is conducting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities w ould appear to preclude the president from excluding the department of homeland security or unit thereof the primary purpose of the department of homeland secu rity is to protect the hom eland not to conduct foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activitie s although the departments proposed intelligence analysis center is assigned the function of analyzing intelligence some of which may be foreign intelligence see for example section 201 which grants to the under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection authority to conduct analysis of information including foreign inte lligence and sections 211 and 212 of hr 5005 which establish the in telligence analysis center and designate its mission respectively nonetheless while section 43031 sets standard for agencies and units that may be excluded it seems to leave to the judgment of the president the question regarding whether the principal function of any particular agency or unit is conducting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activ ities consequently it appears that the president possibly could exclude the depar tment or unit thereof from coverage of chapter 43 on this basis and leave question of resolving the matter of the legality of such an exclusion to the courts if laws uit challenging an exclusion should be filed and the courts should grant jurisdiction to entertain such suit section 4302 of title 5 directs each agency to develop one or more performance appraisal systems which provide for pe riodic appraisal of job performance of employees encourage employee participation in establishing performance standards and use the results of performance appraisa ls as basis for training rewarding reassigning promoting reducing in grade retaining and removing employees under regulations prescribed by the office of personnel management each performance appraisal system shall provi for establishing performance standards to do such things as permit the accurate evaluation of job performance recognize and reward employees on standards of performance and critical elements of their positions and reassign reduce in grade or remove empl oyees who continue to have unacceptable performance unacceptable performance is defined as performance of an employee which fails to meet establishe d performance standards in one or more critical elements of such employ ees position 5 usc 43013 subject to certain provisions an agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance an employee whose reduction in grade orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs8 removal for unacceptable perfo rmance is proposed is entitled toa 30 days advance

extend the notice period for not more th an 30 days an agency may extend the notice period for more than 30 days only in accordance with regulations issued by the office of personnel manage ment 5 usc 4303 the decision to retain reduce in grade or remove an employee shall be made within 30 days after the expiration of the notice period decision to reduce in grade or remove an employee may be based only on those instances of unacceptable performance by the employee which occurre d during the one year evaluation period and for which there is compliance with th notice and other requirements of section 4303 id if because of performance improvement by an employee during the notice period the employee is not reduced in grade or removed and the employees performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the advance written notice any entry or other notati on of the unacceptable performance for which the action was proposed shall be removed from any agency record relating to the employee id any qualifying employee who has been reduced in grade or removed under section 4303 is entitled to appeal the acti on to the merit systems protection board under section 7701 of title 5 id the right to appeal reduction in grade or removal under this section is granted to any employee who is preference eligible see 5 usc 21083 for the defin ition of preference eligible ie certain veterans who have served in some conflicts and some of their relatives and to any employee in the competitive service it also is granted to any employee in the excepted service and to one covered by subcha pter ii of chapter 75 ie an individual in the excepted service other than preference eligible who is not serving probationary or trial period pending conversion to the competitiv service and to an individual in the excepted service who has completed two year s of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an executive ag ency other than temporary appointment limited to two years or less id section 4303 does not apply to the reduction to the grade previously held of supervisor or manager who has not comp leted the probationary period under

current continuous employment under other than temporary appointment limited to one year or less or the reduction in grade or removal of an employee in the excepted rvice who has not completed one year of current continuous employment in the same or similar positions id subchapter ii performance appraisal in the senior executive service of chapter 43 incorporates the definition of agency from section 3132a of title 5 in the subchapter that establishes the senior executive service section 3132a defineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs9 agency as an executive agency except government corpora tion and the general accounting office but does not include an agency or unit thereof excluded from coverage by the president under subsection c of this section as well as number of agencies including the federal bureau of investigation the drug enforcement administration the central intelligence ag ency and as determined by the president an executive agency or unit thereof whose principal function is the conduct of foreign intelligence or c ounterintelligence activities section 3132c of title 5 authorizes an ag ency to file an application with the office of personnel management setting forth reasons why it or unit thereof should be excluded from subchapter ii which blishes the senior executive service of chapter 31 authority for employment the office is required to review the application and stated reas ons undertake review to termine whether the agency or unit should be excluded from coverage under the subchapter and upon completing its review recommend to the president whet her the agency or unit should be excluded from coverage if the office recommends th at an agency or unit thereof should be excluded from coverage the president on written determination may exclude the agency or unit for the period determined by the president to be appropriate provision of chapter 43 section 4312 of title 5 requires each agency in accordance with standards developed by the office of personnel management to develop one or more perform ance appraisal systems for the senior executive service these systems are designed to permit the accurate evaluation of performance in any position provide for systematic appraisals of performance encourage excellence in performance and provide basis for making eligibility determinations for retention and performance awards in the senior executive service senior executive may not appeal any appraisal and rating under any performance appraisal system under section 4312 5 usc 4312 appraisals of performance in the senior executive service must be based on both individual and organizational performance taking into account such factors as improvements in efficiency pr oductivity quality of work or service cost efficiency timeliness of performance meeting affirmative action goals and achieving equal employment opportunity require ments and complying with merit system principles set forth under section 2301 of title 5 5 usc 4313 each senior executive service performance appraisal system must provide for annual summary ratings of one or more fully ccessful levels minimally satisfactory level and an unsatisfactory level any career senior executive who receives rating at any of the fully succe ssful levels may be given performance award under section 5384 of title 5 an senior executive who receives an unsatisfactory rating shall be reassigned or transferred within the senior executive service or removed from it any senior executive who receives two unsatisfactory ratings in any period of five consecutive years must be removed from the ses as must any senior executive who twice in any period of three consecutive years receives less than fully successful ratings 5 usc 4314 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs10 chapter 51 classification hr 5005s proposed new section 9701 of title 5 of the united states code permits the secretary of the department of homeland security in regula tions prescribed jointly with the office of personnel management to adjust provisions of chapte r 51 classification as noted earlier the summary issued by the select committee on homeland security asserts that this chapter is being made subject to adjustment because the secretary needs the flexibility to use broader approach to job classification that more effectively recognizes the strategic value of each employee it characterizes the current classification system as 53 years old and obsolete transforming government at 3 provision of chapter 51 section 5102 fines agency among other things as an executive agency and expressly excludes entities such as the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency and the national imagery and mapping agency from coverage unlike section 4301 the definitions section of chapter 43 relating to performance appraisal section 5102 does not grant the president authority to exclude an agency or unit thereof from coverage of chapter 51 on the ground that the principal mission is conducting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence nonetheless section 5103 states that the office of personnel management shall determine finally the applicability of section 5102 of this title to specific positions and employees except for positions in the office of the architect of the capitol it appears that if congress in later consideration of department of homeland security legislation were to make chapter 51 apply to the department opm pursuant to section 5103 would be authorized to exempt applicability of chapter 51 to specific positions and employees section 5104 prescribes the basis for grad ing grades 1 through 15 of the general schedule based on the difficulty and re sponsibility of work ranging from the simplest routine work in office busine ss or fiscal opera tionswith little or latitude for the exercise of independent judgment gs1 to work of outstanding difficulty and responsibilitywith very wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment gs15 provisions of ch apter 51 direct the office of personnel management after consulting with agencies to prepare standards for placing positions in their proper classes and grades require that each position must be placed in its appropriate class ba sed on the duties and responsibilities these provisions also state that each class must be placed in its appropriate grade based on the level of difficulty responsibility and qualificati on requirements nd mandate that each agency must place each position in its jurisdiction in its ppropriate class and grade 5 usc 51055107 some provisions of chapter 51 impos duties on the office of personnel management to do such things as blish and revise the maximum number of positions which at any one time may be classified above gs15 and establish standards and procedures in accordance with which positions may be classified above gs15 review whether agen cies are placing positions in classes and grades in conformance with or consistently with published standards and if necessary reclassify positions in the appropriate cl asses and grades 5 usc 5109 and 5110 the office also is authorized to revoke or suspend authority that had been granted tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs11 an agency to place positions in appropriate classes and grades nd place in appropriate classes and grades newly created positions and change positions from one class or grade to another when facts warrant 5 usc 5111 and 5112 chapter 53 pay rates and systems chapter 53 is another chapter of title 5 that would be subject to adjustment by the secretary of homeland security as noted earlier the summary issued by the select committee on homeland security suggests that the current federal pay system lacks the flexibility that the department will need to attract skilled and dedicated workers and that the department needs pay system not necessarily restricted to the 15 gs pay grades it also seems to object to what it characterizes as annual incr eases in pay that are most commonly automatic pay adjustments for all employees regardless of performance transforming government at 4 the proposed new section

miscellaneous provisions viii pay for the senior executive service and ix special occupational pay systems the pay comparability system is based on the policy that among other things federal pay rates

usc 5301 this system provides for annual adjustment s in pay schedules for the general schedule of onehalf percent less than the rate of change in private sector wages for given time period and locality based comparability payments unless the president determines that levels of these adjustments and payments are in appropriate because of serious economic conditions or serious economic conditions affecting the ge neral welfare pay under the general schedule excluding locality based comparability pay may not be paid in excess of level v of the executive sc hedule 121600 as of january

committee on homeland security expresses dissatisfaction with the modern pay system that is restricted to the rigid 15 gs pay grades transforming government at 4 some provisions of chapter 53

authority to make such appointments the cap of level i may not be exceeded except upon written approval of the president another example of some measure of pay flexibility in current law is pay for senior executive service positions secti on 5382 states that there shall be five or more rates of basic pay for the ses ra nging from not less than 120 of the minimum rate of basic pay for gs15 to not more th an level iv of the executive schedule and that each senior executive shall be paid at one of the rates to encourage excellence in performance by career executives performan ce awards of not less than five percent nor more than 20 percent of basic pay may be paid to them but the aggregate amount of money available to pay these awar ds is limited 5 usc 5384 while there are pay flexibilities in current law and hr 5005 if enacted in its current form would permit pay flex ibility the new section 9701d2 of title 5 as noted earlier imposes limit on the total amount of cash compensation that any department of homeland security employee would be able to receive it states in relevant part that nothing in this sec tion shall constitute aut hority2 to fix the pay for any

rate of basic pay pa yable for level i of the executive schedule 166700 as of january of 2002 premium pay provisions while the new secti on 9701 of title 5 generally would permit the secretary of the depa rtment of homeland security to adjust provisions of chapter 53 of title 5 of the united states code which prescribes rates of pay that correspond to position classificati ons some agencies scheduled for transfer to the department have been granted authority in provisions outside of title 5 to pay employees at premium rates for overtime see for example section 267 of title 19 which provides authority to pay customs officers at premium rates these pay authorities outside of title 5 would appear to continue in effect when these agencies are transferred chapter 75 adverse actions

procedures for providing due process to employees subject to adverse actions in chapter 75 and appeals in chapter 77 as unnecessarily complex and time consuming regardless of the nature of the offense

personne l provisions in lieberman substitute in an august 1 2002 letter the homeland security advisor to the president wrote that after reviewing the lieberman substitute amendment the bush administration believes that it would create cumbersome bureaucracy that would not provide the best security for america he added that if the legislation were to come to the president in its current form i would recommend veto to the president the ridge letter and accompanying materials expressed concern bout number of areas one of which rela tes to personnel flexibility the letter stated that the president believes that the department of homeland security should have modern efficient and fair personnel system that will maximize every employees ability to accomplish the mission of securing the homeland the president also believes that this system must maintain vital employee rights such as whistleblower and civil rights protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs29 s 2452 which among other things provides that the transfer of an employee of the department under this act shall not alter the terms and conditi ons of employment including compensation of any employee so transferred in section 187f fails to strike reas onable balance in the area of personnel flexib ility it contains rigid statutorily mandated and unalterable personnel system that fails to recognize the need to build department that is capable of responding to an adaptable terrorist enemy the bill would deny the secretary of homeland security the ability to integrate and modernize twentytwo different personnel systems that will be combined into the new department dditionally it would prohibit the kind of managerial innovation needed to hire and retain qualified individuals or to hold them accountable for accomplishing critical homeland security functions letter from the honorable tom ridge home land security advisor to the president to the honorable thomas daschle major ity leader of the senate aug 1 2002 the executive summary that accompanied the letter said that what the president is asking for with its critical mission the new department of homeland security must be the most modern efficient and flexible in the federal government the president wants to put the right people in the right jobs at the right payand to hold them accountable for their performance the president also wants to give the new secretary the authority to reorganize and quickly shift resources to meet new terrorist threats the president wants to empower the new department to hire the best possible empl oyees to protect america transfer percentage of the departments funds from one division to another to respond immediately to new threat information provide meritbase d pay increases to employees who do an especially good job in their posts quickly move antiterrori st personnel and resources to respond to the latest threat information hold employees accountable for their performance while retaining longstanding worker rights and protections that are embedde d in the nationals civil service lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs30 remove poor performers who because of their poor performance jeopardize americas national security reorganize and consolidate the current confusing patchwork of homeland security activities into more efficient and effective system of protecting america the senate bill lacks these critical authorities these existing authorities are currently in use in other parts of the federal government and should be applied to the new department yet the homeland security bill passed out of the senate governmental affairs committee would handcuff the secretary of homeland security by denying he or she the tools needed to build and maintain department capable of meeting the constantly changing threats of terrorism protecting the homeland is simply too important not to give the department this authority the senate bill does not provide flexibility to attract hire and reward good perfomers or to hold poor performers acountable the office of personnel management opm reports that it can sometimes take 5 months or more to hire new federal employee and 18 months to terminate federal employees who are not getting the job done current federal civil rvice rules do not allow managers to reward effec tive employees and penalize poor performers this mean s that all employees are given the same annual pay increase based on how long they have worked for the government not how effective they have been at their job ins the immigration and naturalization service currently is unable to shift border patrol agents from one region to another at moments notice so if intelligence indicates that terrorists may attempt to enter america through pa rticular border location managers are currently prevented from quickly moving agents to the vul nerable areaeven for temporary 30 day assignment under current rules if an employee is found intoxicated at his security post that employee must be given 30 day notice before he or she can behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs31 terminated and the employee is paid for his 30 day period the president is asking for less management authority than members of congress have over their staffs the rules that protect federal workers federal workers represent the very best of america and deserve strong civil service prot ections under the presidents plan employees of the new department will continue to be protected by important civil serv ice laws rules and regulations that protect them against discrimination on the basis of age disability r ace color religion sex national orig in marital status or political affiliation nd guarantee existing veterans preference and whistleblower prot ections the employees

underline in original other material that accompanied the ridge letter characterized the senate committee reported draft as follows the committee introduces narrow changes to the personnel systemsuch as slight hiring process reforms and correction to pay administration anomalies it provides that one as result of transferring to the new department can be fired or receive reduced compensation and terms and conditions of job duties cannot be altered material accompanying ridge letter at 12it identified the following problems with this drafthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31548crs32 the senate bill does not provide sufficient flexibility to attract hire and reward good performer s or to hold poor performers accountable although the co mmittees bill provides some improvements in the federal hiring proce ss it falls short of providing flexibilities necessary to hire compensate and remove employees when necessary the department is restricted in how it can use the voluntary separation incentive authority payments can be made only for substantial delayering reorganiza tion reductions in force transfer of functions or workfor ce restructuring the use of the word substantial limits the use of this authority other substantial problems in the federal pay systemlike the inability to harmonize the pay systems coming into the new department or the inability to substantially reward line employeesare not addressed in the committee reported draft id conclusion this report has discussed civil service provisions in bills to create department of homeland security hr 5005 as passe d by the house and the lieberman substitute to hr 5005 agreed to by the committee on governmental affairs and filed as an amendment in the senate the house bill authorizes the secretary of homeland security in regulations prescribed jointly with the director of the office of personnel management to establish and from time to time adjust human resources management system for some or all of the organizational units of the department of homeland security chapte rs of title 5 of the united states code which relate to performance appraisal classification pay rates and systems labormanagement and employee relations adverse actions and appeals would be eligible for adjustment authority to establish and adjust the human resources management system is scheduled to expire five years after enactment the lieberman substitute generally continues all provisions of current civil service laws for the department but alters some provisions for the entire government that relate to evaluating and appointing applicants for federal employment and compensating some employees the homeland security advisor to the president has indicated that if the lieberman substitute amendment in its cu rrent form should be presented to the president for signature he would recommend veto because among other things it does not provide the personnel flexibility th at the president believes he needs to protect the homeland against terrorist threats
