from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to santer1llnlgov subject re fwd foi request date wed nov 12 093131 2008 ben another point to discuss when you have your conference call is why dont they ask douglass for all his data it is essentially the same you can also think of all this positively they think few of us do really important work so they concentrate on what they think are the cutting edge pieces of work i have big review on paleo coming out soon in the holocene with 20 others wont be out till next year but i can say for certain that it will feature strongly on ca not too much they can request via foi but they will think of something this paper will explain where figure came from in the first ipcc report the infamous one that chris folland put together on the last 1000 yeas ca will say they found this out they had thread on it 9 months ago according to gavin i have the submission date of the article and more detail though to show we found out first cheers phil at 0357 12112008 you wrote dear tom thanks for your email regarding steven mcintyres twin requests under the freedom of information foi act regarding mcintyres request 1 monthly time series of output from any of the 47 climate models was sent by santer andor other coauthors of santer et 2008 to noaa employees between 2006 and october 2008 as i pointed out to mr mcintyre in the email i transmitted to him yesterday all of the raw gridded model and observational data used in the 2008 santer et international journal of climatology ijoc paper are freely available to mr mcintyre if mr mcintyre wishes to audit us and determine whether the conclusions reached in our paper are sound he has all the information necessary to conduct such an audit providing mr mcintyre with the quantities that i derived from the raw model data spatiallyaveraged time series of surface temperatures and synthetic microwave sounding unit msu temperatures would defeat the very purpose of an audit i note that david douglass and colleagues have already audited our calculation of synthetic msu temperatures from climate model data douglass et obtained model average trends in synthetic msu temperatures published in their 2007 ijoc paper that are virtually identical to our own mcintyres request 2 demands any correspondence concerning these monthly time series between santer andor other coauthors of santer et 2008 and noaa employees between 2006 and october 2008 i do not know how you intend to respond this second request you and three other noaa coauthors on our paper susan solomon melissa free and john lanzante probably received hundreds of emails that i sent to you in the course of our work on the ijoc paper i note that this work began in december 2007 following online publication of douglass et in the ijoc i have idea why mcintyres request for email correspondence has start date of 2006 and thus predates publication of douglass et my personal opinion is that both foi requests 1 and 2 are intrusive and unreasonable steven mcintyre provides absolutely scientific justification or explanation for such requests i believe that mcintyre is pursuing calculated strategy to divert my attention and focus away from research as the recent experiences of mike mann and phil jones have shown this request is the thin edge of wedge it will be followed by further requests for computer programs additional material and explanations etc etc quite frankly tom having spent nearly 10 months of my life addressing the serious scientific flaws in the douglass et ijoc paper i am unwilling to waste more of my time fulfilling the intrusive and frivolous requests of steven mcintyre the supreme irony is that mr mcintyre has focused his attention on our ijoc paper rather than the douglass et ijoc paper which we criticized as you know douglass et relied on seriously flawed statistical test and reached incorrect conclusions on the basis of that flawed test i believe that our community should longer tolerate the behavior of mr mcintyre and his cronies mcintyre has interest in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of climate change he has interest in rational scientific discourse he deals in the currency of threats and intimidation we should be able to conduct our scientific research without constant fear of an audit by steven mcintyre without having to weigh every word we write in every email we send to our scientific colleagues in my opinion steven mcintyre is the selfappointed joe mccarthy of climate science i am unwilling to submit to this mccarthystyle investigation of my scientific research as you know i have refused to send mcintyre the derived model data he requests since all of the primary model data necessary to replicate our results are freely available to him i will continue to refuse such data requests in the future nor will i provide mcintyre with computer programs email correspondence etc i feel very strongly about these issues we should not be coerced by the scientific equivalent of playground bully i will be consulting llnls legal affairs office in order to determine how the doe and llnl should respond to any foi requests that we receive from mcintyre i assume that such requests will be forthcoming i am copying this email to all coauthors of our 2008 ijoc paper to my immediate superior at pcmdi dave bader to anjuli bamzai at doe headquarters and to professor glenn mcgregor the editor who was in charge of our paper at ijoc id be very happy to discuss these issues with you tomorrow im sorry that the tone of this letter is so formal tom unfortunately after todays events i must assume that any email i write to you may be subject to foi requests and could ultimately appear on mcintyres climateaudit website with best personal wishes ben thomasrkarl wrote fyi jolene can you set up conference call with all the parties listed below including ben thanks original message subject foi request date mon 10 nov 2008 100200 0500 from

officer 1315 east west highway ssmc3 room 10730 silver spring maryland 20910 re freedom of information act request dear noaa foia officer this is request under the freedom of information act santer et consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends in the tropical troposphere int j climatology 2008 of which noaa employees j r lanzante s solomon m free and t r karl were coauthors reported on statistical analysis of the output of 47 runs of climate models that had been collated into monthly time series by benjamin santer and associates i request that copy of the following noaa records be provided to 1 any monthly time series of output from any of the 47 climate models sent by santer andor other coauthors of santer et 2008 to noaa employees between 2006 and october 2008 2 any correspondence concerning these monthly time series between santer andor other coauthors of santer et 2008 and noaa employees between 2006 and october 2008 the primary sources for noaa records are j r lanzante s solomon m free and t r karl in order to help to determine my status for purposes of determining the applicability of any fees you should know that i have 5 peerreviewed publications on paleoclimate that i was reviewer for wg1 that i made invited presentations in 2006 to the national research council panel on surface temperature reconstructions and two presentations to the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee in addition previous foi request was discussed by the noaa science advisory boards data archiving and access requirements working group daarwg 1http www jossucaredudaarwgmay07presentationskarl_daarwg_noaaarchivepolifyv0514pdf i believe fee waiver is appropriate since the purpose of the request is academic research the information exists in digital format and the information should be easily located by the primary sources i also include telephone number 4164693034 at which i can be contacted between 9 and 7 pm eastern daylight time if necessary to discuss any aspect of my request thank you for your consideration of this request i ask that the foi request be processed promptly as noaa failed to send response to the foi request referred to above for which dr karl apologized as follows due to miscommunication between our office and our headquarters the response was not submitted to you i deeply apologize
