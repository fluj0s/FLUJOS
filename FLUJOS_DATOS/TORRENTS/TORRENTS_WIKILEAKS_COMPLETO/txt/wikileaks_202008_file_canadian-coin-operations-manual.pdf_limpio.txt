flowers general sir frank kitson 101 introduction 1 the purpose of this chapter is firstly to define and introduce the concepts of insurgency and counterinsurgency and secondly to provide general overview for the conduct of counterinsurgency coin campaign within the wider concepts of land operations and doctrine it will provide the reader contextual understanding within which to view the details regarding insurgency and coin 2 coin campaign is conducted using the same means as any other campaign through the application of military forces fighting powerl lt is set within the continuum of operations and is executed through combination of tactical level activities and tasks however it is distinct campaign with its own philosophy and set of principles that provide guidance forthe application of fighting power and the conduct of activities 3 number of concepts are discussed within this chapter that have been drawn from b gl300001fp001 land operafions fuller discussions of those concepts as they apply across the spectrum of conflict will be found therein sectton 1 definitions 102 insurgency 1 lnsurgency is part of wider set of irregular activities and threats to secure and stable environment lrregular activity may be defined as behaviour that attempts to effect or prevent change through the illegal use or threat of violence conducted by ideologically or criminally motivated nonregular forces groups or individuals as challenge to authority2 2 this broader set of irregular activities that threaten authority and stability beyond the capabilities of normal law enforcement includes criminality disorder insurgency terrorism and irregular military forces e9 private or sectarian militias lnsurgency is distinct from other forms of threats in that it seeks desired political effect namely desired change or reordering of affairs 3 number of definitions exist for the term insurgency and although many have been developed over the years most have contained the same key elements violence or at least the threat of violence subversion intimidation of the broad population mass propaganda and political aim again it is the last element political aim that distinguishes an insurgency from other forms of conflict or threats to security and stability t fighting power is comprised of three components moral intellectual and physical combat power refers to the application of physical elements see bgl300001fp001 land operations 2 draft definition submitted to army terminology panel atp june 2007 for more detailed discussion of irregular activities see bgl300001fp001 land operations bgl323004fp003counterlnsurgency operations 4 an insurgency has been defined as follows competition involving at least one non state movement using means that include violence against an established authority to achieve political change3 ln this definition the following can be noted lnsurgency is not movement or people lt is competition struggle or conflict involving different groups of people as manifestation of war it is competition of wills b lt must include at least one nonstate movement to differentiate it from wars between states c the established authority need not necessarily be the government of the nation subject to an insurgency lt could be local authority temporary military authority or government of third party d lnsurgencies seek political change like all wars but the political nature of insurgency is so important it should be emphasized in the definition the change sought could be government collapse typically an objective of 195060s communist insurgencies or lesser objective such as selfdetermination regional autonomy or the release of political prisoners 5 because of the focus on attaining political change insurgencies are political problems and are not solely military problems they require political solutions with the military playing largely supporting role 6 the key to any insurgency is gaining at the very least an indifferent attitude if not the outright support of the population hence many insurgencies have sought to persuade through propaganda and subversion and to intimidate through violence large sectors of population in order to gain support for insurgent aims and undermine support for those countering the insurgency lnsurgents live and operate amongst the population thus those forces and agencies countering the insurgency must separate physically and morally the insurgent from the population base hostile populace will create hostile conditions for any side in an insurgency therefore gaining the support of the people is paramount to any coin campaign 7 at the basis of an insurgency will be narrative story central to this narrative is the idea that motivates the insurgents and is formalized into an ideology lt empowers the insurgents and lends them legitimacy and provides justification for their ends and means b lnsurgencies have political aims stemming from number of sources and guiding ideology regardless of their origins and ideology all insurgencies will have to some extent legitimate grievances at their root these grievances may be wide ranging and include political social or economic characteristics they will be exploited by the insurgent forces in order to gain additional support and undermine the authority and legitimacy of the official government and supporting forces thus in order to solve an insurgency and create enduring solutions to conflict in the environment coin forces must address these grievances 9 key to the eventual defeat of an insurgency is that the outbreak of an insurgency must be properly identified as such the classification or dismissal of nascent insurgency as criminal or some other movement will only fuel the insurgency through inappropriate responses justify the insurgent narrative of systemic injustice and subjugation and provide political and military leaders with the excuse to ignore the root often legitimate grievances of the insurgent movement t definition as developed by counterinsurgency study group during united states marine corps usmc joint urban warrior 2005 12 bgl323004fp003lntrod uction to counterl nsurgency operations 103 counterinsurgency 1 counterinsurgency is defined as follows ihose military paramilitary political economic psychological and civic actions taken to defeat an insurgencya 2 since an insurgency is political problem the military plays largely supporting role to other agencies and government departments in countering an insurgency as indicated in the definition wide range of agencies elements of power and capabilities in addition to the military must come together in unity of purpose to defeat an insurgency 3 coin campaign is conducted through specific philosophy and set of specific principles that guide the application of combat power lt is distinctly different from the conduct of an insurgency itself and the lines of operation within the coin campaign must counter the lines of operation of the insurgents within the guiding principles each coin campaign must be custom approach to the insurgency at hand the constant is the fact that insurgency and counterinsurgency are essentially about the battle to win and hold popular support both at home and in the theatre of operations lf the strategic focal point is public opinion in the local domestic and international arenas most initial military tactical efforts will be focused on breaking the link between the insurgent and the people this is not only physical link but the psychological linkof moralsupport theformerwill entail physical activitieswhilstthelatterwill entail influence activities that undermine and attack the insurgent ideology narrative and claims to authority and legitimacy this will include measures to address and resolve grievances that lend support and credibility to the insurgency lf the insurgent can be isolated it is then theoretically relatively simple matter to eliminate him and his cause 4 ln order to reach this point coin campaign will involve more than military engagement defeating an insurgency requires not only the neutralization of insurgent military capabilities but also the resolution of the root causes of the political and socioeconomic grievances that enabled its occurrence in the first instance therefore it requires comprehensive approach with multiple agencies and other government departments often enabled through coalition effort the mere attrition of insurgents is highly unlikely to result in the defeat of the insurgency lndeed any attempt to win an insurgency through attrition may only help fuel that insurgency only comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of an insurgency and attacks the legitimacy and authority of the insurgents will obtain an enduring solution section 2 coin campaign as part of the continuum of operations 104 general 1 campaigns and subordinate operations often require military forces to operate effectively across the spectrum of conflict conduct wide range of military activities simultaneously and transition quickly from one type of operation to another in rapidly changing operational circumstances commanders must be able to visualize how campaign or operation will likely evolve over time in light of changing circumstances nato allied administrative publication mp 6 nafo gossary of terms and definitions bgl323004fp003 13counterlnsurgency operations 105 the gontinuum of operations frameworks 1 the concept of continuum of operations identifies number of campaign themes and provides framework for commanders to understand the complexity of the operational environment and the manner in which missions contribute to lasting peace or at least to an environment in which conflict is diminished the continuum of operations consists of four aspects the spectrum of conflict b predominant operational level campaign themes including counterinsurgency c types of tactical activities offensive defensive and stability and d the simultaneous conduct of different types of tactical activities termed fullspectrum operations 106 predominant campaign themes l military operations may be described through series of predominant campaign themes plotted at appropriate and relative locations on the spectrum of conflict see figure 11 figure 1l predominant gampaign themes 2 campaign themes consist of the following major combat counterinsurgency peace support which entails range of peacekeeping and peacemaking campaigns and peacetime military engagement6 the location of these themes along the spectrum of conflict is not fixed 5 see bgl300001fp00 i land operations for fuller discussion of the continuum of operations 6 peacetime military engagement is defined as planned military activities that involve other nations and are intended to shape the security environment in peacetime note it includes programmes and

elements of different campaign themes within campaign theatre for example one region of nation may require peace support while another is enduring an insurgency 107 fullspectrum operations 1 all campaigns are conducted through the combined and simultaneous conduct of tacticallevel operations offensive defensive and stability operationst they are linked through enabling operationse each of these types of operations consists of set of tactical activities that are realized through tacticaltasks see figure 12 figure 12 the continuum of operations and fullpectrum operations 2 campaigns and

activities is termed fullspectrum operations 3 as campaigns progress efforts and resources ebb and flow between these different tactical activities and their balance reflects the nature of the

overall campaign should be conducted for example the pursuit of fleeing insurgents that will gain tactical success should not be conducted if it will break the overarching philosophy and principles of coin campaign 10 see bgl300001fp00 1 land operations bgl323004fp003 17counterlnsurgency operations 7 the conduct of campaigns should always seek to reach operational objectives and reduce the level of conflict when operating at any point along the continuum of operations commanders and staffs should consider how to prevent the escalation of violence by the adversary during peace support for example operations must be conducted with view to preventing escalation to an insurgency or to major combat force must be used discriminately because the undue application of force lethal or otherwise can undermine the overall campaign and in fact cause an escalation of conflict if secondary effects are not fully considered b recognizing changing circumstances or conditions especially ones that require change to the major theme of campaign is both an intellectual as well as an intelligence challenge this is part of the art of war the intelligence system must be attuned to and look for indications of changes in the environment and commanders and staffs must be able to interpret the key indicators that demonstrate shift is taking place commanders and staffs must then react to the changing environment either to prevent escalation of violence or facilitate shift to lower level of violence in such way that the situation is manageable by the forces at hand 9 ln situations of political instability or disaffection an insurgency may erupt lnsurgencies are complex and may have several significant factors including intra or interstate violence as well as factional violence between different insurgent groups although some models of insurgency such as the maoist model forecast progression to conventional operations insurgencies as defined above will fall short of largescale conventional operations inherent to major combat campaign 10 the military role in coin is to create security framework that precludes the ability of insurgents to undertake offensive operations the military will work in cooperation with other agencies addressing the nonmilitary aspects of the security environment in order to solve the root causes and grievances that lead to conflict and insurgency this will include many of the tactical activities grouped under stability operations thus the militarys role is one of supporting other agencies by creating manoeuvre space for them through the provision of security and protection and the neutralization of the insurgent threat lt is these other agencies that will bring the enduring political solutions to an insurgency 18 bgl323004fp003lntroduction to counterlnsurgency operations elements of different campaign themes may occur within the same theatre of operations ln 1967 the us marine corps was simultaneously conducting conventional and counterinsurgency specific operations in i corps the usmc area of operations while fighting conventional war against elements of the north vietnamese army nva along the laotian and north vietnamese borders the marines were concomitantly trying to support the combined action program cap that had been slowly but successfully combating the influence of viet cong vc insurgents the cap embedded marine rifle sections with south vietnamese militia to live and operate in hamlets and villages throughout i corps which in effect implemented form of lyauteys tache dhuile method of coin despite the small size of the cap at the time approximately 1 200 marines and 2100 vietnamese militia the manpower demands of attrition wadare in the border regions hindered an

specifically created and implemented stratagem that sought to draw the bulk of us forces to the peripheral areas of south vietnam to be engaged in costly and demoralizing battles of attrition in order to create physical and psychological manoeuvre space for insurgents in population centres commanders must be aware that transition across campaign themes may occur over time and space within theatre and balance must be rirrri between competing demands and principles the main effort may shift between operational objectivei dependent upon the situation and threat at all times commanders must focus on acirieving the operational objectives that will create conditions for enduring success source michaet hennessy strategy in vietnam the marines and revolutionary warfare in i corps 19651972 westport ct praeger 1997 ppl28132 108 comprehensive operationsll 1 ln order to realize operational objectives military forces create supporting effects through the conduct of tactical activities using range of capabilities this range of capabilities and activities is classified as fires or influence activities they are enabled in simultaneous and complementary manner through manoeuvre and battlespace management and are together known as comprehensive operations see figure 14 11 for more detailed discussion on comprehensive operations and other related concepts see bgl300001 fp001 land operations bgl323004fp003 19counterlnsurgency operations figure 14 gomprehensive operations 2 the construct is defined as follows gomprehensive operations the deliberate use and orchestration of the full range of available capabilities and activities to realize desired effects b fires the physical means deliberately used to create or support the realization of physical effects as first order effects note fires include lethal and nonlethal systems they also include electronic countercontrol measures of ew lnfluence activities an activity designed to affect the character or behaviour of person or group as first order effect note lnfluence activities affect understanding perceptions and willwith the aim of affecting behaviour in desired manner 3 although wide array of activities will create influences influence activities are primarily realized through psychological operations psyops public affairs pa civilmilitary cooperation clmlc deception and the posture profile and presence of forces 4 fires and influence activities are planned in comprehensive and complementary manner for example psyops may be used to convince enemy conscripts to flee prior to an attack and cimic projects may repairdamages caused by offensive operations in orderto maintain the support of affected populaces ln accordance with the manoeuvrist approach fires although creating first order effects on the physical plane should be conducted with view to the effects on the psychological planethe resulting effects on will and cohesion likewise 110 bgl323004fp003lntrod uction to counterlnsurgency operations although influence activities may have first order effects on the psychological plane they may have subsequent effects on the physical plane for example psyops that convince conscripts to desert reduce the overall combat power of the enemy commander 5 many of the influence activities will be activities under the category of stability operations they will seek to build lasting solutions to the root causes of conflict and crisis 6 the balance that commander will strike between fires and influence activities will depend upon the type of campaign its guiding principles the situation at hand and the desired effects ln campaigns that require the support of population and the redress of grievances and civil strife large portion of capabilities will be dedicated to influence activities likely in conjunction with other agencies sectton 3 an overview of insurgencies and counterinsurgencies 109 development of an insurgency lnsurgencies are not new phenomenon for example the greek historian herodotus chronicled an insurgency by the scythians against the rule of the persian warriorking darius in 512 bc which ultimately succeeded in forcing persian withdrawal the forces of alexander the great 356323 bc and the mongols also each suffered significantly at the hands of insurgents similarly terrorism has long been used as an effective tactic an early example of this is the use of terrorism as propaganda of the deed by the assassins in persia in an effort to subvert the rule of the seljuk turks in the 1 1th and 12th centuries sources robert asprey war in the shadows the guerilla in history new york ny morrow 1994 brigd retd maurice tugwell revolutionary propaganda and possible countermeasures phd diss london kngs college 1979 with permission l at its most basic an insurgency is an uprising or insurrection against an established form of authority normally government occupying authority or social structure various situations may give rise to an insurgency and single insurgency may have several root and contributing causes ln general insurgencies spring from dissatisfaction with social structure or government policies however recent history has shown that criminal groups can foment form of insurgency by destabilizing government to create conditions favourable to the pursuit of criminal activity this occurs in number of ways including the subversion of police and security forces the control of territory and the intimidation of the populace 2 lnsurgencies develop in stages and often the government will only recognize the severity of the threat after violence has begun to occur on regular basis ldeally the government will recognize threat and act to preclude its development prior to the outbreak of widespread violence bgl323004fp003 111counterlnsurgency operations recent example of early recognition of an insurgency was the regional assistance mission solomon lslands ramsi which successfully halted growing criminal insurgency the government of the solomon lslands hampered by corruption at many levels was longer able to provide even basic services by the summer of 2003 and requested international assistance ramsi led by australia was able to successfully dislocate disrupt and disarm the major criminalgroups help reorganize the police forces and assist in the resumption of the provision of basic public services all priorto the onset of major violence source russel glenn coin in test tube analyzing the success of the regional assistance mission solomon lslands santa monica rand2007 3 lnsurgencies are method used by disaffected groups or those whose best interests are served by destabilizing the existing government by their very nature insurgents quickly become involved with other destabilizing elements within society such as criminal entities each exploits the other for their own benefits 4 each insurgency will have its own set of causes aims and desired endstate some insurgencies will stem from political social andor religious ideology that envisions an improved even utopian state of affairs other insurgencies will stem from unresolved real or perceived grievances while others will be conducted by particular group that simply wishes to gain power but cannot do so through legitimate means or conventional use of military power still others will stem from nationalist desires for independence or autonomy ln all cases insurgencies are supported by propaganda that justifies the use of subversion and violence 5 lnsurgencies are more likely to occur in states where there are inherent racial cultural religious or ideological divisions that lead to lack of national cohesion and weak inefficient unstable or unpopular governments additional factors such as corruption and external agitation may facilitate an insurgency 6 ln other words many insurgencies will develop in failed or failing states where governments have failed to address or satisfy the basic needs of their populace these needs will differ depending upon the region and culture involved but in generalwill include the basic essentials of stable life responsible government religious freedom and economic viability lt is from such fertile environments that insurgencies will often grow 7 the aim or desired endstate of the insurgency may be quite extreme such as the creation of new state or social construct others may simply seek to seize power expel foreign power or acquire specific but limited political advantages or control whatever the aim the insurgents themselves feel that their causes and aim justify the use of violence and subversion and even in some cases the use of terrorism against the civilian populace 112 bgl323004fp003lntroduction to counterl nsurgency operations history holds several examples of canadian involvement in insurgencies conducted on various scales with differing aims some examples are as follows r united empire loyalists and the american revolution 17741783 fenian raids 1866 1870 northwest rebellion 1s85 siberia 19181919 haiti 2004 afghanistan campaign b the tactics used by insurgents will vary with each campaign and situation they will certainly include violence or at the very least the threat of violence subversion and propaganda have traditionally been used to great effect lnsurgent capabilities in this regard have exponentially increased with the availability of sophisticated but inexpensive information technologies that enable the exploitation of mass media to convey their message propaganda threat and capabilities to large audience lnsurgents seek support internally and externally and they often conceal fund raising campaigns behind facades of charitable or political organizations dense urban terrain will be exploited in order to attack high value targets inflict mass casualties and hide their own presence unfortunately many insurgencies resort to the tactic of terrorism as means to realize their operational and strategic end lnsurgents will also exploit the inherent weaknesses of the society under attack particularly liberal democracies and states where religious or ideological tensions are high in order to support their operations their words and deeds will continually paint themselves as the victims of an unjust social or power structure and their actions will often seek to provoke an overreaction from government forces which will thereby support their themes and messages of persecution and victim hood 9 lnsurgencies can cross international borders lnsurgents may establish bases in sympathetic country or in states with weak governments they may also have pannational aims and therefore conduct their attacks in more than one geographic area in order to create results there or in other areas during the cold war communist expansion followed this model and some radical religiousculturalbased terrorist groups have recently undertaken similar measures 10 lnsurgencies seekto gain the supportof portion of the populace large enough to achieve their goals ln some cases this will require support by the majority in others this may only require the support of powerful portion of the populace tribe business class ethnic minority ln all cases an insurgency requires only the indifference of populace to operate to give it manoeuvre space that allows the development and expansion of an insurgency as an insurgency grows those who do not rally to the cause are intimidated into silence killed or forced to flee lnsurgencies usually gain their greatest success amongst that segment of the population that is disaffected or disadvantagedthose who have gained the least from the current social organization even if the majority of the population fails to eventually rally to the side of the insurgents the insurgents simply have to make defending the status quo too expensive or difficult for the security forces the governments concerned and the general populace an insurgency is therefore like all conflict battle of wills 110 development and conduct of goin campaign 1 operations conducted within coin campaign aim to defeat an insurgency through military paramilitary political economic psychological and civil actions an overarching demand of counterinsurgency operations is that military forces play key but supporting role in bgl323004fp003 113counterlnsurgency operations the campaign the military role is to create the security framework to permit the legal and political initiatives required for long term solution to the root causes of grievances although combat may occur the primary strategic centre of gravity is the civilian populace only by drawing the civilian population to the government side and therefore creating hostile environmentforthe insurgents can an insurgency be defeated ln otherwords the military plays but one part of coin campaign that will involve wide variety of other government and nongovernment agencies lt is these other elements of power that will bring about the enduring solutions to the situation 2 the overall effect sought in counterinsurgency is not the death or capture of insurgents but more importantly the provision of security to the population and the reduction of popular support for the insurgency through reform although the militarys role is limited the manner in which it conducts its responsibilities will influence the overall environment and success in all facets of the campaign for example heavyhanded response to insurgent activities will be exploited by the insurgents propaganda and thereby undermine the trust of the local populace in the security forces 3 government facing an insurgency in its own territory is under direct threat and can therefore be expected to bear higher risk and accept higher casualties than coalition partner assisting it 4 although not specifically designed for such commitments military forces have often been used to conduct coin campaigns this is generally due to the levelof violence offered by the insurgents and the resulting requirement for large numbers of wellarmed troops to protect high value targets the populace and government and to engage and destroy the insurgents when necessary 5 although combat may be intense at the start of coin campaign there is typically lower prevalence of combat than expected in conventional major combat campaignsl2 this combat occurs primarily at the smallunit levelie section platoon or companyalthough larger organizations may sometimes be involved the rate of resource consumption is also lower than in major combat although the campaign as whole is likely to last much longer with several years being typical thus the overall resource requirement is usually higher certainly the political and moral commitment of the government and people supporting the coin campaign in another nation must be prepared for longterm commitment 6 lnsurgencies have ambiguous startdates and coin campaigns have ambiguous end dates lt is unlikely that the conflict will be suddenly ended with major military victory against the insurgents who will rarely offer the opportunity for decisive military engagement and are typically organized into small clandestine cells although there are examples of insurgencies and counterinsurgencies that have resulted in decisive military successeseg castros cuban revolution in the former case and the defeat of the north west rebellion in the latter casethe longterm solutions still require political and economic measures ln short military forces do not defeat insurgencies instead they create the security conditions necessary for the political resolution of the conflict 7 lnsurgencies can only be effectively fought with consideration of diverse factors such as politics economics police capability social structure culture and psychology along with military t this is not hardandfast rule the maoist model envisions final phase of major conventional combat and the insurgencies in china vietnam and cuba involved significant conventional combat similarly lhe front liberation nationale fln in algeria attempted to build conventional army wlth which to challenge french conventional military superiority 114 bgl323004fp003lntroduction to counterlnsurgency operations power hence any counterinsurgency must consist of multipronged multiagency approach at the strategic operational and tactical levels the causes and symptoms such as the insurgents themselves and their popular support must be addressed through comprehensive operationsthrough combination of fires and their physical effects as well as influence activities and their psychological effects lt is the latter of these two influence activities that will create enduring solutions to coin campaign by addressing root causes b the coin campaign will be realized through thematic lines of operation that group similar operational objectives together that build to the desired endstate some lines of operation may be lead by the military as supported element other lines of operation will see the military in supporting role with most activities conducted by other agencies here the supporting role will utilize unique military capabilities such as strategic lift medical support security provision military training capabilities andor intelligence collection collation and analysis some lines of operation may be conducted by other agencies entirely within the overall security provided by police and military forces 9 the multiagency approach is termed the comprehensive approachl3 lt sees the military working in unity of purpose and ideally in unity of effort in order to create enduring solutions to the root causes of the insurgency and reach the desired operational endstate ln all cases successful coin requires this comprehensive approach facilitated through unity of purpose 10 the comprehensive approach may be illustrated by way of an example while police and military are cooperating in the search for insurgent bases and are providing security to population centres and along lines of communication international and nongovernmental aid organizations along with military support may be developing physical infrastructure in disadvantaged urban areas concomitantly the government with international support may be reforming election laws and political structures 11 conventional armies may not necessarily be routinely structured to conduct coin campaign however such campaigns are not the purview of special or elite military or military forces although they may have roles to play as well history has demonstrated that the most successful coin operations have been conducted by ingenious resourceful non doctrinaire conventional even conscript armies that have deployed with simply guiding set of principles developing their tactics as the situation became understood paramount to the success of the military portion of the campaign has been firm clearly articulated political and strategic goals and the ability of officers to exercise command with freedom flexibility and confidence down to the lowest levels using ingenuity and resourcefulness to take the battle to the insurgents on one hand whilst attempting to resolve the root causes on the other lndeed those attributes of regimental systemconfidence afforded the commander in remote situations familiarity among comrades and across ranks and reliance on small unit actions have proven most effective in coin campaignsto 12 the commitment of western democracies and alliances to the stabilization of failed or failing states and the desire to limit global effects of insurgencies in an era of weapons of mass destruction means that governments will deploy both military forces and civilian agencies together in order to address these threats to regional and global stability not only must tt for more details regarding comprehensive approach including guiding principles see bgl300001fp001 land operations 1a armies in lowlntensity conflicta comparative anatysis edited by david charters and maurice tugwell toronto brasseys defence publishers 1989 bgl323004fp003 115counterlnsurgency operations commanders understand the militarys role in coin campaign but they must be able to understand the key role played by other agencies and how all agencies work together in unity of purpose to defeat insurgencies and their causes sectron 4 contrasts and competition between insurgencies and counternsurgency campaigns15 i11 general 1 conventional wars and battles pit two relatively similar forces against one another with the winner being able to exercise political control over the other the forces involved focus on military actions in similar timeframes and use comparable capabilities and methods to attempt to dominate the other although the constituent elements of each forces fighting power may be in different balance there is certain amount of symmetry within this competition 2 this symmetry does not exist between an insurgency and counterinsurgency elements the nature of the environment aims of each force relative demands and the elements of fighting power of each forcethe moral physical and intellectualdemand that the conduct of coin campaign be distinctly different from the conduct of the insurgency itself 112 initiative 1 within an insurgency situation the initiative at all levels lies with the insurgent the insurgent will pick the moment at which to begin his campaign and at which moment to initiate the use of violence at the tactical level the insurgent will continuously be in position to accept or decline engagement and most tactical engagements will be time and place of his choosing 2 the insurgents use of propaganda and other means to influence audiencesactivities to create first order effects on the psychological planewill often take an offensive nature that will seek to undermine the credibility of the government and coin elements and increase his own legitimacy despite the lack of formal doctrine for information operations the insurgent will have honed propaganda skills and will quickly master skills in the manipulation of international media knowing what activities and engagements will occur the insurgent will have his propaganda and media messages ready for immediate implementation furthermore the eagerness of international media to be obtain inside exclusive stories will allow insurgents to control messages and present images and stories that support their narrative their grievances and representation of victim hood 3 counterinsurgent forces will often be forced into position of reaction ln realizing this leaders must understand that insurgent forces will conduct activities mostly atrocities in the hope of provoking heavy handed reaction from coin forces that will ultimately undermine their own credibility and legitimacy 4 lnsightful political and military leaders will ideally foresee the development of an insurgency before the insurgencies gain significant support andor resort to open violence ln such cases they should in addition to increasing intelligence collection and analysis initiate 15 the basis for this section has been drawn from david galula counterinsurgency warfare theory and practice westport ct praegar security lnternational2006 pp 310 116 bgl323004fp003lntroduction to counterlnsurgency operations actions that will address any legitimate grievances being exploited by the insurgent leadership and undertake measures to counter the insurgent narrative and ideology 5 attempts by government and coin forces to seize the initiative must be carefully considered the use of physical attacks must be viewed from the perspective of long term effects although physical attacks may result in shortterm tactical success against an element of the insurgent forces they may cause secondary and tertiary effects such as the death of civilians or collateral damage that hurt perhaps irreparably the longterm success of the campaign 6 lnitiative by coin forces may seek to gain considerable success in terms of information operations specifically influence activitiesl6 the ability to underlake effective psychological operations amongst the local populace the ability to quickly explain actions through public affairs means and the ability to use cimic and other resources to address grievances and other potential causes of the insurgency will seize sense of moral initiative for the coin forces and wrestle much of the initiative from the insurgent 113 focus on population 1 because of the political aims of an insurgency and the lack of material resources in comparison to the government forces the insurgent will focus on gaining support of the population he will attempt by whatever means deemed effective to dissociate and isolate the populace from the counterinsurgent and to gain its physical and moral support as minimum the insurgent will seek to break the will of the population to resist ldeally the insurgent will reach point at which he can control the population through combination of force and intimidation or the populace willingly submits to the insurgent eventually this will result in success for the insurgent for in the final equation the exercise of political power depends upon the tacit or explicit agreement of the population or at least on its submissiveness 2 the coin forces and government agencies must actively work to counter the insurgent attempts to coerce or persuade the population careful analysis must be made of the population and its culture in order to comprehend its grievances motivations and the ways in which the insurgent will target it and influence it at the very least the population must be protected from security threats but this will not be enough for enduring success the population must be persuaded to reject the insurgent narrative and ideology which lends the insurgency cred ibility and justification 3 ln addition to the populace in the theatre of operations the insurgent will attempt to undermine the support and will of the domestic populace of any nation contributing forces to the campaign such as those in coalition this will be strategic centre of gravity and must be considered in the planning by coin forces and governments 114 role of politics and political lead 1 ln conventional conflict military activities are foremost and their planning and execution focuses on effects against the military forces of the other side politics takes supporting role 15 see bgl300001fp00 1 land qperations within land operations the concept of information operations has been refined to consist of influence activities only that is those activities that seek first order effects on the psychological plane bgl323004fp003 117counterlnsurgency operations 2 the focus of insurgent and counterinsurgent actions on the populace and its support brings politics to the fore in coin campaign the military will take for the most part supporting role whilst the insurgent will be unencumbered by rules of engagement and the laws of war and will seek through any means to intimidate the populace and to exhaust its will counterinsurgents must consider all their military actions in light of the secondary political and social effects which will have the enduring influence in successful campaign 3 with the population and its support and will as centre of gravity in the campaign most actions become political thus political action becomes foremost in the campaign to the point that politics or political action is an instrument of the campaign lt must be so for only political action will address the circumstances that lead to the insurgency the military may only be required to provide security framework in which other agencies and government organizations may manoeuvre and work 115 transition to conflict and campaign duration 1 during an insurgency the transition from peace to open conflict will be gradual when compared to the sudden eruption of high levels of violence in conventional war the insurgent will generally have desire for quick transition to open levels of conflict he will wish to build up resources and to shape the environment through propaganda and other activities in order to eventually justify the use of violence he will wish to avoid an early reaction by government counterinsurgent forces that could undermine preparations additionally the insurgent will hope to gain significant strength and influence before the population realizes the true danger posed 2 once initiated an insurgency will be protracted affair lt will take time to build up forces and resources to gain support from the populace to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the counterinsurgent forces and to defeat them either militadly or through lack of support by the population additionally the lack of localized obvious target against which to apply combat power will preclude rapid defeat of the insurgents forces 3 this works to the insurgents advantage as protracted conflict will serve to wear down the will of the populace to resist and the will of the domestic populations of any forces contributing to the coin campaign the insurgent must simply continue to sow disorder and insecurity whilst the coin forces and government must fight to provide security and maintain the commitment of the populace 4 the only means to quickly end an insurgency is to come to political resolution that resolves motivating grievances and eliminates the vast majority of public support for the insurgent 116 relative costs l simply put an insurgency is cheap coin campaign is expensive lt takes little for the insurgent to sow disorder undermine the credibility of the government and attack the will of the population disorder will create insecurity and economic disruption and thus hardship for the population 2 government and coin forces have the responsibility to counter this disorder failure to do so will loose the support of the population security measures to prevent disorder are hugely expensive in terms of resources particularly manpower routes must be secured vital points protected and damaged infrastructure rebuilt this responsibility to provide security to populace creates an incredibly high ratio of forces to insurgents as many as 20 to one or 11 8 bgl323004fp003lntroduction to counterl nsurgency operations higherl7 however failure to provide security will force the populace to seek it from elsewhere perhaps the insurgents themselves 3 paradoxically security measures themselves that seek to protect the populace also tend to frustrate the populace and may inadvertently undermine their support they cost the public inconveniences and invasions of privacy thus they must be applied carefully with the aim of limiting disruption to the local populace additionally the necessity of such security measures must be carefully explained to the public and they must be reduced at the earliest opportunity ldeally they are conducted by nations regular constabulary forces where this is not possible and military forces must provide the security they should be passed to constabulary forces as the security situation improves and the latters capabilities increase 4 for counterinsurgent forces particularly those from supporting third nations the cost in manpower from deaths may have an exponential effect although the relative cost in manpower from deaths will be relatively low compared to losses typical of major combat the political costs will be high in terms of undermining nationalwill 5 the relative costs in an insurgency situation allow and encourages the insurgent to conduct protracted campaign this fact must be clearly articulated to all populations supporting the coin campaign 17 fluidity and rigidity 1 an insurgent has few if any responsibilities he may hide amongst the populace and represent himself as part of it his line of operations are therefore fluid and his capabilities and activities will ebb and flow over time lnsurgents have rules of engagement and expectations of moral limits to the application of their combat power they may use whatever means including overt propaganda to influence and intimidate populations 2 coin forces on the other have rigid limits to the conduct of operations they have onerous responsibilities to secure the populace and their infrastructure they must abide by rules of engagement and conduct activities with view to maintaining their legitimacy and the moral high ground they must carefully coordinate the activities of wide range of agencies furthermore coin forces must refrain from using any forms of propaganda and must ensure that their psyops and public affairs activities portray only truthful messages in order to maintain credibility and avoid being irrevocably discredited in the eyes of the populace 118 ideology 1 at the basis of an insurgency is narrative that contains an idea and founding cause for the insurgency this core idea becomes formalized as an ideology lt is highly motivational tool that exploits grievances culture and beliefs in order to further the insurgent aims and justify their actions 2 although the ideology and narrative may be powerful motivators for the insurgent core and for new recruits they will unlikely attract and hold the vast majority of populace who simply seek the basic requirements of security and wellbeing ln the long run it may be the side that provides the best security and standard of living that wins the support of the populace 1t there is generally an upper limit to this ratio once pervasive security is required beyond the ordinary capabilities of constabulary subsequent increases in insurgent numbers do not require an equal increase in counterinsurgent forces bgl323004fp003 l19counterlnsurgency operations 3 lt is unlikely that the counterinsurgent forces will have central ideology as rallying point however two key issues must be kept in mind regardless of the ideology touted by the insurgents coin operations must be conducted in keeping with the cultural and societal norms of the theatre population not to do so will undermine the credibility of and support for the coin forcesrs secondly the influence activities of coin forces must seek to solve legitimate grievances from which the narrative and ideology draw strength advertise those solutions and indicate and exploit inconsistencies in the ideology particularly any false attempt by the insurgents to claim moral superiority 119 enduring irregular nature of the insurgency lnsurgencies can in the end only be quelled with political solution lahcen daoudi the leader of moderate lslamist north african political party noted that if you let cat into the house you can caress it lf you leave it in the mountains it becomes savage ln essence this articulates that if the host nation political leadership engages in some political dialogue with potential or existing insurgent elements there is reasonable chance that the legitimate grievances underlying the insurgent cause can be addressed in nonviolent manner and progress made towards an enduring solution moderate lslamist pjd party poised to win parliamentary control the globe and mail 19 may 2007 p a18 1 throughout the life of an insurgency the insurgent will likely remain unconventional even if the insurgent comes to the point of mustering regular formations he will continue to exploit his flexibility of population support guerrilla tactics and lack of rules of engagement he will not surrender this advantage 2 coin forces for their part must avoid becoming frustrated by the irregular nature of insurgent forces lndeed the insurgent will seek to exploit such frustration in order to cause the coin forces to overreact and create undesired effects amongst populace 3 the only true means of turning an insurgent into conventional force is to engage the insurgent and bring him into the conventional political process 18 having said this the idea of cultural respect or sensitivity cannot allow the practice of moral relativism the sanction of obvious morally wrong practices by local security forces and government leaders will only exacerbate the security situation undermine credibility and fuel support for the insurgents particularly if they claim moral superiority 120 bgl323004fp003counterl nsurgency operations chapter 2 describing an insurgency section 1 understanding an insurgency 201 introduction 1 ln order to successfully combat an insurgency it is vital to understand the term why they occur and the various forms that they may take additionally it is just as important to understand the particular situation and culture in which an insurgency occurs without comprehension of the causes and characteristics unique to each insurgency there will be little hope of successfully countering it 2 as discussed in chapter 1 an insurgency may be described as follows competition involving at least one nonstate movement using means that include violence against an established authority to achieve political changele ln addition to the characteristic of violence or at least the threat of violence insurgencies usually share number of other characteristics including propaganda subversion and links to criminal activities and organizations 3 rarely will insurgents seek to or believe that they can defeat government and its conventional military forces through military pressure alone lnstead they seek to outlast the will of the other side and to influence and persuade the mass of the population to either support their aims or to at least cease supporting the established government or recognized authority 202 causes of an insurgency 1 an insurgency may spring from many causes however the classic insurgency usually begins with the perception of oppression due to political societal and economic grievances when these perceptions become sufficiently emotive leaders may emerge who are able to organize violent protest or resistance and influence people to risk imprisonment and even death in order to combat the established order 2 lt must be remembered by those at all levels of command that at the root of most insurgencies are legitimate grievances lndeed certain amount of empathy may be justified in dealing with insurgents these grievances will often be of political social historic andor economic nature and therefore their enduring resolution will require more than the application of military capabilities they will demand the involvement of other agencies in comprehensive approach the failure to resolve these grievances will likely lead to support for an insurgency thus commanders at all levels particularly the strategic and operational must understand that successful outcome to counterinsurgency coin campaign will demand upon achieving enduring solutions to the grievances at the root of the insurgency 203 the aim of an insurgency 1 an insurgency will aim to gain the advantage of power within given political context in order to realize socioeconomic cultural religious and geographic goals or some combination of these lt seeks to realize change or reorder to the extant political structure andor relationships t definition as developed by counterinsurgency study group during united states marine corps usmc joint urban warrior 2005 bgl323004fp003 21counterlnsurgency operations 2 ln terms of overarching concepts it is competition between two political options this is however simplification of insurgencies as they develop within society there will always be root causes that drive individuals groups and their leaders to take up arms to seek change whilst core leadership may share the same grievances they will exploit wide array of local injustices or grievances in order to recruit wide body of support 3 by their very nature of being illegal secretive and disadvantaged insurgencies will become quickly tied to other groups and irregular activities within society not only will insurgencies undertake criminal activities to raise funds and disrupt society they may well be infiltrated andor exploited by criminal groups who see the numbers and military power of an insurgent force as means of meeting criminal objectives additionally social and religious leaders will see the insurgency as means of spreading their own ideologies with which the ordinary follower of the insurgency may have little knowledge or may not support 4 all of these complicating factors must not be allowed to mask the fact insurgencies and their supporters have political and social grievances perceived but often real at their root they may be national regional or local grievances or combination thereof leaders at all levels must understand this and the fact that an insurgency will only be solved through enduring solutions to those grievances 204 competitive elements over populations_strategic centres of gravity 1 within society there exists an interrelated trilogy consisting of the government its military and its population each element of the trilogy affects the other elements during an insurgency competition occurs over control of and support from the population this can be represented in the figure below both the established legitimate recognized government and the insurgent leadership offering an alternate form of government or political arrangement compete for the support of the populace or at least control over it 2 ln influencing the populace the insurgent elements have the advantage of being able to directly influence the populace through its guerrilla or military forces due to the lack of requirement to follow any law of armed conflict the guerrilla forces can directly target and intimidate the populace the governments military forces will ideally follow the law of armed conflict and can only indirectly influence the populace in positive manner they can best serve the populace by providing security and by being seen as legitimate lawful and moral military force supporting the rule of law and good governance the government must provide the longterm solutions to any cause of the insurgency in order to gain and maintain the suppod of the populace 3 ln such situation of insurgency the populace is strategic centre of gravity success is impossible without the support of the populace or at least the willingness to combat the insurgency 22 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency insurgent leadership alternate authority government guerrilla forces military figure 21 competition over the populace as strategic gentre of gravity2o 4 ln accordance with the elements of campaign planning lines of operation must be developed that approach this centre of gravity those elements of the populace that support the coin campaign must be treated as friendly centre of gravity and thus defended those elements of the populace that are neutral or support the insurgency must be engaged and convinced to support the coin campaign 5 should the government combating the insurgency receive support from another nation or coalition then another populacethat of the contributing nationsbecomes strategic centre of gravity there will be added competition to influence the will of the domestic population of the supporting nations those fighting the insurgency will wish to maintain support amongst the domestic populations forwhat will likely be lengthy campaign the insurgents will seek to undermine the will of the domestic population of the supporting nations and in turn force withdrawal of those nations from the campaign the insurgents will do this through directly targeting the forces of the contributing nations or even the domestic populaces themselves in order to undermine significant proportion of national will ln order to counter this threat to the domestic populations will the supporting governments must work to explain the legitimacy of and requirement for the coin campaign this competition is represented in figure 22 20 this construct was adopted from briefing by ltgen pk van riper usmc retd during the usmc joint urban warrior exercise 2005 given to the coin study group bgl323004fp003 23counterlnsurgency operations lnsurgent leadership alternate authority governmentsupporting nations lnsurgents seeking to undermine the will of the supporting populace figure 22 competition over the strategic centres of gravitypopulations 6 whilst this model has best application to traditional forms of state government combating an insurgency it must be applied with some flexibility to various situations ln many of the remote regions of the world where insurgencies occur elements of the populace will be unlikely to recognize central government authority beyond that of their own village or clan elder their support for the insurgency may wax and wane depending upon the situation at any given time for example they may take up arms against the government or coalition forces in order to avenge recent collateral damages or the death of village member once their need for retribution is satisfied they may longer actively support the insurgency notwithstanding the complex nature of such circumstances the model still indicates that the support of the overall populace will be strategic centre of gravity vital for long term success of the campaign additionally the insurgents or at least the hardcore leadership will continue to attack the will of any supporting nations populace in order to force that nation from the campaign 7 lt is fundamental that military and political leaders understand that key aim of the insurgency will be to attack the will of any populations supporting the counterinsurgency both domestically and internationally 205 characteristics of an insurgency_unique and local aspects of the environment 1 each insurgency is unique and will therefore have its own set of characteristics although insurgencies may share similar characteristics each will have exceptional features for this reason intelligence and planning templates suitable for major combat or conventional campaigns have reduced utility during coin campaign 2 ln conventional manoeuvre warfare the known structure of military formations evident pattern of troop concentration in specific terrain and known doctrine often give very good indication of intent for example the concentration of armylevel bridging assets in mechanized divisions area of responsibility fronting on river with two armoured divisions moving into assembly areas are very good indications of deliberate assault river crossing contrasting to this an insurgent movement may well organize and initiate activities using cellular structure within which the cells do not conform to pattern amongst or within themselves their combat indicators of forthcoming action will differ greatly throughout the organization and will continually alter nonetheless although much more complex the intent of 24 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency insurgents based on structures and planned actions can be determined for example sustained observation may reveal certain cells linked with specific activities such as information operations kidnapping or bank robbery as security measure insurgents may alter or transform cells for specific operations in random manner 3 the one key attribute that distinguishes insurgency from most other forms of conflict is the insurgents aim of forcing political change not all followers of an insurgency will necessarily adhere to or even comprehend the political agenda of the insurgency good number of participants may simply join through family clan or other social links others may simply join to seek retribution for other grievances on personal level therefore even the motivations and ideology of insurgents will be difficult to view in monolithic or holistic sense the characteristics of an insurgency will vary at the local level and must be viewed and assessed from this context 4 although there will be escaping the need to address the root causes and legitimate grievances of the overarching insurgency much can be gained through operations and activities at the local level these must firstly avoid driving more individuals to resort to violence e9 the avoidance of collateral damages in offensive activities and secondly address local concerns and grievances that will influence local leaderships and their groups to at least not support the insurgency but ideally support the established authority 5 ln order to understand the context of the insurgency intelligence collection and assessment must include all elements of the environment and the commanders specific battlespace rather than just focus on the insurgent forces themselves the establishment of broad knowledge base will include understanding of the political military economic social including religion informational and infrastructure pmesll systems aspects of the environment historical and cultural aspects of environment must be understood for they influence all the aspects and local power structures this knowledge base will allow the commander to better understand the context power structures influences and motivations of the insurgency as well as how best to preempt dislocate and disrupt the insurgency and its goals 206 transitional nature of insurgencies 1 lnsurgencies are more likely to occur in states with inherent social boundaries whose racial cultural religious or ideological differences disrupt national cohesion lnsurgencies thrive in states lacking efficient stable or popular governments conditions that are aggravated by economic weakness corruption orforeign agitation although various insurgency models exist few insurgencies fit neatly into any rigid classification such as rural or urban leninist or maoist lnstead effective insurgents will take previous campaigns lessons and adapt them to their own particular needs for example in the 1990s hamas profited by the palestine liberation organizations plos loss due to arafats alignment with saddam hussein and his relatively moderate policies toward lsrael the saudis cut off money to the plo which caused them to lose influence while not lessening its antilsrael stance hamas avoided supporting the lraqi dictator palestinians began looking to hamas for leadership by the end of the 1990s hamas was carrying out most of the terror activity in lsrael lsraeli sources claimed that in the 16 months before may 2002 hamas received 135 million us

25counterlnsurgency operations 207 assessing the insurgency 1 examining the complete range of characteristics will assist commander and staff in predicting the insurgents campaign plan previous experience and historical research may provide valuable guidance however the key to an appropriate response remains an objective military estimate essentially to support operational planning the estimate will identify the insurgencys causes the extent of its internal and external supportincluding the basis of the insurgents appeal to the target populationthe motivation and depth of local commitment and the likely weapons and tactics coin forces may face 208 forms of an insurgency 1 as established above it is vital to military success for commanders and staffs to fully understand the nature of the insurgency tothis end six mainforms of insurgency have been defined which are listed in figure 23 22 for example the us senate nuclear proliferation survey assesses 70 percent chance of nuclearradiological terrorism within the decade online httplugarsenategovreportsnpsurveypdf accessed 16 july 2005lntent is to destroy the system there are normally plans to replace any form of government with another system the most potentially dangerous form of insurrection is that of the anarchist group which sets out to eliminate all political structures and the social fabric associated with thembeing very secretive such groups remain small and lacking public support given the rising threat of terrorism based on weapons of mass destruction their potential destructiveness to society cannot be overlooked seeks to impose centrally controlled structures and institutions by mobilizing the people masses to provide equality in the distribution of all state resourcesthis has been seen recently in two variants communist malaya vietnam and contained in baathist ideology seeks to revert back to nationaloriginal values rooted in the previous often mythologized history of the regionthis type of insurgency often incites similar movements elsewhere seen recently as lslamic jihad egypt or hezbollah lebanon seeks to remove themselves and the area in which they live from the control of the remainder of the statethe form of political system adopted by successful insurgents varies enormously amongst the examples are the tamils ltte in sri lanka this form of insurgency is similar to the separatist type but more moderate in that insurgent groups fight for political economic or social reforms and possibly some form of autonomy without dramatically altering the political status quosome insurgencies in central and south america that have sought reforms to corrupt governments figure 23 forms of an lnsurgency 26 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency sectron 2 scope context and limitations of an insurgency 209 insurgentstrategies 1 lnsurgent leaders are generallywell informed astute and will probably studythe lessons of previous campaigns of insurgency globally because popular insurgent strategies continue to provide inspiration and assistance to diverse groups the professional development of intelligence and operations staff should include study in this area the study and analysis of an insurgents strategic approach has practical application including the production of doctrinal coin guidance five broad strategic approaches are suggested below the elements of which may be combined by the insurgents conspiratorial strategy the oldest and least complicated of the strategies features small cells attempting to release the energy of disaffected society generating spontaneous uprising by means of bold armed action designed to operate in an urban environment where information may be quickly passed and key installations exist this was the strategy used by the bolsheviks in 1917 typically key points are seized before decisive strike is made against the governing regime ln its modern variant insurgents seek to garner control over and exploit media coverage protracted popular war this maoist strategy sees three phases strategic defence organization strategic equilibrium guerrilla warfare and strategic offensive open battle culminating in the seizure of political power lts tactics involve mix of political activity terrorism and guerrilla warfare with the former always predominating most applicable in rural peasantbased environments where government control is weak or nonexistent this strategy assumes that the cause will attract everincreasing numbers of supporters allowing the insurgent to expand outwardly from base areas favourable terrain in which to hide and trade for time is essential for protracted campaign and therefore urbanization may provide suitable space to foster such insurrections urban lnsurgency ln its pure form this strategy involves the application of organized crime and terrorism in systematic and ruthless manner as catalyst for political change the urban environment provides dense populace for exploitation and intimidation this strategy more than the others aims to provoke repressive military response that will alienate volatile mass of the urban poor and move them to revolt lt relies primarily upon ruthless terror tactics augmented by media manipulation to generate an air of panic erode the morale of the politicians the administrators and the judiciary and the police and the army with the aim of inducing climate of collapse the insurgency anticipates that the government will then capitulate or be provoked into adopting repressive measures and above all causing bloodshed against such repression the insurgent appears as the peoples protector military focus also known as the foco theory this strategy places political action second to military victory assuming the population willflock to the winning side ascribed to the cuban leadership fidel and raul castro and che guevara this strategy works only when the government is weak discredited and lacks reliable effective armed forces conventional military operations are not the only option undertaken within this strategy when sharp asymmetric balance of military force favours the establishment forces immediate action maya b c d bgl323004fp003 27counterlnsurgency operations occur in the form of terrorism or guerrilla warfare lt should be noted that other types of insurgent groups will initiate their campaign with wellpublicized military success so as to gain popular support but then undertake different more political strategy liberation strategy whilst many insurgencies may be focused on national aims and the creation of new state some insurgencies may simply aim at the expulsion of what is viewed as an occupying authority ornations ln peace support or stabilizing operations conducted by coalition even with an internationally sanctioned mandate disaffected element often one that has lost power may resort to an insurgency strategy in order to disrupt the efforts to stabilize or cement the new political order 2 lt must be remembered that insurgencies will adopt number of strategies in order to achieve their aims they will combine the concepts listed above in order to best meet the demands of the situation and to progress their goals 210 basic tenets of an insurgency 1 all successful insurgents adhere to certain basic tenets naturally such principles must be applied rationally within the existing social and political circumstances when assessing an insurgency these tenets are suitable cause b leadership c popular support d organization and actors and narrative 211 motivating central cause 1 ln most insurgencies there will be legitimate grievances that may result in central motivating cause to the insurgency or may be exploited by the insurgent leaders so that lack of grievance resolution suppofts the cited cause as mentioned previously the definition of the cause is crucial as rallying point the cause must appeal to all levels from supporting the philosophic ideals of the strategic leadership to the tactical motivation of the rank and file the cause is articulated in the motivating idea and resulting narrative see below the sooner that legitimate grievances are addressed by the authorities the better will be the ability to influence the populace to not support the insurgency 212 leadership 1 an insurrection often gives rise to charismatic leader who inspires followers converts the uncommitted and commands the respect or fear of those who normally support the government often throughout history such leaders have become cult figures whose very name becomes rallying point examples include lenin general franco and che guevara they may even become moral centres of gravity 2 lnsurgencies require leaders able to determine politicalstrategic aims as well as the enabling tactics while strong leader is required in the early stages of an insurgency when it is necessary to enforce ones leadership against contending rivals or if the cause seems weak or divisive when the cause is sound the leader need not be so charismatic 28 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency 3 the value to removing or killing an insurgent leader must be carefully considered the costs involved and the undesired secondary effects collateral damages etc may outweigh the tactical and operational advantages gained lndeed powerful and charismatic leader open to negotiated settlement may be of more value alive in terms of reaching an enduring endstate 23 popular support 1 the cause and the leader must appeal to as wide an audience as possible those who are uncommitted or hostile to the cause must be persuaded or coerced to join the cause some may have to be killed to persuade the others popular support is important from political point of view and essential to the provision of intelligence logistics and to support protective security screen around the insurgents clandestine organization the need to garner decisive level of popular support or at least pervasive acquiescence is necessary for eventual success 214 organization and actors 1 lnsurgent groups often possess cellular organization that both enhances force protection and enables decentralized command and control the cellular organization will limit the numbers of personnel who know the actual names and locations of key actors of the insurgency but still allows directives to be carried out thus if one or even multiple cells are compromised the threat to the overall organization is limited the cell structure will extend to all of the active supporters of an insurgency including facilitators outside of the actual geographic region where the insurgency is occurring although the cell structure is very old method of organization modern information technologies increase its effectiveness by facilitating networking and enhancing command and control in high risk environments 2 within an insurgent organization the primary classes of actors are the top leaders lieutenants foot soldiers and recruiters23 ancillary classes of actors include external suppliers and facilitators financiers heads of supportive states supportive population segments and sources of moral and religious supporto the most important of these are the committed actors and the sympathizers that may reside in either the primary or ancillary classes of actors2s 3 alongside the primary and ancillary actors are people who play more ephemeral or transient role there is much evidence from recent conflicts including lraq and afghanistan that insurgent and terrorist groups have paid nonideologically committed civilians to support operations ln particular this has included substantial remuneration for such things as sniping placing improvised explosive devices and other booby traps launching rocketpropelled grenades rpgs and conducting suicide attacks lnsurgent groups will exploit unemployed or disaffected members of the populace by offering remuneration that may in fact represent the only viable means of supporting families as well the old maxim of the enemy of my enemy is my friend will likely hold true in any conflict where multiple disparate actors are involved particularly in societies where tribal affiliations are stronger than any national identity the support of all of these actors is transitory because of the lack of ideological ties to the 23 paul

activities to dissuade behaviour at odds with host nation government and campaign objectives 4 many particularly the younger members willjoin an insurgency out of peer pressure willingness to gain sense of belonging or sense of adventure lnsurgents will actively recruit based on these desires the popularity of such choices is increased when unemployment rates are high again such nonideologically committed individuals are key targets for influence activities that seek to dissuade support for the insurgency 215 narrative 1 at the basis of an insurgency is narrative that contains an idea and founding cause for the insurgency lt motivates the primary and ancillary actors and allows the idea to be formalized as an ideology the narrative will be plausible story that illustrates real or perceived historical or extant injustices and grievances the narrative will present vision mission strategy and goals that purport to resolve and redress those injustices lt is highly motivational tool that exploits grievances culture and beliefs in order to further the insurgent aims 2 ln combination with actions the narrative is used to attract devotees and supporters26 the narrative willjustify insurgent actions and may advocate for the use of violence to achieve political goals and eventually justify actions even atrocities furthermore it will be used to paint the existing authority and power structures as the logical result of the injustices that are described through the narrative similar to propaganda most narratives will possess at the very least kernel of truth but may also include substantial amounts of mythology and may illustrate utopian ideal as an ultimate goal the narrative may be published as manifesto religious edict or in some other form or it may simply be passed verbally 3 narratives underpin much of human thought narratives or stories influence the ability to recall and understand history motivate people to act temper emotional reactions to events cue certain heuristics and biases structure problemsolving capabilities and ultimately perhaps even constitute individual identity2t narratives form not only the basis of insurgent organizations but also of terrorist groups national identities culture society and host of other things to which humans often cling in order to develop feelings of inclusiveness and identity2s 4 subnarratives also form substantial part of the overall narrative this is true for all individuals and groups further broad example is religion all religions possess substantial narratives and indeed the devotion of followers is predicated on faith in what is in essence story and for branches and sects the belief in subnarratives that are offshoots of the primary story narrative is not necessarily untrue but neither can it be unquestioningly accepted as completely factual 26 brigadier retd maurice tugwell revolutionary propaganda and possible countermeasure phd diss london kings college

influence activities must work to counter the insurgent narrative and its supporting propaganda countering the narrative will require the symbiotic use of words and deeds that seek to redress the grievances exploited by the insurgent narrative while promoting the desired narrative of the hostnation government and coalition 216 context of an insurgency 1 beyond the five basic tenets listed above it is essentialfor coin campaign to consider and comprehend the insurgencys context circumstances will often dictate what an insurgent can and cannot do for example several uprisings that slavishly copied revolts in russia or cuba were dismalfailures the spartacist revolts in germany 1919and che guevarras attempts in bolivia 1967failed given that ideologically based campaign plans did notfitthe sociopolitical context of either environment nonetheless population that is dissatisfied with its conditions in general and holds the perception of weak government can provide fertile soil for skilled insurrectionary leader with popular cause and competent organizational support 2 well led and organized insurrection may if the government commands wide measure of suppotl and can rely on its security forces devolve into protracted competition of attrition such an attrition campaign may still succeed if the insurgency can gradually erode the will of the governments supporters at home and persuade public opinion amongst its foreign allies that the governments cause is hopeless or too expensive to support 217 factors affecting the conduct of an insurgency 1 the factors affecting an insurgency can be as important as the tenets of the insurgency itself and will contribute significantly to the end results if carefully applied the factors are protracted war although weak government may fall quite quickly to well organized rebellion or even overnight to coup d6tat strong government may only be defeated by war of attrition time is on the side of the insurgent ln ruralbased insurgency the territory supports gradual occupation of country as demonstrated by mao tsetung in china while the urban guerrillas operating environment is not so permissive its inability to occupy territory can be partially overcome by establishing nogo areas within cities here the strategy is based not on an outright overall military victory but upon creating war weariness emphasizing economic

most other forms of conflict given the wide range of elements influences and factors involved in an insurgency unlike conventionalwarfare where mass fires and manoeuvre may potentially substitute for comprehensive intelligence and planning neither the insurgency nor coin can afford that luxury for the insurgent the best source of intelligence is sympathiser working for the government preferably in securityrelated employment the media may also contri bute to the insu rgents informationgatheri ng process establishment of an alternative society the aim of imposing an alternative view of society is common to all insurgent organizations these viewpoints may be motivated by nationalist religious or political beliefs while nationalism presents an emotive call of patriotism to replace government portrayed as ruling against the countrys interests religious viewpoints promote remoulding of society along religious dogmatic lines political motivations regardless of the supporting ideologies are enhanced by simple desire for power support for these alternative perspectives will not be solely internal as external support may be received from sympathetic nations external support lnsurgencies are seldom successful at obtaining their goals without external assistance as such outside support of both foreign populations and governments is enlisted for the insurgency sympathetic governments may assist the insurgent openly through providing diplomatic support or clandestinely by supplying weapons and training assistance even if government is unwilling to lend support to the insurgents groups may appeal directly to the foreign populace notably expatriot communities through the use of propaganda aimed to appeal to popular sentiment the resulting sympathetic population may pressure their home government engage in protests or sign petitions all increasing the insurgent support base the insurgent can then use these overseas actions as propaganda to increase local support sympathetic external populations often also prove to be good source of financial support t john shy and thomas w collier revolutionary nar makers of modern strategy peter paret ed oxford clarendon press 1986 pg839c d 212 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency f concurrent activity the leadership will attempt to wage the insurgency on political economic propaganda and military fronts simultaneously this ability to simultaneously conduct its range of activities enhances the effectiveness of the insurgents overall operations thus creating synergy this has the additional effect of heightening the publics perception of its cohesion and capability as such the insurgency that looks and acts like competent parallel state increases its ability to become the state 218 weaknesses and aspects of insurgent vulnerability 1 there are usually many potential weak points within an insurgency these are particularly apparent in the early days of campaign when the insurgency is vulnerable to some form of preemption dislocation and disruption by coin forces secrecy any group planning to use force and violence to prosecute its aims must adopt secretive conspiratorial approach to its planning and actions while such discretion may add degree of glamour and attractiveness to potential recruits this secrecy can quickly become counterproductive adverse implications include affecting the necessary freedom of action lowering confidence in similar insurgent groups and readily lead to serious misunderstanding within the organization consequently balance must be struck between too secretive and clandestine approach to insurgency actions and the need to avoid undue attention from the authorities or rival groups some insurgencies have attempted to minimize this difficulty by creating more public political arm for example there is the lrish republican armys lras associated political arm sinn fein b gaining support gaining popular support for the cause can be difficult and sensitive stage in the evolution of an insurgency lf the publicly accepted reason for rising against the government has appeal it would seem that the insurgency would therefore thrive unfortunately various groupings and factions may hold varying opinions requiring different techniques including possible compromises andor intimidation to gain their support lndifference antipathy and likely fear of government reprisal also have to be overcome publicity dramatically improves the prospect of gaining popular support as even bad publicity can advertise that group is resisting consequently expanding recruitment c secure operating base lnsurgents require secure base from which to operate selecting location distant from activity centres may be potentially more secure for the insurgents but may also put them out of touch with the population and make them vulnerable to isolation alternatively close proximity likely eases the security force tasks of surveillance infiltration and destruction establishing an operating base in border region can often provide temporary or perhaps permanent headquarters beyond the reach and authority of the state d funding all insurgencies require some degree of funding in order to acquire the staples of conflict weapons ammunition food and medicines lack of sufficient funds can limit the scope of an insurgency inhibiting its prospects for success accordingly state authorities must utilize this weakness to their advantage aiming to dismantle the insurgentsfunding mechanisms lacking friendly nation or individuals to back the insurgency funding can be found in criminal activities such as narcotics trafficking robberies and extortion while the illegal drug trade in particular has proven to be more enduring source of income than bgl323004fp003 213counterlnsurgency operations bank robberies it brings the movement into contact with unreliable vulnerable groups who can attract undue attention from the authorities lnsurgencies will attempt to gain income from lowprofile high turnover criminal sources such as movie and music pirating external support may also have political price affecting the overall aim of an insurgency the problem of ghanging aims changing aims is not substantial problem at an insurgencys onset but has potentially damaging effect once an insurgency has been operational for some time lndeed changing aims is common when an insurgency is still coalescing lnitial operations may change the outlook of number of insurgents with some questioning the price of the overall aim particularly if security force successes spread doubt about the cause or the insurgencys leadership seemingly generous compromise offered by the state to the insurgents could prove divisive forcing insurgent leaders to apply ruthless measures to ensure that unity and secrecy are preserved changing aims can be further problematic given the aforementioned secrecy which may spark misunderstanding and suspicion throughout the insurgency f setting the pace controlling the pace and timing of operations is vital to the success of any campaign given that insurgents can control the start of operations and have some measure of control over subsequent activity it is surprising to note that many insurgencies have failed to capitalize on opportunities or have allowed the pace of events and scope of activities to be dictated by the state authorities once momentum is lost the strategic initiative returns to the state leaving the insurgency exposed g lnformers while informers have sometimes been infiltrated into insurgent cells it is far more common to achieve success by persuading the insurgent to become an informer this is someone already in the organization or is link between clandestine cells and their public accomplices such as the couriers or suppliers there is nothing more demoralizing to the insurgents than to fear that one of their trusted comrades is giving information to the government lnsurgent leaders will try to preempt the recruitment of informers by ruthless exemplary punishments h lack of moral authority given its use of violence and the fact that an insurgency will normally be related to and involved with criminal elements its leadership will be vulnerable to attacks on its moral authority and claimed superiority lts susceptibility to this will depend upon the culture in which the insurgency occurs this lack of moral authority must be pointed out to the supporting and neutral populace furthermore to exploit this weakness coin forces must not only conduct their campaign from standpoint of moral superiority in terms of conduct and application of the law of armed conflict but must advertize this fact through public affairs and psychological operations this will help to undermine the insurgency and its supporting narrative sectton 3 insurgent methods and endstates 219 insurgent tactics 1 the deliberate promotion of adverse publicity against government agencies and security forces is essential and complementary this aspect has proven more effective with the growing trend towards political groups using civil liberties and human rights to lower the tolerance of the 214 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency public for harsher coin measures the insurgents claim to legitimacy is based on their declared ability to improve the position of the oppressed the essentially violent nature of insurgencies moves in two concurrent complementary paths one destructive and the other constructive as follows destructive actions are clearly aimed at overthrowing the established order and creating climate of collapse in the states authority destructive activities include subversion sabotage of the economic framework terrorism and guerrilla activity and largescale combat operations b the constructive effort meanwhile aims at creating an organization to subsequently replace the established order at suitable moment 2 subversion subversive activity attempts to undermine the political economic and military strength of state without resorting to the use of force by the insurgent such activity may provoke violent countermeasures to be denounced as an overreaction by the authorities thus discrediting the government as such subversion probably poses the most difficult and dangerous threat to government engaged in coin campaign subversion takes many forms such as penetrating existing political parties and organizations and developing front organizations that can have the appearance of challenging and defying the authority of government an insurgency will seek to win supporters within the government especially the security elements in order to discern future plans and possibly any other economic and financial information these types of information are all useful for an insurgency to exploit as required particularly in the early days of an insurrection 3 lnsurgent lnformation operations propaganda is key element of subversion lt includes publishing information detrimental to the government or security forces and the spreading of rumours whether true or false designed to undermine trust and confidence in the government 4 passive resistance depending upon the society in which the insurgency is operating passive resistance may be useful tactic lt is more effective in liberal societies given an authoritarian regimes ability to crush such open dissent examples of passive resistance include withdrawing labour from public services obstructing the law or sitins in public places these measures to gain political change do not alone indicate an insurgency which by definition uses violence to acquire change however insurgent leaders will encourage passive measures on behalf of the larger population in order to undermine the authority of the government and disrupt civil society through agitation they may also seek to provoke violence during public demonstrations in hopes of causing an overreaction by the government forces and creating another claim to injustice and sense of alienation and frustration amongst the populace 5 sabotage sabotage is disruptive activity that furthers the insurgents interests lt may be active or passive active sabotage sees insurgents set out to disrupt important services functions or industrial processes by violent means targets may be selected at random for political or economic impact or they may fit into wider tactical plan with the aim of increasing general confusion and tying down troops in the static defence of installations suitable targets include bridges roads telephone lines or dispersed military logistics sites targets whose destruction might cause mass unemployment and thereby lose the goodwill of the people are in general avoided bgl323004fp003 215counterlnsurgency operations b passive sabotage is generally aimed at causing disorder and disruption by deliberate error contrived accident absenteeism or strikes the target can be industry public services supplies or troops where action is usually planned on wide scale through political front organizations data sabotage is facilitated by the universality of computers in government business and industrial control systems these can be carried out through cyber attack or by having an insurgent or sympathizer physically damage the system 6 the tactic of terrorism terrorism is tactic despite the attention that it receives terrorism is tactical level undertaking however one that is normally used to influence the situation at the operational and strategic levels lt may be used by individuals groups or states as paft of larger operational objective and strategy to intimidate and coerce governments societies or elements of each terrorist actions call attention to the perpetrators and their causes and may help them win support of potential sympathizers terrorism is used to strike at civilian targets which normally have limited means of selfdefenceto the more spectacular or outrageous the action the louder it speaks terrorist attacks seek to undermine the legitimacy of the indigenous government and security forces by demonstrating their inability to counter the threat and prevent attacks thus the key effect of terrorist attacks is psychological in that they seek to shape the perceptions of various audiences locally regionally and internationally the physical damages caused are simply the means of sending their message through the resulting psychological impact terrorist attacks seek to force policy changes or specific actions by the effected governments for example at tactical and operational level they may seek to cause an overreaction by local security forces thereby giving testimony to claims of discrimination and bias against the perpetrating group at the operational and strategic levels they may seek to force nation to withdraw its forces from coalition campaign terror tactics may include assassinations bombings hostagetakings kidnappings hijackings and sabotage the method chosen will try to exploit perceived weakness within the adversary or to attack what was thought to be strength in order to heighten the psychological effect terror tactics evolve with new technology and the availability of weapon systems and seek to exploit globalization often through international criminal organizations the speed of global communications has supported and enhanced the messages that the perpetrators send through their use of terror these changes have served to strengthen the traditional networkbased cell structures favoured by organizations that use terror this in turn reduces the efficacy of certain traditionalcountermeasures such as leadership targeting and makes penetration more difficult ln short recent developments in the nature of global communications have made terror cheaper and more effective tool than in the past31 30 bard oneill lnsurgency and terrorism from revolutionary to apocatypse2nd ed revised washington dc potomac2005 p 33

an lnsurgency terrorism is tactic that may be used by number of irregular threats including insurgents the importance of terrorist acts is not in the act itself but in the message that it sends to various audiences lt is fundamentalto the propaganda campaigns of many insurgent groups one expert on insurgent propaganda retired british brigadier and academic maurice tugwell noted the following regarding the messages that terrorist acts can transmit to various audiences the nineteenth century anarchist bakunin coined the phrase propaganda of the deed to describe an act usually of terrorist violence committed more for its indirect effect upon public opinion than for any direct benefit arising from the act itself mr paul wilkinson has suggested that the terrorist by his act of violence is telling the world we are here look what we can do heed us or there is worse to come we may comment that this message is the one intended forenemies and that the same act is telling neutrals and friends other things to neutrals it may say we are here see how the weak oppose the oppressors obviously our cause has justice on its side support us and to friends it may impart this message we are here look how the mighty forces of the oppression fade before our blows there is cause to fear them victory will be ours join every enemy action even seemingly irrational one such as terrorist bombing of crowded market is conveying message often at the strategic level to various audiences and is part of larger propaganda campaign source brigadier retd maurice arthur john tugwell revolutionary propaganda and possible counter measures unpublished phd dissertation london kings college university of london march 1979 p22 lnsurgents who employ terrorism willjustifu its use in number of ways among other ways terrorist acts will be justified as legitimate by portraying them as altruistic because the act is supposedly for greater good and that it is the only weapon available given the enemys superior military capabilities historically terrorists have sought to distinguish themselves from common criminals because of adherence to and support for whai they believe to be legitimate cause and that those who die committing such acts are martyrs wholl be remembered for their sacrifice these justifications have been used by groups throughout history including lrish nationalists

developing insurgency should therefore include fundraising efforts ln the early stages this will probably be covert and criminal such as bank robbery subsequently the political organization within the insurgency will take on the task of extracting aid from wellintentioned charitable and philanthropic organizations and from sympathizers abroad more violent methods may include the extorting of ransom from individuals kidnapping or from governments hijacking and perhaps the enforced levying of taxes on intimidated sections of the population finally as has been bgl323004fp003 217counterlnsurgency operations demonstrated by the plo and the fuerzas armadas revolucionarias colombia farc mature insurgency can develop parallel socioeconomic order which may attain level of political legitimacy greater than that enjoyed by the legal government in the eyes of the local populace some criminal organizations blur the line between lawbreaking and insurgency for example the calidrug cartelfunds an

other forms of parallel socioeconomic structure and activity 8 weapons and equipment lnsurgents tend to use basic weapons whose essentials have not changed very much since the 1940s beyond simple availability selection criteria are based upon compactness lethality and simple operating procedures the following should be noted personalweapons are principally pistols carbines rifles and weapons with high rate of fire ln recent times weapons and bombs have been miniaturized explosives harder to detect and more lethal accompanied by dramatic increase in improvised explosive devices leds lnsurgents generally have access to complete range of combat support weapons sniper rifles utilizing armourpiercing ammunition are being seen more frequently lmprovised mortars are easy to make although they are usually inaccurate and unreliable most require some form of flat bed for transportation acquisition of military mortars and ammunition significantly increase the range and lethality of such weapons rocketpropelled grenade rpgtype antiarmour weapons proliferate portable air defence missiles pose significant threat the mere possession of air defence weapons particularly manportable air defence systems manpads by an insurgent group will disrupt the government use of helicopters explosives in various forms are the favoured weapons of insurgents military mines both antipersonnel and antitank are frequently utilized by insurgents they have the dual purpose of hampering coin forces efforts while terrifying the local population lnsurgency forces are increasingly using leds the effectiveness of these weapons is well known and expertise in their manufacture and handling is often of high order sophisticated initiating devices antilifting mechanisms and innovative tactical placement including secondary leds are becoming common furthermore any incident bomb or hoax can be used as bait to kill security forces and disposal specialists recently the suicide bomber has emerged as particularly effective weapon the suicide bomber is in effect precision weapon that also demonstrates the degree of the insurgents commitment sophisticated chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrnweapons will likely remain beyond the capability of insurgent groups since the release of sarin gas in tokyo subway in 1995 the potentialfor insurgents to use crudea b c d 218 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency cbrn devices must be considered such capability is to be expected only in an insurgent group already employing terrorist tactics 220 insurgent tactics in rural environment 1 rural insurgencies continue as the allocation of land water or other scarce mineral resources continues to provide real or perceived grievance pafiicularly in areas where there is burgeoning population and malevolent government lnsurgent bases will be established in remote areas often in difficult terrain mountains jungles forest etc from which attacks may be launched over as wide an area as possible to disperse scarce security resources these actions may be mistaken for banditry under the pretext of protection against such banditry isolated villages will be prepared for defence including the discreet clearance of fields of fire other indications that campaign is developing include hoarding supplies training and arming of village selfdefence groups and increased evidence of local intimidation and coercion 2 ln its early stages rural insurgency relies upon small bands assembling for limited attack probably against remote and inadequately guarded target as the movement grows to the stage where it can command significant support from the local population so its objectives will become more ambitious and larger forces will be necessary the relative strength of insurgent bands will always place them at disadvantage visavis the security forces and they will seek to avoid pitched battle their tactics are therefore based on mobility and surprise generally using ambushes and explosives 3 rural populations are vulnerable to terrorism and intimidation and very quickly feeling of insecurity can spread throughout whole region such intimidation is common within rural insurgencies because of the populations relative physical isolation from the protective security forces and the governments presence 4 ambush is the most widely used insurgent tactic lt is particularly effective against road movement especially when the ground makes it difficult for the government forces to move off the road and take cover ln addition to sniping and massed fires ambushes there is growing trend in ambushes featuring leds and suicide bombing 221 insurgent tactics in an urban environment 1 with the degree of urbanization increasing globally encountering urban insurgencies will likely expand urban populations are vulnerable providing relatively small insurgent forces with the opportunity to create an atmosphere of fear and insecurity sufficient to discredit the government 2 ln the urban environment insurgents do not normally plan to occupy and control territory although they may seize small areas for limited time to establish presence from which they can subsequently receive support lacking the ability to occupy territory on significant scale insurgents will aim to make the governments position untenable by engendering state of warweariness frustration and anger against government emergency measures under such conditions the people may rally to any organization or leader who offers stability 3 cities and towns provide great scope for insurgencies the concentration of large population in relatively small area provides cover for the insurgents although they may find support only in certain areas additionally the needs of great city related to the complexity of urban living could find city brought to its knees through the interruption of power supplies noncollection of rubbish or the cutting off of water bgl323004fp003 219counterlnsurgency operations 4 for these reasons the urban insurgent can operate more boldly than his rural counterpad and his tactics reflect this lntimidating the local population as seen in rural insurgencies also occurs in urban environments ln this setting population density facilitates the insurgents audacity as they are able to readily disappear amongst the populace however this too is doubleedged sword for population density may also be used to advantage by the coin forces in the recruitment and placement of agents and in the stealthy infiltration of patrols 5 the ready availability of large numbers of people in urban areas enables insurgents to engineer demonstrations and assemble crowds with relative ease the emotions of the demonstrators can then be readily manipulated often in an effort to provoke an overreaction by security forces women and children may be purposely included in demonstration because they lend certain legitimacy to the event are easier to gain sympathy from observers and may help create an enormous propaganda victory if the insurgents succeed in provoking government overreaction that causes civilian casualties 6 countering an insurgency in an urban area offers number of challenges to the coin forces particularly given the density and complexities of an urban environment however if city is an urban jungle then it too consists of number of villages or local areas each urban area may be divided into almost selfcontained sections few individuals live throughout an entire city instead they live work socialize and worship in the same local area often within walking distance the terrain analysis and knowledge base established by intelligence assessment should work to identify the urban delineations and their internal power structures 222 insurgent communications 1 given the political aims and secretive nature of insurgency communicating is critical contact amongst the insurgents is accomplished through small surreptitious groups or cells lnsurgents make extensive use of secure methods such as deadletter drops or coded graffiti ln addition to the methods below they will also use political literature such as manifestos magazines posters and circulars communicate today modern mass communications facilitate the task of the insurrectionary leader and supporting cadres they can gain secure communications within their organization and stage broad appeals to the mass audience provided by the public therefore modern military seeking to defend its parent or foster society must be prepared to exploit modern media and deny its use to an opponent currently insurgents are known to employ modern communications as follows gellular telephone and hand held radios the mobile phone and similar devices have become ubiquitous in the developing world lnsurgents use them for communication and deception veiled speech and false information are used to compensate for and even exploit the open nature of these types of systems b radio radio is an increasingly used component of control as well as means of passing information or propaganda underground radio stations may disseminate propaganda or order crowds out for demonstrations they may also use radio frequencies to detonate bombs c television almost every insurgent group has used television directly to promote their cause or indirectly ensuring that incidents are newsworthy enough to be reported on television lt is coincidence that the steep rise in terrorist and insurgent action has taken place at the same time as the growth in television the distribution of video tapes also enormously enhances an insurgent cause as seen by the linkage between certain media outlets and terrorist organ izations 220 bgl323004fp003describing an lnsurgency d media coded messages may be included in newspaper advertisements articles in magazines or on posters or circulars to convey instructions to cells perhaps in conjunction with the dead letter box system such messages may be used to pass information when time is not essential for the execution of an operation or to inform an insurgent of the time and date preplanned attack or incident is to be staged lnternet the world wide web is being used increasingly within insurgencies not only can it be used for propaganda purposes but also as tool to pass along terrorist and insurgent techniques and procedures lnsurgents are increasingly publishing their versions of events in order to attract support and show their strength often through video clips of attacks on security forces or killings of kidnapped government supporters such websites thus become primary source of intelligence as analysts seek indicators of insurgent morale nomsdeguerre various factions and their motivators or ideologies which may then be useful for negotiations or psyops targeting sectron 4 conclusion_a medical metaphor for an insurgency and coin 1 an insurgency may be compared to communicable disease the insurgent ideology and its popular support are spread through population by exposure to the equivalent of risk factors the exploitation of legitimate grievances propaganda and the insurgent narrative agents for the spread of the disease are memesbehavioural practices passed on by imitation many individuals especially young people are not necessarily drawn to an insurgency out of ideological commitment but rather through social and cultural associations between family members and friends 2 communicable disease is countered through holistic and systematic approach involving wide range of means changes to behaviour and the environment such as the reduction of risk factors isolation and quarantine inoculation and treatment of the clinically infected r 1 figure 24 an insurgency spread as gommunicable disease32 3 just as communicable disease may be treated in numberof ways we can extend the metaphor to illustrate how coin strategy may be applied to resolve an insurgency 32 this construct was adopted from briefing by ltgen pk van riper usmc retd during the usmc joint urban warrior exercise 2005 given to the coin study group bgl323004fp003 221counterlnsurgency operations changes to behaviour and environment just as the spread of disease may be curtailed through changes to behaviour and the environment and the removal of risk factors the same idea may be applied to stop the spread of an insurgency grievances and circumstances that fuelled the insurgencys start and that continue to lend it credence and support must be resolved b lsolation and quarantine just as those who are infected with disease are often quarantined coin forces and policies must seek to separate insurgents from the populace this will firstly cut off supporl from the populace but more importantly will help preclude the infection of others and thus an increase to the insurgency membership the insurgents must be isolated both physically and cognitively from the populace ln the latter sense this will rely upon defensive information operations and attacks against insurgent communication and propaganda means c lnoculation those not infected with disease are inoculated likewise whilst legitimate grievances are being resolved information operations will be needed to counter the ideological infection of the populace with the narrative and justification for the insurgency d treatment those who have been infected by communicable disease undergo treatment ln the case of those supporting an insurgency number of means may be required ldeally influence activities information operations may be used to persuade and dissuade insurgents and their supporters to pursue peaceful and legitimate means to resolve their grievances lt may even be possible to conveft some insurgents to support the military forces of the coin forces ln other cases committed insurgents unwilling to surrender may have to be captured killed or marginalized to the point that they are ineffective 4 ln order to properly and effectively counter an insurgency one must truly understand the motivations aims strategies and context of the insurgency moreover one must understand thecultureinwhichtheinsurgencyisoccurring thisisvitalfortheoverallgoalofthecoln campaign is to solve root causes and to convince the vast majority of the populace to support legitimate process and to reject the insurgency this can only be done within the context of the culture at hand 5 the solution to an insurgency is political one which will require comprehensive approach incorporating wide variety of agencies with the military in supporting role this is reflected in the philosophy and principles that frame the conduct of coin campaign 222 bgl323004fp003counterlnsurgency operations chapter 3 coin principles the first thing that must be apparent when contemplating the sorl of action which government facing insurgency should take is that there can be such thing as purely military solution because insurgencyis nof primarily military activity at the same time there is such thing as wholly political solution either short of surrender because the very fact that sfafe of insurgency exisfs implies that violence is involved which will have to be countered to some extent at least by the use of force general sir frank kitson reflecting upon his experiences from campaigns in kenya malaya oman and cyprus 301 introduction 1 insurgency has been defeated solely by military means successful conduct of counterinsurgency coin requires harmonized approach using political social economic psychological informational and military measures to restore or establish the authority of legitimate government and address the root causes of the insurgency the root causes will be political social and economic in nature and therefore require agencies and elements of power other than the military to resolve 2 within this harmonized effort military force will play supporting role the fundamental maxim of all coin is that strategic centre of gravity is the populace of the threatened state or region without the moral support of the people coin campaign can succeed similarly insurgency can succeed without at least the tacit acceptance of the populace lnsurgents will also seek to attack the will of nations contributing coalition forces and other elements of power and capabilities to combat the insurgency these domestic populations and their will to support longterm commitment must be considered strategic centres of gravity in the campaign operations at all levels must be conducted with these centres to gravity in mind section 1 counterinsurgency philosophy 1 as in all campaigns the application of military capabilities in coin campaign is guided by doctrine which consists of philosophy guiding principles and tested practices and procedures coin campaign is conducted using the same overarching philosophies that guide the application of fighting power in other campaigns comprehensive approach that uses military capabilities in conjunction with other elements of power to create enduring outcomes b adherence to the principles of war c warfighting ethos d manoeuvrist approach mission command and f an ethical application of combat power 2 specific to the conduct of coin campaign is philosophy that reflects the centres of gravity that are generally common to any coin campaign the overarching philosophy of coin campaign is encompassed by the following bgl323004fp004 31counterlnsurgency operations an insurgency is political problem that requires elements of power other than the military to create an enduring solution and outcome the military therefore plays supporting role successful coin campaign requires the support of the populace thus all military activities must be conducted with view to gaining and maintaining the support of the local populace and to this end creating and maintaining the legitimacy of the campaign this must be understood at all levels of command including the lowest tactical levels33 sectton 2 principles of counterinsurgency general 1 from the overarching philosophy certain principles may be developed in order to guide the military and other agencies in the conduct of coin campaign these principles are based on history and theory and draw on the experiences of friend and foe alike lt must however be remembered that principles are guidelines only and must be tempered by realistic estimate of the situation and an appraisal of the variables and potential responses like all principles they should be applied pragmatically and with common sense to suit the circumstances peculiar to each campaign the assessment of the situation will indicate where application of principle may not be possible at least temporarily where they may conflict or where there is overlap as with the principles of war they must be balanced with one another and all operations must be examined against them part of the art of command will be to balance competing demands consider options and develop the best course of action possible adhering as closely as possible to the principles and the overarching philosophy plans and their implementation must be tailor made for the context in which they are to be implemented underpinning the principles are the assumptions of minimum necessary force and legitimacy of all actions 2 although the military plays supporting role in coin campaign the failure of commanders to properly apply the principles could easily and directly lead to failure of the entire campaign 3 ln any campaign tactics techniques and procedures ttpwill routinely be modified in order to meet the situation at hand particularly in coin campaign where the adversary will be adaptive cunning and resourceful this will be continual process 4 principles offer the civil leadership and the heads of all agencies including the military commander both start point and useful guideposts the coin principles offered herein are arranged in logical sequence and provide government and military commanders with general pattern on which to base and review strategy and operational plans 5 the principles for the conduct of coin campaign are effect political primacy in the pursuit of strategic aim b promote unity of purpose to coordinate the actions of participating agencies including government machinery tt the ouerarching nature of this concept and the need for it to be understood at all levels of command like mission command raises the need to gain popular support to the level of guiding philosophy rather than have it as constituent principlea b 302 32 bgl323004 tfp004coin principles c understand the complex dynamics of the insurgency including the wider environment d exploit intelligence and information separate the insurgents from their physical and moral sources of strength including addressing their grievances real and perceived f neutralize the insurgent g sustain commitment to expend political capital and resources over long period and h conductlongertermpostinsurgencyplanning 303 effect political primacy in the pursuit of strategig aim 1 lnsurgencies are political problem that cannot be countered solely by military means although an insurgency may be slow in becoming apparent once it is identified the host government and its international supporters must decide upon strategy to stop neutralize and reverse any effects of the insurgency this must include an effective proactive response to any violence and intimidation generated by the insurgents apart from immediate shortterm actions many of which will be taken with the advice of the military force commander the government must formulate longterm political planbacked by political economic and social programmeswith the aim of addressing legitimate root grievances and legitimacy for the insurgency the military role will be to provide security framework that creates conditions conducive to implementing these programmes that is the military security and neutralization of the insurgent violence will provide manoeuvre space for other agencies required for enduring solutions coin plan involving the police military locally raised militias and coalition security forces will implement this security framework34 ldeally the security framework will be lead by host nation police and military forces in order to provide additional legitimacy for the government 2 political primacy underpins coin as it legitimizes strategic operational and tactical actions all actions follow the political lead and support its strategic aim within coin campaign the specific strategy determines which instrument of power diplomatic military economic or social is the focus of effort and which agency may have the lead at operational and tactical levels this will change over time as the coin operation and situation evolve 3a security forces include military coalition military forces national police local police and locally recruited support forces bgl323004fp004 33counterlnsurgency operations ensuring public perspective in coin campaign not only is it imperative that the military takes supporting role to the other coin players during the execution of the campaign it is also necessary that the fundamental of minimum force be followed aggressive offensive actions should be viewed as necessary but secondary aspect to the campaign with only shortterm value the longerterm influence aspects of the militarys engagement particularly in conjunction with other agencies that lead to enduring solutions of the crisis must be highlighted to both indigenous and domestic audiences this serves two purposes firstly it demonstrates to the indigenous population that coin forces are not theie to destroy their lives and property but rathlr to assisi them in securing the basics of life and enhancini their quality of iife this in turn garners their active support for the campaign secondly it illustrates to domestic populations of contributing nations within coalition that their sacrifice of treasure and lives are worthwhile in that measures are being actively pursued to resolve underlying grievances and create enduring stability this is particularly important when the domestic populations hold an inaccurate viewpoint focusing on the use of force only ln order for this perspective to be better balanced efforts must be made to advertise the use of strategiclevel advisory teams and other means used to build lasting capacity within developing nation such was the case with the former canadian commander of the afghanistan strategic advisory team engaging wide varie of audiences upon his return from theatre such publicity locally and domestic may help protect two strategic centres of gravity 304 promote unity of purpose to coordinate the actions of participating agencies_control and coordination 1 the coin effort requires comprehensive approach involving wide range of agencies seeking to resolve the causes of the insurgency this should be number of agencies and elements of power united by common objectives and endstate thus unity of purpose and ideally unity of effort will be achieved this concept of unity of effort may be implemented through variety of structures that promote various levels of common command control andor coordination 2 many of these agencies have different philosophies modus operandi and methods unity of command across this array of national government and nongovernment organizations and agencies will be impractical although unity of effort is most desirable it too may not be achievable unity of purpose however must be achieved and all agencies must agree to work towards common purpose and endstate this will require close coordination often led or facilitated by local military commanders 3 within national approach ie that of the threatened nation or that of coalition contributing nation and within coalition one person will ideally be granted responsibility for the direction of the campaign and authority over all government agencies involved in the effort this will ideally allow differences of opinion between agencies to be resolved by an impartial director and centralized coordination in order to exploit in complementary and mutually supporting fashion the strengths of each contributing agency while this single individual could be military commander control will likely be vested in politician diplomat or civil servant ln any case the individual will be working to strict government guidelines and overall control ldeally the single commander will lead joint command and control structure 4 single gommand system unity of purpose and effort is facilitated by organizing the coin campaign under single commander or committee director while the person so bgl323004fp004coin principles designated may be civilian or military it is critical that responsibility for overall direction is vested in one headquarters the commander will bring together both military and nonmilitary elements of power in single command structure advisors will be made available from all of the relevant participating elements such as the civil service international organizations police and military the commander will oversee staff system established to ensure that all plans and actions are conducted towards common goal 5 the gommittee system operationallevel committees are formed again mirroring the strategiclevel command these committees will conduct joint planning in order to ensure that the representative subordinate elements execute such plans in manner keeping with the overarching campaign plan the actual committee structure and representation willvary between insurgencies and indeed will likely change as the conflict evolves as minimum representatives will include the host nation political and civil authorities hostnation military and security authorities political and civiltroopcontributing representatives troopcontributing military commanders and select staff intelligence securitycontributing representatives and probably i nternational organizations representatives 6 trust is key factor in making such an organization functional this is often difficult to establish across differing organizational cultures for example the military requirement for security and expertise in applied violence is potentially the antithesis of humanitarian non governmental organizations ngos neutral transparency and abhorrence of things military the committee director and all members must continually strive to maintain mutual openness and confidence key component of this will be clearly communicating the purpose and reasoning behind military operations within the bounds of operational security opsec considerations 7 role of personalities given the interagency aspect of coin operations and the need for the military to work handinhand with its civilian and police partners many of whom will have little understanding3s of military organization or command structuresthe role of individual personalities becomes magnified any system of control and coordination must be able to adapt to the personalities of those involved military commanders must select their liaison officers and committee members with care exploiting those who can achieve progress through balance of charisma persuasion and graceful force of personality commanders must be able to realize that they themselves may not be the most suitable individuals to conduct daily facetoface operations and coordination with their civilian counterparts and therefore must select the most suitable representative this must be balanced with the message that the commanders own personal presence will send at any given time b assistance to allies and foreign powers when military provides assistance to foreign state the forces assigned may necessarily be subordinate to that government in order to preserve the host nations sovereignty and the governments credibility in the eyes of its populace at the very least the leadership role of the indigenous government must be highlighted ln such cases assisting forces will likely be obliged to adopt the coordination system of the host nation 9 government planning and military supportassessment and estimate of the situation and military advisors when the government is determining which of its objectives can best be attained with the help of the armed forces the military commanders and advisers 35 experience has shown that some government political leaders civil administrators and staff of ngos will not only have lack an understanding of how the military functions and operates but will have significant misconceptions and even hold hostilities towards the military and thus may be reluctant to cooperate bgl323004fp004 35counterlnsurgency operations will be able to explain the forces capabilities and limitations in the context of the particular crisis an analysis of the situation should reveal the areas in which the supported government and the insurgents are most vulnerable these vulnerabilities are likely to be spread over the entire political economic social and security spectrum the aim will be to identify those government vulnerabilities that are best suited to military defensive action and those vulnerabilities of the insurgents that are most susceptible to offensive military action the military will likely be able to assist in certain areas of stability activities such as reconstruction and governance but the capability limitations of the military and the perceptions of military involvement in these areas must be fully assessed and clearly articulated to political leaders throughout the planning of coin campaign the supporting role of the military must be emphasized and the concept that insurgencies require enduring political solutions must be stressed 10 allocation of priorities the coordinated national plan that emerges from the above estimate should address the political economic social and security spectrum and seek enduring solutions to the insurgency causes determining the type of insurgency faced will highlight two priorities identification of physical and moral centres of gravity for the insurgents and identification of the government actions that will achieve meaningful results some of these results or at least the actions leading to them should be achieved quickly so as to demonstrate resolution others such as rebuilding of an economic infrastructure will take long time to achieve but it will often be these actions that lead to enduring success the national priorities need to be addressed at this stage of the planning process once the overarching priorities are identified other allocations of tasks and resources will be identified to include roles and responsibilities between government departments and military offices in order to avoid duplication of effort gaps and potential conflict b priority of action between the social economic military and civil administration fields c priorities within each field of activity social economic military and civil administration just as the military will apportion efforts across the operational functions command sense act shield sustain so too must the civil police and other authorities set priorities across their own organizations and capabilities 11 campaign design and operational planning once the strategic priorities and objectives have been identified campaign design and operational planning may begin the military will work in conjunction with the host nation and the other elements of power and agencies involved operational objectives will be identified and grouped along thematic lines of operation leading to the operational endstate lt will be vital that the military conducts the campaign design in cooperation with the other elements of power involved in order the truly realize unity of purpose and effort across all agencies 305 understand the complex dynamics of the insurgency including the wider environment 1 the various interrelated dynamics of an insurgency will present profound intellectual challenges for commanders and staff ln order to understand the context of the insurgency its causes and motivations broad knowledge base must be created in order to understand it and the environment in which it has grown this will require an assessment of all the various elements within the environment political military economic social including culture and religion informational and infrastructure lt will also demand an understanding of the various often competing power structures present in the society and insurgency itself 36 bgl323004 tfp004coin principles 2 given the large number of variables at work it may very well be impossible to predict the secondary and tertiary effects of specific actions still effort must be expended to understand these variables and dynamics at hand and how best to tackle them 3 the dynamics of an insurgency may include causewhat makes the insurgency attractive to the uncommitted b central idea the narrative of the insurgencythis may be an ideology or religious ideal that also identifies strategic endstate c aims of the insurgencylong term short term advertised and hidden d organization and capabilitiesleaders cadre combatants support base and politicalwings external supportmoral physical and conceptual f methodologystrategies and tactics and g the wider environmentpolitical economic sociological and technical 4 for every dynamic within an insurgency the lines of operation within the campaign plan must anticipate and counter the evolving dynamics of the insurgency 306 exploit intelligence and information_the overarching importange of intelligence 1 lntelligence is the key enabler that will allow the insurgency its causes its motivations its power structures and its weaknesses and vulnerabilities on both the physical and psychological planes to be understood lt will thus support the creation of an effective and legitimate campaign plan such intelligence will demand multifaceted assessment and analysis capability that will examine the entire environment and its influences well beyond the mere military capabilities of the insurgents 2 combating an insurgency requires sophisticated human intelligence humint network that includes not only local sources of intelligence but also detailed collection plan that incorporates all sources from the soldiers who patrol daily to the agents of influence within society sophisticated wellguided network is essential to develop complete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of an insurgency 3 lnformation and intelligence must be exploited in systematic and thorough manner all individuals concernedcivilians commanders and soldiers of all ranksmust understand the overriding importance of intelligence in actively defeating an insurgency and in gaining the support of the populace lntelligence will support direct military action against insurgents guide influence activities and psychological effects to attack the root causes of the insurgency create enduring solutions of standing grievances and allow for success to be measured allsource intelligence is the key enabler required to defeat an insurgency 4 operationallevel applicationlocal knowledge knowledge of the countryits ethnic composition culture religions and schisms the political scene and party leaders the clandestine political organizations and their undercover armed groups the influence of neighbouring states and the economywill provide the essential backdrop to understanding the insurgency however such knowledge base takes time to build lt is essential to do so because the development of actionable intelligence relies on an ability to discern patterns of change in behaviour the host nation police and its intelligence service should be the prime agencies for providing background intelligence at the start of mission so that baseline of bgl323004fp004 37counterlnsurgency operations local conditions can be established creation of baseline understanding and its growth into broad knowledge base allows developing trends and changes in specific areas to be identified and encouraged if positive or halted if negative ln all cases the best source of intelligence comes from members of an insurgent group who have been detained or convinced to switch loyalties all operations must be intelligence driven this produces two benefits first it mlntmtzes disruption to the general population by focusing on specific targets allows refined risk assessment and avoids collateral damages and second it creates snowball effect as each targeted operation inevitably produces more intelligence since the summer of 2003 us forces in lraq had been searching for and trying to eliminate abu musab alzarqawi the head of qaeda in mesopotamia alzarqawi was personally responsible for innumerable suicide and roadside bombings and assassinations ln february of 2006 us forces had gleaned intelligence from captured insurgent detailing number of safehouses and residences in the lraqi town of yusufiya this intelligence was used to launch number of raids in midapril that captured more insurgents and uncovered more intelligence these operations had two effects it uncovered videotape of zarqawi fumbling with cg m249 light machine gun which was broadcast worldwide by the us in counterpropaganda effort aimed at demonstrating the incompetence of zarqawi and his immediate associates the second effect was more important after weeks of interrogation by speciallytrained intelligence personnel the captured insurgents revealed enough information to create detailed mapping of alzarqawis organizations midlevel leadership this breakthrough allowed number of targeted raids on 19 14 and 17 may by sof that killed number of insurgents and produced more physical intelligence finally at the beginning of june 2006 interrogators were able to produce intelligence detailing the security precautions taken by sheikh alrahman close advisor to zarqawi combined with electronic intelligence this enabled us forces to identify the location of meeting between alrahman and alzarqawi using this intelligence zarqawi was targeted and killed by aircraftlaunched pgms on 7 june 2006 the deliberate patient exploitation of intelligence guided and shaped an effective series of operations that produced tangible results resulting in weakened and less operationally effective adversary source mark bowden the ploy the attantic monthtyvolume 299 no4 may 2007 washington dc the atlantic monthly pp5468 5 tacticallevel application without accurate intelligence the security forces are reduced to conducting blind and ineffective operations which often provoke negative reaction amongst the population the ensuing negative media reporting can undermine domestic and international support for the mission and benefit the insurgency furthermore troops conducting routine framework patrolling tend to loose their focus and motivation with the result often being the conduct of patrolling for the sake of patrolling itself tactical intelligence requirements should be pushed down to the lowest levels and all sources specialist and routine framework patrols alike should be given specific informational requirements to gather furthermore specialists wherever possible should be pushed down to the lower subunit tactical levels so that they may remain responsive to their intelligence requirements while bgl323004fp004coin principles fulfilling those of the units and formations every soldier is source of information collection and must come to understand the human and geographic terrain including the operational methodology of the enemy standing information requirements should be pushed down to the lowest levels in order to focus routine operations such as security patrols and to allow the requirements to be applied pervasively ln the end each successful operation becomes an intelligence windfall and parlays into stronger intelligence picture 6 the tacticallevel application of information and intelligence will allow large named areas of interest nals to be reduced to point nals and eventually to target areas of interest tals for subsequent precision strikes for example humint reports may indicate gang and their suspected weapons cache are located in neighbourhood containing 20000 occupants patrols and other sources through specific tasks and stated information requirements may reduce this area nai to specific city block or house this will eventually become tai that can be passed to operations staff and commanders for subsequent actionin this case cordon and search activity 7 the same can be said regarding information exploitation for psychological effects for example humint reports or interrogations may indicate that an insurgency is recruiting members from particular suburban region further examination and collection regarding this area may reveal that it is an ethnic enclave with high unemployment hence this area may become tai for the application of civilmilitary cooperation clmlc and other influence activity capabilities in order to stimulate development of this enclave followup patrols can in time gauge the public reaction to such measures ln short intelligence drives and focuses tactical operations limits collateral damage and assists in measuring success b the lntelligence organization lt should be expected that intelligence organizations in coin campaigns will have to grow considerably compared to those in conventional operations which focus merely on conventional enemy ldeally the intelligence organization should start expanding in lock step with the insurgents developing threat lnevitably however there is an interval before the expanded organization becomes effective such expansion should reflect the need to understand the various elements of the environment that influence the campaigns outcome such as cultural and economic aspects 307 separate the insurgents from their physical and moral sources of strength 1 two facets of lsolation one of the primary operational objectives of the coin campaign is the physical and moral isolation of the insurgents from the sources of physical resources and the population without the support both physical and moral of the population an insurgency will likely be unable to survive additionally it is important to work to eliminate the sources of funding and material support that sustain insurgent operations that come from both internal and external sources all agencies involved in the coin operation must understand this and work within their own fields to this end both elements must be addressed physical separation lnsurgents must be separated from their physical support which includes recruits finances and material resources that may be originating from within the host nation or from external sources b moral separation lnsurgents must be undermined intellectually and morally and any justification for their moral support by population removed narrative willform the foundation of insurgent propaganda and guide their actions this narrative will highlight real or perceived grievances and provide vision and strategic endstate as an alternative to the existing government or society the bgl323004 tfp004 39counterlnsurgency operations 308narrative will also provide moral justification for the insurgency and attempt to capture the moral high ground from the government thus undermining the insurgencys narrative is critical to influencing the population to support the government to this end legal viable alternative to the insurgency must be offered by the coin campaign the insurgency must be deprived of any claim to moral superiority physical separation 1 establish firm base the first requirement may be to secure the base areas essential to the survival and functioning of the government and state these normally include the capital key points of entry vital installations such as public infrastructure and reinforcing those areas that are loyal to the government the provision of security in these vital areas encourages their inhabitants to rally behind the government 2 expand secure areas once established security forces expand outward from the secure areas in campaign akin to the spreading of an oil slick as each area is consolidated loyal local forces could be raised to secure the area to release mobile regular troops to secure the next area while the host states civil administration and police reestablish themselves in the recently liberated territory and gain through social development the support of the populace this is proven approach to combating an insurgency the fache dhuile or oil spot technique of counterinsurgency was first formalized by french general hubert lyautey in the first decade of the 20th century the premise of the technique is the provision of security umbrella or framework at the local level concomitant to furnishing social services such as schools health care and government administration lyauteys aim was to physically and psychologically separate the insurgent from the population and to slowly expand government control by using the army not as an instrument of repression but as positive social force support for the government would come with tangible improvements in the local populaces wellbeing versions of this technique have been applied by among others the french in morocco and algeria the us marines in vietnam and the us army on southern luzon during the 18991902 philippine war even though the term tache dhuile had yet to be coined source robert asprey war in the shadows the guerrilla in history new york morrow 1994 pp 150157 3 integration of security forces the most effective way of expanding coin campaigns affect and achieving physical separation of the insurgents is by having security forces living amongst the population history has proven that isolating security forces in fortified strongholds is ineffective allows insurgent infiltration and serves to separate the counter insurgents from the population all of which is the reverse effect of that actually being sought forthis oilspot or ink spot method to work as intended the security forces must live and interact intimately with the population and its established authority and government not only does this create strong personal bonds between the people and the military it enhances the intelligence network and creates hostile environment for the insurgents this method is not without risk lndeed risks may have to be taken in force protection in terms the relative exposure of the soldiers is increased this will also involve political risk in terms of the potential for higher casualties such risks must be carefully explained to soldiers and domestic populations alike ln order to mitigate such risks certain level of security is necessary before such tactic can be employed ln the final analysis it is imperative for successful campaign 31 0 bgl323004fp004coin principles that the security forces build confidence in the population and it is unlikely that this can be achieved from behind fortified walls 4 eliminate the insurgent subversive and support system the security forces operations must focus on eliminating the insurgents subversive and support organizations this is an essential prerequisite to defeating any active insurgent group for the following reasons the subversive organization controls the population denies the government popular support spreads propaganda unchecked and prevents witnesses from provid ing information b without such action the insurgents continue to receive supplies recruits and information regarding the security forces and can continue to disrupt development and stability even if the majority of their moral support has been eliminated c once the subversive organization is destroyed or dislocated the insurgents are forced to operate more openly and thus expose themselves to deliberate military actions and arrest d subversive elements arrested are the best sources of information on the insurgent organization these elements must be carefully handled according to legal constraints by specialist staff skilled in extracting detailed intelligence 5 methods of physical separation thoughtful combination of methods by all agencies involved is needed to separate the insurgents from their subversive and suppoding constructs lntelligence should aim at the identification of support cells quartermaster functionaries subversive cells and propagandists this information should come in good part from civilian police sources but where police forces lack physical presence in remote geographical area the void may be filled with elements of special forces assigned specific information requirements b the provision of security for the populace the overt supporters and informers this is best done proactively through the use of anonymous tip telephone lines specialist handling of sources and lowlevel security measures such as face masks to hide the identity of informers working with security forces c the gradual spread of government and security force control over areas d curfews and searches of individuals thought to be supporting insurgents patrols ambushes and vehicle checkpoints the latter best done at low levels for short intervals on likely routes f lnterdiction operations against the entry of external supplies g closing national borders or imposing control measures over them h lnternational diplomacy to staunch the flow of external fiscal human and material support for the insurgency this may require government legal action in number of nations particularly those contributing troops to an insurgency certainly evidence collected in theatre of operations indicating the sources of external funding and resources should be advertised widely to support government action that will staunch this support bgl323004 tfp004 31 1counterlnsurgency operations 309 intellectual and moral separation 1 general undermining the narrative of the insurgents and removing grievances justification and causes of the insurgency is criticalto enduring endstates lndeed such action will be decisive in the campaign addressing this facet primarily involves dealing with the real and perceived grievances that help to intellectually draw supporters and recruits to outwardly or tacitly support the insurgents just as insurgent propaganda involves both words and deeds providing an alternative to the insurgent narrative requires both words and actions therefore not only does the campaign plan and its intent need to be broadcast it must be constantly reinforced updated and supported by real action that creates sense of normalcy and improves the dayoday lives of the populace b legal viable alternative to the insurgency must be offered to members of the insurgency their supporters and the uncommitted in the population handin hand with this is the fact that the conditions that permit the spread of the insurgency and its justification in the eyes of many must be addressed and resolved with longterm solutions that are well publicized through information operations c broadly speaking this will often involve the reform of government and government institutions and policies and alternatives to the idealized vision of society that insurgent propaganda will advertise the insurgency must be deprived of any claim to moral superiority d ln general the concept of separating the insurgent in moral or intellectual sense has been termed winning the hearts and minds more accurately this should be considered winning the minds and hearts of the population specifically planned influence activities must be conducted to affect the understanding and perceptions ie the mind of the target audiences in order to affect their will heart and ultimately their behaviour in desired manner 2 reforming the host nation government and lnstitutions ln many cases the government under attack from an insurgency requires some type of reform in order to solidify its legitimacy win and maintain the support of its own populace and gain international support this may include the reform of unjust policies such as inequitable distribution of land government actions within moral contextsuch as observance of the law discrete use of force the provision of public services and equitable distribution of benefits realized through social and economic developmentwill help to produce favourable climate domestically and internationally ln other words the government must learn to envision and provide an equitable social contract with its populace b lnternationally it is critical that the host nation government make real and sustained efforts at any needed reforms for responsible and representative government the publics of supporting nations in coalition will likely demand high standard of human rights rule of law and good governance maintaining this support is dependent partly on the efforts of the host nation to reform weak institutions and develop internationally recognized legitimacy 312 bgl323004fp004coin principles 3 domestic and lnternational diplomacy diplomacy must play central role in the intellectual and moral separation of the insurgents from the population this involves both diplomacy within the affected state and internationally domestically it is important that the host nation government negotiate with disaffected groups to develop sense of inclusion and ownership of the political process broadening the base of stakeholders in political process is critical to increasing participation in the legitimate process with regards to insurgents undoubtedly there will be diehards that refuse to support anything but absolute achievement of the stated goals for these the only options are capture death or to be made so irrelevant that they wield influence or threat however the vast majority of most insurgent groups are normally composed of less highly motivated people who simply want to achieve better life domestic diplomacy is critical in trying to bring this group to the government side and although their trust will be difficult to gain it is imperative that efforts to do so are made lt is highly unlikely that permanent solution can be achieved otherwise b lnternationally diplomatic efforts aimed at cutting moral support from countries that share ideological cultural or religious links to an insurgency can play an important part in countering the narrative underpinning insurgent propaganda this may simply involve greater support to state that demonstrates the compatibility of religion and democracy or successful example of settling long standing grievances with government reforms ln other cases this may involve encouraging governments to enforce legal constraints on religious leaders advocating violence or the support of extremist propaganda 4 holding the moral high ground lnsurgent narrative and propaganda will provide moral justification for the existence of the insurgency and for any violent acts committed the struggle to intellectually and morally separate the insurgents from the populace hinges on the government being seen as morally superior to the insurgents and the alternative society being offered by the insurgency this involves establishing and ascribing to the rule of law host nation governments and institutions may require detailed assistance in achieving this concept in both practice and in the eyes of their populace to this end commanders and even their soldiers must understand the need to help ensure the supported government remains legitimate and acts accordingly where possible they must assist in the raising of standards of conduct from the local level upwards violations must be reported to the military and civil chainsof command and addressed accordingly coalition forces involved in the campaign must as part of the solution set the example for the host nation government were necessary ln short the insurgency must be deprived of any claim to moral superiority 5 apply power discriminately to lnfluence human will force must be applied discriminately throughout coin campaign to avoid alienating the population through civilian casualties or unnecessary damage to property at times shortterm tactical success may have to be forsaken in order to meet the longterm operational objectives of the campaign and maintain the support of the populace minimum use of force should guide the actions of the security forces this maxim must be reinforced at all stages of the campaign and at all levels of command b furthermore the exercise of power by any of the agencies involved in campaign must be conducted with legitimacy within the rule of law and without prejudice to any one group within the affected population bgl323004fp004 31 3counterlnsurgency operations c additionally disruption to normal civic life must be limited to the greatest extent possible this principle must be applied at the operational and tactical levels for example the imposition of curfews should be as limited in time and scope as possible in order to avoid disruption to the lives of the majority of the populace who are always at risk of becoming fatigued by security measures likewise the conduct of cordon and search in private homes may require forced entry into locked rooms lf the owners cannot locate keys even when breaching tools are produced then the door should whenever possible be removed from its hinges lf nothing is found as will often be the case the door can then be replaced without damage this in turns limits embarrassment for the security forces and the extra effort taken to avoid damages to private property is to ceftain extent appreciated by the populace lt in turn helps gain and maintain their support and counter the propaganda undoubtedly spread by the insurgents regarding the security forces and their methods 310 neutralizetheinsurgent 1 the security forces of the government or coalition will have significant role in the selective destruction disruption and dislodgment of insurgents confidence trust and freedom of action without the need to refer routine and anticipated operations that will exploit often fleeting opportunities back to higher levels of command must be afforded tactical commanders particularly down to subunit level if they are to be successful in striking the insurgent and dislocating him from his power base 2 lt will be highly unlikely if not impossible to destroy the entire insurgent movement part of the neutralization of the insurgent will be to neutralize his presence in affected areas critical aspect of successful military coin is command initiative and action at the lowest tactical level that involves the junior commander platoon and section level leading small patrols36 into the insurgents area of operations the aim should be to defeat the insurgent on home ground using adequate force but more than is absolutely necessary proportionality must be the measure applied when employing force 3 all military tactical actions must be conducted in harmony with the other actions taken to neutralize and defeat the insurgency amelioration of the causes reformation of the government and development of local security forces if necessary information operations to explain the military actions and social development without this multipronged approach killing insurgents simply becomes form of attrition warfare and may encourage more converts to the insurgency lndeed this point may be exacerbated by sociocultural codes of conduct that demand retribution for the death of relative regardless of cause or justification 311 sustain commitment to expend political capital and resources over long period l lnsurgency and counterinsurgency like all forms of warfare are protracted contests of will lnsurgents understand that they do not have to win decisive battle but have to make the campaign too expensive and demanding in terms of time resources financial and political capital for the government the populace andor the governments external supporters some of whom may be supplying troops to stabilize and support the state not only must the 36 the required size of the patrol will depend upon number of factors considered in the estimate and planning process including threat insurgent tactics distance to be covered and tasks of the patrol 314 bgl323004 tfp004coin principles commitment of the local populace be sustained but the populations of any supporting nations must be convinced to remain committed to the coin these are strategic centres of gravity within the campaign 2 sustained commitment to the coin is underpinned by unity of purpose across wide range of disparate elements and organizations involved in the campaign that is through the comprehensive approach to the campaign lnformation operations will have to work towards this aim furthermore realistic measures of success will have to be decided and promulgated so that complementary lines of operation and successive operational objectives may be fully identified broadened and exploited 312 conduct longerterm postinsurgency planning 1 the requirement for postinsurgency security and development probably holds the key to effectively applying all of the other principles merely providing for the military defeat of insurgents does not in any way end the government requirement to make suitable longerterm plans to address the perceived and real grievances that enabled the rise of an insurgency in the first instance 2 the plans and requirements to address these grievances must be communicated to the populace of the host nation the international public and the populaces of nations contributing resources and manpower to the campaign this will allow the coin campaign to develop the longterm legitimacy required to sustain what will undoubtedly be lengthy and complex effort 3 the announcement of bold government initiatives to be started after the insurgency has been defeated or at least significantly neutralized can have real and significant effect on winning the moral support of the population such initiatives should be designed at the same time as the comprehensive strategic plans are being prepared to defeat the insurgency the timing of any statement about longer term plans could be of crucial importance and should be handled in sensitive and controlled manner by the state authorities in concert with the overall information operations plan lt is critical that the announcement of government reform initiatives coincide with actual deeds failure to coordinate the words and actions of strategy will increase disenchantment with the government both domestically and internationally ln the british dhofar campaign 19701975 the end of insurgent activity occurred in december 1975 but the authorities had to work relentlessly for several more years to achieve continued support from the population before the causes of the insurgency had been fully rectified as with subduing fire the flames have to be out and the embers cold before it can be considered fully extinguished section 3 factors bearing on the application of the principles of coin 313 popularsupport 1 lnsurgent aims an insurgency aims to discredit the government its legitimacy and its policies lt will have spent much time preparing the ground for insurgency with propaganda using real and contrived discontents when it considers that the government andor its supporting authorities e9 support from an external nation have been sufficiently undermined and that significant part of the population has been alienated from authority the insurgency will use coercion and terror to reinforce its propaganda campaign bgl323004 tfpoo4 31 5counterlnsurgency operations 2 competition for loyalty minds and hearts government must convince its population that it can offer better solution better government and better life than the opposing insurgents in order to influence the minds and win the hearts of the population this will be focal point for the information operations campaign just as an insurgency needs the sympathy or the acquiescence of sizeable percentage of the population to survive and to overthrow the government so the government needs the peoples support to appear legitimate in its eyes and to obtain information leading to the arrest or capture of the terrorists violence or the threat of it is aimed at the citizens fears for his family and freedom to earn wage to feed them whoever can guarantee citizens security can often command their allegiance an insurgency is competition between government and insurgent for the individuals loyalty unless the government can offer reasonable protection individuals are unlikely to risk their own or their families lives by volunteering information and the security forces will meet passive resistance from the populace as whole in addition to the active resistance of the insurgents 3 government protection protection of the civilian population will require restrictions and measures searches checkpoints curfews etc that will disrupt normal lives and frustrate the local populations their frustration will increase with time lnsurgents will seek to misrepresent necessary inconveniences as harsh and oppressive consequently the government and its security forces must anticipate possible hostile public reaction to such security measures and prepare arguments to rebut insurgent propaganda in order to keep the initiative in the battle for the hearts and minds of the people 4 lnvolving the local population in the gampaign even in situations in which the local authorities and host nation police forces require significant reform much effort should be made to include them within the dictates of force protection and opsec in the campaign lncluding them will build their confidence encourage higher standards and raise their profile in the eyes of the local communities likewise local populations should be made to feel that they have vital part to play in countering the insurgency and leading to its conclusion such confidence building measures may even extend to having remote communities raise their own local defence forces the trust the community initially places in its protectors is repaid by the trust the government shows in them by allowing them to bear arms in common cause 5 countering insurgent propaganda lnsurgent propaganda must be monitored and addressed by deliberate and multifaceted information operations campaign that is through the use of influence activities however as much authority as possible must be pushed down to the tactical levels in order that information operations at that level are able to be executed in timely and effective manner broad themes developed at the strategic and operational levels must be tailored to the specifics of local target audience at the tactical level in order to address the specific issues at the local level canadian and coalition soldiers must be aware of the key role that they play in countering insurgent propaganda which at the very least will paint them as foreign oppressive occupiers their friendly but professional disposition tone and decorum while patrolling amongst the local population their ability to relate to the populace and the discriminate use of force will quickly undermine that propaganda 314 avoidance of moral relativism 1 moral relativism is the doctrine that morality exists in relation to culture society or historical context and that there is absolute right and wrong moral relativism assumes that morals are not universaland therefore confuses culture and morality when working in another society there is natural tendency to practise moral relativism and thus accept immoral practices by members of an indigenous population and attribute them to immutable local customs and cultural values 31 6 bgl323004fp004coin principles 2 such an assumption and the ensuing practice are wrong moral is defined as concerned with the principles of right and wrong behaviourtt value as in cultural value is defined as the regard that something is held to deserve the importance worth or usefulness of somethingtt because morals are concerned with principles they can be considered universal values are culturally specific and the values and social constructs assumed by culture will vary to extreme degrees from those of other cultures values may change but only over very long periods of time both morals and cultural values are distinct from individual or social practices although all are related 3 the practice of moral relativism in coin as in all campaigns should be avoided because it creates substantial risk of alienating the population and undermining support for the campaign this can occur in two ways firstly moral relativism can sanction corrupt or otherwise illegal actions of people in authority this in turn will undermine their authority legitimacy credibility and moral superiority along with that of the campaign in the eyes of indigenous and international populations moral relativism must be avoided when dealing with any individual or group be they government officials and members of the host nation security services or criminal elements tribal authority figures business people and members of the insurgency itself the effects of moral relativism are even greater when the sanctioned violations clearly undermine good governance and the legitimacy moral superiority and effectiveness of those authorities fighting the insurgency thus moral relativism and its attribution of immoral behaviour to simply extend local values and culture is counter productive as it delegitimizes the host nation government the coin campaign itself and the forces conducting it3s b secondly the illegal or immoral activities may have been one of the root causes to instability in the society in the first place by permitting effectively sanctioning such behaviour as extortion by armed policemen at checkpoints the commanders will only forestall the longterm improvement of the society 4 ln avoiding the practice of moral relativism and ensuring acceptable standards of conduct from public officials and society itself commanders must use degree of common sense and judgement for example armed police extorting money from civilians at checkpoint is different from school teacher who charges parents stipend per child in light of poor or nonexistent wages from developing government 5 although it may be considered social or cultural norm by virtue of its ubiquity corruption and criminal activity cannot simply be dismissed as cultural or moral norm and indeed may have aggravated the root causes of an insurgency the insistence that government officials and other authority figures follow moral standards may require individual and societal changes but unlikely changes to cultural values societal change is acceptable and may indeed be necessary for the successful conclusion of the coin campaign additionally if the improvement of the host nation populaces wellbeing is primary goal of coin moral relativism with regards to permitting criminal activity and excusing failure to fulfil the governments social contract cannot be accepted as legitimate or beneficial practice tt from the oxford dictionary of engtish 1dh ed revlsed oxford university press 1999 edited by judy pearsall p 925 t tbid p 1584tat its worst moral relativism in such cases may be considered racist for it assumes an indigenous population is not capable of morally correct standards of behaviour again this attitude will not garner support from the local populace bgl323004fp004 317counterl nsurgency operations 6 ln trying to improve society facing an insurgency it must be realized that reduction in corruption and criminal activity will not occur instantaneously but rather over period of time forces conducting coin campaign must expect and insist upon the moral conduct of host nation authority figures and security forces this may become part of the longterm security sector reform and governance development ensuring police professional conduct haiti 2004 ln conducting lowlevel coin operations against the criminalbased insurgency in haiti in early 20o4 canadian troops conducted number of cordon and search operations against gang headquarters and gathering places most of which contained brothels lt quickly became obvious that members of the haitian national police routinely frequented such establishments thereby associating with gang members and exhibiting antisocial behaviours some headquarters staff dismissed this issue as simply part of the haitian culture not only does this view disregard the lack of legitimacy of the local authorities but it assumes either that there is moral yardstick that can be applied or that the local populace is not capable of higher standards such conduct by local authorities certainly undermined their legitimacy and trustworthiness in the eyes of the local populace throughout the operation the tacticallevel commanders from section commander upwards continued to insist on high standards from the local constabulary and reported violations to the upper echelons of their chainofcommand source afteraction reports from i coy 2 rcr operatton halo 315 avoidance of cultural absolutism 1 lt is possible to assume that ones societal and cultural values and norms are universal and equivalent to morals thus one may attempt to impose social constructs unsuited to the culture and society in which campaign is being conducted this is form of cultural absolutism 2 such an assumption and situation risks creating or exacerbating the perception that foreigners are trying to impose values and beliefs at odds with those of the indigenous population confusing what is morally universal e9 the right to education or responsible government with what is specific to culture and society e9 secular democracy and attempting to apply it in another culture can lead to the creation of the perception that one is seeking to impose cultural rather than societal change and will thus undermine the authority of campaign and its acceptance by an indigenous population while this perception may exist within the host nation population regardless the practice of cultural absolutism is more likely to generate feelings of illwill or cultural imperialism than would otherwise be the case 3 for example while responsible governance is considered universal human right4o it must be recognized that there can be many forms of responsible government thus secular democracy as practised in western nations may not be directly transferable to culture that does not necessarily ascribe to the notion of the separation of religion and politics however this does not mean that forms of responsible participatory government that incorporate religion the 1948 universal declaration of human rights articles 18 through 21 declare freedom of opinion expression peaceful assembly and association and pafticipatory government as universal rights these are all fundamental tenets of democracy but may be inherent in other forms of representative responsible government not considered purely democratic in the western sense 10bgl323004 tfp004coin principles into the political process should be dismissed as illegitimate if they do not violate the basic principles of responsible government another example may be found in education development lf the desires of village council is for cimic team to coordinate and provide for the construction of religious school rather than secular school this request should be granted lt is not for the military commander to decide what type of education is offered lnstead the aim is to facilitate education in general keeping in mind that development is incremental and longterm ln this case providing for religious school at the local level may allow parents and village leaders to moderate instruction at the school and avoid radicalized teachings practised elsewhere 4 lnsurgent propaganda particularly from point of moral superiority will exploit the practice of cultural absolutism by coalition forces usually by claiming that grievances and injustices are being perpetuated and that the fundamental traditional culture is being attacked 5 ln orderto avoid such situations and perceptions commanders and those planning campaign must understand the traditional tenets of the culture and society in which they will operate they must understand how their words and actions will be viewed and interpreted they must attempt to effect individual and societal change where necessary for successful outcome whilst adhering to the cultural and traditional arrangements and avoiding assumptions of cultural absolutism campaign may require changes to society but they must occur with the culture arrangements of the environment 6 lt should be noted that the domestic populations of nations contributing troops to campaign may not comprehend the importance of working within cultural constructs and expect social developments to reflect their own societys concept of development and progress the importance of working within cultural construct reflective of the environment at hand may have to be explained carefully to domestic audiences 316 politicalawareness 1 commanders at all levels and individual soldiers must be aware of the consequences of any action they may take this is especially important should an unexpected opportunity present itself to create tactical success or in sudden emergency when there is time to seek advice or direction from higher authority those with an understanding of the socio cultural and political nuances at the local level will be better able to assess the likely effect of their actions on the local populace and to make correct decisions that will reinforce the larger goals and objectives of the campaign they must be ready to sacrifice shortterm tactical success in order to support the principles of coin campaign and the operational objectives specific to the campaign 2 all ranks must be briefed on the aims of both the coin campaign and those of the insurgency and trained to recognize themes and messages in enemy propaganda along with the need to avoid feeding those propaganda messages an understanding of the issues at stake ensures that soldiers know how to reinforce the coin effort and objectives furthermore commanders and soldiers must be made to understand that success in coin is not necessarily synonymous with physical destruction of insurgents and that achieving tactical success must not take precedence over the longerterm operational and strategic goals 317 acting within the law l even though terrorists and insurgents use lawless and violent methods the government and security force response must be constrained by adherence to the rule of law operating outside the law will only fuel discontent and the insurgent propaganda machine lf the bgl323004fp004 31 icounterlnsurgency operations government and its security forces lose the moral high ground and thus legitimacy and credibility the people have incentive to support them the host nation security forces must act within domestic law while coalition forces must operate within the bounds of both international and national law as well as within the bounds of accepted international norms which may not be formally stated but nonetheless exist ln many nations the police and local military will require close supervision in order to ensure that they and their actions fall within these parameters leaders at all levels must not be reluctant to voice their concerns with respect to the conduct of local security forces both on the spot and in their reports to their chainsofcommand 318 minimum necessary forge 1 more force may be used than is necessary to achieve an aim the amount used must be reasonable and it must not be punitive once the aim is achieved more force should be used 2 the need to use minimum force is not to be confused with deploying the minimum number of troops the appearance of force large enough to contain situation at the right psychological moment may convince insurgents and other adversaries or dissidents that the authorities are well prepared and determined to deal with lawlessness 3 as in all operations commanders remain morally responsible to ensure that all ranks can apply their rules of engagement robustly and with confidence ln doing so commanders and soldiers alike must recognize the need to limit collateral damages and to only engage clearly identified threats lnsurgents will undoubtedly attack from the shelter and screen of civilian populations and soldiers must ensure that they clearly identify the threat before engaging with deadly force this must be key aspect of training 4 furthermore insurgents will execute atrocities with the specific aim of causing an overreaction from the security forces that will later be used in propaganda to undermine the credibility of coin forces and to enhance the insurgents narrative this should be kept in mind by commanders when planning sectton 4 conclusion 1 the principles and considerations articulated above are only intended to provide guidance and are not meant to be read as hardandfast rules they are doctrinal principles based on the overarching philosophy they are not dogma and should be applied with flexibility and common sense all forms of warfare evolve particularly during times of conflict and insurgency and counterinsurgency are not exceptions to this fact however the principles listed and described represent the distillation of the facts of history and provide reasonable guide for the commander to comprehend complex operational situation and develop plans that will reinforce and complement the necessary political solution to the conflict 320 bgl323004 tfp004counterlnsurgency operations chapter 4 strategiclevel considerations for counter insurgency the first requirement for fhe successful conduct of coin campaign is for the governmenf fo sef up sound framework within which it can take place general sir frank kitson sectton 1 introduction 1 ln its widest context an insurrection will be politically motivated therefore the overarching strategy to defeat the insurrection must be political while military activities will act to form part of this strategy they only encompass one arm of multifaceted campaign that uses comprehensive approach incorporating all elements of power in unity of purpose the amount of emphasis placed the militarys role will be dictated by the strength of the insurgent forces and their tactics techniques and procedures strategic and operational considerations are fundamentally different for counterinsurgency coin campaigns than for conventional campaigns they require closer cooperation with ongoing diplomatic activities and more consideration of the overarching political objectives at lower operational and tactical levels of command usually this involves the selective use of force as opposed to maximum firepower and destruction in conjunction with humanitarian and diplomatic activities therefore closer and more extensive coordination between the military and other governmental and non governmental agencies is required nonetheless whether or not an insurgency develops to the point at which there is major combat as with the chinese peoples liberation army in 1947 or the afghan northern alliance in 2002 the outcome of coin campaign will be profound section 2 the government concept 4o1 the setting 1 alliances and global security arrangements enhance the security environment through reducing the threat of attack against canada while increasing the likelihood of support from other nations also the willingness to contribute to allies both regionally and on global level has been seen as effective in containing potentially unstable situations as such working with other nations is an essential element of our foreign and defence policies here the military has proven role in maintaining international policies and relationships 2 the government of the day decides on participation in international deployments on casebycase basis considerations affecting the decision making process include canadian interests and costs risks to military personnel probability of success specificity of objectives and mission duration as well as existing commitments 3 lt is possible that national government an international organization or other lead nation faced with an insurgent threat will request assistance from canada ln the event of the government of canada agreeing to such request the canadian military may deploy force to conduct coin operations such deployment may be unilateral action or part of multinational coalition under the united nations or other leadnation or coalition arrangements 4 ln considering requesting canadian military assistance national government or the is likely to delay such request in the hope that the existing situation will improve so that bgl323004fp004 41counterlnsurgency operations outside assistance will not be necessary lt should be expected therefore that any insurgency will be well established by the time canadian troops are committed 5 even before firm commitment is made by the canadian government and most certainly immediately following any public announcement military leaders must work to ensure that the enablers and conditions needed to help ensure campaign success will be provided as stated earlier coin campaign requires comprehensive approach with the military working in support of other agencies in order to address the root causes of the insurgency the involvement of other government departments and other agencies in the campaign planning training and deployment to the campaign and their longterm commitment to the campaign will be essential for success given the militarys unique understanding of coin campaigns and the principles by which they should be conducted commanders must be prepared to take lead in encouraging the government to set these conditions for success in the campaign 402 the primacy of host nation policies 1 coin campaign must be conducted in accordance with an agreed pervasively applied national policy of the host nation hn and indigenous government they must take the lead in the campaign ln the case of failed failing or reestablished state an interim government mandate and its military campaign must be in accordance with any mandate issued by the international organization sponsoring the overall campaign and coalition 2 ln situations in which the indigenous government is nascent and only developing it must be mentored and brought to the fore in the public eye to the greatest extent possible this will give legitimacy to the campaign and to the indigenous government and ideally sense of pride and ownership amongst the populace furthermore even nascent government will be able to provide advice to coalition leadership regarding the perceptions and attitudes of its own population and their view of coalition actions 3 all actions and restrictions arising from strategic policy affecting the nation its population and resources must be carefully explained to the populace similarly the operations of the security forces must be seen to stem from national policy 403 the primacy of law 1 the legal framework within which coin operations may be conducted will almost ceftainly change from situation to situation but the primacy of the law cannot be usurped by military action where the national or mandated government maintains control of the country or parts of the country it should determine the policy and priorities for coin operations and the restoration of legitimate government 2 lf martial law or emergency powers are enacted these measures should be temporary in nature and their purpose must be clearly explained to the people of the host nation such decision must be made carefully for it will be readily exploited by insurgent propaganda as an example of the unjust policies of the government 3 these facts dictate that the highest level of government develop and distribute strategic message which pervades down to the lowest tactical level furthermore restoration of legal normalcy is decisive factor 42 bgl323004fp003strategiclevel considerations for counterl nsurgency section 3 strategic objectives 1 since insurgency is principally political struggle the ultimate objective will be achieved by combination of complementary objectives under the overall direction of the highest civilian authority these objectives which will address the root causes of the insurgency will be achieved through political policy that will develop responsible governance competent civil service and politically subordinate security forces b economic policy that will create enduring and pervasive wealth to meet basic needs and expectations c social programmes that seek to develop current and future generations and d security operations that create framework in which other elements of power may operate and foster the development of indigenous forces to assume and fulfil their own security requirements 2 ln coin campaign strategic centres of gravity will be segments of the population generally the majority and their support for the campaign there will be competition over the support or at least the acquiescence of the broad mass of indigenous peopleo the domestic populations of troop contributing nations and their will to support longterm campaign will also be strategic centre of gravity which the insurgents will try to influence mainly through attacking their will by inflicting heavy cost on the coalition forces other strategic centres of gravity may be individuals or groups who are moral centres of gravity 3 the identification of centres of gravity becomes more complex at lower levels of command where subordinate commanders must deal with regional sub regional and local political economic social and military issues and influences all activities regardless of the level at which they are conducted must work to support the strategic and operational objectives through the identified centres of gravity 4 although centres of gravity remain vital considerations in campaign and operational planning they cannot be the sole focus campaigns must focus on the strategic and operational objectives that must be reached or created in order to realize the desired endstate these objectives will be reached through or at least in relation to the identified centres of gravity given the nature of counterinsurgencies this will in many cases be conducted on the psychological plane vice only the physical plane of physical attack and defence 5 ln certain situations the insurgency itself may have become complex enough to be considered as combination of groups of insurgencies perhaps with shifting alliances and varying degrees of competition within and amongst groups the insurgency in lraq during 20042005 is an example of this although planning will require perhaps greater complexity and detail plans should continue to apply the guiding principles for coin campaigns 6 ln campaign in foreign country the objectives of the canadian military will be influenced by the policies of the host nation the government of canada and the capabilities and limitations of any coalition partners be they military or other elements of power the overall aim is to create situation in which the coalition military is longer needed and the indigenous security forces can provide reasonable level of security other agencies are capable of ot coin forces will need to gain and maintain the support of the broad mass of the indigenous populace for their part insurgents only need to intimidate or exhaust the will of the local populace to resist the insurgency bgl323004fp003 43counterlnsurgency operations operating securely and can eventually pass development and aid issues to international andor indigenous agencies and canadian involvement may be withdrawn in the confidence of an enduring solution segtion 4 threshold circumstances and considerations 1 lt is vital the political and military leaders recognize the development of an insurgency whilst it is still in its early stages during this threshold period key decisions will be made that will either alleviate the crisis and preempt the insurgency or worsen and inflame the situation ldeally the effects of decisions and actions will be carefully considered before they are implemented 2 as political and social situation deteriorates and an insurgency develops the host nation government may face series of threshold circumstances these will manifest in manner difficult to recognize as range of seemingly unrelated events such as politically motivated strikes within key industries or demonstrations with potentially subversive political undertones recognizing these actions as insurgent activity may be difficult because many of these incidents occur with subversive intent in normal times and threat of violence lndeed any related violence may be dismissed by some as simply criminal activity and an attempt made to disassociate it from any political motivation 3 although one must be careful not to assume an insurgency exists where it does not the dismissal of nascent insurgency as mere criminal behaviour is the surest way of fuelling it such dismissal adds to the insurgents narrative of subjugation and overall legitimacy and provides political leaders with an excuse to ignore the root causes of the discontent underpinning any growth in the insurgency 4 ln dealing with developing insurgency all restrictive measurescurfews and restrictions on movement or in an extreme case detention without trialplace strain on democracy and any decision to introduce them must not be made lightly lnsurgent incidents often bring public demand for extreme measures as the populace seeks security simultaneously the insurgent through his actions intends for the government military and security forces to respond in repressive manner this must be avoided at all costs as an ill considered response will heighten the effectiveness of the insurgent campaign 5 the government may conclude that combination of selective legislation and small scale precision security force operations would stand good chance of nipping the insurgency in the bud ln practice however crossing that threshold is seldom easy as sensitivity to potential domestic and international repercussions firmly inclines government towards the deferment of painful decisions 6 during this threshold period the government will monitor the situation in the strategic environment lf it deteriorates relevant departments and ministries such as national defence and foreign affairs in canada will begin contingency planning this will include informing the respective ministers of possible capabilities options and restrictions within the context of the insurgencys perceived causes and objectives from this initial planning strategic directive should be prepareda2 setting out the governments policy and objectives as the basis for campaign design and basis for the comprehensive approach to engage with political military economic and social issues the government should begin to bring together the military with ot bgg005004af000

considerations for counterl nsurgency the other elements of power and national and international organizations needed to resolve the crisis and conduct successful campaign 7 although such scenario is likely to develop gradually as the seriousness of the threat becomes obvious there are number of issues that would be particularly beneficial to military planners should the government give them early consideration these include but are not limited to formulating longterm politicalaim integrating and expanding the requisite intelligence and security services and establishing multiagency framework for the planning and conduct of security and other operations requiring civil police and military cooperation naturally such efforts would be expanded should the situation continue to deteriorate section 5 military commitment 1 guided by the national strategic directive the canadian military will develop military strategy and campaign plan which is subset of national strategy the degree of preparation enabled by this military strategy and campaign plan during this early stage will determine the ease of deployment and subsequent operations for canadian troops the earlier that liaison is established between the canadian forces government agencies coalition and localforces and the more integrated the planning that has taken place beforehand the smoother the deployment will be 2 ln the simplest of terms the aim of military intervention is to restore the situation to the point at which the host nation police and security forces are able to maintain law and order at the same time the military will provide the security framework within which other agencies may be able to operate in order to restore essential services and help develop indigenous government capacity lnitially the security situation may be such that the military must assume additional roles such as the reestablishment of essential services and emergency humanitarian relief as the security situation improves these responsibilities should be assumed by other organizations better suited to undertaking them concurrent with this must the handover of security responsibilities to local authorities ideally with police lead this will show progress lend legitimacy to the campaign and government and restore sense of normalcy in the society training and mentoring role may have to be adopted in order to develop the capability of the local security forces to assume these responsibilities 3 there is always the risk that deploying military force will replace rather than supplement local security forces this situation must be avoided in the interests of maintaining the military in supporting relationship with government police and other agencies both indigenous and international this will lend legitimacy and support to both the campaign and the local forces themselves lt will be vital that local face be given to any operation whenever possible additionally this will help preserve the security forces morale and their standing with the population they will have to serve upon the return to normalcy 4 when acting within coalition force it will remain important to coordinate activities with the local authorities this will avoid the image of occupation and ensure that an understanding of indigenous needs is gained and that planned operations and their effects are considered from suitable cultural perspective 5 when operating in supporl of friendly government the military must be seen to operate clearly in support of the civil power and not in isolation from it this can be accomplished more readily if the local security forces are incorporated into military planning whenever possible and the civil government is seen to be implementing those aspects of policy planning and control which closely affect military operations bgl323004fp003 45counterlnsurgency operations secflon 6 the withdrawal of military forces 1 the strategic endstate should describe the withdrawal of all government agencies from the campaign whilst the operational endstate will describe the conditions leading to the withdrawal of military forces 2 the withdrawal phase of military disengagement may prove problematic whilst government or military aspires to protracted conflict history provides scant few examples of shotllived counterinsurgencies there is always the potentialthat public antipathy manifest in widespread opposition to deployment and demands for withdrawal could form strategic challenge to the government and the military to maintain the morale of the public and of military elements deployed and in training to deploy the key element in achieving these objectives is strategic public affairs programme 3 potentially domestic or international settlement may allow for swift troop withdrawal nevertheless the history of coin indicates greater probability for prolonged struggle of the attrition of national will 4 because it is political struggle on both the physical and psychological planes coin campaign takes years to succeed and to reach point at which the military commitment may handover to indigenous security forces and normal force presence occur often the host nation government will only regain control of its disaffected territory area by area over time this will necessitate prolonged military withdrawal phase this fact should be articulated at the start of the strategic planning process and the campaign plan must anticipate it and reflect it 46 bgl323004fp003counterlnsurgency operations annex legal considerations in the conduct of counterinsurgency campaign 4a01 introduction 1 before any unit or component of the canadian forces cf may deploy on operations commanders at all levels need to understand the legal foundation for the pafticular mission or operation to be undertaken generally there are two legal regimes that govern the deployment of the cf on missions oroperations outside canada including forthe purpose of this manual counterinsurgency coin operations the first regime is the body of national or domestic law that provides the foundation for embarking on coin operations the second regime includes that large body of international law that governs the conduct of the cf during the execution of coin operation in another sovereign state 4a02 national or domestic legal foundation 1 there are two sources of authority in national or domestic law that provide the legal foundation for the cf to engage in operations the first source can be found in the national defence acf nda sections 31 to 34 set out the authority of the government to place members of the cf on active service either for the defence of canada or the consequence of any action taken by canada under the charter nato treaty or other regional agreements those sections of the nda also provide that all members of the regular force are liable to perform any lamul duty and that members of the reserve force may be liable for lamul duty when called out by regulations ie class b or c reserve service ln addition part lll of the nda sets out the code of service discipline cf members on coin operations are always subject to the canadian military justice system 2 the second source of authority within the national legal regime is the general authority of the government to engage in military activity under the rubric of crown prerogative crown prerogative is residual royal powerthat is currentlyvested in the governorincouncil ie the governor general of canada acting on behalf of the cabinet and provides the authority for the cabinet to order military deployments engage in international expeditions enter into international treaties and declare war without the constitutional requirement to refer the matter to parliament 4a03 international legal foundation 1 the second regime that provides legal foundation for operations abroad is set out in international law under international law canada may engage in overseas operations in any of four possible sources of authority the first source consists of the authority to conduct operations on the territory of another state by the request or consent of the host state for the purpose of coin campaigns requesting states may ask canada to provide military assistance in the form of equipment or training e9 congo in the 1960s sierra leone sudan or humanitarian assistance to the host nation e9 rwanda 2 the second source of authority is found in the charter each of chapters vl vll and vlll of the charter contain specific authority to conduct spectrum of operations with approval and in the case of chapter vlll by regional arrangement ln the majority of cases canada will only engage in operations that are approved by the or under internationally recognized regional arrangements e9 lnternational security assistance force tlsaf historically canada has not unilaterally engaged in expeditionary operations in another sovereign state bgl323004fp003 4a1cou nter i nsu rgency operations 3 third source of authority is founded on the inherent right to selfdefence either collectively or in defence of canadian sovereignty both of these legal authorities to engage in military operations are unlikely in coin situation mainly due to the level of threat and slowto evolve nature of insurgencies while unlikely it is possible that nation that is member of regional arrangement will request the assistance of another member nation to combat an insurgency e9 australian assistance to the uk coin operations in malaya 4 fourth and recently developing source of authority to engage in international missions can be found in the principle of humanitarian intervention while not universally accepted humanitarian intervention provides that state may intervene in the internal affairs of another state on the conditions that there is widespread humanitarian distress the host nation is unwilling or unable to deal effectively with the crisis and the existing international organs have failed to act humanitarian intervention must be limited in time and scope and the intervening force must withdraw once the situation is stabilized 4a04 lawful condugt of operations in coin campaign 1 once the government has decided to engage in coin operation under one or more of the authorities explained above the law of armed conflict governs the conduct of the cf during the mission lt is well settled in coin doctrine that maintaining the confidence of the legitimate government and the citizens of the country suffering the insurgency is crucial to continued military and governmental success to that end the conduct of the cf must be above reproach when engaging in operations against the insurgents any real or perceived breach of the law of armed conflict will undermine the legitimacy of the coin campaign and those forces conductingit history has shown that once the citizens have lost the confidence of the military forces engaged in coin operations their sympathies and support will be transferred to the insurgents 2 there is robust international and domestic legal regime controlling the conduct of cf units and members on operations apart from the protections offered by the domestic law of the host nation international law sets out the standard of conduct in noninternational conflicts the cf will always conduct operations within the parameters of international law for coin operations additional protocol ll ap ll to the geneva conventions provides protection to victims of noninternational armed conflict by applying the humanitarian principles found in common article 3 to the geneva conventions to noninternational conflicts 3 common article 3 to the geneva conventions is the absolute minimum standard of treatment and it states that persons not taking part in hostilities must be treated humanely and without discrimination specifically they must not be subject to violence to life or person being taken as hostages subjected to humiliating and degrading treatment lf charged with crime they must be afforded the judicial protections commonly guaranteed by civilized nations finally if wounded or sick they must be collected and cared for the standard of treatment afforded by this article also applies to those insurgents irrespective of their status under international law who have been captured surrendered or rendered hors combat by wounds or sickness 4 ln addition the chief of the defence staff cds has stressed direction to the cf to the effect that all persons detained by units or individuals of the cf must be accorded the standard of treatment provided by the 3rd geneva conventionot ie the standard of treatment afforded to prisoner of war because cf personnel will treat all captured individuals as prisoner of war irrespective of subsequent determination of their status using labels such as unlamul ot bgg005004af005 ljse of force in cf operations dated 200t0601 4a2 bgl323004fp003annex to chapter 4 combatants detainees or personnel under custody to identify captured insurgents are irrelevant for the cf members involved with the capture handling or treatment of detained insurgents 5 the greatest leadership challenge in coin operations is maintaining the moral high ground and the rule of law by resisting the provocations of the insurgents history has shown that overreaction to insurgent provocation has led to breaches of the law of armed conflict which in turn have provided valuable propaganda material to the insurgents the loss of citizen support and ultimately mission failure to avoid such situation commanders and units must be well disciplined well trained and comfortable and confident with the rules of engagement 6 while the legal foundation of the coin operation may vary from situation to situation the primacy of the rule of law must never be displaced cf personnel must conduct operations within the accepted international norms of warfare and the code of service discipline irrespective of the type of operation bgl323004fp003 443page intentionally left blankcounterl nsurgency operations chapter 5 operationallevel considerations for counterinsurgency lf the longterm political objective ls nof first in the mind of all pafticipants there will be tendency to adopt shorlterm ad hoc measures in response to insurgent or terrorist activity sir robert thompson section 1 joint and combined aspects of counterinsurgency 501 introduction 1 the planning and conduct of counterinsurgency coin at the operational level requires realization by commanders and political leaders alike that the campaign requires wide range of actors and elements of power and cannot involve the military alone lndeed in most areas of activity or lines of operation the military will have supporting role to other elements of power and international organizations 2 despite this supporting role military commanders will likely take the lead in campaign planning including the incorporation of other elements of power into the campaign plan this may occur within formal command structure within cooperative consensual arrangement or within combination of arrangements regardless the approach to the campaign must be comprehensive addressing the root causes of insurgency 502 comprehensive approach 1 the demands of coin campaign call for the application of comprehensive approach that sees the military working in conjunction with other agencies and elements of power to address the root systemic causes of crisis including an insurgency and to produce enduring outcomes in the campaign the comprehensive approach is defined as the application of commonly understood principles and collaborative processes that enhance the likelihood of favourable and enduring outcomes within particular environment note the comprehensive approach brings together all the elements of power and other agencies needed to create enduring solutions to campaign 2 many of the root causes of an insurgency cannot be addressed by military forces and require the application of international organizations and other agencies and elements of power the military must neutralize the insurgents through preemption disruption and dislocation and create freedom of manoeuvre for these other agencies lndeed once the security situation has improved and can be maintained by indigenous forces the military may even withdraw whilst these other agencies remain 3 the campaign plan must reflect this comprehensive approach each line of operation will group together similar and related operational objectives and will likely involve number of agencies ln many lines of operation the military will have supporting role at times such as in line of operation dealing with security issues the military may be the lead agency supported by other elements of powerou army terminology panel may 2007 ou for more details regarding the comprehensive approach see bgl300001fp001 land operations bgl323004fp003 51counterlnsurgency operations 4 working with comprehensive approach will require unifying theme manifested in common endstate unity of purpose and ideally unity of effort across all agencies much of this approach will be realized at the lower operational and tactical levels through military forces working handinhand with other agencies 503 comprehensiveoperations 1 military units tend to be trained organized and equipped for combating conventional threats that are similar to themselves in terms of aims structures and doctrine coin campaign necessitates somewhat different emphasis many activities conducted by military forces will seek to build confidence within local populace and to convince them to support the campaign vice the insurgents thus the military will conduct influence activities these will be activities that have firstorder psychological effects in order to affect the understanding and perceptions ie the minds of the populace and even the insurgents themselves and to ultimately affect their will and behaviour ie their hearts 2 these influence activities may be shortterm psychological operations and public affairs or longerterm civilmilitary cooperation clmlc related undertakings many stability operations such as the construction of infrastructure or the training of indigenous forces may be considered part of influence activities 3 lnfluence activities are combined with firesphysical activities with first order physical effectsto form the concept of comprehensive operations the deliberate use and orchestration of the full range of available capabilities and activities to realize desired effects the campaign theme together with the situation at hand will dictate the balance that is struck between fires and influence they are planned and conducted in synchronized and complementary manner and coordinated through manoeuvre and battlespace management see chapter 1 and figure 14 4 together fires and influence create effects on the physical and psychological planes respectively and should be planned to support operational objectives many of these influences will be conducted with or through other agencies that are best suited to meet humanitarian and governance demands thus realizing comprehensive approach see figure 51 52 bgl323004fp003strategic level planning executive authorityoperationallevel considerations for counterl nsurgency comprehensive approach multiagency lntegration comprehensive operations fires lnfluence activities across multiple agencies figure 51 the gomprehensive approach and comprehensive operations 5 the application of fires to neutralize the insurgents will ideally be done with indigenous forces in order to develop their capabilities and to enhance the legitimacy of the campaign ln conducting the engagement of the insurgents commanders must come to appreciate and avoid undesired effects the creation of collateral damage and civilian casualties for example will do much to undermine the operational objectives and overall legitimacy of the coin campaign and will greatly detract from influencing minds and hearts thus planning must be done with this in mind 6 planning of tacticallevel activities must always be done in order to support the stated operational objectives the combination of fires and influence will support the neutralization of the insurgent and the separation of him from his sources of strength fires and other physical activities will separate the insurgent from his physical support whilst influence activities through public affairs psychological operations psyops and other capabilities will separate him from his moral supporl and ideally neutralize his influence on indigenous and other populaces 7 coin will be conducted through joint and combined command intimately linked with civilian political activities and other agencies the shift in emphasis from the destruction of enemy manoeuvre forces to balance between fires and influence requires greater awareness of intelligence information and the sociocultural milieu of the area of operation ln order to gauge how influence messages will be perceived and understood and thus create the desired effect commanders must come to understand the overall environment its systems and its overall culture l commanders must consistently emphasize the minimum use of force rather than maximum firepower with consideration of both primary and secondary effects in order to maintain legitimacy and avoid providing material for insurgent propaganda all of these factors will require greater degree of cooperation and unity of effort across all agencies from all participating countries with more diverse range of civilian and security force actors to deal with than is customary to many within the military 9 structurally organizations at the operational level will mirror those civil and military arrangements created at the strategic level thus ensuring continued joint and combined integrity throughout the various levels of command military leaders at the operational level willtactical level planning execution figure 51 bgl323004fp003 53counterl nsurgency operations continue to ensure that military efforts remain subordinate to politicalcivil constraints and requirements this will hold true regardless of the shifting effort and emphasis as the insurgency evolves 10 at the operational level and below the comprehensive approach with its integration of multiple agencies to create enduring solutions to the insurgency may be realized and implemented through the creation of civilmilitary transition teamsa6 these teams or groupings combine military and other agencies to undertake wide variety of tasks that focus on reconstruction governance and development they may include range of government departments and international organizations supported by the military their overall tasks will include essential services sustainable development infrastructure and governance development the militarys role may be wide ranging particularly in the early stages but as minimum will likely include security escort liaison duties as well as the provision of expertise in fields such as engineering 11 these teams should be considered manoeuvre elements not in terms of combining firepower and movement but in terms of psychologically outmanoeuvring the insurgents to dislocate the insurgents and create lasting stability they bring customizable multifaceted capability to the campaign which will create effects in support of operational objectives they may work along single line of operation or along number of lines of operation 504 command systemsand structures4 1 the command and control structures adopted for coin campaign should include the wide variety of agencies and elements of power needed to successfully prosecute the campaign these may be formal or informal arrangements ln either case they must be based on unity of purpose and common endstate and include the various elements of power needed to address the causes and aggravating factors of the insurgency 505 single commander system4s 1 ln single command construct the chairman or director of the coordinated effort is in overall command of the campaign ln this system policy and executive authority are vested in single commander usually military officer with senior civil service police and subordinate military commanders as advisers the system requires perceptive and charismatic team building commander whether military or civilian the commander will be acting on behalf of the government and will have variety of military and civilian advisers the executive authority of ot ciuilmilitary transition team is defined as an organization designed to integrate and coordinate interagency and multidisciplinary efforts within given geographic region note lts purpose is to develop capacity in local agencies and institutions in order to promote longterm stability lt may be referred to as provincial reconstruction team prt in some theatres submitted to the army terminology panel september 2007 the use of prts during the campaign in afghanistan is an example of civilmilitary transition teams a7 this section and the concept of single and committee command structures are based in part on the work of general sir frank kitson see frank kitson bunch of five london faber and faber 1977 passim a8 recent example of single command system can be found in the australian command construct used in the regional assistance mission to solomon lslands ramsi initiated in 2003 ln this case civil servanudiplomat led the mission with the military and police elements subordinate to him in single command structure even though the military contributed the majority of the forces deployed lt is important to note however that the style of command used was highly cooperative in nature see russell glenn coin in test tube analyzing the success of the regional assistance mission solomon lslands santa monica rand 2007 54 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterlnsurgency the commander must be well understood by all subordinate commanders be they civil or military 2 single command system will best suit single nations contribution to campaign even as part of larger coalition or that of closely knit coalition 3 although single command system may exist there will be important contributors to the campaign that will not come under this command system these may be international agencies private volunteer organizations private business and nongovernmental organizations ngos ldeally they will share unity of purpose and close coordination will be common practice 4 within nations campaign contribution single command system should allow the application of comprehensive approach at all levels of command with an appropriate mix of military and civil elements of power at various levels of command see

operation in the campaign plan committees are replicated at each levelnational regional and localas appropriate 4 the police and the military provide members to the various security operations committees at each levelnational regional and localin the administrative and command hierarchy these must include elements of indigenous forces particularly if they are mature and reliable the ability of indigenous forces both police and military to provide intelligence and situational awareness cannot be underestimated 5 other elements of power such as judiciary reform institutions and infrastructure development organizations may form their own cooperative committees with indigenous input or leadership at national regional and local levels in order to coordinate and harmonize actions military forces may also be represented at these nonmilitary committees in order to coordinate support e9 engineer expertise security and transport and provide situational awareness 6 decisions are made jointly and implemented by the chairman and members through their own civil service police and military command at various levels the committees may also include lead administrators from various ngos and international bodies providing support to the operation such as the special envoy united nations high commission for refugees unhcr coordinator etc the structure of the committees must be flexible and altered to suit the circumstances at hand national police command and civilian intelligence agencies both indigenous and foreign may be able to support 7 while the committees at various levels will guide and coordinate operations military commanders at all levels must be prepared to exploit fleeting opportunities in order to do damage to the insurgency movement ln simple terms time may not exist to refer potential military actions back to committee any military action taken however must be fully in concert with the overall strategy of the coin operation use

conduct of operations as detailed in chapter 3 must be clearly understood they form the backdrop to the campaign plan and continue to be applied through all levels of command and integrated into daily operations developing the military aspects of coin plan depends on many factors but typically involves the securing of firm base from which to operate once this base is established military forces should then seize the initiative in separating the insurgent from the supporting population in order to support the governments subsequent activities 2 the nature of coin campaign and the demand to use comprehensive approach calls for all elements of power needed in the campaign to be involved to the greatest extent possible in the development of the campaign plan bgl323004fp003 57counterlnsurgency operations 508 effegtsbased approach to campaign planning 1 an effectsbased approach will be used in the development of the campaign planot the effectsbased approach is defined as planning philosophy combined with specific processes that enable firstly the integration and effectiveness of the military contribution within comprehensive approach with other elements of power and secondly the realization of operational objectives50 ln simple terms an effectsbased approach ensures that the military activities are integrated with those of other agencies and that military activities are directly linked to operational objectivesthe results or effects of the activities directly contribute to operational objectives 2 the campaign plan for coin campaign must span considerable length of time in order to be realistic and address the systemic causes that led to the crisis once devised the campaign plan is implemented through series of operational plans that are constantly reviewed and issued on continual basis assessment of the situation the environment and campaign progress is continuous and informs subsequent iterations of the operational plan each successive operational plan adjusts operations to reflect the progress made in the campaign this is illustrated in figure 54 effectsbased approagh to operational design figure 54 model of gampaign plan and supporting operational plans 3 ln dealing with an effectsbased approach and specifically with coin campaign the normal taxonomy used in campaign planning must be expandedst the campaign plan must ot for more details on the effectsbased approach see bgl300001fp001 land operations uo army terminology panel may 2007 51 for the purposes of military lexicon effects are simply considered the results of activities they may occur as first order effects on the physical or psychological plane or on both planes when second order effects are considered for more details see bgl300001fp001 land operations 58 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for cou nterlnsurgency work towards desired and well articulated operational endstate that supports the strategic endstate and objectives such an operational endstate should envisage the termination of all or at least the majority of military involvement in the campaign and prevailing security situation that allows other elements of power to operate freely and is maintained by indigenous forces at sustainable operating level the campaign plan begins with an articulation of this operational endstate 4 from this operational endstate the commander and planning staff determine key centres of gravity operational objectives that will support the endstate supporting effects that will realize operational objectives and finally the activities assigned through the operational plans that will create those supporting effects this is illustrated in the figure below effectsbased approach planning operational endstate through to activities key centres of gravityop plan op order figure 55 model for the development of an effectsbased gampaign plan 5 the basic steps in completing such campaign plan are as follows review the sltuation the operating environment will be complex and wide range of factorspolitical military economic social including culture and religion informational and infrastructurewill need to be analyzed for their power structures and influences upon the successful outcome of the campaign this will form the broad knowledge base that will inform the remainder of the operational and tactical planning process b ldentify and analyze the problem 1 the commander and staff conduct mission analysis to establish both the mission and the operational endstate lnitial operational objectives may also be identified bgl323004fp003 59counterlnsurgency operations 2 the staff conducts detailed evaluation of the factors building upon the broad knowledge base based upon the operational endstate and objectives centres of gravity may be identified other operational objectives and the supporting effects needed to create them may also be identified at this point 3 the commander and senior staff conduct analysis of the factors to discern the major building blocks of the campaign plan they will select and analyze the centres of gravity that dominate the situation along with their critical requirements and vulnerabilities furthermore they will confirm the desired operational endstate based on the key centres of gravity the commander will determine the operational objectives needed to achieve the endstate analysis will occur throughout in order to confirm the validity of decisions at this point the commander should have identified coherent operational objectives focused on the operational endstate and addressing the key centres of gravity the commander will issue planning guidance to his staff frame the campaign plan and lnitial operational plan oplan with the building blocks decided the campaign plan may be devised 1 forthe campaign plan operationalobjectives may be grouped into thematic lines of operation which allow commanders and staff to visualize the progress and direction of the campaign the lines of operation will indicate where the military has primacy and where it supports other instruments of power note that all lines of operation regardless of the primary agency involved move towards the operational endstate once this framework is established commanders and staff may determine supporting effects or decisive points that create the operational objectives measures of effectivenesss2 are also determined commanders and staff must realize that many of the desired effects in coin campaign will take extensive periods of time to realize for they relate to changes in understanding perceptions and will mainly in relation to supporting campaign 2 whilst the campaign plan depicts the longterm process the nearterm requirements to commence the plan must be considered thus the campaign plan is initiated through an operational plan oplan which is updated and adjusted regularly to meet changes to the environment see figure 54 the commander and staff select the decisive points that are most relevant to the immediate situation and that must be achieved before others can be achieved selection and prioritization of decisive points will generate options each of which will provide potential framework for an oplan based on his intuition the commander will select an option to decide which decisive points will be developed first broad outline

that will lead to the realization of the decisive points courses of action may be developed and compared in terms of activity resources time and space course of action coa evaluation each potential coa is evaluated and compared using number of means in order to determine the most feasible and likely of success ln doing so the validity of selected decisive points may also be examined to determine if they are deliverable and realistic within the constraints of resources commanders decision and plan development once the coas for the oplan have been compared and assessed the commander may select or develop the coa most likely to be successful in terms of creating the required decisive points supporting effects 6 the extant taxonomy for campaign planning must be expanded beyond the concepts dealing with conventional forces linked to geographical features and become broader concepts in order to support the objectives and environmental issues relevant to coin campaign the expansion of campaign planning taxonomy should incorporate the need to create operational objectives that involve more than simply military forces operating against other military forces lines of operation should be considered as thematic groupings of operational objectives and their supporting effects they connect and drive activities to meet operational objectives and ultimately the operational endstate in relation to identified centres of gravity centres of gravity remain vital in the development of campaign plan and will dictate the development of operational objectives53 1 centres of gravity should be considered capabilities based on groups or individuals that can create effects they may be physical such as an enemy armoured reserve or they may be moral such as charismatic religious leader centres of gravity will have characteristics and localities of importance but must be considered as capability to be affected or influenced 2 centres of gravity at the strategic and operational levels must be identified and considered in the development of the campaign plan 3 generally within coin campaign strategic centres of gravity are populations and their support of the campaign the population of the region or nation in question is centre of gravity over which the insurgents and the coin elements will fight for support the domestic populations of any troop contributing nations will also be centres of gravity which the insurgents will attempt to intimidate and convince not to suppott the campaign tt allied administrative publication aap 6 defines centre of gravity as characteristics capabilities or localities from which nation an alliance military force or other grouping derives its freedom of action physical strength or will to fighte b bgl323004fp003 511counterl nsurgency

seek to create the conditionsa respons ible government sustai nable infrastructure etcthat wi i i gai n and hold their suppoft 5 at an operational level centres of gravity may be regional governments and leaders whose competence and legitimacy in providing support and security to their populations will be vital other centres of gravity may be regional groups or tribes whose support withdrawn from an insurgency may be key to longterm success 6 ln attacking or defending these centres of gravity there will be req u i rement for comprehensive operationsthe synch ron ized combination of fires and influence activities lnfluence activities through public affairs psyops cimic and presence profile and posture are particularly important in terms of convincing populationbased centres of gravity to reject the insurgency and supporl the coin campaign5o c operational objectives will not necessarily be terrainlinked objectives but more in the nature of decisive conditions that have both physical and psychological dimensions they may be military and security related or they may be related to governance civil institutions and infrastructure thus many operational objectives will be reached or created by other elements of power with the military in supporting role or providing security and perhaps given an early security situation initial work operational objectives are the key building blocks of the campaign d decisive points may be considered those supporting effectsresults of activitiesthat build to the operational objectives for example if based on desired endstate an operational objective is the creation of competent politically subordinate military force decisive point or supporting effect required for this objective may be the creation of military training centre and professional nco corps this supporting effect can then be created by the assignment of tactical activities in particular those dealing with security sector reform see figure 55 several decisive points or supporting effects will likely be required to achieve an objective activities are tactical activities and tasks assigned in order to create supporting effects or decisive points that together will realize operational objectives ln this manner tactical activities are not conducted out of hand or from preconceived template but are directly related to operational objectives 7 once operational objectives have been identified they may be grouped together in thematic lines of operation the figures below indicate an example of lines of operation for campaign u for more details with respect to

although the development and conduct of coin campaign at the operational level will follow the same general process as that for any other campaign there are several aspects that warrant special consideration these are reflective of the philosophy and principles unique to cotn 2 the importance of these unique aspects orfactors cannot be overstated failure to understand and consider them will ignore the principles for coin and thus potentially lead to campaign failure 510 collaborativeplanning 1 by its vary nature coin campaign will require comprehensive approach so that elements of power other than the military may address and solve the underlying causes of the insurgency and morally separate the insurgency from its legitimacy and support base thus many lines of operation and operational objectives will not only involve other agencies but those agencies may well be the lead element 2 to this end these other agenciesbe they government departments international organizations or ngos entering into the campaign in spirit of cooperationshould be involved in planning for the campaign this will pose some challenges to agencies including the militarye_l nr ii counn i i ercviaeo

counterlnsurgency which are accustomed to working in isolation or working without formal plan at the operational level military commanders may have to take the lead and carefully explain to other organizations the reasoning and process behind collaborative campaign planning this will be necessary whether the campaign hierarchy is based on single command system or committee system 3 ln the early stages of the campaign the security situation may be such that only the military forces are able to operate ln such cases some lines of operation that would normally have civilian agency lead may be assumed by the military in order to commence work to develop legitimacy for the campaign and to garner public support through the demonstration of tangible progress restoration of essential services may be case in point ln such cases the military activities should be supportive of likely future work by other agencies collaborative planning before the deployment will help ensure this complementary aspect of activities 511 operational centre of gravityinsurgent support 1 strategically small number of centres of gravity will exist within the nation itself these will likely be limited to the following possibilities the bulk of the population their support for the coin campaign and their rejection of the insurgency b the host government members and structures and their perceived legitimacy amongst the populace their capability and their physical and moral superiority to the insurgents andor c any individual national leader who has pervasive influence across the nation as moral centre of gravity 2 gaining the support of the population will require effective political action safe and secure environment and socioeconomic programmes that serve to substantively improve the daytoday lives of the people 3 operational centres of gravity for insurgents will likely be various groups of individuals who support the insurgency this may be particular tribe or clan in region known to forego recognition of central government or one that has been marginalized by central authority another operational centre of gravity may be an external supporter supplying resources to the insurgent forces 4 each centre of gravity will have to be analyzed in order to determine its critical requirements and critical vulnerabilities these may be physical moral or combination for example specific tribe supporting an insurgency may have done so out of historic marginalization by central government lf assessed as an operational centre of gravity it may be neutralized through number of means its grievances regarding political marginalization may be solved through political reform its moderate leaders motivated and their images enhanced through psyops the tribes tactical capabilities destroyed and hard line leadership either destroyed or marginalized to the point that they are longer influential thus combination of fires and influence will be used to neutralize adversary centres of gravity 5 lt is from operational centres of gravity that the insurgents draw their freedom of action physical strength and portion of their will to fight although campaign planning must support the overarching effort against the insurgents strategic centre of gravity operationallevel leadership must determine the relevant operational centres of gravity analyze them and determine how best to neutralize them methods of neutralizing these centres of gravity may include destruction or disruption of insurgents higher command and control structures removal bgl323004fp003 51 5counterlnsurgency operations of fear of reprisals amongst the general population or influence activities seeking popular support and legitimacy such as the provision of utilities and medical aid to society at large 6 analysis of operational centres of gravity will involve the same general process as any centre of gravity analysis however greater emphasis must be placed upon centre of gravity capabilities and vulnerabilities on the psychologicalmoral plane for the operational focus must be on influencing groups of people to reject the insurgency such an analysis will help inform the development of operationallevel objectives and subsequent decisive points supporting effects and activities this will require immense support from the intelligence community in terms of identifying and analyzing the various factors and influences in the environment in order to understand how best to engage physically and psychologically these centres of gravity and alter their behaviour in manner desired 7 once this analysis is done it will ultimately inform shape and focus tacticallevel activities and their links to operationallevel objectives ln all cases the indigenous population is the primary centre of gravity because insurgency can survive amidst the hostile terrain of an unreceptive public other centres of gravity may include but are not limited to sources of financing weapons and munitions groups of supporters and their motivations and political conditions that fuel public grievances higher headquarters and national sources can provide valuable intelligence and information but will seldom be able to provide information of the requisite quality to conduct tactical operations the operational planning process will therefore dedicate significant amount of effort towards acquiring the information necessary to target the insurgents centre of gravity 512 development of the campaign plan 1 once the centres of gravity and their critical vulnerabilities and requirements have been identified and analyzed operational objectives lines of operation decisive points supporting effects and activities to meet those decisive points may be determined ln short the campaign plan may be developed 2 part of this process should include an analysis of the insurgents own campaign plan this will be part of the intelligence assessment lt should determine the insurgents aims intents and strategic and operational schemes of manoeuvre and thus should allow commanders to identify likely lines of operation and objectives for the insurgents ln turn the coin campaigns planned objectives lines of operation decisive points and activities should seek to counter insurgent lines of operation and preempt dislocate and disrupt the key pillars of the insurgent campaign plan some of those key pillars will be to target friendly centres of gravity the commander must be aware of this fact and consider what actions may be required to counteract these insurgent efforts 3 specifically insurgents will try to capitalize on the role public opinion plays in democracies and will deliberately stage events and coordinate operations to undermine the will of domestic audiences of campaigning nations in order to cease their participation in the campaign the domestic audiences of these nations and their support for the campaign are strategic centres of gravity that the insurgents will attack plans must be made and activities conducted to defend these centres of gravity paft of this battle will consist of proactive public affairs policy that seeks to highlight the legitimacy of the campaign to indigenous domestic and international audiences and above all ensures that the domestic audience of campaigning nation receives accurate and timely information regarding the campaign 51 6 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterlnsurgency the support of the domestic public is critical to sustaining any coin campaign the cf is tasked to undertake and is therefore friendly centre of gravity technology now allows insurgents to more easily coordinate actions and effects and directly target the will of the public of coalition partners domestic public opinion can and will be targeted number of ways including media releases and interviews with western media outlets attacks timed and coordinated to coincide with specific events in coalition countries and strategies aimed at causing rates of attrition unacceptable to coalition members there are many historical and recent examples of insurgents targeting the will of an adversarys domestic public general vo nguyen giap specifically created strategy that would target the will of the american public during the vietnam war more recently the madrid train bombings on 11 march 2004 likely altered national election outcomes and led to the withdrawal of spanish troops from lraq at both the operational and strategic levels planners must anticipate and plan to counter enemy lines of operation targeting friendly centres of gravity sources michael hennessy strategy in vietnam the marines and revolutionary wartare in t corps 19651972 westport ct praeger 1997 pp128129 4 ln short the insurgents too will seek to influence key target audiences thus the commander must anticipate this with combination of defensive and offensive information operations influence activities the former will seek to protect domestic populations supportive indigenous groups and friendly forces from the insurgent propaganda and explain the nefarious motivations of his actions and atrocities the latteroffensive influence activities will seek to convince neutral or unsupportive target audiences to reject the insurgency and its aims 5 alloperational objectives decisive points and related activities of the campaign plan should seek to undermine the physical and moral strength and legitimacy of the insurgents given that the successful outcome of coin campaign is linked to the psychological disposition of population to support or reject an insurgency destruction of the moral superiority and legitimacy of the insurgent must underpin all operational objectives supporting effects and tactical activities ln doing so the military will have supporting role to other agencies and elements of power that can address social grievances build campaign legitimacy and convince the populace to invest in and support the campaign 6 the various lines of operation for coin campaign will depend upon the thematic groupings of the operational objectives they may include such themes as security governance and social and economic development to name only some possibilities these will be broad lines of operation containing number of operational objectives and their related decisive points for example governance line of operation may include objectives and decisive points in the area of economic and government development the civil service the judiciary and the penal system line of operation dealing with security may include objectives and decisive points regarding the military paramilitary constabulary civil defence and border security to name just few possibilities see figure 58 below many of these will of course require elements of power other than the military to be successful thus the campaign plan will incorporate comprehensive approach 7 once the campaign plan has identified the operational objectives and required decisive points or supporting effects then successive operational plans will assign the tactical activities needed to create the decisive points and subsequent objectives bgl323004fp003 517counterlnsurgency operations notevre some decisive points may not be necessary depending upon the progress of campaign governance security political process reconstruction

supporting and transitory role of the military 1 throughout the coin campaign the military will generally have supporting role lt will undertake actions to neutralize the insurgentthrough preemption disruption and dislocation in order to allow manoeuvre space and freedom of action other elements of power need to bring successful end to the campaign 2 depending upon the security situation in the early stages of campaign the military force may be the only element of power capable of working in the environment thus it will be the supported force and will initiate action along as many lines of operation as possible much of this will be undertaken to neutralize the insurgent and seize the initiative but also to begin to 51 i bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterlnsurgency gain the understanding and support of the indigenous population thus the military can expect to undertake combination of offensive defensive and stability activities 3 offensive activities will seek to seize the initiative from the insurgent and preempt and disrupt his activities and influences defensive activities will seek to protect vital points vulnerable elements of the population and the force itself stability activities will seek to disrupt the influence of the insurgent through area security and control thereby establishing the conditions for other agencies to begin work and undefiake initial reconstruction governance and security sector reform ssr tasks in order to gain the support of the local populace 4 as the security situation improves the ability and requirement to conduct stability operationsactivities will increase and the military can expect to hand over some responsibilities to other agencies be they police or civilian lt should also allow other lines of operation beyond the militarys capability to commence ldeally as the security situation continues to improve greater proportion of the stability activities including security and control will be assumed by other agencies be they foreign international or indigenous ln the later case this will also occur as indigenous capabilities are developed see figure 59 nonmilitary agency contributionll t military contribution to stability operationsactivities figure 59 lllustration of transition of stability operations to other agencies 5 early involvement of those other agencies in the campaign plan will ensure that initial military efforts in reconstruction governance and security sector reform are done in accordance with longterm objectives although commanders cannot assume this transition too early in the campaign the sooner it begins to occur the greater will be the legitimacy of the campaign for it should indicate an improvement to the security situation and government action to address the root social andor economic causes of the crisiscampaign transition bgl323004fp003 51 9counterlnsurgency operations 514 the subordinate role of fires and their physical effects 1 as discussed in earlier sections the philosophy and principles of coin campaign demand that the enduring solutions to an insurgency will require campaigning elements to address the root and systemic causes of the insurgency and to not only physically neutralize the insurgent but to morally separate him from his support base and the population in general together this will gain and hold the supporl of the mass of the populace and eventually cause the insurgency to wither 2 to this end offensive operationsfires and their physical effectswill only go so far regardless of how many successful engagements occur it is highly unlikely that the insurgency will succumb in permanent sense to attrition lndeed such attempts will likely drive more individuals to the insurgency and provide additional support for the insurgents narrative and propaganda this will be magnified in certain cultures that practise an eyeforaneye sense of retribution and justice 3 the successful outcome of the campaign will require greater emphasis on activities that influence wide variety of target audiences be they groups of individuals or key leaders who may be moral centres of gravity the influence activities should seek to gain the support of the populace and will include in large measure stability activities that will solve the root economicsocial causes of the insurgency address political and civil development and enhance domestic services and security forces other influence activities through psyops and public affairs should seek to preempt and dislocate that of the insurgents and protect the indigenous and domestic populations from insurgent propaganda properly conducted these influence activities may even convince certain portions of the insurgent group to either convert to support the coin campaign or at least enter peaceful negotiation process 4 such influence activities will take extensive periods of time even years to produce tangible results this will be change for commanders accustomed to seeing the immediate results or effects of fires who may demand immediate feedback considering the possibility of relatively short period of time in theatre however acceptance of this subordination of fires and the realization that measures of effectiveness for influence activities take considerable time are essential for success in coin campaign 5 ln light of this then the operational plans through which the longterm campaign plan is realized should not seek to resolve the campaign within narrow time frame lnstead they should analyze the current situation and environment and seek to make incremental progress towards the desired endstate that will set the conditions for the next operational plan to be issued 6 the aim of military operations is to create security framework that assists the host nation government and other agencies in reasserting control throughout the country and in creating enduring solutions to the crisis lt is imperative that the civil administration be able to provide public goods and seruices in order that the people are given proof of the governments legitimacy and capability to govern security framework that preempts dislocates and disrupts insurgent activity is crucial enabler in achieving this imperative 7 the military commanders task will not be as straightforward as is likely during conventionalwarfare the operational planning process must take account of wide range of political economic civil and security interests this will ensure that the correct target audiences are engaged through the appropriate influence activities that also take into account cultural perspectives these realities are reflected in the way in which operations are subject to the approval of the civil administration through the joint committee system or single command system ln most instances the operational plan will aim to isolate and neutralize the insurgents 520 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterlnsurgency both morally and physically through simultaneously conducted and parallel political social and military activities 515 understanding effects of activities and the compression across levels of command 1 the nature of coin campaign sees the main effort focused on gaining and holding the support of the majority of the populace in contrast to them supporting the insurgents will and endstate tactical activities even at the lowest levels in coin campaign generally occur amongst the populace for two reasons they and their vital points must be secured against insurgent attack and insurgents tend to hide and operate amongst the populace thus the effects of tactical activities are viewed and felt immediately by the very centre of gravity over which insurgents and counterinsurgents are fighting 2 result then is compression across levels of command in which tactical activities may have operational and strategic level effects thus the conduct of soldiers at checkpoint for example may influence the perceptions of the whole populace with regard to the campaign and its legitimacy 3 this compression across the levels of command must be understood at all rank levels the need to consider and avoid undesired effects such as collateral damages and civilian casualties that will undermine campaign legitimacy and popular support must be considered in planning and avoided at times risks must be taken or shortterm tactical success must be forsaken in order to avoid possible outcomes that will undermine support for the campaign 516 war gaming 1 operational plans and their tactical activities must be war gamed in the same fashion as those for campaigns against conventional adversaries however the factors that must be considered in such coin war gaming are more extensive and complicated 2 planning and subsequent war gaming must consider the political military economic social including religious and cultural information and infrastructure related systemsss in the environment along with the influence that each system will have on the outcome of the operation and campaign power structures and influential individual leaders must be identified and considered in the war gaming additionally other agencies and their reactions to operational plans and activities must be considered 3 to this end war gaming will be fairly complicated with staff and ideally experts and advisors considering the planned activities from the viewpoint of these various environmental systems and gauging their respective reactions such reactions must be informed by the cultural perspective of the environment or group under consideration forthis purpose cultural and political advisors may be included in the war gaming process 4 ln this way proposed courses of action at the operational and tactical levels may be considered in detail and in perspective of the local environment in order to help ensure that desired effects both physical and psychological are obtained and undesired effects are avoided uu this range of environmental systems may be abbreviated as pmesii systems bgl323004fp003 521counterlnsurgency operations sectton 3 implementation and execution of the campaign plan 517 expanding the campaign presence physically and psychologically 1 the operational plans that are issued to implement and execute the campaign may be prosecuted in number of ways the concept of the campaigning coin forces and with them their security and control and other agencies working to the same end spreading like tache dhuile or ink spot over the contested environment is an effective practical and methodical manner of achieving success in the campaign ln simple terms it sees the expansion of the campaign and its influences both physically and psychologically throughout the environment gradually dislocating the insurgent from his physical and moral support bases this is particularly effective when parts of territory or nation have been lost to insurgent control 2 the process of spreading the presence and control of the government and its campaigning forces requires the comprehensive approach of all elements of power this will thus address the security and social issues inherent to the insurgency and in turn will build legitimacy for the campaign and its forces and begin to influence the local populations to accept and support the coin campaign 3 ln keeping with the philosophy and principles of coin political engagement will lead followed by simultaneous military and socialeconomic engagement all should be advertised and explained through information operations to the public audiences in order to influence the understanding perceptions and will of the indigenous populations and to win their support for the campaign 4 at every stage of the campaign plan implementation local forces and agencies must be seen to be in the lead and at the forefront to the greatest extent possible this will enhance their legitimacy and undermine insurgent claims that the coin campaign is an occupation every advance of the ink spot should be done in consultation with national regional and local authorities as appropriate 5 as the deployment and manoeuvre of military forces cause insurgent activity and presence to be preempted dislocated and disrupted in new area other agencies but possibly the military initially must undertake activities to relieve suffering provide aid and essential services address grievances and generally gain support for the campaign thus together this will involve fullspectrum operationssimultaneous offensive defensive and stability operations 6 the manoeuvrist approach taken to preempt dislocate and disrupt the insurgents will involve both fires and influence activities information operations on the physical and psychological planes as detailed below fires or physical activities will physically separate the insurgents from the populace by preempting their plans dislocating their forces and presence in population and disrupting their activities fudhermore military forces will directly target the insurgents in order to destroy or deter them and their influences whenever possible such activities must be done with longterm view of securing the population allowing for the return of normal levels of civil activity and deterring further insurgent actions b lnfluence activities will seek to shape the understanding perceptions and the will of wide variety of targetsbe they adversary friendly or neutralin order to gain and maintain support for the campaign 522 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterlnsurgency 1 psyops through such means of radio stations and public messages will inform the indigenous population as to the purpose of the mission and seek to undermine the narrative of the insurgents 2 public affairs will support national and international media to ensure the truth is presented in public forum regarding the expansion of the campaign and actions taken to support and protect the populace 3 cimic related projects will address essential services emergency aid and other projects that will quickly impact upon the wellbeing of the populace alleviate suffering and gain their support for the campaign 4 the profile presence and posture of the forces particularly those providing framework security presence amongst the public must be carefully considered forces should present hard targets to insurgents but be accessible to the population at large apart from gaining support this may induce flow of information on insurgent intentions and activities 7 ln such manner the insurgents will become not only physically but psychologically separated from the local populace see figure 510 518 securing firm base and initial government planning 1 lt can be anticipated that the host nation government will have sufficient control of its territory to provide secure base where reinforcing coalition contingents can build up and establish essential support elements lf this is not the case an initial entry into the nation may establish firm base or one can be found amongst supportive element of the populace 2 consideration must be given to not overburdening the host nation with demands for administrative support this can be best achieved through increased selfsufficiency by the deploying units lncoming military formations and units should be deployed on the same geographical basis as the hostnation security forces corresponding with the boundaries of the civil administration lt is possible however that the situation is deteriorated to such an extent that area is safe from insurgent activity lt may therefore be necessary to hold some logistic assets afloat or in third country while troops are committed to secure base area from this secure area troops are deployed into hostile territory to begin the process of reestablishing control and security arca by area 3 from this firm base the coin forces will conduct planning in cooperation with the federal andor regional political and civil authorities this plan should layout the process for spreading control and presence into the next area to be secured such plan must take comprehensive approach and take into consideration all aspects of engaging in the new area using comprehensive operations to physically dislocate and preempt the insurgents and to psychologically dislocate and disrupt them 519 engagement of the lower levels of government 1 once the plan has been agreed to by the national or higher regional government the expansion into the new district or area may begin this expansion should have an indigenous government lead to it ln beginning to make this expansion the following should be undertaken or considered key leaders in the area or district are engaged to develop plan customized for that region and the group or groups of people contained within it this bgl323004fp003 523counterlnsurgency operations engagement must incorporate all leadersbe they elected appointed or traditionalthat wield influence and power within the population the leaders will be able to identify the grievances and issues unique to that area the expectations of the populace and the intent and capabilities of the insurgents in that area b comprehensive approach must be incorporated from the outset which sees the military and other agencies planning the expansion handinhand with local leaders thus engagement of the local leaders must be conducted with all elements of power represented planning may follow the lines of operation developed in the campaign plan any committee system established at the higher national levels may be replicated at this local level in order to harmonize information and plans between levels of government formal committee should be established and regular meetings planned this will support the coordination of all campaign activities be they offensive defensive or stability c specific assembly or committee may be developed with local stakeholders and power structures in order to identify the needs of the local populace from their perspective this may include shortterm projects andor longterm developmental undertakings d an information operations influence activities programme must be planned to advertise immediately to the populace this cooperation between indigenous government and coin campaign forces lf not already present indigenous police forces must be brought into the area those already there should be enhanced if necessary these local constabulary forces must be integrated into the local government and into the campaign plan wherever and whenever possible they should have the lead in operations f quickimpact cimic projects may be conducted in order to relieve serious suffering quickly gain the support of local perhaps wary populace and to build campaign legitimacy military forces may undertake some of these projects particularly if they are the only agency in the area this will include simple but effective measures such as emergency medical care medical clinics in villages or neighbourhoods repairs to schools or orphanages andor delivery of aid g ln addition to quickimpact projects longterm development planning must begin the root causes or grievances of the insurgency likely result from long standing and complicated social political and economic issues that may be difficult to resolve this may require extensive development in such areas as infrastructure economic development and political reform h auxiliary security forces should be recruited and developed in these newly secured areas this will add legitimacy to the campaign help provide enduring security and help ensure security vacuum is not created once campaigning forces move to the next area such forces will require significant support but will likely be able to provide excellent situational awareness and intelligence within their areas the raising and training of these forces should not be done as an ad hoc measure once security forces arrive in the new area but should be part of the plan from the beginning and forces specifically designated for this training and mentoring role should be allocated i simultaneous to the political engagement will be the establishment of security force presence in the new area ldeally this will include an indigenous element 524 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterl nsurgency the forces will establish form of fonruard operating base fob within the area in order to support and realise the physical and psychological dislocation of the insurgent from the populace these security forces will support other agencies and provide the security framework for their operations ldeally initial expansion will occur in areas traditionally loyal to the central government where the population will readily rally back to its allegiance once it feels secure from insurgent actions and retributions 1 the selection of the area of the fob must be one that can be consolidated quickly and used as base for further operations designed to link up with the initialfirm base and be able to spread government control and influences to other areas 2 although an fob is necessary whenever possible military forces should live and work amongst the population although the security situation must be somewhat stabilized for this to occur and that such practice may entail higher level of risk to personnel it is the only sure way of developing solid relationships with the communities the security forces are trying to protect the constant and prolonged use of fobs will create in the minds of both the campaign forces and the indigenous populace fortress mentality and posture that physically and psychologically separates the security forces from the population this fact and perception must be avoided 520 clear area of insurgent presence and influences 1 once security forces have moved into an area and are supported by political plan and scheme of manoeuvre in conjunction with indigenous forces measures may be taken to clear the area of insurgent presence and influence 2 lnfluence activities information operations must be exploited to morally separate the insurgents from the populace this requirement to gain the support of the indigenous population must be understood down to the lowest rank levels and all operations must be conducted with the ultimate goal in mind 3 daily contact with the local populace must also be used to gain valuable information regarding the insurgents their aims and methods as well as any reasons as to their support amongst the populace this will support the pursuit and engagement of the insurgents and inform other activities that will seek to undermine the moral claims of the insurgents and address root causes and grievances 4 combination of offensive and defensive operations will be used to directly pursue and engage the insurgents where deemed prudent special forces may be used to conduct direct action56 5 wherever and whenever possible indigenous forces should be seen to lead such offensive and defensive operations lf still developing they may have to be mentored and continuously trained by specially designated observer and mentoring teams even if local forces are in developing stage they should still be involved and certainly consulted in terms of 56 direct action is defined as shortduration strike or other smallscale offensive action by special operations forces or special operations capable units to seize destroy capture recover or inflict damage to achieve specific well defined and often time sensitive results aap 6 bgl323004fp003 525counterlnsurgency operations situational awareness and intelligence information requirements particular caution may need to be used when considering the operational security limits and challenges of indigenous forces 6 local police must be developed and exploited as greatly as possible they bring sense of normalcy to the indigenous population and are significant sources of intelligence regarding local insurgent groups and their support bases this is particularly true since insurgents often stem from or work with local criminal organizations about which police forces should have detailed knowledge as the security situation improves the role and presence of indigenous police forces should be raised in order to give visible sign of improvement and to free up military forces for other duties 7 depending upon the situation and capabilities of the constabulary local police forces may be able to take the lead in pursuing and arresting insurgents whilst military forces assume the manpowerintensive tasks of vital point security and routine patrols 521 government lead in the return of displaced persons 1 once designated level of security and stability has returned to the local area national and regional governments may take the lead in the return of refugees and internally displaced persons ldps 2 this must be handled carefully any underlying cultural or ethnic tensions between competing groups must be managed and alleviated as well these groups cannot be returned without coherent and comprehensive plan that provides for their continued security as well as for their welfare and sustainable employment displaced refugees will not stay nor even begin to return if they cannot feel secure and have means of supporting themselves 3 the return of refugees and ldps will not only be sign of returning normalcy and security but will breed additional security through their presence and support of the campaign 522 cimic activities by the military 1 even before nonmilitary agencies arrive in the area to begin longterm development projects military forces may begin the process to alleviate suffering spark development and gain campaign support measures will involve quickimpact projects such as repairs to wells and the conduct of local medical clinics remuneration for collateral damages lowlevel employment schemes such as war damage repairs and checkpoint construction and delivery of basic tools for work and agriculture 2 much of these cimic activities should be planned in advance and started as soon as possible after expanding into new area many of the initial supplies may be delivered quickly to theatre having been preplanned as part of the campaign funds resources and the authority to use them should be pushed prior to the actual requirement to the unit and subunit levels so that the quickimpact cimic projects may be designed to meet the needs of the immediate local populace 3 ldeally preplanning with other agencies will allow these military lead projects to support the further development of larger projects by other elements of power in due course 523 establish lowlevel communttybased development counctls 1 the establishment of communitybased development councils will allow local leaders the opportunity to guide the development in their local areas in order to meet local grievances and needs these councils must bring together all agencies including the military and political 526 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterlnsurgency leadership this should ensure that not only are local needs met but that best use of resources is made and duplication and conflicts are avoided the committee should be able to identify and vocalize priorities and specific projects 2 although the incorporation of local leadership is vital care must be take to ensure that the support won by such development is support and legitimacy for the campaign and is not exploited by local leaders with their own agendas to gain support for themselves at the expense of the larger campaign 524 develop security presence and set conditions for sustainable security 1 development can only be supported by permanent security presence and stable state the presence of security forces must be expanded in logical and measured manner as the security situation improves security forces should be increasingly integrated into the local populace in order to avoid development of fortress disposition and mentality and to further separate and dislocate the insurgent 2 local forces must play key and ideally lead role their counsel will be vital in gaining accurate and timely intelligence from the local populace and in identifying insurgents amongst the local populace local security forces may require an ongoing training and mentoring regime 3 key to local forces will be the establishment or reestablishment of constabulary forces the presence of police forces brings certain sense of civil normalcy to population furthermore police are ideal for tackling the criminal elements and activities that routinely become part and parcel of an insurgency the expansion of police presence will see the creation of police posts and substations throughout the area which may be colocated with military forces for certain amount of time 4 security forces should begin to raise auxiliary security forces particularly such elements as auxiliary police services these will consist of locals who know their own areas and populace the best and who have vested interested in guarding stability and development this raising of auxiliary forces should be part of the overall security sector reform process ldeally police training is conducted by civilian police forces as part of comprehensive approach 525 set the conditions for sustainable development 1 once security has been established other agencies within the comprehensive approach should begin to create sustainable development agencies will include other government departments both indigenous and those of supporting nations international organizations private business and ngos the activities of these organizations must be carefully coordinated with those of the security forces through either single command system or committee system 2 just as with the security forces work towards sustainable development and improved governance should be led by indigenous and local authorities only members of the indigenous population will understand the needs and grievances of the local populace and be able to guide development in manner to address those needs and to meet local expectations without local leadership development may not meet the needs and expectations of the indigenous population bgl323004fp003 527counterlnsurgency operations 3 remediation and payment for collateral damages must be foremost in any scheme as the related grievances will be readily identified with the campaign and its legitimacy likewise any expropriation of private property must be immediately repaid and ideally should start from premise of negotiation failure to quickly repay incurred debts by the campaigning forces will undermine legitimacy build distrust of the campaign create grievances and feed insurgent propaganda 4 the disarmament demobilization and reintegration ddr process of any former military militia or insurgent forces must be carefully planned and managed in detail by both military forces and other agencies former soldiers and fighters cannot simply be disarmed and sent home without reintegration plan that will include gainful employment 5 expectation management of local populations must be carefully managed as unrealistic expectations that go unsatisfied will lead to discontent and loss of legitimacy for the campaign quickimpact projects and humanitarian aid should address shortterm needs and gain quick support for the campaign longterm development and its measured progress will have to be welladvertised to local populations ln orderto avoid initialdelays in development the campaign plan from the outset must include details for the sustainable development plans should include project details responsibilities and preapproved funding envelopes ln this manner delays that will lead to indigenous frustration and disappointment will be avoided to the greatest extent possible 526 continued campaign development and transition 1 as the security situation improves successive operational orders will continue to pass increased authority and responsibility to local security forces and agencies in each area viable improvements in each area should encourage similar development in other areas as the ink spot expands see figure 510 for summary of the process 2 the expansion of the campaign into various contested areas will seldom follow smooth and orderly fashion identical in each newly gained area regardless of how the coin campaign is conducted in detail the following key elements must be maintained political lead and engagement of acknowledged leaders in each area b the incorporation of indigenous forces ideally seen to be leading operations but as minimum done in cooperation with them and exploiting their local expertise c the simultaneous engagement through influence activities to gain the support of the indigenous population and gain the moralpsychological advantage over the insurgents and d sustainable development within carefully managed expectations based on comprehensive plan incorporated into

campaign 527 introduction 1 the conduct of any operational plan and subsequent tactical activities must be conducted in keeping with the philosophy and principles inherent in coin campaign furthermore their conduct must all lead directly to the attainment of the operational objectives delineated in the campaign plan 528 balance across fullspectrum operations 1 the simultaneous conduct of offensive defensive and stability operations that is the realization of fullspectrum operations will occur throughout coin campaign commanders must carefully balance forces and activities across these three sets of activities in order to further the campaign and reach operational objectives 2 offensive operations are conducted in order to separate the insurgents from their supporters resources suppliers and sources of information in the designated area such operations must be based on actionable intelligence and sound planning the secondary effects of offensive operations must be carefully considered so that they do not cause undue collateral damages or alienate the local populace lndeed there may be times when shortterm tactical success must be postponed in order to avoid undesired effects that will undermine the campaign 3 the resulting dislocation of the insurgents from offensive operations will allow civil administration to be reestablished essential seruices infrastructure development and improvement to governance may commence through comprehensive approach the military security forces may provide robust support to the police or be asked to help train local auxiliary forces that will support the police when military forces withdraw these newly controlled areas then provide firm bases for furlher security operations until gradually the entire theatre or nation is restored to civil government control and enduring stability 4 defensive operations will consist mainly of securing those areas from which the insurgents have been displaced they will secure base camps government institutions vital points such as key infrastructure and the population at large military forces may assume many of these manpowerintensive tasks in order to free up local constabulary forces so that they may take the lead in pursing the insurgents and their related criminal activities and linkages 5 there will be occasions when private security companies assume defensive activities these may be hired by the indigenous government brought into theatre by coalition forces or hired by ngos international organizations or private businesses lf such private security companies are considered part of the coalition their rules of engagement employment responsibilities and limitations must be cleady defined the local populace will not distinguish between campaigning forces and these private security organizations and indiscretions and illegal use of force by either will undermine the campaign and its legitimacy 6 stability operations consist of security and control activities support to disarmament demobilization and reintegration activities support to security sector reform activities support to civilian infrastructure and governance and assistance to other agencies ln due course many of these stability activities will be assumed by other agencies and indigenous government services nevertheless many stability activities such as the training of new security elements and the provision of military forces to augment the police in security patrols will require direct 530 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterlnsurgency military involvement or at least the military acting in supporting role stability activities particularly the provision of security and control will continue the dislocation of the insurgents and will attempt to preempt or disrupt future insurgent activities other stability activities such as the training of indigenous forces and the development of local governance will consolidate the insurgent dislocation and morally dislocate the insurgents by addressing root causes and grievances that support insurgent motivations and aims 7 military forces and other security forces will always be in short supply careful balance must be struck between the three types of tactical operations in order to meet the demands of situation and the operational objectives too much of an emphasis on offensive operations will allow insurgents to infiltrate amongst the populace and its vulnerable infrastructure the insurgents will thus be offered an opportunity to achieve easy successes against poorly protected vulnerable points and thus embarrass the government and undermine its support with too little emphasis on offensive operations and focus on defensive and stability operations the insurgent organization may continuously grow and an everincreasing proportion of the campaigns resources will become devoted to defensive countermeasures so that eventually the insurgents achieve their aim by making it appear that the price of further resistance is too high57 b the security and control activities and tasks within stability operations should be emphasized whenever possible as means to take measured approached to continued dislocation and disruption of the insurgents offensive activities should only be initiated on sound intelligence activities for security and control will create security framework within which the military and civilian agencies may operate and the local populace may assume routine civil duties patrols checkpoints observations posts and similar stability tasks will protect the populace and disrupt or preempt insurgent activities and movement they will gain valuable intelligence which will support subsequent selective offensive operations 529 compression across the levels of command 1 the relationship between the operational and tactical levels of command during coin operations are somewhat compressed given the focus on winning popular support for campaign actions at the tactical level can have far reaching operational and strategic repercussions activities will be conducted in public view and the manner in which routine patrols checkpoints and other tactical tasks are conducted will either support the attainment of operational and strategic objectives or undermine them the conduct of an individual soldier amplified by the media can become an issue thoughtless move or overreaction at the section or platoon level can easily have ramifications above the immediate tactical level that undermine the legitimacy of campaign and loose public support even if the majority of tactical tasks are conducted with view to gaining public support and winning campaign legitimacy the populace will remember and the insurgents will exploit those few poorly conducted tasks that undermined legitimacy measures and precautions must be taken to limit such occurrences this must be understood by all levels of command in all components including special forces 530 manoeuvristapproach 1 the record of attritionalsuccess in coin operations is generallya poorone effective coin operations place due emphasis on the intellectual and psychological aspects of s7 frank kitson eunch of five london faber and faber1977 passlm bgl323004fp003 531counter i nsurgency operations operations not simply the material they emphasize the focus on people and ideas not only on ground 2 to this end insurgent cohesion is identified and attacked by applying concentrated yet discrete force against key vulnerabilities surprise tempo and simultaneity are used to overurhelm and unhinge the insurgent attacking will and shattering cohesion and ultimately helping to create the conditions for political defeat force is applied selectively and destruction is means not an end 3 the successfulapplication of the manoeuvrist approach still has limitations in coin campaign even if coin forces are highly successful in destroying insurgent critical vulnerabilities the insurgents will and cohesion are likely to remain intact or at least be less affected than conventional enemy for insurgents are motivated by political idea and narrative the insurgents may continue to fight change tactics or simply go into abeyance and reappear at later date 4 thus the manoeuvrist approach must be expanded to include psychological attacks directly against the will motivation and cohesion of the insurgency lnsurgents must be defeated psychologically as firstorder effect and not solely through physical attacks lnfluence activities such as psyops and cimic must seek to undermine insurgent legitimacy and claims to superior political option the populace itself must be engaged with influence activities that seek to gain their support and undermine or preclude support of the insurgency 5 ln this way the manoeuvrist approach within the campaign involves blend of fires that attack the insurgents capability to ultimately affect his will and cohesion and influence activities that attack his understanding perceptions will cohesion and legitimacy directly together these fires and influence activities are synchronized through manoeuvre and battlespace management 6 furthermore classic police work will undermine insurgent cohesion by evidence gathering arrest and legal action surprise can be achieved for example through developing information by all sources then acting on the cue of intelligence gathering technology or human intelligence humint rapid exploitation of this intelligence by either covert action or rapid concentration of combat forces into given area sows confusion and disruption throughout the insurgents command structure this occurs in large part because the level of trust within and amongst insurgent cells is compromised and reduced 531 mission command 1 success in coin requires all participants to be actively aware of the longterm goals and the plan to achieve them tacticallevel commanders must be made to understand the philosophy and principles by which coin campaign is conducted the mission command approach to leadership reaffirms this view emphasizing informed initiative throughout the force this methodology is particularly applicable to coin given the key role played by lowlevel tactical commanders militarily coin is quite often platoon and section conflict 532 describing operational success in coin campaign 1 success is defined by the state of affairs that needs to be achieved by the end of campaignan endstate since insurgency is principally political struggle it may be that the desired endstate of the government and supporting nations falls short of an identifiable victory in strictly military context 532 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterl nsurgency 2 success in coin may equate to reducing the threat to point at which the situation may be passed to the civil police or simply not losing control to the insurgents lf for example the intention of committing troops is to buy time in which to address particular grievances then dramatic tactical military success may in fact be counterproductive troops must be aware of the military role which is normally supporting one and commanders should select accurate measures against which to judge the effectiveness of military tactics ground captured has much less significance in coin than it does in conventional warfighting militarily speaking operational success may equate to the containment or reduction of violence and threats to level at which the police can deal with the situation and civil society functions normally 533 destruction of insurgents 1 ln coin physical destruction of the enemy may still have an important role to play despite the best efforts of influence activities to persuade insurgents and their supporters to pursue peaceful means to affect political change there will be some insurgents who will remain committed to the violent destruction of the inplace political and social structures these insurgents must be captured killed or so physically and psychologically isolated that they are longer effective 2 attrition will be necessary but the number of insurgents killed should be more than is absolutely necessary to achieve success wherever possible nonlethal methods of neutralizing the enemy such as arrest physical isolation or subversion are more likely to advance the campaigns cause given intense media scrutiny and domestic and international legal oversight sound judgement and close control of lethal force will need to be exercised 534 attacking insurgent legitimacy 1 the political and moral legitimacy of the insurgents must be attacked if coin campaign is to be successful lnsurgencies gain legitimacy through combination of words and actions that emphasize flaws and injustices in the government or status quo while providing evidence of the insurgent narrative and ideology as viable alternative lnsurgent legitimacy must be undermined through coordinated influence activities including those aimed at specifically countering the insurgent propaganda these should aim to erode the narrative of the enemy exposing fallacies and fabrications other influence activities such as clmlc governance reform and public affairs must reinforce the legitimacy of the campaign the government and its longterm objectives 535 attacking insurgent funding 1 although many insurgencies will be fiscally supported from abroad it is important that all sources of funding within the host nation be identified and neutralized lnsurgents use funding not only for the purchase of weapons equipment and explosives but to pay informants supporters and members of the local population to be proxy fighters 2 lnsurgent funding will likely be complex and involve sophisticated networks that include international electronic banking and trading lt may also involve criminal activity such as narcotics production and trafficking and the use of fraudulent charitable organizations or legitimate charities that have been duped lnsurgent funding will also come from rather low profile and mundane sources such as pirated media sales attacking the sources of funds that support the insurgency will be complex effort that relies as much upon police and legal efforts as military activity however it is absolutely vital that such an effort be made 533 bgl323004fp003counterl nsurgency operations 536 simultaneity 1 all effective insurgent strategies emphasize simultaneity by creating parallel political and social challenges to the inplace authorities in addition to military challenges lf the use of simultaneity is productive for the insurgent then it is equally applicable for the coin effort tactically it can be achieved through the restrained and carefully considered use of and by grouping for independent action mix of agencies such as joint militarypolice patrols with compatible communications reporting to single headquarters operationally it is achieved through the development of harmonized campaign plan using comprehensive approach along multiple lines of operation this will attack the insurgents physically undermine their legitimacy and gain support of the local populace in concerted and complementary fashion sectton s the role of military service components and indigenous forces in coin 537 land component 1 the predominant service in counter insurgency is the land force although air elements often play strong suppoding role unless the insurgents are joined by an outside power with significant naval and air forces counterinsurgency will remain primarily land force responsibility with the other two services acting largely in support this reflects the nature of coin and its focus on the indigenous population lnsurgents can only be countered comprehensively through deploying troops on the ground amongst the population 2 the land force can expect to be called upon particularly at the tactical level to employ its traditional skills ranging from providing observation and security to closing with and destroying the enemy the subtle political nuances underpinning coin operations the focus on gaining popular suppott and the dispersed nature of the battlespace however require greater initiative and flexibility at the subunit platoon and section levels see chapter 6 for further discussion on the employment of land forces in coin campaign 538 air component 1 the use of the air component during various coin and peace support campaigns has clearly demonstrated the potential of advanced technology for surveillance target acquisition reconnaissance and attack of targets these capabilities have been expanded upon through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and have become significant enabler of land operations the use of air support in coin campaign has been able to be expanded and enhanced through precision weapons that have made improvements in reducing casualties and collateral damage to infrastructure near the target area 2 for coin operations fixedwing aircraft can provide the same types of supporttroop lift and resupply and photographic and visual reconnaissanceas they do for conventional operations air component capabilities can be employed for ground attack missions when confirmed targets can be found along an insurgents lines of communication and when insurgents are engaged by ground manoeuvre forces nonetheless one must not underestimate the insurgents ability to counter air power through deception reduced signature and even lowlevel air defence weapons such as manportable air defence system manpads 3 the use of air component assets to attack insurgents must be carefully considered and targets confirmed in terms of their authenticity and value collateral damages and civilian casualties will do much to undermine the campaign and its public support both indigenously 534 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for cou nterlnsurgency and abroad lnsurgents will exploit such incidents through propaganda and will be the first to ensure international media coverage 4 airland integration and battlespace management will require careful planning the nature of coin operations and the high volume of aircraft sorties available compared to conventional operations will likely cause airland integration coordination teams to be pushed to lower levels of command 5 aviation assets have obvious roles for troop carrying surveillance liaison and over watch of ground troops given the nature of coin and the dispersed nature of insurgent targets it is unlikely that aviation will be used as manoeuvre arm aviation can be used in many roles comparable to those given to armoured reconnaissance regiments such as surveillance point and area reconnaissance imagery support to intelligence economy of force tasks and command and control c2 6 aviation assets may be employed in close fire support to ground manoeuvre forces their target acquisition systems responsiveness and ability to remain in the immediate area make them valuable fire support assets 539 maritimecomponent 1 much of the worlds population lives in littoral states and in large coastal cities therefore maritime considerations may be an important factor when campaigning in such regions naval support may consist of providing deterrence and presence patrols enforcing international sanctions and blockades and providing some degree of support for troops ashore the presence of naval forces can also send strong political statement and message to insurgents and their supporters 2 naval ships may be close enough to provide timely high profile appearance to demonstrate support for threatened ally conversely naval forces have the ability to loiter over the horizon for prolonged periods providing warning to hostile elements with minimum provocation 3 they can be used in sea basing concept for command and control and for resupply of forces ashore ln addition naval air support can potentially augment the air assets in theatre 4 naval forces may also provide the initial firm base needed to support expansion into new territory this may be the initial entry or it may be an expansion further along the littoral regions of nation despite the advantages to the use of maritime resources security must be vigilant given the concentration of resources onboard ship single successful surface attack by insurgents could cause significant loss of life and material 540 special forges 1 the organization of special forces sf units the high quality versatility and comprehensive training of these troops and their capacity to work well in small groups make them particularly suitable for supporting role in coin campaigns care should be taken however that they be used to complement rather than replace conventional units 2 tasks for special forces may be wide ranging and include special reconnaissance close protection deep penetrations and covert observation in remote or difficult areas they bgl323004fp003 535counterlnsurgency operations may undertake direct actionss tasks however care must be taken that special forces do not become employed in tasks that are within the capability of line units for this would be waste of valuable resources 3 despite their capabilities and independent nature of operating special forces must be employed in line with the same principles of coin as other forces they too must understand the need to win and maintain popular support and to this end avoid collateral damages and civilian casualties to the greatest extent possible their operations must be coordinated with the local tactical commanders in whose area they are operating for these local tactical commanders know their own areas and will be left to deal with the repercussions of the operations 4 special forces may be used to train indigenous forces however this should be limited training and mentoring forces should train forces that have identical or similar roles mainly for purposes of commonality identity and mentoring thus special forces may be used to train indigenous special forces and units responsible for typical special force operations 541 indigenous security forces_police forces 1 lndigenous police forces may play valuable role in the conduct of coin mission and will be key element in comprehensive approach lndeed if competent and trustworthy they will likely have detailed knowledge of insurgent leaders and their links to criminal elements the presence of police forces particularly if seen to be leading operations will have normalizing effect on the population 2 military coin forces must be closely coordinated with police forces and military forces will likely be employed in support of police forces in order to provide security and protection for them in their routine duties ln some cases police forces may play supporting role such as the arrest of insurgents captured and detained by military forces 3 police and military forces may be colocated in stations and substations in order to conduct joint operations and to afford the police additional protection particularly in the early stages of campaign 4 the role of police in the host nation and the level of employment of those police are often dependent on the competency of the police force and judiciary and their reputation amongst the population for example if police force or judiciary is regarded as corrupt the people will have little trust that the police will have the best interests of the people in mind or that the force can provide real security 5 military forces may be used at least initially in campaign to train indigenous civilian police ldeally this responsibility will be assumed by supporting police forces so that they receive proper mentoring and training in all aspects of police duties nevertheless the military will continue to work closely with police forces and mentor them when necessary 6 close and routine coordination with police forces will also provide valuable intelligence sources joint intelligence and analysis centres may be established in order to exploit the capabilities and resources of both military and police forces 58 direct action is defined as shortduration strike or other smallscale offensive action by special operations forces or special operations capable units to seize destroy capture recover or inflict damage to achieve specific well defined and often time sensitive results aap 6 536 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for cou nterl nsurgency 7 as security improves police forces should assume greater role and profile amongst the populace this will enhance the sense of civil normalcy and free up military forces for other duties lt will also increase the sense of campaign success and legitimacy b lt is possible that the police forces of state are not organized or controlled in manner common to responsible governance there have been many instances when police forces have been poorly organized and trained ill equipped and corrupt lndeed the behaviour of police and other security forces in nation may have been an aggravation of the crisis leading to the insurgency one must also understand the potential ramification of using former combatants as police account must be taken of these factors when planning the overall campaign and measures taken to improve these circumstances must be foremost in the minds of planners plans must be made to rectify the professionalism competency and role of the local constabulary forces lt is unlikely that nation will be considered stable without competent police force 542 indigenous military forces 1 lndigenous military forces will vary from situation to situation in terms of quantity quality and effectiveness ln terms of standing army they may be nonexistent however regardless of theirstate of existence atthe startof coin campaign theywill be indispensable in terms of creating enduring solutions to the crisis 2 lndigenous military forces if existing and supportive of the campaign will be key source of intelligence and situational awareness for campaigning forces particularly those of coalition not familiar with the local terrain people power structures and culture 3 even if still under development indigenous forces should be seen to the greatest extent possible to be leading missions against the insurgents this will indicate an attempt at local solution to the insurgency and add legitimacy to the overall campaign furthermore it will help to further develop the indigenous forces in terms of their professional skills both individual and collective 4 the lead role of indigenous forces must be respected even if they remain developing force with limitations although coalition forces may produce more effective outcome if leading the issue of establishing and maintaining campaign legitimacy and popular support is so crucial that indigenous lead should be emphasized even at the risk of losing some shortterm tactical success notwithstanding this coalition forces will continue to train and mentor indigenous forces even in the midst of operations 5 the training and development of indigenous forces will be key part of security sector reform this requires comprehensive approach with the military and other agencies working in synchronized and complementary manner to develop not only police and military forces but other aspects of security and governance such as border police prison services and judiciary services security sector reform must be part of the campaign plan from the outset and the campaign plan and resulting initial operational order should clearly annunciate the security sector reform responsibilities of each agency 543 indigenous irregular auxiliary forces 1 ln almost all coin campaigns governments have attempted to mobilize the local population to protect themselves by forming auxiliary forces when soundly based sensibly organized and properly coordinated with other units these forces have proved indispensable and indeed on occasion the key to successful campaign bgl323004fp003 537counterlnsurgency operations 2 lt is not unusual for regular soldiers to be scathing about the appearance operational efficiency fighting potential and loyalty of auxiliary forces this attitude usually stemming from an ignorance of the characteristics of auxiliary forces and misunderstanding of their motivation together with lack of appreciation of the wider issues at stake in coin campaign may have unfortunate consequences lt can hinder the proper development of auxiliary forces and their integration into the overall operational plan although the nature of these forces may differ between campaigns commanders and staff need to understand the characteristics of these forces and the requirements and problems associated with their raising training and employment 3 auxiliary forces contribute significantly to the campaign apart from providing the needed manpower to replace regular and coalition forces they have access to local intelligence and detailed situational awareness that can help support further operations they also have the advantage of having committed interest in seeing the campaign and its stability and development succeed the commitment of the local population through the raising of auxiliary forces also adds further legitimacy to the campaign 4 the government campaign to defeat an insurgency will succeed only if it wins the loyalty and support of the population the real test of loyalty is whether the people will actively support the coin campaign since this will inevitably involve risk 5 coin is expensive in terms of personnel successful campaigns may require security forcetoinsurgent ratio of up to 201 auxiliary forces help meet the personnel requirement they are particularly useful for defensive and stability operations releasing the more mobile bettertrained regular troops and police for offensive operations 6 the intimate and thorough knowledge that auxiliary forces can provide of their local area and its people considerably ease the intelligence problem they are more likely to pick up information from the network of informal contacts throughout the populace and that may even extend to the insurgent forces furthermore they will be able to advise on local power structures and provide guidance to regular commanders regarding issues of cultural or social significance which in turn will help avoid offence to the local populace 7 finally some auxiliary forces may have specialized skills developed as part of their social culture that complement those of the regular forces while they have neither the training nor equipment to operate like regular soldiers they may excel in certain skills such as tracking patrolling observation the use of ground and communicating with the local population b auxiliary forces may be employed as independent units to secure areas cleared of insurgent control given their value and skills padicularly in language and local knowledge auxiliary forces will prove highly valuable if they are used to augment regular and coalition forces 9 other security forces in an indigenous population may also help secure the gains of the campaign customs immigration border police and coastguards are all designed to control movement across frontiers and coastlines and to prevent smuggling while they tend to concentrate their efforts at officially designated crossing points they may also incorporate mobile element for patrolling unwatched sectors these services are usually well acquainted with the identities habits and routes used by the smugglers and illegal border crossers that an insurgent organization will use to move troops arms and equipment 10 the use of auxiliary forces will create challenges in operational and information security whilst care and caution must be exercised some risk may have to be taken at least in the early stages until auxiliary forces become better known element lt must be recognized that in many cases members of auxiliary forces accept considerable risk to themselves and their 538 bgl323004fp003operationallevel considerations for counterl nsurgency families in volunteering to combat insurgents therefore certain level of trustworthiness should be assumed 11 by the time coalition forces arrive for the campaign local auxiliary forces may be under considerable pressure and discouraged by insurgent successes they will need support and encouragement as well as the opportunity to play positive and constructive role in operations as areas are successively brought back under government control they will be handed over to the local administration together with its police and armed forces those auxiliary forces recruited and deployed on territorial basis near their homes will be key to securing those areas and allowing longterm development and stability bgl323004fp003

techniques and procedures ttp must remain flexible and should be altered to meet the threat and situation in theatre and to exploit any immediate lessons learned during operations the campaign plan must ensure that all tactical activities are directly linked to and work towards operational objectives although tactical operations may be planned and coordinated at the highest levels they must be controlled and executed at the lowest levels units become enablers for their subunits which in turn prosecute the tactical tasks in decentralized but coordinated fashion the battle which will involve combination of fires and influence activities creating physical and psychological effects is fought and won at the section and platoon level 4 tactical activities such as an attack will be conducted in accordance with the principles for offensive operationsto however their conduct and adherence to their own principles should not violate the overarching philosophy and principles of coin campaign to do so will undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of the overall campaign sectton 2 establishing the foothold_physical and moral 1 as with any military operation the first phase of coin campaign will likely involve establishing viable and secure base of operations unitsubunit will normally be assigned an ao in which it will be responsible for the conduct of fullspectrum operations

characteristics of the defence but adjusted for coln6r this foothold will become at least initially the base of operations for the univsubunit lt should be located on key terrain that will allow the forces to respond rapidly to any threat or incident in the ao to seize sudden opportunities and to provide constant presence in the ao although it must be defensible the location cannot be viewed as fortress on hill remote and distant from the local populace lt is critical that the soldiers integrate with the population by establishing physical and emotional connections with the population close relationships will be developed that will increase popular affinity for the government trust in the security forces and provide intelligence that can be exploited in operations these psychological or moral connections and affinity will enhance the overall legitimacy and popularity of the campaign ln short the forces will establish moralfoothold as well as physical foothold 3 whilst the commander will seek out and identify the key public figures in the area police chief constable local mayor industry managers etchuman intelligence humint counterintelligence and possibly special forces sf intelligence specialists will seek to identify and contact the actual power brokers within the social structure who may be different from the public figures 4 patrols create links with the population and are the most obvious representation of nations commitment and resolve platoon and section patrols will seek to establish contact with the average citizens in the streets and villages the tone and demeanour set by the patrols is critical and demands exemplary standards of conduct 5 certain amount of risk management must be taken to allow patrols to set this needed profile and to send the appropriate message to the populace this of course does not mean that the troops conduct themselves in relaxed manner although the patrol leader may be talking with local school children or shopkeepers other members of the patrol maintain secure stance that implies the patrol remains hard target for insurgents this blend of openness and stern professional exterior impresses the civilians gives them confidence and unnerves the insurgents who will always be watching 6 this foothold not only begins to reassure the populace and dislocate the insurgent but it begins the tacticallevel intelligence collection against which measures of effectiveness will be devised and used as the campaign progresses 7 as the situation develops other satellite camps or patrol bases may be established permanently or temporarily even at the platoon level this spreads the influence of the security forces supports intelligence collection and dislocates the insurgents this represents part of the spreading component of the ink spot or tache dhuile technique 6l for example the area will have observation posts ops standto positions and interlocking arcs of fire defensible force protection

the immediate area after quick medical inspection the detainee was transported to the nearest civilian police station and passed to their authority although it was highly unlikely that any civilian

ingenuity and proactive stance to undermine the power authority and eventually the will of the insurgent 2 commanders must be able to quickly identify and exploit those opportunities to pre empt dislocate and disrupt the insurgency and its operations opportunities will be fleeting therefore recognizing and exploiting these opportunities in timely and effective manner requires high level of tactical awareness and ingenuity ln this way the power that the insurgents hold over the local populace which is often founded on intimidation can be severed 3 ln order to be successful in attacking the insurgent on the physical and moral planes the tactical commander requires more assets independence and authority than he would normally possess in conventional operations some examples are as follows lndependence and flexibility to establish and if possible chair operational and intelligence committees appropriate to his level of command with non governmental organizations ngos coalition padners and local police and civic authorities b resources namely monetary and authority to conduct lowlevel civilmilitary cooperation clmlc and reconstruction projects in order to create an immediate

objectives d authority to conduct information operations lnfo ops that follow approved broad lnfo ops themes and messages lt is of the utmost importance that commanders be able to preempt and counter the propaganda messages of the insurgents 602 preemption 1 preemption is the taking of action so as to prevent an anticipated event from occurring ln military operations particularly coin preemption will require the seizing of opportunities before an enemy can act in order to preclude insurgent operations and to deny them advantages the insurgents may be constantly destabilized by the initiative of security force actions with both fires and influence activities psychological operations psyops deception profile posture and presence cimic and public affairs 2 preemption is facilitated by sensortoshooter link that is instituted through doctrine technology training and organization preemptive operations will depend on proactive and responsive intelligence system linked with rapid decisionmaking process in such way that the detection of an opportunity can be translated into successful outcome 3 key to preemption is covert surveillance capability at the unit and subunit level this may consist of dismounted reconnaissance assets sniper detachments or rifle platoon elements rehearsed and equipped for the task cunning use of surveillance will act as triggers for other forces to deploy to exploit the fleeting opportunity 4 even overt presence patrolling can preempt insurgents62 for example threats by insurgents to keep the local schools closed and attempts to intimidate families to keep children home can be preempted by the placement of standing patrols at the schools until such time that confidence returns to the population and the insurgents have been displaced from the neighbourhood 5 ln coin it is frequently the case that one success leads to opportunities for another an arrest may lead to the discovery of an arms cache and so on special forces sf and reserves such as quick reaction forces qrfs must be available properly positioned and able to exploit unplanned opportunities to strike at the insurgency locating the qrfs with surveillance assets for example covertly inside dilapidated building will ensure an immediate response police and other government agencies must move in quickly behind the military forces to reestablish and retain control and influence 6 preemption should also be goal of influence activities lnfo ops flyer handed out by patrols that explains the purpose of the security forces and their future operations may pre empt insurgent propaganda that paints the security forces as oppressors likewise the timely implementation of reconstruction projects at local schools will rob insurgents of possible grievance that the current regime fails to provide for the countrys citizenry and future u presence patrolling is considered part of broader concept of framework operations which are those generally overt military operations conducted to establish safe and secure environment which in turn contributes to the defeat of the insurgent in an area british land force field manual vol 1 part 10 counterlnsurgency operations framework operations generally consist of those security and control tasks and activities that are part of stability operations they provide the secure environment in which normal civil society can function and other agencies may conduct their activities in support of the campaign 64 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency 603 dtslocatton 1 one of the main aims of presence patrols checkpoints and other security and control activities is to dislocate the insurgents and their influence over the populace dislocation denies the insurgents the ability to bring their strength to bear and goes beyond merely frustrating the enemys plans by making their strength irrelevant by refusing to fight on their terms lt will consist of deterrence and security measures such as protection of vulnerable targets search operations overt surveillance of potential mounting areas or meeting places or places of intimidation and proactive lnfo ops message that reinforces the legitimacy of the government and security forces the results of determined effort to dislocate the insurgent may not be spectacular and may not even be apparent to troops on the ground but over time will rob the insurgent of the initiative 604 disruption 1 disruption seeks to attack the insurgent selectively targeting his most important assets and so throwing him into confusion wellexecuted overt military operations will help to disrupt the insurgent by threatening deployment and escape routes locating arms caches and restricting movements even the threat of aggressive covert and overt operations can be effective in creating disruptive physical and psychological effects lnsurgents who know that they are being actively hunted will be tempted to flee the ao 2 disruption will also occur as security forces in the process of conducting security and control tasks encounter insurgents attempting to infiltrate or operate in the area forces should be prepared to not only disrupt and prevent the insurgentsbut ideally will be able to fix them so that they may be struck by reserve forces or other forces operating in the local area 3 disruption callsfortacticalawareness cunning and robust use of forces so long as collateral damages and civilian casualties can be avoided commanders should also appreciate that rare opportunities may be better exploited by other agencies minor arms find for example could if left undisturbed become fruitful ambush site speed and aledness will be essential 4 ln order to create disruption tactical commanders must be afforded freedom of action commanders cannot await authority from higher echelons as the opportunity to strike effectively will likely be lost 605 appreciating secondary and tertiary effects 1 commanders and staff must understand that every action will have second and third order effects on one hand proactive security and control activities robust deliberate operations and thoughtful lnfo ops measures to influence target audiences will dislocate and disrupt the insurgents presence and influence amongst the populace and in turn corrode and undermine their confidence and will on the other hand these operationsparticularly if they create undesired results such as collateral damages do not meet their immediate aims or produce physical signs of improvementmay cause embarrassment to the security forces unwanted disruption to the population and in turn undermine the publics confidence and empathy and the overall legitimacy of the campaign longterm success in coin will be affected by these second and thirdorder effects of activities 2 this issue may best be illustrated by the following example cordon and search operation of suspected weapons cache in the heart of an insurgent controlled neighbourhood conducted in conjunction with local police forces may find few if any weapons however the bgl323004fp003 65counterlnsurgency operations second and thirdorder effects may be significant and will be either positive or negative in nature the positive secondary and tertiary effects may include the following 1 new intelligence sources are identified within the establishment and from within the spectators who gathered during the conduct of the operation 2 lnsurgent leaders are identified either through arresvdetentions or from evidence found at the scene 3 the use of local police forces may have several effects increase the legitimacy of the military forces in that they are seen to be working with local authorities b increase the profile and esteem of the local police forces who may not be wellregarded by the local population andor c improve the professional conduct of the local police force by way of example and through the training value of the operation 4 lnsurgents knowing that they and their resources are being sought actively are forced further underground and may even flee the area 5 the local populace begins to feel more secure and less afraid of the insurgents and their power 6 weapons are forced further underground and are less readily available to insurgent forces b the negative effects in this example may include the following 1 embarrassment in that weapons were found 2 insurgent propaganda highlights this lack of success and attempts to demonstrate that the security forces are incompetent overreacting heavyhanded and not to be trusted 3 intelligence sources could be compromised 4 interference to the local populations daily routine incites anger 5 local police assisting with the action loose confidence and trust in the security forces andior 6 damage occurring to shops and homes during operations angers the populace63 3 lnformation operations influence activities should be planned to exploit the positive followon effects and attempt to mitigate the impact of the negative effects commanders must ensure that this is considered from the outset of planning 63 commanders must insist that during such operations collateral damages are limited to the greatest extent possible although troops must be prepared for breaches locked doors can usually be removed from their hinges cut locks can be replaced and damages repaired by engineers in the days immediately following the operation 66 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency sectron 4 securing and consolidating controlled area through fu llspectru m operation564 1 once the presence of security force has been established operations to clear secure and consolidate the next area to be brought under government control are launched from established operating bases while offensive and defensive activities will establish and consolidate gains made in dislocating insurgents and securing geographical area the presence and influence of coin forces are maintained mainly through stability activities 2 the immediate aim of security and control tasks is to expand the area controlled by the government this can be viewed as another component of the spreading ink spot or tache dhuile concept the goal is to separate the insurgents from their sources of moral fiscal and logistical support as well as disrupt their intelligence networks these continuous stability activities such presence patrols mobile checkpoints and searches aim to wrest territory and more importantly the hearts and minds of people who live in it from insurgent control and influence to this end the profile and posture of troops and the manner in which they dealwith the populace will be crucial every action must seek to gain support for the campaign other activities such as psyops cimic and public affairs must work to keep the profile of coin forces high gain credit for the campaign and ultimately gain popular support stability activities and the information they gain from the populace should also lead to opportunities to conduct offensive operations such as attack or raid against the insurgents 3 the security and control activities of stability operations will include surgical cordons and searches raids presence patrolling and mobile checkpoints these tactics force the insurgents to react or surrender the initiative 4 specific offensive activities will stem from specifically gained intelligence well planned and organized ambushes destroy the adversary when the opportunity arises infiltrations and attacks may be used to destroy known and vulnerable insurgent camps and base positions success however rests on very good intelligence and commanders must make every attempt to verify the accuracy and veracity of reports lnsurgents or others may plant false information to cause embarrassment to security forces and to undermine the campaign furthermore the conduct of offensive activities such as an attack on an insurgent stronghold must not undermine or counter the principles inherent in coin campaign they must not risk effects such as civilian casualties or collateral damages that will ultimately undermine public support and cause segments of the populace to support the insurgents 5 defensive tasks will likely include operating base security and defence of civilian vital points such as key infrastructure 6 as areas of the hostile territory are cleared of insurgents the civil administration must be reestablished this will be part of the overall stability operations lt is possible that many of the areas former civil servants magistrates and police may have escaped the initial insurgent take over and would be able to put their local knowledge to good use on their return however they and the civil police will undoubtedly need the backing of suitable military forces for some time and certainly until the neighbouring regions have been brought back under government control consideration must be given to the possibility that corruption in the civil administration may be legitimate grievance lf this is in fact the case the commander must work closely with other agencies participating in the campaign to devise solution that redresses this problem 6a see bgl300001fp00 1 land operations for further details of fullspectrum operations bgl323004fp003 67counterl nsurgency operations 7 ln the absence of civil administration or in the presence of corrupt or developing administration whose shortcomings may have led in paft to the insurgency campaigning forces must be prepared to assume governance and administrative duties this should be identified in the campaign planning stages and other agencies used to implement it ln such circumstance measures even at the lowest level must be taken to develop indigenous governance capabilities and to have indigenous leaders at the forefront of governance development agencies other than the military will be key to such development and their work in this endeavour will be their equivalent of tacticallevel activities supporting operational objectives such development in terms of governance and infrastructure will be the true consolidation of the military operations that removed the insurgents 8 part of this development will include the stability activities inherent in security sector reform ssr the military and appropriate other agencies will in coordinated and complementary manner undertake reform and development of various security services and related governance and administration beyond military and police reform ssr may include prison services the judiciary border security customs authorities civil defence and auxiliary forces 9 lnteragency cooperation at the tactical level within comprehensive approach may take the form of civilmilitary transition team civilmilitary transition team is defined as an organization designed to integrate and coordinate interagency and multidisciplinary efforts within given geographic region note lts purpose is to develop capacity in local agencies and institutions in order to promote longterm stability lt may be referred to as provincial reconstruction team prt in some theatres65 10 this construct will see number of agencies working in cooperative and formal manner to develop the infrastructure and governance of the nation lt may work on single line of operation or on number of lines of operation generally they focus on reconstruction development and governance development and mentoring lt could include ssr responsibilities ln sod the transition team willfocus on stability

support some reconstruction and quick impact projects section 5 defensive operations and activities in coin 606 types of defensive operations 1 defensive operations include the activities of defence and delay unless insurgent forces reach the point at which they develop manoeuvre forces it is unlikely that delay battle will be required 2 the defence will play major role in securing the local populace their infrastructure and territory gained through offensive operations the defence will be realized through wide array of tactical tasks such as standing observations posts standing patrols vital point protection and defensive positions particularly around operating base locations see chapter 1 figure 13 3 defensive operations by the security forces will assist in the stabilization of the area and allow the government and other agencies to effect their tasks defensive activities will seek to submitted to army terminology panel september 2007 68 bgl323004fp003land component

ln most coin campaigns areas of operation will be nonlinear and perhaps non contiguous the threat will be irregular and area can be assumed to be safe although significant improvements in security will lower the threat level even in cleared and consolidated area the insurgents may still likely have capability that can launch bomb attacks or carry out assassinations they may attempt to reintroduce insurgent cells to launch terrorist attacks both for their propaganda value and in an attempt to force redeployment of police and troops to remove the pressure from their forces elsewhere hence defensive measures and protection may be necessary for wide range of people areas and facilities 608 responsibility 1 the issue as to what security forces conduct these defensive measures will depend greatly on the situation and may vary from area to area within the same theatre lf indigenous security forces particularly with police lead are capable of fixing and striking the insurgents then military forces may assume manpowerintensive defensive tasks lf indigenous particularly constabulary forces lack the capability or resources and are continuing to develop campaigning security forces may have to assume the fixing and striking of insurgents whilst local forces assume defensive roles ldeally as time progresses and the security situation improves auxiliary forces and police may be able to assume many of the static defensive duties 2 ln some campaigns it may be desirable and practical to use private security companies particularly in terms of supporting ngos or private organizations that are working in the theatre these private security companies must be employed carefully if they are part of the campaign plan they must be given limited and specific mandate clearly defined tasks and clear rules of engagement 609 endurance 1 defensive activities and protective measures will still be required in the most secure base areas although the tasks may eventually be handed over progressively to the police or auxiliaries priority will be force protection of the security forces base areas lf the security forces cannot protect their own infrastructure the populace will have little confidence the security forces can protect them government infrastructure and economic vital points and lines of communications will require protection for they provide high value targets for the insurgents at all times and at all levels vigilance must be stressed and enforced 610 balance 1 defensive activities and protective measures in high risk areas are manpower intensive many of the tasks are routine and boring and soldiers tend to lose their vigilance after long periods without an incident lf possible troops on such duties should be rotated with those on more active operations and every effort must be made to maintain continual training programme in theatre bgl323004fp003 69cou nter i nsurgency operations 611 objectives of defensive activities and protective measures 1 defensive activities and protective measures will have to be taken with respect to security forces themselves other agencies in the campaign and the local populace and their infrastructure the general aims of defensive activities and protective measures include the following ensure security of all base areas including forward operating bases and temporary bases b secure controlled areas c secure lines of communication d disrupt supply and reinforcement of insurgent units secure key infrastructure f protect vulnerable groups or individuals and g prevent disruption of the economic life of the nation 612 tactical tasks for defensive activities 1 defensive activities and protective measures will include wide variety of tasks ln the conduct of defensive activities tacticallevel units will be expected to conduct the following vip protection protection may be required for key members of the government certain security force commanders and visiting dignitaries lt may include the training of local forces in this role close protection will likely be conducted by military police and sf troops while temporary outer cordons may be conducted by line troops security of troops and base areas security force troops their resources and their locations will all require certain level of defence administrative moves of troops often expose concentrations of troops as soft targets forces will likely have to be allocated for their protection convoy security the security forces will be expected to secure government and ngo convoys as well as their own this may be done through escorts or through defence of the convoy route protection of other agencies other agencies within the environment and campaign may at least initially in the campaign require levels of protection that can only be provided by military forces this will include protection of their base camps and of their movements this requirement will increase when battlespaces are noncontiguous securing routes and lines of gommunication main supply routes msr and lines of communication will always be vulnerable to attack likely or previously used ambush areas may require picketing technology can be exploited and pickets located on dominating terrain will be able to act as triggers for the dispatch of reserves to either increase protection or disrupt an insurgent operation static defensive positions security forces will not only have to secure their own locations but may be tasked to guard civilian installations and vital infrastructure along with government institutions these will be augmented bya b c d 61 0 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency standing patrols and clearing patrols around vulnerable sites which will continue the disruption of insurgent activities and surveillance they should also seek to disrupt the placement of mines and improved explosive devices leds 613 countersurveillance measures 1 lnsurgent groups will rely on committed members sympathisers and coerced neutrals for surveillance and information on indigenous and coalition security forces actions capabilities and weaknesses much of the purposeful surveillance will occur in fairly open lowtechnology fashion with watchers blending in with the general public shadowing patrols or watching base camps lntelligence gathered by sympathisers and coerced neutrals will be collected through simple surveillance of security force practices countermeasures must be employed at all levels vigilance must be stressed and practised constantly soldiers should be assured that in most cases their departures and movements are reported some methods of countering such surveillance include challenging suspicious persons or those shadowing patrols and avoiding patrolling patterns and the use of clearing patrols around fixed locations 614 standing patrols 1 apart from static defensive posts the establishment of network of overt and covert standing patrols occupying key positions provides an important means of furnishing defensive posture and acquiring information this in turn will assist in dominating an area and dislocating and disrupting possible insurgent offensive activities 2 standing patrols will generally have an assigned area that includes one or more dominating positions from which they can maintain observation the tasks allocated to standing patrols may include overwatch of locations both permanent such as base camps or temporary such as vcps b clearing insurgent watchers from points of observation c obtaining information on insurgent activity and noting patterns d observing the movement and activity of curfew breakers and crowds identifyingringleadersandlawbreakers f directing patrols police reserve units or helicopters to incidents g providing covering fire to vehicle and foot patrols should they come under level of attack which necessitates the use of firearms andor h assisting in the dispersal of unlawful assemblies and crowd

insurgent gangs began as soon as canadian troops arrived in haiti in early 2004 observant soldiers in observation posts ops and clearing patrols quickly identified and eliminated watchers

passed to united states marine corps usmc regimental and canadian intelligence staffs who used it to identify the insurgent organization and command source op halo after actionreports sectton 6 offensive operations and activities in coin_gaining the initiative 615 introduction 1 offensive operations support the militarys key role in neutralizing the insurgent they effectively take the battle to the insurgent in order preempt dislocate and disrupt him they will be key to gaining the initiative over the insurgent 2 offensive operations include wide range of activities each of which are realized through wider range of tactical tasks see chapter 1 figure 13 during coin campaign the most likely offensive activities that will be employed are attacks hasty or deliberate against insurgent positions and locations including command and control centres and systems b fighting patrols for the conduct of raid66 or an ambush c reconnaissance in force and d pursuit and exploitation 3 the conduct of offensive activities will follow their own principles and ttp however the conduct of offensive activities should not violate the overarching philosophy and principles inherent in the conduct of coin campaign at times the tactical success offered by potential offensive activity may have to be delayed in order to support the operational objectives of the campaign for example the pursuit of fleeing adversary may have to be ceased or postponed in order to secure an urban area or provide emergency humanitarian assistance to local populace that has been under adversary control whilst the pursuit may destroy some insurgents the emergency assistance to the population will engender popular support and gain legitimacy for the campaign 616 attackshastyattacks 1 occasionally coin forces will be able to wrest the initiative from the insurgent and conduct hasty attacks any such opportunity should be fully exploited in order to gain the tt raid is defined as an operation usually small scale involving swift penetration of hostile territory to secure information confuse the enemy or destroy his installations lt ends with planned withdrawal upon completion of the assigned mission aap 6 note that raid differs from cordon and search 612 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency initiative and undermine insurgent will and sense of impunity these opportunities will be fleeting and commanders must have standing authority to assume offensive operations as the opportunities arise depending upon the nature of the campaign many of these opportunities may occur at the section and platoon level during the conduct of presence patrols here commanders will have to make rapid transition from stability activities to offensive activities 2 any hasty attack should be conducted with view to avoiding undesired effects such as collateral damage and civilian casualties successful attack may kill small number of insurgents but if completed with collateral damages and civilian casualties it will do irreparable harm to the campaign in the eyes of many lndeed it may even drive neutral members of the populace to support the insurgency 3 ln the conduct of hasty attacks commanders must be cautious of insurgents seeking shelter amongst local populations and institutions 617 deliberate attacks 1 as in any campaign deliberate attacks will require detailed planning and reconnaissance ln coin campaign they will likely occur against insurgent bases and concentrations of forces given the nature of insurgency the opportunities for deliberate attacks will not routinely occur 2 ln the conduct of the battle procedure operational security opsec will be paramount and given the nature of insurgent information collection practices difficult to maintain special consideration must be made to ensure the opsec is maintained 3 apart from the conduct of the attack itself plans should focus on the exploitation of success this will include the pursuit of fleeing insurgents ideally by specially designated forces emergency aid to any noncombatants in the area and consolidation of the position considerations must be given to the need for and possibility of permanent occupation of the cleared location the success of the deliberate attack will be limited and impermanent if security forces withdraw and insurgents are permitted to reestablish their presence and continue to influence any local populace 618 largescaleoffensive operations 1 ln cases where an insurgency controls large areas of the theatre the insurgents may raise and deploy sizeable force such situation is most likely to occur where they have access to friendly neighbouring country which they use as haven to assemble train and equip 2 largescale offensive operations are attractive for many commanders as they imply initiative and provide the opportunity to be proactive and gain major success against the insurgent they will include variety of offensive activities such as deliberate and hasty attacks fighting patrols pursuits and large scale sweeps 3 past campaigns however do not provide many examples in which largescale offensive operations gained significant advantages and led to success difficulties with opsec and the scale and inherent tactics of such operations allow insurgents adaptable to dispersalto ex filtrate and avoid decisive engagement bgl323004fp003 61 3counterl nsurgency operations 4 ldeally insurgent forces should be engaged and destroyed in battle while they are relatively small and before they pose major threat this may not be feasible for number of reasons the threat is likely to develop in remote area while the host government focuses on securing vital areas close to the capital the main towns and their surrounding wellpopulated and economically important rural areas b the host nation may have neither the troops available nor the means of projecting force over considerable distance into remote and possibly mountainous jungle region andor c there may also be risk that operations on the border of stronger hostile neighbour may provoke an unwanted intervention on the pretext that the neighbouring countrys borders have been violated or its security threatened 5 there are number of prerequisites for the success of largescale offensive operation good intelligence the locations of units headquarters and key leaders are as important as the knowledge of the enemys positions and security screen equally important is good intelligence on the insurgents supporting political and logistic organization b lsolation the area chosen for the operation must be isolated as much as possible to prevent insurgent reinforcement or exfiltration lf the escape of small padies cannot be stopped the enemy should not be able to evacuate formed units enemy escape routes should as far as possible be blocked c surprise and deception obtaining surprise presents the greatest problem preparations and preliminary moves that cannot be hidden must be disguised patrolling to obtain information should be carried out in as many areas as possible with obvious emphasis on the selected area rumours of possible operations planned to take place elsewhere may be fed into the insurgent intelligence organization through channels which the insurgents are known to trust demonstrations and feints may be launched in such manner as not to arouse suspicions as to the location of the main effort its aims and its objectives 6 the execution of such an operation requires rapid deployment to encircle the main enemy forces lnsurgent forces should not just be surrounded by cordon which is likely to prove porous in the best circumstances but located and pinned down once surrounded disorganized and broken up the insurgents must be pursued 7 success must be followed by rooting out the insurgents political and logistic support organization and replacing it with the host governments administration the people in the area must be protected from future covert insurgent infiltration by insurgent political cells andor forces 619 offensive activities against insurgent command and control systems 1 offensive operations should include when possible action against insurgent command and control c2 systems such actions may be particularly effective and often the most economical means of reducing the combat effectiveness of insurgents applicable at all levels of command the primary objectives of offensive operations directed against insurgent command and control capabilities include the following 614 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency slow his tempo in relation to that of the security forces b disrupt his activities c degrade the insurgent commanders ability to command and control d interdict electronic signals used to detonate improvised explosive devices and disrupt his ability to generate and sustain offensive activities 2 technological advances will greatly enhance the ability of security forces to affect the insurgents command and control systems care must be taken however to minimize negative consequences for the noncombatants also one must be aware of the effect upon potential intelligence collection for example shutting down cellular telephone grid in order to deny its use by insurgents has strong negative impact on the civil society in addition to precluding electronic wa rfa re exploitation of intercepted commu n ications 620 fighting patrols_raid and ambushes 1 fighting patrols are distinct from other patrols particularly presence patrols for the purposes of security and control stability operations in that they are conducted for the purposes of conducting an ambush or raid the purpose of fighting patrols is to preempt or disrupt the insurgent and his aims series of fighting patrols followed by the establishment of permanent security force presence will dislocate the insurgents fighting patrols bring troops into contact with the insurgents on favourable terms 2 fighting patrols are particulady effective in coin campaigns in terms of gaining tactical success over the insurgents preempting and disrupting their activities and undermining their will and cohesion the inherent tactics of patrolling match those of the insurgents planning is detailed and they are conducted by small mobile elements exercising initiative 3 fighting patrols must be based upon good accurate and specific information and intelligence regarding the planned objective such information may be obtained from variety of sources including police and military collection technical sensors including imagery humint sources reconnaissance routine presence patrols tracking and sometimes lucky contact 4 fighting patrols will be planned in detail but they must retain the ability to develop and adapt flexible ttp that can counter the mutable tactics of the insurgent lessons learned during patrols should be disseminated quickly so that they may be incorporated into followon activities 5 fighting patrols particularly those conducted for ambushes need not have specific target in mind but may simply be executed on the basis that the opportunity to ambush the adversary may be encountered and exploited lt must be remembered that despite the offensive nature of fighting patrols normal rules of engagement roe will apply and must be followed 6 ln close terrain where it is seldom possible to set in stealthy manner cordon successfully fighting patrol has better chance of scoring success the patrol may be able to set hasty ambush or raid an insurgent base used judiciously fighting patrols are an excellent way of keeping small groups of enemy on the move inducing sense of insecurity and dislocating insurgent plans 7 ambushes are usually deliberate but drills must be developed to enable section or patrol to move rapidly and quietly into an ambush position when its lead elements spot insurgent forces moving ambushes may be conducted in areas under government control or in areas still under the control of insurgents because they are followed by withdrawal raids will be bgl323004fp003 61 5counterlnsurgency operations conducted against insurgent camps or strong points in areas not yet under the control of government forces b ambushes and raids may be conducted with any combination of the following aims the destruction of an insurgent force b the capture or killing of wanted insurgent c the capture or destruction of weapons and equipment d gaining of intelligence deterring the insurgent from using an area andor f preventing the insurgents from approaching friendly positions 621 reconnaissance in force 1 campaigning forces may conduct reconnaissanceinforce tasks in order to gain required information regarding insurgents their location disposition strength intentions and influence in region and amongst its population such activities will likely be conducted in more overt fashion than fighting patrols which rely upon stealth to reach their objective and withdraw reconnaissance in force may be mounted or dismounted 2 although information collection will be the primary aim of reconnaissanceinforce activity forces must be prepared to exploit opportunities such as the ability to ambush insurgent groups wellpractised drills good communications and high levels of training will ensure the required flexibility to exploit fleeting opportunities sectton 7 stability operation56t and activities in coin 622 introduction 1 stability operations are defined as tactical activities conducted by military forces in conjunction with other agencies to maintain restore or establish climate of order within which responsible government can function effectively and progress can be achieved6u stability activities seek to gain support and legitimacy for campaign by addressing the root causes of crisis they include tasks that seek to protect an area and populace in order to allow other agencies and the civilian populace to function and they include reconstruction training and development compared with offensive and defensive activities they are generally the predominant type of operation in coin and peace support campaigns 2 stability operations consist of the following activities security and control tasks b support to demobilization disarmament and reintegration ddr c support to ssr tt for more detailed discussion of stability operations see bgl300001fp001 land operations t army terminology panel nato defines stability activities as tactical activities that seek to stabilise the situation and reduce the level of violence they impose security and control over an area while employing military capabilities to restore services and support civilian agencies nato ajp 32 61 6 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency d support to civilian infrastructure and governance and assistance to other agencies 3 these stability activities are realized through wide array of tactical tasks such as cordon and search vehicle checkpoints vcps curfew implementation presence patrols humanitarian aid delivery training of indigenous security forces and crowd confrontation to name few 4 lnitially in campaign the military may be the only agency in theatre or the local area that is able to conduct stability activities and tasks the military will initiate some aspects of the work and establish the security and control needed for other agencies and civilian society to be able to operate many stability activities require other agencies ssr for example will require not just the military but other agencies to conduct reform of other facets of security apparatus such as prisons police border control and the related civilian and political administration and oversight 5 stability activities set the conditions for an enduring stable and secure situation and thus future sustainable development they often address many of the conditions and circumstances that led to the instability and insurrection in the first place 623 security and control tasks 1 security and control tasks seek to create security framework that will allow the conduct of normal civil society and will permit other agencies to conduct their operations ln other words the creation of security framework will permit other agencies to operate and manoeuvre security and control may be imposed through wide variety of tactical tasks that support this aim but will normally be conducted through presence patrols observation posts cordon and searches checkpoints curfews movement control and the use of reserves to react to emergencies or threats 2 security and control tasks often support the collection of information namely from the local populace and troops on the ground which leads to the conduct of other stability activities or even offensive activities 624 patrolling and observation posts 1 most patrolling and observation posts conducted for the purposes of security and control will be overt however in certain circumstances they may be covert and seek to lure out insurgents or other irregular threats such as criminals that threaten security such activities are often termed framework operations or framework patrols for they help create that security framework that permits other agencies to operate 2 patrols are mainstay of coin operations and must be conducted with robust spirit taking into consideration however that they will be occurring often amongst civilian populations most types of patrols should be assigned standing and specific information requirements lrs to support the overall campaign and specifically planned operations given the overt nature of most coin patrolling patrols are more vulnerable to ambush than those conducted in conventional operations every effort should be made to avoid creating predictable habits including standardized routes and timing failing to do so will invite effective enemy attacks 3 presence patrols provide force presence that helps to create the secure environment they dislocate insurgents presence and influences and disrupt any insurgent activities they provide protection and should actively seek information through their contact with the public and through observation bgl323004fp003 617counterlnsurgency operations 4 presence patrols may operate as complete platoon or in dispersed manner at the halfsection or section level albeit controlled at the platoon level they may operate on half platoon or multiple system6e the tactics and procedures will vary in accordance with the environment the threat insurgent tactics their task and the involvement of other security force elements 5 the patrols may work from firm bases or from temporarily established patrol bases they may be mounted or move on foot patrolling should avoid creating pattern of predictable habits ln broad terms their tasks are to provide local protection for security force bases by complimenting other protective measures such as standing patrols observation posts ops and sensors b lnhibit insurgentsfreedom of movement by random deployment

gather information and intelligence through the issue of standing and unique lrs 6e ln multiple patrol system the basic tactical element is the fourman brick hence rifle section will consist of two bricks multiple will normally consist of three bricks and thus platoon can form two multiples one commanded by theplatooncommandertheotherbytheplatoonsecondincommand brickspatrol insupportofoneanother normally within visual or at least radio contact and are thus able to support one another while remaining flexible enough to outmanoeuvre any insurgents encountered 70 roving snap vcps are often more effective than static vcps which will quickly become known to the insurgents patrols will often encounter suspicious activity notice an irregular action or notice something out of its ordinary place or simply receive tip from local the patrol commander must be prepared to stop and search suspicious vehicles additionally he must be prepared to conduct lowlevel cordon and search with the combat power available or with additional reinforcements he may simply set an immediate cordon and knock on the premises explaining the situation to any occupants and then conducting search 61 b bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency during the deployment to haiti in 2004 intelligence sources at the united states marine corps usmc regimental level indicated that hardware store in the west end of port au prince was possible weapons cache as the store was owned by known gang leader this was added to company target list and framework patrols assigned to this area were tasked to search for and identify this store eventually after about 20 days later patrol located the store the patrol commander conducted his combat estimate and after receiving authority to do so from the company command post the patrol conducted cordon and knock operation nothing was found and two locks had to be cut during the operation lt was explained to the store manager that if the owner wished he could report to the company location and his locks would be replaced three days later the owner and other man arrived at the camp seeking new locks the two men were and had been posing as haitian national police hnp officers and were listed on the hnp most wanted list copy of which was held in the company command post they were detained and turned over to hnp authorities 625 movement control 1 control of movement is vital aspect of coin operations although manpower intensive it is necessary to dislocate and disrupt insurgent activities and reassure the public movement control measures can also be highly inconvenient to the general public and point of contention therefore the need for them must be clear and well advertised in terms of purpose vice location and time through the lnfo ops communication plan ldeally movement control measures are conducted in conjunction with the local police with the latter seen as being in the lead 2 principal methods before movement controls are imposed aims and plans and must be discussed between the civil authorities the police and the military to make sure the enforcement is practical proposition and that the necessary police and soldiers are available to put them into effect the principle methods of movement control are road blocks b checkpoints both snap and deliberate c traffic control points and d curfews 3 controlling movement may have any of the following aims permit security forces to enforce the law thus increasing public confidence in the governments ability to protect them b disrupt insurgent groups and plans by making movement difficult and precluding coordination between insurgent cells and groups c dominate an area to prevent crowds from gathering and to deter hostile action d control the movement of crowds that do form and prevent their reinforcement intercept and discourage the illegal movement of arms explosives medical supplies and food f seal off an area to prevent the introduction of weapons explosives and subversive propaganda material bgl323004fp003 619counterlnsurgency operations g arrest wanted persons h record movement to detect patterns and obtain information andor i facilitate the movement and operations of the security forces for example part of an outer cordon of deliberate operation may include temporary roadblock 4 vehicle checkpoints vcps will be regular means of controlling movement and disrupting insurgentactivity ln the conductof vcps in coin operation thefollowing points should be considered planning must be detailed and appropriate resources applied these should include enough resources and mobility to provide effective cutoff and pursuit elements b reserues or qrfs should be aware of the operation and prepared to support if necessary c modern communication devices particularly cellular telephones will alert insurgents seeking to avoid the vcp to its presence within minutes of its establishment thus the use of snap vcps at the section level put in location for very short periods and the simple stopping of suspicious vehicles and individuals will do more to preempt and disrupt insurgents than longterm vcps d vehicle checkpoints provide members of the public the opportunity to pass information to the security forces without raising the suspicion of insurgents troops conducting vcps must be prepared to receive such information or to provide the informant with contact 5 largescale or continuous movement control measures will require much consideration planning and coordination likely public reaction must be taken into account during the planning stage agitators will be quick to exploit any adverse reaction and the need for any unavoidable irksome restrictions should be anticipated and explained to weaken hostile propaganda lllconceived measures that lead to the collapse of public services must be avoided the committee system exists to discuss these plans and their likely consequences sound plan must be based on good intelligence which involves close liaison and joint conduct with the police the concept must be supported by specific lnfo ops plan explaining the purpose and goals of the control measures 626 crowd control measures 1 crowds and violent demonstrations are often feature of insurgencies and are easily exploited by insurgents for their own ends lnsurgents will stage events to draw crowds and often attempt to provoke security forces to overreact to demonstration these events will be filmed by insurgents and the images quickly disseminated internationally in carefully coordinated propaganda effort crowds and resulting riots undermine the overall security situation weaken the governments control and destroy civil infrastructure 2 ln spite of measures to prevent it crowds may rally around particular issue and assemble usually in urban areas in front of government offices security force camps or in public spaces the civil police may be unable to cope with the situation and military assistance may be required the size of crowd is indication of its attitude large crowd containing many curious onlookers may be docile until agitators begin to influence it small crowd may be peaceful or it may be concentration of those with extreme views the military commander on the spot must use his own judgement as to how to deal with any particular situation 620 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency 3 crowd control operations cco require specialtraining in specific ttp and equipment these should not be acquired on the job and must be included in all predeployment training ln theatre regular training schedules should include cco refresher likewise ccospecific equipment must be positioned forward with tactical subunits for violent crowds can gather with little notice furthermore when there is threat of crowd confrontation the mere appearance of properly prepared troops can help dissuade the crowd from turning violent 627 search tasks 1 as security forces impose control over urban and rural areas search tasks become mainstay of the security environment searches must be guided by accurate intelligence in order to minimize disruption of the population and embarrassment for the security forces 2 the purpose of search tasks is to isolate selected area by deploying cordon either by stealth or at such speed that the intended quarry has chance to escape and then searching it thoroughly the target area may be single house or an entire city block obviously the more precise the target area can is the better 3 search tasks are conducted whenever possible with police authorities they may be conducted in order to capture wanted persons weapons communication devices propaganda materials and means explosives or documents b disrupt insurgent activities c eliminate insurgent activity in specific locality particularly with view to expanding controlled area d gain evidence to suppoft prosecutions or to prove links with expatriate communities and fraudulent fund raising schemes and gain information to support future operations 4 ln conducting such tasks with the local police and other forces opsec is essential lt is not uncommon for local security forces to be infiltrated by insurgents or to contain informants who pass the insurgents information lf this is concern for military commanders methods should be used to conceal the nature and area of the task until the last minute 5 the establishment of the cordon and the search are two separate activities but are mounted as one task because the search part of the task is usually lengthy affair that disrupts the life of locality cordons and searches should only be mounted on reliable information series of fruitless operations merely alienates the population from the government and unnecessarily provides the insurgent with propaganda 6 cordon and search tasks are not easy to execute due in good part to the difficulty of closing the cordon so quickly that the insurgents have chance to escape lt is easier to position cordon in open country with good road network long fields of observation and with the help of helicopters ln close terrain iungle urban it is virtually impossible to position and link up cordon because movement is restricted buildings are connected watchers may see the forces coming and alert the target area and observation may be restricted to few metres lngenuity will be required by commanders to work around these challenges 7 during coin cordon and search tasks will often be conducted based on humint sources lnformation from informants must be treated with caution lt is always possible that an informant may simply wish to set up local rival or may wish to lead the security forces into an bgl323004fp003 621counterlnsurgency operations ambush caution must be exercised at all times and information gained when possible should be confirmed by other sources 628 supportto ddrand ssr71 1 the design of required demobilization disarmament and reintegration ddr and security sector reform ssr programmes should begin as part of the overall campaign planning process specifically designated forces will normally be required padicularly forthe ssr programme 2 the military will play supporting role in the overall ddr process which sees various armed elements undergo dissolution process ddr by its very nature will require the involvement of any number of other agencies in order to properly demobilize and reintegrate former combatants these former combatants may be regular army members conscripts private militia members former insurgents and other irregular actors 3 lt must be remembered that the ddr process cannot simply disarm former combatants and return them to their homes without support or employment such actions will breed instability criminality and possibly insurrection therefore other agencies are required to work to avoid such problems work schemes and retraining will be necessary to occupy former soldiers and to support wider development special programmes may be required to deal with situations involving child soldiers 4 to this end the ddr process will require wide range of agencies with the military forces playing supporting role the likely tasks that the coin military forces will undertake in ddr process include disarmament of security forces militias andor illegally armed groups b weapons collection and accounting c weapon destruction d protection escort and transportation of demobilized personnel particularly where they may be threatened by elements yet to be demobilized and assistance in selection for new security service 5 not all former combatants may be demobilized many either as collective groups or individuals may undergo reform process in the creation of new security forces 6 likewise the ssr process will require comprehensive approach involving wide range of agencies reform may be required for variety of elements within security apparatus including the military police judiciary border and customs control prison services and national defence control administration and governance the level of reform required will depend upon the situation and state of the indigenous securityforces and administration 7 many possibilities exist for the development or reform of security forces the design of the ssr programme should be undertaken within the campaign planning process and specifically assigned forces should be allocated the design for the reformed security sector should reflect the nation and environment including social structures and culture within which it 71 see bgl300000fp00 i land qperations for details regarding demobilization disarmament and reintegration ddr and security sector reform ssr processes 622 bgl323004fp003land component

b tribal lines and loyalties will have to be overcome in some cases this may occur between unit and subunit lines in which units battalion level are integrated but at the subunit level they are affiliated along regional or tribal lines lndigenous traditions and opinions will have to feed whatever construct is designed 9 the militarys role in the ssr programme will likely include the following tasks selection and recruitment of future security force personnel b allocation and control of equipment and infrastructure and c training mentoring and transfer of responsibility to indigenous military and in the short term other security forces such as police and border guards 629 support to reconstruction and governancecivilmilitary transition teams 1 although the military forces may assume initially some provision of essential services reconstruction and governance longterm development and governance maturity will require the application of other agencies working in conjunction with the military 2 reconstruction and governance should initially seek to provide emergency and essential services to population this will not only address issues and stresses within the environment but will gain local support for the campaign and increase campaign legitimacy 3 reconstruction and governance will require comprehensive approach with the military in supporting role to other agencies better suited for these inherent development tasks this may be realized through the creation of civilmilitary transition teams clmltts these are defined as an organization designed to integrate and coordinate interagency and multidisciplinary efforts within given geographic region note lts purpose is to develop capacity in local agencies and institutions in order to promote longterm stability lt may be referred to as provincial reconstruction team prt in some theatres72 4 civilmilitary transition teams will incorporate number of agencies under single construct and ideally command in order to conduct capability building within the developing nation its government and administration lt will attempt to address the root causes of instability and the insurgency itself if possible lt will gain support and legitimacy for the campaign and create the solutions for enduring stability lt may assume wide variety of tasks such as training of police and prison officials government leadership training infrastructure repair and development and other civil capacity development and expansion these organizations should be considered units or formations that undertake tasks and create effects that support operational objectives they must operate in cooperation and synchronization with other units and activities in the theatre 5 the militarys role will be supporting one the military may assume some of the capacity building particularly in the early stages of the campaign when not allof the other agencies have deployed the military will be responsible for local security defence and force protection of other agencies the military may also assist with c2 structures and support intelligence and threat analysis support and liaison support to name few

health and public buildings and services including sewerage and waste limited medical assistanceadvice f enabling of humanitarian aid and g securing key national infrastructure 7 as the security situation improves many of these tasks should be assumed by other agencies including indigenous elements b the military may assume some initial governance tasks but ideally these will be undertaken by other agencies better suited for their conduct and development requirements for interim governance by military forces and other agencies may include the following commercial support and economic institutions e9 establishment of local markets banks and village business cooperatives b public transportation nodes such as ports and airports c management of essential services and industries d educationinstitutionsandinfrastructure public civil service institutions including refuse health customs media etc f political institutions particularly at the local municipal level such as mayors office and support staff g humanitarian assistance and aid distribution h enabling political negotiation at local level i providing panagency c2 framework j rule of law implementation specifically policing duties against criminal activity and border control and k support to elections 9 the provision of infrastructure and governance support will be developed and implemented through the campaign plan and its lines of operation detailed plans will have to be refined once the command and control relationship has been established across any coalition and with the indigenous authorities 630 assistance to other agencies 1 within the comprehensive approach to the campaign there will be agencies operating that may require military assistance this assistance may include provision of transport and security to select ngos or other such assistance to their operations such assistance must be clearly linked to the lnfo ops being concurrently conducted to ensure unified message and effect are created such assistance must also be in line with operational objectives and where 624 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency possible provide additional opportunity for information collection and the development of situational awareness sectton i enabling operations and activities in coin 1 enabling operations consist of those activities and tasks that enable forces to conduct other tactical operations enabling operations include activities such as the withdrawal relief in place passage of lines and advance to contact to name few7 2 enabling operations within coin environment will be conducted using extant principles and ttp however special consideration will have to be made with respect to the threat and overall coin campaign and environment 3 echelon forces will require additional security and protection given the ubiquitous nature of insurgent threats lt may be unlikely that the conduct of an advance to contact will be required but all forces moving from one point to another must conduct such movement as tactical movement prepared for engagement 4 relief in place will occur repeatedly throughout coin campaign at all levels of command the details required for passage to the incoming force must not only include the immediate tactical situation and threat but must include holistic handover of the environment its actors and influences local culture and power structures 5 reconnaissance patrols will continue to be conducted within coin campaign and will likely include both mounted and dismounted patrols as in conventional operations they may be conducted as point area or route reconnaissance the information requirements will vary with the specific task however they will likely focus on both physical terrain and elements of the local populace within coin environment the conduct of reconnaissance patrols will require some specific considerations small reconnaissance patrols which are relatively weak will be vulnerable particularly if conducted overtly they can be easily attacked in any terrain or swarmed by crowds in urban areas b coveft patrols have reduced threat profile avoid early warning to insurgents of their presence and do not reveal the information being sought c reconnaissance patrols with technical requirements e9 route reconnaissance should include specialists such as engineers where applicable depending upon the intended mission it may include members of other agencies such as ngos although these will more likely be classified as liaison visits d the insertion of covert patrols and ops is very difficult in dense urban areas lngenuity must be used to disguise their insertion which can be concealed amongst an overt operation qrf must be prepared to extract or reinforce the patrol f the patrol may assume additional responsibilities as opportunities present themselves such as the conduct of snap vcps 73 see bgl300001fp00 1 land operations for more details regarding enabling operations bgl323004fp003 625counterlnsurgency operations sectron i reserves and quick reaction forces 1 quick reaction forces arfs are formed at the tactical levels in order to react to the unexpected exploit opportunities and success and supporureinforce threatened areas and friendly forces they are simply form of reserve forces 2 ln addition to supporting military forces there will be requirement to provide rapid support through qrf to local security forces and institutions even in dense urban areas civilian police stations and other offices of local authorities can feel isolated and threatened ln rural areas police outposts and border stations are vulnerable to attack due to their isolation lt is important that such local forces be made aware the military forces are willing and capable of rapidly and effectively coming to their aid without this confidence they will be unwilling to undertake operations and may flee from their posts thereby allowing insurgents to destabilize an area and undermine the government control 3 likewise coalition military forces operating from small platoonsized bases or patrolling at the section and multiple levels will at certain times require reinforcement or extraction qrfs must be ready to respond to such calls for support qrfs may also be used to exploit brief opportunities to strike at insurgents or to secure intelligence finds 4 thus qrfs must be identified and held in readiness to go to the aid of threatened detachments or to exploit possible successes the planning of qrfs in coin operation should consider the following the establishment of fixed communications means between the force and those local security elements such as police posts that are within the units ao and for which the units are responsible b the allocation and practice of alternative routes in order to reduce the risk of ambush from insurgents who have deliberately planned to attack the relieving force c the allocation of armoured vehicles to the qrf to increase mobility and force protection there is possibility that they may be blocked on an approach route or ambushed with antiarmour weapons d the use of helicopters for rapid movement this is often the best option for rapid insertion but is vulnerable to all types of fire and may not be able to land in dense urban environments the design of qrf as an allarms grouping is based on manoeuvre forces with embedded supporting forces such as field engineers fire support and medical support sectton 10 measures of effectiveness 1 within the continuum of operations overall success is generally measured by progress along the spectrum of conflict towards the end of less violence whilst this holds true for coin there can be much finer indications of success as operations are conducted over period of time even though the measurement of overall success is of interest to all levels strategic to tactical many of the indications will be measured at the tactical level ozo bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency 2 ln order to determine progress in campaign commander will assess the conduct of the campaign through measures of performance mop and measures of effectiveness moe74 whilst mop ask the question are we doing the task right moe ask the question are we doing the right tasks to create the desired effects 3 moe are defined as criterion used to evaluate how task has affected system behaviour or capabilities over time7u moe refer to the desired effects and whether or not the activities conducted have created those effects that is achieved results they apply to both fires and influence activities 4 with respect to fires and their effects on the physical plane moe remain relatively obvious an attack may have been conducted well but if it failed to seize the assigned objective or failed to achieve its purpose then the moe were not met and the activity failed 5 with influence activities and effects on the psychological plane moe are applied to activities and the resulting changes in understanding perception and the will of the target audience given all of the individual and environmental variables in the human decisionmaking process developing moe for influence activities and effects on the psychological plane may be one of the most daunting intellectual tasks facing commander lnfluence activities seek to work through external and internal filters in order to affect understanding and will these filters are often culturally and socially based hence the planning and conduct of these activities is an arf requiring the commanders subjective feel for their effect the results of these influence activities require as defined set of indicators as possible in order to detect changes in perceptions understanding attitudes and behaviours these indicators need to account for the effect of cultural and environmental influences 6 developing appropriate moe to assess effects on the psychological plane is very difficult task willpower perceptions and beliefs are all lessthancompletelytangible variables that defy simple measurement observing and measuring trends is one of the surest ways of gauging target audiences attitude trends however require definable baseline and this will be difficult to identify 7 at the start of an operation the startstate of the security situation should be noted and ideally recorded statistically lndicators to be examined in specific area may include the following number of murders or killings b number of insurgent attacks on government buildings persons and security forces c number of violent incidents and general levels of crime d number and intensity of public demonstrations state and provisions of civil services such as sanitary collection services schools open and government offices open f police station manning and equipping and the profile of police presence in public g commercial activities particularly small shops and open markets and for more complete discussion on measures of performance and measures of effectiveness see bgl300001 fp001 land operations army terminology panel may 2006 bgl323004fp003 627counterlnsurgency operations h public activities in urban areas particularly at night b as the mission progresses improvements in the above indicators will indicate the measure of effectiveness the development and application of measures of effectiveness is key to understanding and fostering success in campaign 9 success that is improvements in the civil situation will not occur evenly over region lmprovements may occur in one area while an area in which the insurgents have more influence and power will be slower to improve likewise improvements may come more rapidly in the daytime but the situation will be worse at night such indicators will allow the security forces to focus their resources more effectively sectton 11 conditioning the tactical level for counterinsurgency operations 1 commanders and soldiers alike must be made to appreciate the differences between coin and conventional campaigns their actions and activities must be guided by the philosophy and principles of coin this must begin in the training for deployment and continue throughout the operation lt is very much an intellectual challenge that must accompany the training in ttp specific to coin points that must be considered in educating commanders and soldiers in coin will include the following cultural training that will inform attitudes towards the civilian population lack of cultural awareness and understanding can generate considerable animosity between civilians and soldiers cultural training must include not only macro level factors religion language geography etc but also microlevel factors traditional local political constructs tribal identities and relations local mannerisms and the like soldiers must be made to appreciate the fear stress and frustration that the civilian populace will feel in times of an insurgency furthermore they must appreciate the effect that their tactical operations will have on the local populations simply trying to imagine how one would feel if an insurgency and coin operations were taking place in ones own neighbourhood will go long way towards developing an understanding attitude and empathy towards civilians during operations b junior leaders and soldiers must be made to realize the key importance that they have in the information gathering and intelligence process every soldier must realize they are sensor or information collector patrol commanders must conduct detailed patrol debriefs with their troops and provide detailed patrol reports to the intelligence and operations staff additionally soldiers require regularfeedback regarding the value and usefulness of the information they provide c commanders and soldiers must have measured expectations regarding the quality and calibre of the local security forces ln many failed or failing states the local police and military will not be of standard common to many soldiers they must realize that these assets despite some shortcomings have great knowledge of the local issues threats and insurgents methods furthermore soldiers and junior leaders must be made to realize that part of their mission is to educate and improve localforces where necessary d junior leaders and soldiers must be made to realize that coin is complicated long process and that success only comes after long period of security and development furthermore success cannot be measured by offensive action 628 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency and the number of insurgents killed because for every insurgent killed there will be at least one more recruit ready to take the deceased persons place ln fact the soldier must understand that coin is battle of wills and that attrition may be the insurgents friend they must understand that success comes through the gaining and maintaining of the public will over the long term all ranks must realize the operational and strategic implications that individual actions at the tactical level can have across the entire operation an overreaction to threat or failure to react to small civilian emergency can critically undermine the operation and the esteem of the security forces in the minds of the public nationally and internationally sectton 12 cultural awareness 1 general historically an understanding of the host nations hns culture is critical to success in coin cultural awareness ca can reduce battlefield friction and the fog of war during coin and thus improve the ability to accomplish the mission ca gives insight into the intent of insurgents and other groups in the battlespace while reducing cultural friction with the hn peoples additionally ca assists in building rapport while preventing misunderstandings that undermine support for the security forces 2 gultural considerations culture is broad and encompassing term the following descriptions define the key aspects of culture76 cultural terrain culture is simply another element of the terrain environment and particular battlespace cultural terrain parallels geographic terrain for military consideration as both influence decisions cultural terrain presents battlespace obstacles and opportunities b gultural factors cultural factors are dynamic aspects of society that have the capacity to affect military operations they include religion ethnicity language customs values practices and perceptions all these factors affect the thinking and motivation of the individual or group and make up the cultural terrain of the battlespace not all factors are applicable to all operations and additional factors may be considered as necessary c gultural awareness cultural awareness is the knowledge of cultural factors and an understanding of their impact on the planning conduct and outcome of military operations cultural awareness results from both standardized and specific training 3 power structures within an environment and its cultures commanders must come to understand the power structures both formal and informal that exist and will influence the outcome of the campaign within single group or situation there may be number of power structures those who appear to be in charge may in actual fact have very limited powers not all elements within social group may acknowledge uniformly the actual power and influence of certain leader furthermore leaders in one field such as religion may have influence and power in other social fields such as politics ln many communities the only authority figure that locals acknowledge may be local or tribal elder despite the existence of 76 excerpt from american british canadian australian abca cultural awareness project team final report march 2005 bgl323004fp003 629counterlnsurgency operations central government commanders must come to understand these power structures and work with them to further the campaign objectives 4 operations cultural considerations must be fully incorporated into the conduct of operations commanders must understand the impact of culture on the execution of their operations and plans and the implications inherent in the fluid nature of the complex environment all personnel must consider culture during the reassessment of the battlespace the amendment of existing plans and transition of authoritybattle handover 5 cultural awareness during relief in place key piece of the successful relief in place between tactical units and formations is the exchange of cultural information 6 training any predeployment training for specific mission area must include briefings concerning the culture issues relevant to the operational area lf specific ao is known prior to deployment then cultural awareness training should include any aspects that are unique to that particular region aspects of the culture should be folded into predeployment training exercises section 13 the tacticallevel committee system 631 establishing the committees 1 general the comprehensive approach and its multiagency execution of the coin campaign demands close crossagency planning and coordination down to the lowest levels the committee system of coordination provides for such cooperation in the multifaceted approach to defeating the insurgency in both the short and long terms lt is especially important when formal single chain of command has not been established or other agencies and organizations not within the formal chain of command participate in the campaign 2 roles the committee system will mirror that which is built at the operational level but will be implemented and influenced at an appropriate level of civilian and police authority the various committees established should reflect the lines of operation established in the campaign plan ln many cases the committees will be based on geographical and civilian lines of organization such as municipalities and counties at the tactical level the role of the committee system remains the same as that of operational level or national committees establishment of priorities b coordination of intelligence and security c coordination between security and civil activities d joint consultation and as far as security will permit joint planning joint direction of operations f arrangements for public safety and protection of public institutions and g direction of the lnfo ops influence activities 3 the committee system will harmonize the fires and influencethe comprehensive operationsof the campaign at the tactical level 4 regional provincial and district committees fully integrated coordinating committees are necessary at various subordinate tactical levels these will comprise the regional representatives of the agencies cooperating in the conduct of the coin the 630 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency committees will often be based on boundaries that reflect civil administration and local government boundaries in regions provinces counties andor districts 5 committee features and membership depending upon the level concerned number of committees may be formed or at the lowest social levels single committee may be formed to dealwith all issues ln the establishment and conduct of the tacticallevel committee system the following should be noted these lowerlevel committees and any subordinate coordinating bodies may be referred to as operations or action committees the taxonomy may have to be flexible to reflect the desires of indigenous leaders or those of international organizations participating b the chairman is usually the senior officeradministrator of the local indigenous civilian administration in whose support the security forces are working depending on the size of the area he could be minister appointed for the purpose provincial governor the chairman of county council civil chief executive officer or mayor of large city depending upon the local culture and society he may be religious leader with influences in other fields commanders and agency leaders must avoid assuming that the same social or political delineations that exist in their own societies will work in the society and culture in question c the local police and military commanders and the intelligence and security organization representatives will form the membership of appropriate security and supporting intelligence committees local civilian experts may either be full members or in attendance as the occasion demands coalition formation commanders of the appropriate level would normally attend the appropriate host countrys committees d senior administrators from various ngos and international organizations operating in the region may sit on the committees or be in attendance depending upon the culture concerned local religious andor tribal leaders may also attend the committees 6 town ward and village level smaller less formal committees are needed to coordinate civil police military and intelligence operations at the lower levels without jeopardizing security or creating cumbersome bureaucracy this is the level at which the campaign plan is implemented as tacticallevel action lt must be seen to succeed to retain the loyalty and support of the people lt is important that local interests are represented and that the people can relate to government policy locally acknowledged leadership figures must be included if the system and campaign are to have legitimacy and thus support at the local level failure at this level will mean defeat the chairman is normally the head of the civil administration possibly the local mayor the chief administrative officer the rural council chairman or even tribal elder the membership reflects the police military and other interests at this level the military representative may be battalion or company commander depending on the scale and geographical area concerned bgl323004fp003 631counterlnsurgency operations figure 61 example delineation of gommittee system 632 challenges in the implementation of the campaign plan and coin principles l lt will be important that all members of the committees at whatever level fully understand the role and capabilities of the military element they must also understand their limitations in terms of resources skills and roe furthermore they must understand the national strategy and campaign plan including their individual roles and that of the committee itself many members of the committee will not be familiar or even comforlable with these issues and military personalities must be prepared to take leadership role in what may be initially at least collective education process likewise military members of the committees will have to become familiar with the abilities and limitations of their counterpart agencies 2 the committees even at the local level may incorporate more than military police and local government they may include leaders from other government departments representatives from international organizations and even ngos if appropriate sub committees focusing on specific issues such as security or regional development may also be created as required 3 military commanders must remember that principles are easier to affirm than to apply particularly in coin campaign with its inherent variables tensions and multiple agencies the committee system will help coordinate actions and harmonize means across the various agencies ln many failed orfailing states where insurgencies will occur there will be lack of professionally trained administrators and other professionals will lack depth and extensive tt at this level formal committees may not exist but the military commander will conduct individual liaison and coordination and call together ad hoc meetings as an issue may warrant 78 the same manner of ad hoc coordination may be required at the platoon level should platoon be operating away from the subunit with its own ao 632senior government official or minister of defence or internal affairsun special envoy or other international parties national religious leaders senior provincial minister or federal representative mayor or large cityadministrators for major ngos local religious leaders local police chief

police chiefsmayor or district representative tribal leader religious leaderlocal ngo local religious authority bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency training hence progress and implementation of the principles and planwill be slowand require patience on the part of the military 4 for their part military commanders must remember that enduring campaign success will only be realized through the benefits and development for which other agencies are required other agencies enhance and truly enable the concept of comprehensive operations only in this manner will the support of the populace be obtained 5 there will be need for tact understanding and compromise as individuals and organizations are persuaded to give up some of their power and influence in the interests of greater efficiency and closer cooperation 633 facilitation of the committee system 1 boundaries civil administration police and military unit boundaries should be the same in the interests of liaison and planning and coordination and to avoid operational and intelligence conflicts and confusion police boundaries usually coincide with those of the civil administration ln cases of disagreement military boundaries should conform to the civilpolice ones because the latter are usually well established and will remain when the land force withdraws occasionally it may be expedient to adjust boundaries in order to bring known insurgent organization within the area of responsibility of one commander 2 location of headquarters and joint operations gentre joint operations centre at each level of command in support of the committee system provides the focal point for the conduct and coordination of operations and for the collection and processing of information lt also provides secure meeting place for the civil authorities police and military commanders and has the staff machinery for disseminating decisions for implementation by all the various forces and organizations within the local boundary other points to note in the establishment of the hq and joint operations centre are it should be located if possible at the police hq where police files and intelligence are readily accessible b if the military hq is not colocated communications must be established between the two locations and c opsec will remain an important consideration when working with local government and police forces 634 execution of the committee system_command and control 1 committee directives and operational orders the committee framework will vary with each situation but should run along the following lines the committee chairman or director of operations will issue policy directive for the implementation of the national and campaign plan at that regional level military assistance in drafting this document may be required the directive should reflect the lines of operation and objectives in the campaign plan and tie together the activities for all agencies involved at that level and in that region lt is issued initially as guiding document and reviewed periodically formation and unit commanders issue operational orders that reflect and implement the committee policy directive and highlight the militarys support to each of the lines of operation lt translates the general policy direction into tactical activities lt will need regular review and adjustment based on the moea b bgl323004fp003 633counterl nsurgency operations c regular and at some levels daily operational meetings will provide feedback between agencies and allow for coordination and updated direction as required d at the unit level the operational order should guide the daytoday activities of the subunits however it will require regular updating particularly the priority intelligence requirements plrs and lrs specific orders are then issued for individual deliberate operations 2 command and control much emphasis has been placed on the need for centralized direction and decisionmaking however the function of the committee system is essentially to provide forum for planning and coordination the command function remains the prerogative and responsibility of each military and police commander or civil department head these officers and officials will be expected to consult one another before taking any initiatives or making any changes to previously agreed policy or plans 3 rapid decisions there will be occasions when quick decision is needed perhaps to exploit fleeting opportunity or to foil an unexpected insurgent initiative lf there is time for military commander to consult his superior or his committee members he will have to make timely decision and act upon it provided that good understanding exists amongst the members of the local committee and within the chain of command and that some thought has been given on how to react to foreseeable contingencies the commanders decision should be sensible one commander who tells his superior the police officer and if necessary the chairman of his committee what he has done and why he has done it should expect rapid support and cooperation ln making such decisions and taking independent action commanders must consider the effects that will occur with regard to these other agencies decisions and actions should reflect the principles of coin and supporl the longterm operational objectives of the campaign sectton 14 employment of combat arms and support arms 1 general the land force will play the key role in the conduct of coin as with any type of military campaign the combat arms and support arms will all have separate but mutually supporting roles to play military forces generally face lower threat from insurgents than they do when facing conventional enemy however the nature of coin operations creates high demand for patrolling and interaction amongst the civil population and unique level of exposure to an enemy indistinguishable from the local populace premium will be placed on infantry for these tasks hence noninfantry arms may be required to rerole in order to undertake these manpowerintensive operations regardless of the situation such units must be prepared to conduct their normal combat functions should the threat warrant it 2 lnfantry given the nature of coinwith its requirement for pervasive widespread operationsinfantry units will be in high demand both mechanized and light infantry complete their missions dismounted in all operations not simply coin mechanized infantry have the advantage of protection mobility and firepower while light infantry adapt more readily to close terrain such as urban areas jungle and mountainous terrain given the need for rapid reaction the size of aos and the ink spot doctrine of continually extending the influence of the security forces and their campaign even light infantry will require integral means of transport for the conduct of operations regardless of the means of transport all junior leaders and soldiers must understand that success in coin will only be realized by dismounting and spending time amongst the local populace and gaining information from them 3 armour armour and all heavy firepower must be used most judiciously in coin so as to avoid the david versus goliath psyops advantage this could give to the enemy as well as 634 bgl323004fp003land component operations in counterlnsurgency to limit unnecessary collateral destruction nonetheless particularly in high intensity coin operations armour plays valuable role with its characteristics of firepower and protection ln rural areas armour provides both breaching capabilities and the power to strike at insurgents outside the effective range of many of the typical insurgent small arms ln urban areas armour can provide invaluable protection neutralize strong points and assist in breaching structures when not employed in this capacity the troops may be employed in presence patrolling and movement control 4 armoured reconnaissance the mobility protection firepower and surveillance capabilities that are offered by armoured reconnaissance forces make them usefulfor variety of tasks apart from surveillance and mounted reconnaissance patrols they can perform area security lines of communication security route picketing convoy escort and form part of qrf amongst other tasks nonetheless armoured reconnaissance personnel must be prepared to dismount and interact with the local population in order to maximize their usefulness as i nformation collectors and confidence bu i lders 5 dismounted reconnaissance and snipers given the requirement for intelligence gathering and the need to conduct covert operations in close terrain reconnaissance and sniper detachments will prove very useful apart from gathering information they can establish and man covert ops that will trigger the deployment of other forces to kill or capture insurgents and disrupt their actions they can also provide overwatch and protection for deliberate operations such as cordons and searches 6 aviation aviation assets deployed in coin will prove most useful in the same manner as conventional operations apart from troop movement sensor tasks and fire support aviation assets provide valuable overwatch during deliberate operations timings become crucial as their appearance before the start of deliberate operation will give early warning to insurgents prior to any ambush we would seecf and prepare our ambush posifions but we would not occupy them since helicopters would always overfly the route ahead of the convoy

intelligence support to counterinsurgency operations 1 good intelligence is vital in any campaign and throughout the conduct of all of its lines of operation lt is especially inextricable to successful counterinsurgency coin where it will be in constant and continuous demand sound intelligence supports continuing success that over time will wear down the insurgent movement restricting its capability and reducing its morale accurate intelligence will permit commanders to conduct operations with precision reducing the detrimental effect on the host nation hn population and minimizing casualties among friendly forces the combined effect will be to secure and maintain the morale among the security forces and raise their standing with the civilian population 2 effective and precise use of means on both the psychological and physical planes will earn legitimacy and respect which are vital in the campaign for popular support llldirected and indiscriminate use of force will merely serve to alienate any hn population lt must be appreciatedthereforethatsoundintelligenceisaprecursortoall colnoperations ltmustbe built up quickly and sustained efficiently from the start of campaign 3 thorough knowledge of the extent of the insurgency the political and military aims command structures and logistic network of the insurgents should allow the hn government and coalition forces to develop longterm overall strategy and sensible military policies to defeat the insurgency on the physical and psychological planes at all levels intelligence will permit commanders to put the strategy and policies into practice allowing for the defeat of the insurgents by killing capturing or arresting individuals and depriving them of targets intelligence the means of command and communication weapons ammunition food and other supplies attrition of all these elements will reduce the insurgents ability to maintain the campaign 4 ln orderto be truly successful in coin campaign the concept of intelligence and its analysis must be extremely broad lntelligence staff will be key to establishing broad knowledge base regarding all systems within the environment political military economic social including religious and cultural characteristics informational and infrastructure they must come to understand and describe for the commander power structures and the relationships between these systems and their overall influence on the successful outcome of the campaign lf the objectives of coin campaign are in general to gain support of the population and address the underlying causes of the insurgency these can only be achieved if this broad knowledge base is created for example accurate intelligence regarding the exact locations of insurgent forces will be important but will not lead to enduring success if the to john keegan tntetligence in war knowledge of the enemy from napoleon to aiqaeda london key porter books 2003 pg 364 bgl323004fp003 71counterlnsurgency operations intelligence picture does not assess the root causes of the insurgency such as lack of economic development and political representation of particular ethnic minority 5 furthermore intelligence analysis must include the establishment of measures of effectiveness sothat progress on each of the campaigns lines of operation may be measured this will include base line or startstate along with specific means to measure progress 6 there is nothing radical in the application of the fundamentals of intelligence to coin campaign there are however three aspects that will carry greater emphasis than might be the case in conventional campaigns the predominance of human intelligence humint b the influence of the civilian authority on coin operations and the consequent constraints and complications on intelligence gathering and c the appearance that at times operations are in support of intelligence rather than the reverse 702 the importance of human intelligence 1 ln any campaign the purpose of intelligence is to determine the threat by accurate and timely assessment of both capability and intentions and the influencing environmental factors so that the commander may develop plan to bring about successful mission and ultimately conclusion to the campaign ln coin operations the insurgencynot just the insurgent but the insurgencys idea and appealmust be defeated and this can be done only if commanders are given sufficient knowledge of the enemy and other environmental factors 2 ln situations where the insurgent lives among the population without uniform or recognizable military structure his capabilities and intentions will be largely determined from information provided by the population and individuals moving in close proximity to him sophisticated intelligence sensors crucial in generalwar normally cannot match the humint agent the informer surveillance from observation posts or the reports from routine police or army patrols timeconsuming collation of detail and painstaking analysis may then prove the key to unravelling important aspects of the insurgents activity and his ability to influence populations processing humint is enhanced with the use of recent software applications such as link analysis and spreadsheets 703 civilian control and political legal constraints 1 lntelligence gathering in coin campaign will in all probability lack the freedom that may be enjoyed in conventional operations the primacy of civilian political control the balance between efforts to defeat the insurgency and those expended on crime prevention and resolution the need to share with other agencies legal limitations and the need for admissible evidence for prosecution will all constrain the gathering of intelligence military intelligence staffs may find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances subordinated to civilian control and methods of operating particularly when supporting police 704 activities in support of intelligence 1 ln operations where the reliance on humint is paramount many operations and activities will be conducted for the express or at least parallel task of gaining information this is particularly the case for dismounted presence patrols the dismounted soldier becomes the eyes and ears of an intelligence organization the value of extensive patrolling and subsequent 72 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in cou nterlnsurgency debriefing may not be readily apparent to the soldier for example the true aim might be to develop picture of patterns of insurgent behaviour over protracted period rather than short term reconnaissance for immediate offensive action the need to win the minds and hearts of the population so to weaken sympathy for insurgents and thus increase the potential flow of information may also try the soldiers patience and morale as he is obliged to adopt less aggressive stance than he might otheruuise have chosen 2 the importance of information collection must be stressed to the soldiers and they also benefit from and are motivated by an information feedback that demonstrates how the information they collected has benefited the mission 705 principles of intelligence 1 the four stages of the lntelligence cycle direction collection processing and dissemination and the application of the eight principles of intelligence remain extant in coin and provide the structure within which the intelligence organization operates the eight principles of intelligence are centralized control b timeliness c systematic exploitation d objectivity accessibility f responsiveness g source protection and h continuous review sectton 2 establishing knowledge base in support of counterinsurgency campaign 706 assessment of the environment 1 the conduct of successful campaign may require broad range of elements or systems within an environment to be considered for their role and influence in the campaign such is the case in coin campaign in which the population and its various leaders and institutions will play key role in campaign success for their support is vital for success thus the systems within the environment must be considered and will cover the range of political military economic social including culture and religion information and infrastructure pmesll their relationship to the population and support for the campaign must be assessed it is this necessity that makes the campaigning environment complex and demands that intelligence staff focus on and evaluate all these systems vice simply the insurgent and his military capabilities figure 71 illustrates the complexity of an environment bgl323004fp003 73counterlnsurgency operations ooo clo 0 c cl eoo c 5otrule of education religion humanitarian health lnformation militarysecurity economiccommerciala nation or society constituents of nation or societyadministrative political governance figure 71 lnterrelated elements of an environment and society 2 therefore the intelligence staff must work to formulate broad knowledge base that will allow all relevant systems to be understood and engaged as required to create enduring solutions to the insurgency the knowledge base must include the influences that history and culture play in each system 3 the knowledge base must also analyze each element of the society along with the key members of each element and understand the role they play in the environment their aims in relation to the campaign and overall srlccess and the influence they have on other systems within the environment apart from creating detailed situational awareness the knowledge base should identify root causes and grievances that led to the insurgency and crisis in the first place this will help inform the development of operational objectives and supporting effects only in this way will the commander know what who and how to engage within the campaign to move towards the desired objectives and endstate 4 given that enduring solutions to underlying grievances and problems in many of the pmesii systems are beyond the capabilities of military forces the coin campaign demands comprehensive approach that will use various elements of powermultiple agenciesto conduct the campaign and create enduring solutions 5 regardless of what agencies are used to undertake activities much of the assessment in support of operations will come from military intelligence staff however just as with the rest of the military intelligence staff will be limited in their capabilities to conduct full assessment of all these systems and their major players 6 thus intelligence staff will seek out expertise in each of these areas as required these may include cultural economic and political experts to name few many of these experts will reside in other agencies and their support of military analysis will be facilitated by the use of intelligence committees 7 the creation of such broad knowledge base and its accompanying analysis will allow the commander to decide what effects need to be created in each of these systems in order to 74 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency rcalize operational objectives and thus what activities need to be conducted the development of the knowledge base will take time and must be guided by an intelligence preparation of the battlespace lpb process designed for the complexity of the operating environment 707 spectrum of relative interest 1 the systems in an environment do not exist without the people or actors who populate them lt is these individuals and groups along with their attitudes regarding the outcome of the campaign that must be considered and assessed hence this requires classification of all the actors which range from the adversary through hostile and neutral to friendly forces and allies within the battlespace as they relate to the interests and objectives of the friendly force this may be labelled the spectrum of relative interest and where these actors fit along the spectrum in relation to the desired endstate willweigh heavily on the commanders consideration of what effects he will apply to modify their positions and align them with his interests that is have them support the campaign see figure 72 some of these effects will be physical but many others specifically those seeking to engender support from the target will be psychological effects the result of influence activities the individuals and groups are all targets or target audiences for engagement either on the physical plane the psychological plane or both81 2 this approach requires cultural understanding and stems in part from the need to engender support from local populations and to engage other elements of an environment ln order to support this approach the knowledge base must gain insight into the psychological plane and the intent motivations and relationships of elements in the battlespace in order to move them through an effect of influence to position of acceptance cooperation or even support the assessment and analysis that leads to this spectrum of relative interest categorization supports the targeting process for each of the audiences on the spectrum of relative interest is assessed with respect to how they may be influenced and moved to position of support or acceptance tt with respect to the term targets broader understanding the term must be used targets will include adversary elements friendly and allied elements and neutral audiences nothing nefarious is meant by the term but it should be viewed in the sense of business advertisement targeting particular audience thus all target engagements are considered together in complementary and comprehensive fashion bgl323004i fp003 75counterl nsurgency operations support for the more less figure 72 the spectrum of relative lnterest 3 each of the groups within an environment may be plotted along the spectrum of relative interest and an assessment may be made as to what activities are required to either maintain their support or to move them to position of supportto produce effects on their perceptions understanding and will in supporl of the endstates of the campaign 4 this approach must also recognize the paradigm shift in information acquisition ln major combat operations significant part of the information required to establish understanding by the commander might flow from national or higher echelon sources however in coin campaign this shifts towards an information flow model that is more bottomup with soldiers in direct contact as the key source of information ln many such circumstances actionable intelligence regarding adversary targets and the motivations for their support will come from contact with the local populace furthermore such contact will provide useful input for measures of effectiveness particularly in terms of gauging the reaction of the local populace to the campaigns activities and conduct sectron 3 direction 708 general 1 the intelligence cycle will begin with direction that stems from the requirements determined in the campaign planning process and subsequent planning processes for supporting operational plans 2 direction will be implemented through national chains of command and through hn and coalition chains of command once the campaign begins plans and direction will likely be formulated at least in the coalition and with the hn authorities through committee system whilst there will be certain frustrations in working through committee system it will ensure 76 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency close coordination and integration amongst different agencies and capabilities which will allow for effective and complementary direction to be issued 709 intelligenge architecture and the organization of intelligence in counterinsurgency_design of intelligence architecture 1 early in coin campaign it will be necessary to establish chain of operational command that reflects the political and military requirements of the hn and assisting coalition when this has been established there will be need for supporting structure of intelligence staffs placed at appropriate levels in order to provide timely responsive intelligence for commanders lt is inevitable that the intelligence structure will develop with the campaign the architecture must anticipate this and deploy progressive stages of capability that can be readily linked together ln parallel with these staffs communications network that permits the rapid efficient passage of intelligence data of different types upwards downwards and sideways must be established ln coalition operation it will need to cross national military civilian and service boundaries so that it can link staffs and agencies at every level 2 unlike the military chain of command which is purely hierarchical this network should be constructed on the principle of providing intelligence from where it is available to wherever it is required this may result in it bypassing some levels of command in order that it reach the appropriate user this skipechelon system like collaborative parallel planning will ensure information is available on the pull rather than the push principle at whatever level of command may need it the intelligence architecture is not simply communications network for it includes the allocation of areas of intelligence responsibility alr to each level of command lt specifies precisely the authority to task individual collection assets and allocates the reporting authoritywho is responsible for the provision of fused intelligence reports based on information from collectors the intelligence architecture should form an annex to the operational directive under the title of the intelligence plan 3 ln support of operations it may be necessary to form an allsource intelligence centre asic within which there may be variety of enabling groups such as humint support group hsg cryptological support group csg or an image intelligence lmlnt support group lsg these may be an element within the contingent of single nation or they may be part of committee system specialist intelligence should always be kept under close review when operating with allies as it can encourage exclusivity and reduce the mutual trust so necessary for effective cooperation 710 constraints 1 there will be constraints on this free flow of data caused by the necessity to apply the need to know principle this is vitalfor humint source protection some intelligence perhaps that which is provided from strategic sources may not be made available to all intelligence staffs at every level for example material with national caveats may be made available from domestic agency for national commanders only there will be need for special handling procedures for this and other such material ln such circumstances as minimum national intelligence cell nlc may be established 711 straining communications networks 1 lnevitably extensive intelligence data networks will place large burden on the communications available this should be borne in mind when designing the intelligence architecture with as much use being made of existing systems as possible ln coin bgl323004fp003 77counterlnsurgency operations campaign the usage by intelligence organizations of available bandwidth will outstrip that of all other users due to the need for access to national databases imagery products and the output of national agencies this is pafticularly the case when satellite communications are established in the theatre 2 operational planning must take into consideration this demand on communications infrastructure 712 centralizedcontrol 1 the need for centralized control lntelligence assets are normally centralized at the highest appropriate level of command in order to be available across the widest possible area of operations and group of users ln coin operations there are further imperatives for centralized control where several intelligence organizations are working against common target there is the danger of overlap while some duplication is necessary to improve the evaluation of information by its being confirmed from more than single source the danger exists in the possibility of single source being exploited by more than one agency each in ignorance of one another this can lead to false confirmation and in turn gives the source greater credibility than may be its worth there is also the potential for undesirable wastage of effort and resources 2 the director of lntelligence ln designing the intelligence organization decision must be made to centrally coordinate all intelligence staffsmilitary civilian hn and coalition ldeally single director of intelligence should be established at the national level with similar posts at each lower level of command this may be the civilian administrative authority or military command depending upon the circumstances 713 integration and the committee system_establishing an intelligence committee 1 lntelligence committees should be established at each level of command in order to coordinate the collection processing and dissemination of information and intelligence each committee would owe allegiance to the next higher level which would be responsible for the effectiveness and coordination of the intelligence efforts of those below it lntelligence committees may be subcommittees of militarypolice security force committees lntelligence committees should meet regularly if there is to be useful exchange and discussion of intelligence and good working relationship between civil authorities police and military intelligence staffs established 2 membership of the intelligence committee should be arranged mutually between the hn intelligence services both civilian and military and those of coalition intelligence staffs security classifications will restrict complete sharing of information and there may be established inner committees of nations with similar resources and interests this however has the potential of creating two classes of nations and accompanying animosity efforts must be made to avoid such situations 714 functions of an intelligence committee 1 the functions of an intelligence committee are as follows at the hn level to keep the government the civil and military commanders chiefs of staff and operations staffs informed of all aspects of intelligence and 7b bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency security operations and to facilitate the exchange and provision of the intelligence necessary for the prosecution of strategic campaign b at subordinate levels to keep its related operations committees and the next higher intelligence committee fully informed with relevant intelligence for operational planning c to advise operational staffs on security and protective measures d to develop the collection plan against which the collection agencies will be tasked to direct the collection agencies the intelligence staffs through the g3 operations staff will allocate tasks and priorities along with limitations for when the information must be obtained f where possible to establish common procedures for all hn and allied intelligence and security organizations g to provide an appropriate dissemination service to commanders h to ensure coordination the intelligence committee should ensure that coordination in the following areas occurs 1 civil police and army boundaries are the same and accord with the civil authority and security force command system this may not always be possible 2 agreed plans and direction from the committee is allocated to respective members in an appropriate fashion 3 lnformation and intelligence flow downwards as well as upwards and sideways to neighbouring committees where appropriate 4 representatives of government departments and hn experts are co opted for special advice and local or culture perspectives with due regard for security they might come from wide variety of agencies such as customs services and coastguards the transportation department rail services inland water transporl civil engineering telecommunications power and water suppliers and from wider circle of the hn community which might include farmers businessmen and other traders 715 central intelligence staffs 1 subordinate to the committees there should be centralized integrated staff capable of performing collection coordination and intelligence requirements management ccirm database management and fusion functions on behalf of all the intelligence staffs of that particular mission for this reason the concept of the asic was developed as part of the intelligence plan clear orders should be given regarding which level has responsibility for maintaining master database lt is essential to prevent every level of intelligence staff running databases in parallel although it will never be possible to avoid some duplication of record keeping there should be minimum of databases with single levelprobably the highest hn or lead coalition nationmaintaining the master database with subordinate and other levels submitting changes to it in the form of datachange requests maintenance of single database is facilitated by the pull rather than the push method of information retrieval and by close cooperation between all collectors analytical staffs and committees bgl323004fp003 79counterlnsurgency operations 2 while intelligence committees give general directionlaying down policy and allotting general aims collection tasks and prioritiesthey do not exercise command command and control remains the prerogative of the commanders civilian and military over both their respective intelligence staffs and their collection agencies 716 fundamentals of intelligence organization 1 whatever the design of the intelligence architecture the organization and the sources and agencies deployed there are number of fundamentals that should be considered in intelligence architecture organization these must be considered at the outset and plans made for their inclusion in the structures gontinuity units should be kept in the same area of responsibility aor for as long as possible this ensures that they become familiar with the hn inhabitants power structures other security forces the terrain and infrastructure consequently they are better able to measure their opponents and they acquire the ability to develop information into intelligence ln short they get feel for what is normal as background against which to observe the abnormal flexibility an intelligence organization is designed to meet specific situation but it must be receptive to the adjustments needed when the insurgent threat develops in new directions themes strategies and tactics or the situation changes in some other way such changes in the situation may make fresh demands upon specialist services such as imagery interpretation or interrogation commanders and their intelligence staffs must be able to respond quickly to new needs by redeploying resources and where necessary adjusting the functions they fulfill furthermore intelligence staff and the organizations must be capable of collecting and assessing information regarding all systems within the environment rather than simply collecting information on the enemy robust information handling capability the intelligence system whatever its shape must be able to cope with an increasing amount of information as units with growing experience become more productive and betterfocused lt is hoped that with time the indigenous population becomes sufficiently confident to pass more information to the security forces as this happens sufficient intelligencetrained personnel must be made available to collate the additional information analyze and fuse it interpret its meaning and disseminate the resulting intelligence in time for it to be used operationally 1 specialists the training of analysts source handlers surveillance operators imagery interpreters linguists interrogators and other intelligence specialists must be developed as early as possible if the inevitable shortage of such skilled personnel which exists at the beginning of any campaign is to be overcome the careful husbandry of scarce skills specific to the ongoing campaign is necessary throughout campaign but particularly essential at the beginning until more trained specialists become available 2 liaison lf the intelligence organization is to work effectively and efficiently good liaison between all intelligence organizations and agencieshn allied civilian and militaryis paramount the specialists referred to above are vital elements in establishing effective liaison with hn intelligence agencies the sensitivities of such intelligence liaisonb 710 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency duties require the liaison officer to have wide experience of military capabilities and knowledge of intelligence security the need for security especially source protection must be fully understood within the intelligence organization and among those to whom it is disseminated the need to know principle has to be enforced and clear guidelines given on dissemination particularly to hn civilian authorities ln the immediate era of canadian confederation 18641870 the first canadian lntelligence service was formed under one gilbert mcmicken stipendiary magistrate based in wlndsor ontario this period saw numerous and confusing alarms brought on by the american civil war and the subsequent fenian insurrectionary movement an extreme lrish nationalist movement that raided canada with the aim to influence british policy on lreland mcmicken had organized an excellent detective force along the frontier and had wide acquaintance of spies and informers prime minister sir john alexander macdonald usually knew more about the plans of the fenians than the fenians did themselves extract and quote from donald creighton john macdonald the young politician toronto the macmillan company of canada ltd 1956 pages 393 421 and 438439 717 intelligence staff organization 1 there is fixed establishment for an intelligence organization nor is there any pre determined scale on which to base its composition lts size will be determined by the extent and nature of the threat the commanders requirements the architecture necessary to support operations and the intelligence collection agencies that can be made available 2 within coin campaign there will be an enormous demand for information regarding the systems in the environment pmesll that may influence the support of the population and the successful outcome of the campaign the intelligence staff organization must grow to include specialists in those nonmilitary areas they will be able to advise the commander and staff planners regarding the role and influences of these systems the cultural context within which they operate and the means needed to create desired effects within them ln addition to political advisors intelligence staff may include economic cultural and religious advisors as necessary they will also be helpful in the determination of measures of effectiveness 3 as two campaigns are ever fought in quite the same circumstances it follows that the intelligence organization for each new commitment should be customized although past campaigns will provide guidance and lessons where there are useful parallels ln all cases the principles of intelligence and fundamentals for organization should be followed 4 the size of any national contribution to coin campaign will have to be designed in consultation with the senior intelligence officer and the intelligence staff of the hn almost cedainly the size of intelligence staffs will grow as the campaign develops 718 factors affecting committee integration 1 although single centrally controlled integrated intelligence organization answering to single director of intelligence is the ideal the circumstances prevailing in hn and coalition campaign may not be conducive to such system where it cannot be achieved compromise3 bgl323004fp003 711counterlnsurgency operations solution must be brokered between the interested parties the establishment of centralized system may be affected by variety of factors including the effectiveness reliability and vulnerability of the hns security forces and its intelligence and security organization b willingness by all parties to cooperate to share information and details of perhaps sensitive hn sources other intelligence details and pafticularly at the higher levels matters of political sensitivity c the different points of view and doctrine of the security forces both hn and allied because the hns security forces in parlicular the police must continue to live and work among the population after the eventual departure of the allies they will be subject to greater internal pressures and constraints lt is important that intelligence staffs overcome this problem as failure to integrate will seriously impede the intelligence effort d the degree of authority delegated to officials at each level of the command structure and committee level national provincial regional and district 719 allsourceintelligencecentre 1 whether or not an intelligence committee is established the normal focus for intelligence for campaign forces will be the allsource intelligence centre asic or if joint operation the joint asic jasic which will be located alongside the joint operations cell joc forming the hub of any joint task force headquarters jtfhq 2 within the asic will be the senior intelligence officer and his staff this will include ccirm and the allsource cell asc in which fusion and analysis will be conducted representatives of the agencies e9 hsg csg and isg will be located in the asc ln some cases it will be necessary for these elements to be afforded their own segregated area with more stringent access controls 720 tasking_the commanders intelligence requirements 1 direction will begin with determination of the commanders intelligence requirements or as they are more commonly termed priority intelligence requirements plr these will be the product of his mission analysis and should be discussed with the senior intelligence officer who will be able to ensure that they are accurately focused 2 lt may not be possible in the early stages of campaign to fully state the commanders intelligence requirements when this is the case the intelligence staffs have the responsibility of giving guidance to commanders on the kind of intelligence that they will require this may be done by an intelligence estimate an intelligence estimate takes the commanders plan matter how broadly defined and compares it with existing intelligence on the insurgency 3 concurrent with the intelligence estimate the staff should apply intelligence preparation of the battlefield lpb together the intelligence estimate and ipb will give the intelligence staff good idea of the gaps in their knowledge which can form the basis of the initial collection plan lt is likely particularly in the initial stages that there will be shortfall in intelligence with more basic intelligence than current intelligence available the preparation of an initial collection plan will also give some indication of the necessary collection assets and intelligence architecture that will be needed for the campaign 712 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency 4 ibp within coin campaign must focus not only on matters of terrain but on the culturalfactors and environmental systems pmesllthat are at play in the insurgency 721 direction to the collectors 1 even when an intelligence organization has been established information does not flow automatically into the hands of the intelligence staff and then to the commander lf direction is poor the intelligence organization may be in danger of collecting large quantities of irrelevant information 2 commander must give his intelligence staff clear direction and firm indication of the priorities to be allotted to his intelligence requirements on receipt of the commanders intelligence requirements the intelligence staff will with the aid of the intelligence estimate and lpb identify gaps in the intelligence already held these gaps should be filled by tasking collection agencies units and resources to collect against them the questions put to the collectors are known as information requirements lr and their collection is carefully planned by the senior intelligence officer in conjunction with his ccirm staff who will coordinate the collection plan lrs and the related intelligence requirements the resultant collection plan must in turn be approved by the commander before collectors receive their direction from the operations and intelligence staffs the collection plan will normally be maintained on collection worksheet that will show the allocation of tasks in order of priority to individual collection agencies and the time and form in which information is to be reported section 4 collection 722 general 1 there are two aspects of collection exploitation by intelligence staffs of their sources and agencies and the timely delivery of collected information to intelligence staffs for subsequent processing into intelligence or when appropriate directly to weapon systems collection will be based on the collection plan drawn up by the intelligence staffs under the direction of commanders and the intelligence committees during the direction phase the ccirm staff will manage collection 723 human intelligence_collegtion of human intelligence 1 the most effective source of intelligence during coin campaign will be that derived from the direct questioning of persons whether formally or informally in other words from humint sources humint sources may include the following coalition military sources this will include all ranks of the security forces especially those whose duties require them to move among the hn population on patrols on collection of locallyproduced supplies on liaison with hn authorities dock workers airport workers aid workers and the like lt is vital that all such personnel are thoroughly briefed on the gaps in intelligence that their duties might enable them to fill they should be made intelligence aware so that they are always prepared to report information which may appear trivial but which when added to other pieces may be important dismounted patrols are critical to collection in coin operations and all soldiers are sensors who should be debriefed upon return patrol report formats may have to be amended to better suit the environment in which forces are operating bgl323004fp003 713counterlnsurgency operations hn security forces hn security forces will include military paramilitary auxiliaries reserves and police forces they will be an excellent source of information along with the cultural reference but they must be handled with great sensitivity the forces intimate knowledge of the local population culture and related grievances will provide more accurate information of value both when on duty and on leave like their coalition counterparts they should be encouraged to become intelligence aware attempts should be made systematically to brief those going on leave locally and debrief them on return care must be taken not to duplicate the information collection from police officers being undertaken by their own intelligence staff police equivalents are very likely to be handling their own sources among the population lt is probable that there will be strong reluctance to disclose these sources to intelligence staffs but their tasking and the information they provide should be coordinated and fused by

important to be fully aware of the legal basis under which interrogation takes place systematic interrogation of captured insurgents can have excellent results particularly in building picture of command structures communications and other aspects of the insurgents infrastructure ln lowlevel conflict interrogation is less likely to produce intelligence of immediate tactical value simply because insurgent operational methods normally involve very restricted circle within which future plans are discussed ln general terms but not always so interrogation should be capable of producing evidence that will be acceptable in court lt is vital therefore that it is conducted strictly in accordance with rules laid down by the hns judiciary and the law of armed conflict debriefing

done by making confidential telephone lines text message numbers or post office box numbers available and by keeping routine military patrols in close proximity to the population they may also be permitted to pass information during vehicle checkpoints vcps during cordon and search operations or during other activities such as civilian medical clinics doing so will permit budding informant to

useful information that reaches the intelligence staff will come from informers and agents ln humint terms an agent is person specifically recruited and trained placed in hostile organization and who is tasked with information gathering on the organization of which he is part in other words controlled source an informer is person who perhaps uninvited passes information to an opponent about his organization in other words an uncontrolled source small number of well placed and reliable agents can provide information of value well beyond their cost particularly if aimed at the pivotal points in the insurgents command lf agents are able to penetrate the top level of the insurgents command and control organization information may be provided on the development of their strategies the identification of important leaders the system of liaison between the military wing and the insurgent political leadership and the methods of acquiring resources at lower echelons informers are useful in providing information on for example personalities tactical plans and weapon caches at these levels if continuity is to be maintained it is important that the agent network expands at similar rate to that of the insurgent movement othenruise their relative value will diminish the problem with acting on information supplied by an individual is sourceprotection ln an insurgent organization the circle of knowledge is kept small lf an informer reports the move of weapons to new hide for example perhaps only three insurgents have been made aware the courier the commander and the quaftermaster subsequent immediate operation by the security forces to recover the weapons might raise suspicions this could seriously jeopardize the security of the source therefore care must be exercised in such matters and the advice of the hsg sought when planning operations nongovernmental organizationslnternational organizations reports surveys and databases created by nonmilitary organizations and other agencies offer potential wealth of information for the intelligence organization materials created by these organizations may contain information not available to military sources due to the close contact these organizations enjoy with the public lt should be noted that in the interest of maintain impartiality neutrality and favourable operating environment some of these organizations may not be interested in sharing their information with the military these relationships must be cultivated with care and will often depend upon the personalities involved to bgl323004fp003i ntelligence in

effect liaison closely with each other this liaison is vital to ensure deconfliction source should ever be run by more than single agency lf single source works for more than one agency it is possible that his reports can unwittingly confirm themselves this false confirmation sometimes called false corroboration is danger to the intelligence process and can cause the source to gain greater credence than his worth furthermore if the situation becomes known to the insurgents they can exploit the false collateral at the expense of the security forces b veracity there is always the risk of source if not properly handled producing information which is unreliable or even acting as double agent tasking must be rigidly controlled to reduce the likelihood of this happening reliability of sources must always be evaluated with great care and records maintained by the humint agency c security the smaller the circle of people knowing the identity of source the safer he can operate lf sources are to be maintained and confidence spread sourceprotection must be effective and be seen to be effective 725 open source intelligence and publications_open source intelligence 1 lntelligence derived from open sources osint is playing an increasingly important role nowhere however will the role of the media be more important than in coin the actions of the security forces will be scrutinized closely and will play major pad in forming public opinion and in building and maintaining the legitimacy of the campaign relations with the media are not the direct responsibility of the intelligence staff they should remember however that reporters can get access where security forces often cannot furthermore press teams are often out and about for protracted periods warm relationship built up between intelligence staffs and individual members of the press corps can reap dividends in the form of lowlevel information 2 many journalists will cover the campaign for an extended period visiting the country for number of weeks at time before returning home for one or two months they may even be regional expert with unique range of contacts lf an intelligence staff develops sufficient bgl323004fp003 717counterl nsurgency operations relationship with individual members of media team information might be forthcoming in return for perhaps sanitized update or security brief on their return to the theatre of operations journalists may be useful in providing insight into the feelings and concerns of the local populace or the opinions of local leaders 3 media reports should always be regarded with caution they are likely to include bias to some particular purpose rather than be straight reporting of unabridged or unelaborated facts commanders may have seen the morning news on television about the campaign immediately before being briefed by the staff this will inevitably lead to staffs having to respond to press reports rather than leading on subjects of their choosing with unfortunate results lntelligence officers should take steps to avoid briefings developing in this way hn media in particular will have vital role to play in building campaign legitimacy and in gaining the support of the populace and intelligence staff can expect to play part in this with the public affairs staff 726 open source publications 1 ln addition to the current reporting of news teams in theatre there is likely to be considerable opensource material produced prior to the campaign which will go some way to meeting intelligence staffs requirements for basic intelligence this can include the lnternet atlases encyclopaedias travel books statistical summaries and host of other references produced by the specialistinterest press covering the armed forces and the political economic and geographical situations inside the country 2 additionally with media savvy opponent the intelligence staffs should attempt to catalogue insurgent publications for they can sometimes reveal aspects of the insurgents that are otherwise unknown 3 lt must be remembered that the insurgent movement will also attempt to make use of the media to spread its own views and discredit those of the government and the security forces while they may use the media as mechanism to air legitimate grievances insurgents will also manipulate the media to their advantage to disseminate manifestos broadcast staged acts and gain the publics sympathy the monitoring and assessment of such propaganda will allow staff planners to develop plans to counter insurgent propaganda and to even preempt it

they will provide not only intelligence collection on behalf of higher headquarters but will monitor communications during the conduct of tactical operations for the purposes of intelligence collection and force protection the monitoring of communications nets may give an indication of impending attack or an attempt to flee an area during the conduct of tactical operation thus allowing forces to take preventative or protective action 3 the detection of insurgent command and control c2 networks may be considered target for possible engagement however the advantages to be gained from attacking their means and locations must be weighed against the advantages to be gained from monitoring their c2 means and exploiting them for purposes of intelligence gathering and force protection

effectiveness 1 lntelligence staff will play role in the determination and application of moe ln order to overcome the difficulties in their selection and application some basic principles exist that can aid in the development of useful moes causalityst definitive cause and effect relationship must be established between the activity and the effect attempting to be measured given the cultural and other variables present there has to be reasonable likelihood that the planned activity will create the desired effect secondly commanders and staff must be able to assess any other extant factors that may be causing the effect other than their own activities likewise they must ascertain if the measured effect is merely coincidental b quantifiablest an moe that can be counted helps to remove some of the subjectivity that plagues moes on the cognitive plane quantification allows accurate trend measurementss c observable and attributable when drafting moes consideration should be given to the possibility that all of the variables influencing an activity and change in behaviour cannot be observed the moes must be able to recognize trend or change and confirm the connection or attribution to the activity for example if the presence or absence of negative graffiti is being used as an informal indicator of support for campaign and military force in an urban area observers will ideally be able to ascertain its timing ie when itwas done its attribution to particular group e9 political criminal military the groups motive and whether it represents minority or majority viewpoint its attribution in terms of cause particularly if it appears as reaction to specific event or action and its location in relation to the cultural makeup of the local environment d gorrelated

bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency operational and tactical levels will measure the incremental progress through effects and objectives flexibility although moes should be drafted at the planning stage they should remain under regular review and commanders must be prepared to adjust them as required they must evolve as mission progresses particularly as the consequence of their activities leads to the attainment of operational effects similarly moes are likely not transferable from mission to mission even if mission takes place in the same area of operations ao the passage of time will force reconsideration of moes previously employed collection the commander must possess the capabilities to collect the intelligence necessary to apply an moe and provide the direction and guidance to do so plans must be made to collect and assess moes through all units in the ao as part of the g2 information collection plan collection may be assisted by other agencies however without formal command relationship this may have to be done informally nevertheless other nonmilitary agencies may prove to be an effective gauge of progress in creating desired perceptions and will in target audience for example increased cooperation with nongovernmental organizations ngos or other government departments ogds may indicate greater acceptance of the campaign relativity lmprovements sought in given environment must be relative to the specific environment and to what is considered normal for that particular environment and culture expectations for situational improvement must be reasonable given the starting state and the normal state of that particular environment lmprovements to situation that will make it relatively normal for that environment may come quickly however systemic improvements in absolute terms may require cultural changes over very long period of time expectations for change and the related moes should be set as incremental milestones so that improvement can be measured and demonstrated as tangible progress over time for example decrease in criminal activity must be initially compared with the normal levels for the environment that existed before the security situation demanded military intervention 2 developing appropriate moes to assess effects on the psychological plane is very difficult task willpower perceptions and beliefs are all lessthancompletelytangible variables that defy simple measurement observing and measuring trends is one of the surest ways of gauging target audiences attitude trends however require definable baseline and this will be difficult to identify 731 sensitive site exploitation 1 lntelligence staffs will be required to support the conduct of sensitive site exploitation sse in which specially trained personnel systematically search specific location in the search for evidence or other information or material lntelligence staffs will help identify the target location immediate threats and evidence or items to be sought 2 sse will often be used to collect information for additional operations or for evidence to support subsequent legal prosecution of insurgent suspects much of it therefore will be planned and done in conjunction with civilian counterpartsg bgl323004fp003 721cou nter i nsurgency operations section 5 progessing 732 processing as discipline 1 the processing stage of the intelligence cycle incorporates the work of the intelligence staff in collation analysis integration or synthesis and interpretation of information 2 the processing staff will normally be trained intelligence operators often from all three services supported by specialists in the collection disciplines where appropriate specialists from other arms and services willjoin the analytical staff for example engineer intelligence operators with their specialist knowledge of terrain explosives and route construction alternately ammunition technicians with their training in explosives firing devices and weapon inspection are able to develop weapons intelligence in conjunction with the police forensic scientists this discipline based on such techniques as weapon matching will be able to trace weapons to their sources of supply to rounds they have fired explosives and detonators to their origin and so on 3 given the need in coin campaign to create broad knowledge base incorporating the pmesii systems of an environment the processing stage will be complicated and require the process to be applied to an enormous volume of information lt is in this staff discipline where many of the nonmilitary analysts will reside 733 fusion of intelligence 1 the best results will be obtained from those intelligence organizations that are fully integrated and work to centrallyagreed collection plan employing effective ccirm personnel fusion and database managers analysts and other intelligence specialists who approach their task in structured objective and systematic way 2 one of the critical tasks performed in the asic is that of fusion this is the collation of reports and information from the separate singlesource agencies such as humint sigint and imint into single assessment each agency produces its own view of an event or activity and reports it to the intelligence staff this is known as singlesource picture compilation the fused assessmentthe assessment made by the comparison of more than one singlesource reportbecomes the recognized tactical ground or maritime or air picture the recognized picture will be produced at the level with responsibility for reporting which is usually the level maintaining the database as that is where the broadest view will exist this fused assessment becomes the authoritative view which forms the basis for assessments by all subordinate intelligence staffs lt will be disseminated upwards downwards and to the flanks in the form of intelligence summaries intsums 734 databases 1 one of the fundamentals of effective processing is the maintenance of an efficient database ln coin campaign there will be plethora of small apparently insignificant and unconnected data only effective collation and crossreferencing will enable analysts to assess the significance of individual pieces and make best use of them 2 additionally databases will be key to successful relief in place when units and headquarters rotate between aos or into theatre consideration should be given to trickle relief in place of key analysts so that relief in place maintains some form of continuity in database familiarity 722 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency sectton 6 dissemination 735 responsibility 1 dissemination of intelligence to subordinate commanders is the responsibility of the director of intelligence at the highest level and of the senior intelligence officers at subordinate levels where intelligence committees are established individual intelligence chiefs of the represented services and agencies will accept responsibility for briefing their own commanders and subordinate representatives 2 depending upon the committee system used and the agencies involved limited distribution of some products may occur given security restrictions 736 use of intelligence architecture 1 lt should be emphasized that intelligence should flow not necessarily in hierarchical manner as orders along an operationalchain of command but quickly and efficiently from whoever holds it to whomever needs it this will mean that on occasion it will bypass some levels of command this flow is greatly aided by the use of information technology intsums should be disseminated at regular intervals these can be supplemented by detailed reports on specific topics e9 insurgent orbats or incidents as required 2 as with intelligence reporting in any campaign care must be taken to avoid circular reporting in which parts of summary from one intelligence staff are plagiarized in another and returned to the originator as apparent confirmation of initial assessments this problem is particularly acute in combined operations where the different national authorities include reports from third parties in their own summaries the best defence against this is clear orders for reporting authority and thorough knowledge on the part of intelligence officers of the sources and agencies available to all the intelligence staffs providing reports for the theatre 737 security 1 while intelligence is of use only in the hands of operational decisionmakers its dissemination should be closely controlled sourceprotection must always be priority lf source is at risk intelligence should be sanitized or disguised in such way as to conceal its source 2 access to intelligence in such circumstances should be restricted to those with real need to know security of intelligence must always be balanced against the value to be gained from its dissemination agencies generally have strict guidelines for dissemination of intelligence in an emergency perhaps when lives are at risk lntelligence officers need to acquaint themselves with these procedures so that emergency dissemination can take place with minimum of delay sectton 7 intelligence support to influence activities 738 general 1 procedures and methods of intelligence support to fires are well established and practised given the overarching philosophy and many of the supporting principles of coin campaign which seek to gain campaign legitimacy and popular support for the campaign and its bgl323004fp003 723counterlnsurgency operations objectives there is significant emphasis on influence activities these are activities with first order effects on the psychological plane that affect understanding perceptions will and ultimately behaviour some influence activities such as psychologicaloperations psyops and deception will support offensive operations however the aim of the majority of influence activities in coin campaign will be to undermine support for the insurgency separate the insurgents morally and physically from the populace address root causes and grievances and ultimately win mass support for the campaign 2 to this end influence activities consist of deception psyops civilmilitary cooperation clmlc public affairs and presence profile and posture of forces the conduct of each of these will have to be supported by intelligence staff in terms of addressing requirements targeting appropriate audiences and developing and collecting measures of effectiveness 739 support to civilmilitary cooperation 1 before cimic detachments assess the requirement for coordination and eventual reconstruction and governance development intelligence staffs will assess the overall state of the civil institutions and infrastructure and their relation to the root of grievances and tensions that sparked the insurgency such assessment will have to be done in relation to other pmesii factors and systems such as social or ethnic divides for example economic and social disadvantages in one region or for one ethnic group may have helped cause the insurgency therefore intelligence assessment must identify these root causes and requirements for enduring resolution 2 once this is done cimic staff may undertake prioritization of needs and work in cooperation with local and international agencies to build civil capacity and resolve civil grievances lntelligence staff through their humint network should also be able to identify to cimic staff and commanders local officials whose agenda may not support the campaign and indeed who might seek to gain personal benefit from infrastructure and governance development 3 for their part cimic staff will be able to provide their own assessment to intelligence staff regarding the situation amongst the populace and its leaders and their attitudes towards the campaign 740 support to psychological operations 1 psyops elements and commanders should work very closely with the allsource intelligence cell to plan psyops and to integrate these with other influence and fires activities lntelligence staff should assist psyops staff in target audience assessment this will be particularly true for delineating between various ethnic or tribal groups and between various leaders and power structures 2 lntelligence staff will be able to assist in historicalanalysis of the nation its traditions and past experiences all of which will help formulate the psyops message 741 support to public affairs 1 the ability of intelligence staff to support public affairs will be limited public affairs will have to seek assistance in terms of sanitized information that can be given to media and what threats to media exist in the environment 2 lntelligence staff may be able to assist public affairs in assessing the legitimacy and affiliations of indigenous media outlets and personalities 724 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in counterlnsurgency 742 support to degisions on profile posture and presence of forces 1 how soldiers and commanders present themselves can send strong messages to target audiences and the public at large although commanders should be able to make intuitive decisions in this field to great extent intelligence staff and in particular cultural advisors will be able to recommend to commanders how force postures will be viewed by indigenous groups 2 some groups may seek robust show of force and capability in initial contacts as means to accepting forces legitimacy whilst other groups will be alienated by what they consider to be an offensive first impression commanders should seek advice from intelligence staff regarding how the indigenous populations and constituent groups or tribes will view force postures 3 additionally intelligence staff should be able to assist the commander in making risk assessments regarding reductions in the profile presence and posture of troops 743 support to deception 1 the only targets acceptable for deception are the insurgents themselves and normally in direct support of an offensive or defensive action such as the use of tanks in demonstration to divert attention away from the main effort of an attack 2 lntelligence supports deception planners by analyzing an insurgents reconnaissance capabilities and identifying his perception of the battlespace and his perception of the coin forces staff also advise on insurgent deception doctrine tacticsprocedures capabilities and intentions this requires an insight into an insurgent commanders way of thinking including the estimate process 3 during the execution of deception operations allsource intelligence pafiicularly on insurgent movemenvdeployments is required to monitor the insurgents response and to determine whether the deception operation is achieving its aim ln analyzing this intelligence attention must also be paid to possible insurgent deception plans to protect his own operations sectron 8 training 744 predeploymenttraining 1 all personnel involved in the direction collection processing and dissemination of intelligence should deploy to the theatre having made thorough preparation as cohesive unit they must be clear on their role in the intelligence organization within coin campaign having had the opportunity to rehearse the issues with which they will be dealing and with those with whom they will be working 2 senior intelligence officers in particular should take the time to examine the forthcoming operation against the principles of intelligence lt is necessary to order their thoughts on architectures and intelligence support in such way that they can clearly conceive the infrastructure necessary to meet their aim of supporting the commanders plan those personnel with role requiring them to conduct liaison with other authorities should have had the opportunity to make contact with them to discuss the issues and particularly agree on their means of communication ldeally they should have the opportunity to exercise using similar communications systems before departure bgl323004fp003 725counterlnsurgency operations 3 predeployment training must begin with the principles practices and tools that have served intelligence staff well in the past this will ensure suitable and confident start point common to all personnel involved based on proven methods and procedures at the very least this will ensure well honed methods are used initially in theatre any changes required once in theatre are then taken from the confidence of proven practices and procedures any changes to practices and organization either in training or in operations should be assessed in terms of the principles of intelligence to ensure that real improvement will be obtain from the change and that the changes will not violate extant and proven principles 745 backgroundintelligence 1 military staff should be as thoroughly briefed as possible on the situation in the theatre of operations before deployment personnel recently returned from theatre or those there already but returned to advise will be able to assist with individual and unit training on intelligence matters current affairs lessons learned practices tailored to the theatre and other aspects of the insurgency 746 specialist skills 1 military staff with specialist skills should ensure that as much training as possible is done prior to arrival in theatre problems are much easier to solve particularly those involving technical equipment in benign environment where extensive support facilities exist than in potentially hostile austere environment after deployment section 9 challenges faging an intelligence organization in counterinsurgency campaign 747 creation of the broad knowledge base 1 the requirement for intelligence staff to not only produce intelligence regarding the insurgent capabilities and military intentions but to assess all the systems within the environment regarding their influences on the campaign will tax intelligence staff and their organizational capabilities greatly staff and capabilities will have to expand greatly as will their conceptual understanding of their role within the campaign and environment 2 additional staff specialists and subordinate cells will have to be created ln doing so the principles of intelligence and the basic fundamentals of organization should be respected 748 security of the expanded organization 1 finding and vetting suitable personnel while preventing insurgent penetration of rapidly enlarging intelligence system will present difficulties and risks the difficulties may be overcome by effort and cooperation the risks have to be accepted with open eyes and minimized by good security 749 conflict between centralization and decentralization 1 at the higher levels of command the principle is to centralize intelligence at the tactical level of coin campaign there will be great expectation for subunit commanders to exercise initiative furthermore operations will be conducted in dispersed nature likely in non 726 bgl323004fp003lntelligence in cou nterlnsurgency contiguous battlespace together these characteristics will demand decentralization of intelligence support 2 by applying the principle of mission command the centralized direction of intelligence policy and overarching plans need not stifle the initiative necessary to counter an insurgency and will support this decentralized demand subunit level commanders may require an intelligence processing capability within their headquarters element even without formal intelligence support they should seek to establish an intelligence cycle that links and drives an operations cycle within their scope of command this will be particularly the case if the battlespace is organized such that each subunit has its own ao 3 despite this decentralization of capability and process lack of at least centralized direction and policy will erode the control of intelligence work and product ln order to avoid this the following must be kept in mind dissemination of lntelligence given the interagency framework necessary for the conduct of coin campaign there will likely be need to share sensitive information with broader audience whilst there will remain demands to control classified information delineation will be required between the information and the source lnformation may therefore be shared with broader than normal audience as necessary maintaining reasonable precautions but without revealing the source b collection methods methods used to collect information can longer be controlled rigidly from central government humint must be handled at the lowest level possible and practical however poor procedures and control of sources may lead to breakdown in reporting double reporting and infiltration by insurgents c decisions on the threat and force protection commanders at various levels must discuss personally the threat assessment within their own areas of responsibility whilst local commanders will undoubtedly know their own areas and inhabitants the best and be able to interpret measures of effectiveness insurgents will not respect the boundaries imposed by the battlespace organization threat in one area may easily migrate even temporarily to another area thus despite the acknowledgement of success at local levels the overall threat assessment must be made from holistic centralized view 750 countering insurgent propaganda 1 lnsurgent propaganda will work to give the impression that the military forces and in particular their intelligence agencies are rogue elements in the environment acting without control appropriate governance or legitimacy this message must be effectively countered the relationship between the government the judiciary the security forces and intelligence should be indivisible and they should all be seen to be working to central common authority 751 operatingrestrigtions 1 ln combined operations the charge may be made and exploited by the insurgents that the government is under the control of foreigners the resultant sensitivity may cause the government to place greater restrictions on coalitions freedom of action this might include restrictions on intelligencegathering particularly sensitive collection in the

strategic centres of gravity of any counterinsurgency coin campaign is the local population history has shown that insurgents require only the indifference of population to operate successfully the insurgent operates amongst the population and depends on the tacit acceptance or open support of the populace for supportive operational environment thus the primary target audience of information operations lnfo ops in coin campaign is that portion of the population that is mildly supportive neutral or hostile to the insurgent movement the goal is to increase support for the host nation hn government or at the very least decrease insurgent legitimacy by undermining the narrative of the adversary through combination of words and deeds ultimately this will lead to greater support for the government and decreased support for the insurgency absent neutral or friendly populace insurgents cannot operate or thrive second primary goal of lnfo ops is the promotion of campaign legitimacy and its objectives 2 lnfo ops doctrine as developed over recent years and in line with natoo has included three key activity areas countercommand activities cca information protection activities lpa and influence activities ln review of this construct it must be realized that cca and ipa are simply offensive and defensive activities respectively and create first order effects on the physical plane lnfluence activities however seek to affect understanding perceptions and thus affect will and behaviour of the target audience as first order effects on the psychological plane for the purposes of both land force operations and this publication lnfo ops will be considered as influence activities only 3 lnfluence activities are defined as an activity designed to affect the character or behaviour of person or group as first order effect note lt affects understanding perceptions and will with the aim of affecting behaviour in desired mannerei lnfluence activities are considered as any other operation as function of capabilities specific capabilities that conduct influence activities are those that have first order effects on the psychological plane and thus that affect understanding perceptions and will as first order effects deception psyops civilmilitary cooperation clmlc presence profile and posture of troops and commanders and public affairs pa they affect the minds understanding and perception and the hearts will of target audiences 4 they will comprise the bulk of activities in coin campaign for they will create the enduring solutions to campaign namely development and the redress of grievances and thus tt john nagl better war in lraq armed forces journal august 2006 e0 see nato allied joint publication ajp 310 allied joint doctrine for information operations t army terminology panel may 2007 bgl323004fp003oaolcounterlnsurgency operations gain and hold the populations support lnfluence activities seek to predispose persuade convince deter disrupt compel or coerce approved target audiences by promoting desired themes and messages these activities may use one or more capabilities dependent upon the desired effect 5 ln coin campaign much of this will be done to gain support for the campaign and undermine support for the insurgency thus activities such as the presence of security forces in the streets the building of infrastructure the resolve of economic and social hardship that led to the insurgency and the advertisement of campaign objectives in the media should all be aimed at gaining support for the campaign and undermining insurgent claims to legitimacy 6 lnfluence activities are combined with firesphysical activities including electronic warfare ew attacks and defence that create first order physical effectsto be comprehensive operations fires and influence activities are planned targeted and conducted together in synchronized and complementary fashion through manoeuvre and battlespace managements2 7 due to the focus on the will of the population coin operations are less about the application of physical force fires than the influence of perceptions and ultimately will and behaviour given this focus the influences of all activities be they first order or second order effects must be carefully considered every action even the most innocuous seeming will create effects that will influence someone all activities and operations must be considered for unintended effects and plans made to avoid undesired effects for example successful tactical engagement of the insurgents may cause such collateral damages that it ultimately undermines the support of the population and is further exploited by insurgent propaganda b the governments and campaigns overall informationinfluence plan will concentrate on the two broad aims of winning the populations support and confidence whilst simultaneously lowering the morale and effectiveness of the insurgents and their supporters some degree of success with the first aim may be prerequisite for progress with the second leadership at all command levels must be aware of the psychological implications of and the correlation between the political the military and the moral aspects of the campaign ln particular they should take care that action in one sphere despite promising quick return does not jeopardize the success of the other two spheres and so of the campaign as whole for example an opportunity to ambush particular insurgent leader may have serious negative repercussions if the attack includes unacceptable collateral damage or the removal of leader who may be persuaded to ultimately supporl the campaign 9 the primary influence activity capabilities are psyops presence posture and profile ppp pa cimic and deception all activities must be supporting of the overall objectives and some activities such as psyops and pa must maintain clear distinctions while maintaining close coordination 10 the integration of influence activities will be complex and must be viewed as continuous set of operations as such the operations staff jg3 and jgs is responsible for lnfo ops planning and coordination lnfluence activities lnfo ops are not considered separately from other activities specifically fires they are considered planned targeted and conducted together with fires as comprehensive operations thus in actual fact there is separate lnfo ops plan but simply single plan that balances fires and influence activities 11 moreover because all successful coin campaigns have possessed detailed thematic direction from the strategic and political levels influence activities must be integrated t for more detailed discussion on comprehensive operations see bgl300001fp00 1 land operations b2 bgl323004fp003lnformation operationslnfluence activities horizontally and vertically across and up and down the chain of command for example the destruction of an insurgent safe house and seizure of munitions cache may be combined with cimiccoordinated project that provides resources to nongovernmental organization ngo publicized by psyops in theatre and pa internationally protected by robust security element displaying strong deterrent posture to the enemy but friendly and helpful profile to the population and thus increase campaign and hn government legitimacy and establish safe environment for economic development obviously such series of operations requires substantial interagency cooperation in both planning and execution to be successful supporting host nation legitimacy and authority an important component of the coin campaign conducted by the regional assistance mission solomon lslands ramsiwas gun amnesty programme seeking to remove illegal firearms from the general public the lnteinational committee of the red lrorr which helped to facilitate part of the gun amnesty wanted to publicize their involvement by displaying their symbol on all signs related to the programme although an understandable request ramsi officials denied permission to display icrc symbols in direct relation to the amnesty programme not all agencies involved in coin campaign might realize the importance of reinforcing the perception of host government legitimacy ln this case it was felt necessary to create the impression that the amnesty program was solely government initiative the goal being to improve perceptions of government competence establishing and improving government legitimacy is central goal of all coin lnfo ops and even the most innocuous seeming actions should be judged against this maxim source russe genn counterinsurgency in test tube analyzing the success of the regional assistance mission solomon lslands ramsi santa monica ca rand2007 sectron 2 principles of application of influence activities 801 general 1 the principles that apply to lnfo ops influence activities must be carefully considered and used as guide to the conduct of influence activities within coin campaign the concept of affecting understanding perceptions and the will of the populace and key individuals must be well understood at all levels of command in order for the campaign to be successful 2 as with other activities influence activities must be directly linked to the operational objectives of the campaign plan they will likely appear on all lines of operation in the campaign plan to one degree or another 802 commanders direction and personal involvement 1 the commanders personal involvementdrives lnfo ops and he exercises controlover all lnfo ops activity within framework of timely decisionmaking and consultation up and down the chain of command and with other agencies as appropriate following mission analysis the commander formulates unifying theme articulated in his stated intent tacticallevel planning is based on that intent with its defined endstate and supporting effects and harmonizes lnfo ops activities with other activities without the guidance of the commanders unifying theme bgl323004fp003 83counterlnsurgency operations and intent the lnfo ops effort will lack focus and will not achieve the desired effects in harmony and simultaneity with other activities messages risk becoming confused and contradictory 2 the importance of lnfo ops must be understood and communicated by the commander to his subordinates placing faith in influence activities may seem counterintuitive to the commander however it is essential that this cognitive leap is made successful coin campaign has been conducted without sophisticated and integrated set of influence activities even though it may not have been described as such at the time moreover the commander must understand that influence activities may reside outside of some soldiers comfort zone the confidence to trust in and properly employ influence activities will only occur if the commander demonstrates his own faith in nonphysical activities furthermore commanders and staff must realize and accept that the measures of effectiveness moe of influence activities will require an extensive amount of time years in some cases because of this the commander will need to be intimately involved in planning and ensure that influence activities are given due focus and support 803 centralized planning and decentralized execution 1 the principles of centralized planning and decentralized execution apply to lnfo ops at all command levels however centralized execution may be required for certain types of targeted information activities when all involved force elements are required to adhere rigidly to plan or when strategic assets are used the approval level and process for psyops messages must be as low and streamlined as possible in order ensure messages are timely and relevant to the environment at hand 804 early involvement and timely preparation 1 planning for influence activities must start early because both planning and execution take time and results can be slow to develop hence commanders intent and direction must be viewed right from the start in relation to lnfo ops capabilities and be maintained throughout the planning process targeting staff and advisors such as psyops detachment commanders need to be fully involved in the planning process to integrate lnfo ops within the overall plan 2 conceptualizing and providing resources for influence activities is as complicated as the planning work required for physical activities coin experiences demonstrate that lnfo ops are far more effective when lnfo ops planners are amongst the first on the ground in theatre whenever the security environment allows key personnel involved in lnfo ops planning should be amongst the earliest elements deployed as this enables an early and accurate assessment of the general mood of the population this requirement should be reflected in logistics planning 805 close coordination and sequencing 1 the very nature of lnfo ops and the large diverse target set means that there needs to be very close integration vertically and horizontally within command and with other agencies to create complementary effects in support of common objectives the principle of close coordination and sequencing is arguably of greater import in coin campaign than in any other type of mission because there is an adversary whose sole purpose is the delegitimization of the host government and friendly forces contradictory messages or inaccurate information will undermine credibility and legitimacy and do great harm all lnfo ops activities must be coordinated deconflicted and synchronized horizontally and vertically across the chain of command and with other political and civil activities in order that one activity does not 84 bgl323004fp003i nformation operationslnfluence activities compromise negate or diminish the desired effect of another this is the responsibility of the commander assisted by targeting staff and subordinate commanders the smooth integration of influence and physical activities is critical to maintaining message and theme continuity across all government and cooperating agencies 806 timely counterinfo ops 1 even the most effective plan for influence operations will be frustrated in execution if deliberate actions are not taken to counter the lnfo ops actions of the adversary significant portion of the planning should be dedicated to the preparation for reaction to enemy lnfo ops there are numerous recent examples of militarily weaker opponent effectively conducting an lnfo ops programme that has influenced foreign and indigenous populations from kosovo in 1999 to hezbollah in the summer of 2006 to anticoalition elements in lraq and afghanistan today modern information technologies allow the targeting of domestic populations seeking to undermine the political will and popular support for the mission lt is for this reason that pa must be fully integrated into the operational and tactical plans failure to adequately counter the enemys story in timely and credible fashion can undermine not only publics morale but it can also bolster an enemys popularity and rally public opinion against the mission lnfo ops planning must dedicate resources to monitoring enemy lnfo ops and remain flexible enough to counter erroneous information disseminated by an adversary timeliness is paramount because the first story released is often the story that gets the greatest distribution and attention measures must be taken to counter the propaganda of adversaries and to reveal their falsehoods 2 number of factors serve to leave the initiative of lnfo ops in the hands of the insurgent first the insurgent will have moral or legal compunction to use only the truth in the conduct of influence activities second modern information technologies enable the rapid and broad dissemination of text audio video and photographic material this means that the news cycle is now much shorter than in previous eras and therefore reaction to enemy propaganda cannot wait even 24 hours third because the insurgent will be operating on home turf his sources of intelligence will be superb 3 the insurgents require only small amount of truth on which to base their propaganda events will be staged to incite an overreaction by the security forces or simply to produce images such as wounded and killed civilians that can be claimed to be result of security force actions all told friendly forces will be forced into defensive reactive stance compelled to monitor local and international media and other sources of information in order that false stories can be rapidly countered with accurate information this will likely be an unfamiliar stance for friendly forces accustomed and trained to seize the initiative in operations despite this offensive lnfo ops targeting the key lines of operations of the insurgent must take place simultaneous with defensive lnfo ops which seek to counter enemy propaganda only by careful identification and analysis of the enemys centres of gravity physical and moral and lines of operation can friendly forces conduct offensive lnfo ops lnsurgent propaganda will work hard to undermine public domestic and international support for the campaign this propaganda must be actively countered and ideally precluded before it even occurs truthful information provided to the public domain will aid in supporting campaign legitimacy and will serve to undermine and even dislocate the insurgent propaganda such information provided in timely proactive manner will be the most effective means of countering insurgent deceit and propaganda bgl323004fp003 85counterl nsurgency operations 807 accurate intelligence and information 1 like all coin activities accurate and timely intelligence is criticalto successfully planning lnfo ops this intelligence must include information about potential adversaries other approved lnfo ops targets and the operating environment ln particular intelligence will need to answer as many of the questions on cultural factors posed by commanders as possible the operations and plans staff focusing on influence capabilities should work closely with the intelligence staff to define requirements necessary to plan execute and assess the effectiveness of lnfo ops lntelligence preparation of the battlespace lpb should include analysis of human factors including culture religion languages etc information technology decisionmaking infrastructure and processes and network vulnerabilities this portion of ipb forms the basis of the lnfo ops contribution to the command estimate 2 the enemy will be operating on familiar ground and will be able to gather accurate intelligence with comparative ease as long as the population is not openly hostile to his activities lt will require significant amount of work for friendly forces to gain similar amount and quality of intelligence human intelligence humint is critical throughout the world wordofmouth and rumour is often accepted as credible and legitimate source of information rumours are spread between personal contacts not formal mediums the only way to determine what stories positive or negative are being spread by these means is to develop and maintain large and dependable humint network 808 gomprehensivetargeting 1 at the operational level targeting starts with detailed understanding of the operational environment its constituent systems and entities and the commanders objectives commanders and targeting staff identify lnfo ops effects required to achieve the desired objectives and range of activities that when integrated into the overall operation plan will achieve those effects lt is important to realize that any element of targeting activity may influence range of target audiences and create unintended effects the targeting staff therefore must analyze the impact of such activity and propose appropriate measures to avoid unintended effects lnfo ops targeting is not planned separately from the targeting of fires process but in conjunction with it so that created effects are complementary 2 lnfluence activities will comprise the bulk of coin campaign the use of fires will be severely circumscribed because of the possibility of unintended effects this is not to say that physical destruction will not play role in the campaign rather it is meant to reinforce the fact that the primary strategic centre of gravity for both the insurgents and friendly forces is the indigenous population thus the bulk of targeting in coin campaign will focus on the neutral and indifferent portions of the populace 3 although there are historic examples where the undermining of insurgent will has brought about the collapse of an insurgency the committed insurgent will be resistant to direct influence particularly in groups motivated by fundamentalist religious ideology the core members of an insurgent movement are likely highly motivated dedicated and unafraid of mortal consequences of their actions ln fact fundamentalist ideologues will likely view death as part of divinely mandated act that will please whatever deity they worship and therefore will be incredibly resistant to any lnfo ops message this does not mean that all insurgents are invulnerable to the effects of psyops in fact the ephemeral actors those not ideologically whalid phares the war of ldeas jihad against democracy new york palgrave macmillan 2007 pp 4344 b6 bgl323004fp003lnformation operationslnfluence activities committed to the insurgency may be decisively influenced by psyops and should be identified as primary target audience however in general the neutral or indifferent members of population that indirectly enable the survival movement and actions of an insurgency will always be an important target audience the result will be hostile operating environment for the insurgent second order effect of this may be the undermining of an insurgents will due to the inability to increase public support for the cause 809 establishing and maintaining credibility 1 ln orderfor lnfo opsto be successful in creating influencesin operating on the psychological planethe source of the lnfo ops must have significant credibility in the eyes of the target audience poor or nonexistent credibility has been identified as primary cause of failure of lnfo ops in past campaigns whether source is seeking to generate support from an indigenous population or convince enemy troops to surrender the lack of credibility will hinder success for example an indigenous population with strong religious and cultural bias against campaigning troops may distrust messages created and disseminated by western military force such as nato 2 credibility will take time to develop and is intimately tied to the actions of military force and the host government the ppp of force will have significant impact on credibility depending on the specific context force may need to show strength decisiveness friendliness or limited footprint or several of these at once the credibility of force may have to be established in planned incrementalfashion even when possessing credibility indigenous proxies such as social religious or political leaders who have credibility with target audiences and are sympathetic to the mission should be used to broadcast desired messages it must be remembered that all actions should reinforce the perception of host government legitimacy credibility and competence and the use of indigenous voices will further this goal every action of the soldier must be considered means of influence and should be judged for potential unintended effects the simple act of picking fruit from an orchard or vegetables from field by resting soldiers can alienate village dependent on that produce for winter survival without asking permission of the farmer and offering suitable compensation this seemingly harmless acf could be misconstrued and used by an adversary for propaganda purposes eg the wealthy western invaders care little for the average person and steal your food every action has effects and all soldiers must understand the repercussions of even seemingly benign acts 810 performance and effects monitoring and assessment 1 as with any military activity the results of information operations are assessed using measures of performance are things being done right and measures of effectiveness are the right things being done to create the desired effects are employed 2 measures of performance mop for info ops are relatively straightforward and similar to mop used for other activities mop refer to the mechanisms of planning and implementation they can be viewed in the same manner as the delivery of indirect fire reaction times quality of product correct target identification and assessment and suitability of engagement means to name few measures of effectiveness moe refer to the desired effects and whether or not the activities conducted created the effects bgl323004fp003 87counterlnsurgency operations 3 the successful prosecution of lnfo ops relies on continuous monitoring and assessment of the short and longterm effects of interrelated activities this is achieved by collection of all source intelligence and other feedback on the lnfo ops activities moe must be included in the lnfo ops planning from the outset and are integrated in the intelligence collection activities particular attention should be paid to changes in the adversarys or other audiences will and actions including such items as changes in the attitude of the civilian population political activity and expressions of unrest also changes in an adversarys capability such as reduced efficiency disorganization and slower reactions to events and specific actions in response to deception or destruction may be used as an moe 4 lnfluence activities may take significant amount of time to achieve recognizable effects ln some cases effects may not become apparent until well after an individual unit or commanders tour has ended shortterm suppor and friendliness that may be result of personal relationships with particular commander or unit should not be mistaken for confidence in the government although these relationships are critical winning over the trust of the target audience will take time and considerable effort and likely span several rotations furthermore deeds at the tactical level will have the greatest effects both positive and negative the positive effects are critical steppingstones to success while negative effects will carry far beyond the limited tactical context in which they originated negative effects will also be remembered longer and are easily exploited by insurgent propaganda 5 changes in behaviour may take place over lengthy period of time and be imperceptible for example the effects of radio broadcast campaign may take years to become apparent additionally it is very difficult to develop causal link between single lnfo ops action and target behaviour even when direct messages are used at the tactical level for example changes in driving behaviour around military convoys may be due to several concomitant factors psyops products previous use of warning shots or past incidents of civilian casualties when proximity to suicide bombing targeting coalition forces resulted in collateral damage despite these difficulties moe are criticalto gauging the usefulness of lnfo ops 6 with influence activities moe are applied to activities and changes on the cognitive plane given all of the individual and environmental variables in the human decisionmaking process developing moe for lnfo ops on the cognitive plane may be one of the most daunting intellectual tasks facing commander lnfluence activities seek to work through external and internal filters composed of the sociocultural political and economic factors in order to persuade or dissuade and thus affect behaviour and action hence the planning and conduct of these activities is an arf requiring the commanders subjective feel for their potential effect sophisticated comprehension of the cultural factors at play is necessary to first establish baseline measure at the beginning of mission and to detect changes in perceptions attitudes and behaviours throughout the campaign 7 moe will vary significantly between missions and even within missions commanders must clearly define the endstate and ideally any milestones on the path to that endstate using whatever means are most appropriate moe measure and indicate progress in the target audience towards that endstate moe must be tailored to the specifics of not only the overall change desired but to the environment that is the commanders battlespace and area of operations because of the intangible factors involved and the subjective nature of influencing will and perceptions the moe may very well be subjective moreover because affecting behaviour is the ultimate aim either by maintaining nonaction or causing the target audience to adopt particular course of action they require significant amount of time to determine effectiveness therefore they must be assessed as set routine to attempt to recognize changes trends and slight yet significant indicators the commander exercises judgement as 88 bgl323004fp003lnformation operationslnfluence activities to when an adjustment or change to an activity against target must be made in reaction to behavioural changes in the target audience b some fundamentals that can aid in the development of useful moe are causalityeo definitive cause and effect relationship must be established between the activity and the effect to be measured there has to be reasonable likelihood that the planned activity will create the desired effect as well commanders and lnfo ops staff must be able to assess any other extant factors that may be causing the effect other than their own activities likewise they must ascertain if the measured effect is merely coincidental b quantifiablees an moe that can be counted helps to remove some of the subjectivity that plagues moe on the psychological plane quantification allows accurate trend measurement for example during tour in lraq one formation monitored and counted local and international media coverage of events in their ao as an moe this allowed positive and negative trends to be identified which helped to discern the effectiveness of ongoing lnfo opse6 c observable and attributable this principle may seem obvious however when drafting moe consideration should be given to the possibility that all of the variables influencing an activity and change in behaviour cannot be observed the moe must be able to recognize trends or alterations in behaviour and confirm the relationship between the target audience behaviour and the lnfo ops activity for example if the presence or absence of negative graffiti is being used as an informal indicator of support for campaign and military force in an urban area observers will ideally be able to ascertain its timing that is when it was done its attribution to particular group political criminal military and their motive and whether it represents minority or majority viewpoint its attribution in terms of cause particularly if it appears as reaction to specific event or action and its location in relation to the cultural makeup of the environment d correlated to decisive points and objectives just as activities are planned to reach sequential decisive points along line of operation moe should be selected to correlate to the achievement of each decisive point and should be reflective of the level of employment although strategic lnfo ops require measures that occur throughout the length of campaign many moe at the operational and tactical levelwill measure the incremental progress through sequential decisive points flexibilty although moe should be drafted at the planning stage they should remain under regular review and commanders must be prepared to adjust them as required moe must reflect mutable conditions in an ao they must evolve as mission progresses particularly as decisive points are reached and to fo detailed discussion of causality see william s murray will to measure parameters vol 31 3 autumn 2001 pp 134147 e5 the quantifiable observable and timeliness

time will force reconsideration of moe previously employed f gollection the commander must possess the capabilities to collect the intelligence necessary to employ an moe and provide the direction and guidance to do so plans must be made to collect and assess moe through all units in the affected battlespace as well collection may be assisted by other agencies however absent formal command relationship this may have to be done informally notwithstanding this nonmilitary agencies may prove to be an effective gauge of progress through lnfo ops to this end attempts should be made to develop working relationships with agencies from all participating governments the hn and ngos active in the environment g relativity lmprovements sought in given environment must be relative to that environment lt is imperative that baseline measurement of the overall environment be established as early as practicable in the campaign planning absent comparative baseline it may be impossible to accurately determine the effectiveness of lnfo ops and ultimately campaign progress expectations for situational improvement must be reasonable given the starling state and the normal state of that particular environment this does not mean that moral relativity should be applied to excuse gross criminal behaviourtt some change in the environment may occur quickly for example an immediate drop in crime in particular neighbourhood may result from the presence of regular patrols however systemic and social improvements that will create an enduring improvement may require substantial amount of time and be measured in multiple years or even decades thus measuring an overall drop in gang and criminal activity throughout theatre must be measured in relation to the levels that existed under precrisis circumstances and could take years to achieve furthermore systemic change will be the result of numerous concomitant factors expectations for change and the related moe should be set as incremental milestones so that improvement can be measured and demonstrated as tangible progress over time 811 summary 1 developing appropriate moe to assess effects on the psychological plane is very difficult task willpower motivations perceptions and beliefs are intangible variables that defy simple measurement observing and measuring trends is one of the surest ways of gauging targets attitude will and behaviour change trends however require definable baseline and this will be complex but crucial initial task difficulties aside accurate moe can make the difference between meeting desired objectives or ending campaign in frustration tt gross criminal behaviour such as the abuse of basic human rights corruption ortheft from the public purse cannot be justified as simply being normal however all situations must be judged in context for example an under paid schoolteacher in struggling nation charging students to attend an ostensibly publicfunded school is different case to an armed policeman extorting funds at checkpoint particularly if this is the only means by which the teacher can survive careful judgement is necessary when establishing baseline of conditions in an ao 81 0 bgl323004fp003lnformation operationslnfluence activities sectron 3 characteristics of insurgent propagandage 812 generalcharacteristics 1 substantial proportion of coin influence activities will concentrate on refuting insurgent propaganda this may be seen as defensive influence activities thus it is useful to illustrate the major characteristics of insurgent propaganda to better understand how to construct themes and messages that will support friendly lnfo ops while undermining those of the enemy deconstructing the themes of enemy propaganda allows the commander and staff better understanding of the enemys lines of operation and what countermeasures will best undermine the enemy campaign the characteristics illustrated below are broadly applicable to all insurgencies 2 lnsurgencies are supported by closely coordinated and mutually supporting triad of political goals propaganda and military action like friendly lnfo ops propaganda can take severalforms and will be reinforced with action words will be supported by deeds and vice versa 3 the insurgent cause is advanced predominantly by discrediting the government and security forces reducing public morale both indigenous and that of coalition forces and vilifying progovernment media lnsurgents and their propaganda will exploit any government mistake especially incidents in which the police and military may be seen to have overreacted unlike the government the insurgents do not have to prove anything they simply have to make the government appear incompetent because of this fact the insurgents can use falsehoods and heavy manipulation of information to support their propaganda while legitimate government and campaign will be constrained by the imperative to use only truthful information while maintaining basic freedoms 4 consequence of all this is the necessity for campaign forces to disclose what may be considered bad news despite the best efforts errors will be made in coin campaigns including breaches of rules of engagement roe and inadvertent civilian casualties when these errors occur they must be quickly acknowledged and amends made to limit the potential propaganda value to the enemy modern technologies guarantee that bad news will eventually be disseminated therefore it is better to deal with the story and have some control over it than try to cover it up and have controlwhen it becomes widely known 5 propaganda must be effectively countered if coin campaign is to be successful like all lnfo ops counterpropaganda requires unified multiagency approach throughout the levels of command and must include political direction on approved themes and messages propaganda is effective and cannot be ignored lt is through propaganda that the adversary increases his popular support reinforces his narrative gains recruits and material resources and ultimately develops legitimacy and credibility e8 propaganda is defined by the oxford dictionary of english 2nd ed revised as mass noun meaning information by this definition friendly lnfo ops could be considered propaganda however the dictionary definition also states that propaganda is especially used to denote information of biased or misleading nature the term propaganda is used throughout this manual in this latter pejorative sense the vast majority of this section is adapted from brigadier maurice tugwells doctoral dissertation revolutionary propaganda and possible counter measures london kings college universityof london march 1979 see in particularchapters pp295335 brigadier retd tugwell graciously granted permission to reference his dissertation during telephone conversation with neil chuka dad4 contractor on 13 february 2007 bgl323004fp003 81 1counterlnsurgency operations 6 the goal of counterpropaganda is to refute insurgent propaganda and to present the truthful justification for the legitimacy and credibility of the host government effective counter propaganda is required to convince both domestic and international audiences that the campaign is legitimate public opinion must be considered throughout the campaign by all levels of command including the political element clearly pa will play leading role in communicating the truth to the international public the effort to counter enemy propaganda must explain government strategy and goals present facts and expose the fallacies of the enemy message and the illegitimacy of enemy motives 7 all propaganda contains some kernel of truth however miniscule which is distorted to play upon the preconceived notions attitudes and perceptions of the target audience as well as sociopolitical trends that have led to discontent adversary lnfo ops target the same segments of the indigenous population as friendly lnfo ops the neutral or wavering portions from which new supporters can be drawn b perhaps more importantly modern information technologies enable insurgents to target the domestic populations of those states contributing to coin campaign the internet in particular allows insurgent groups to immediately distribute propaganda internationally monitor the political climate and public opinion in campaigning nations and synchronize activities to maximize effects on the will of the allied domestic public this is critical factor because most contemporary insurgent groups will be politically savvy and understand that it is far easier to undermine the will of the public in democracy and thus the political support for campaign than it is to militarily defeat superior armed force ln fact there is much evidence suggesting that the survival and success of contemporary insurgent movement is dependent on the mastery of the use of modern information technologies and the manipulation of international public opinionee 813 themes of insurgent propaganda 1 there are number of overarching themes that characterise insurgent propaganda although some of these themes become more prevalent as an insurgency evolves the themes will likely be used simultaneously targeting different specific audiences tailored to suit the ebb and flow of the struggle righteousness the insurgent cause is right and just and supported by the divine this theme is founded in faith and ideas rather than fact b hatred the government or opposing international force is painted as heretical or morally and spiritually corrupt since the government opposes the righteousness of the insurgent cause and has sought to suppress the people it and its agents are deserving of hatred and death c lnevitable triumph because the struggle is portrayed as moral and righteous affair the insurgency can only end in triumph regardless of the time required to achieve victory this theme is highlighted in conflicts involving fundamentalist ideologies d allegiance you are with us or against us is given as stark choice although insurgencies only require the ambivalence of the population to exist and thrive propaganda will leave uncertainty about the ultimate requirement to support see for example clifford bob ihe marketing of rebettion lnsurgents media and tnternational activism new york cambridge university press 2005 812 bgl323004fp003lnformation operationslnfluence activities the cause this theme seeks to paint those opposing the insurgency as traitors cowards or unfaithful apostates moral certainty concept of moral certainty is used to bolster active supporters of an insurgency this theme seeks to implant the notion that the moral highground lies with the insurgent and that all acts committed by supporters are just both legally and spiritually terror although terrorism is tactic the theme of terror is used in insurgent propaganda to coerce assistance from the civilian population and to enforce discipline within an insurgency this theme must be supported by violent action which may be limited in scope but can cause terror out of all proportion to the act itself martyrdom also known as glorification of heroes this theme will highlight the actions of insurgents and glorify the fallen to bolster internal morale and impress the civilian population praise of violence violence is portrayed as righteous and spiritually cleansing justified reaction all actions are justified as necessary and just reaction to government suppression long war lnsurgencies do not succeed overnight and in order to sustain support it is necessary to reinforce the notion of inevitable triumph by communicating that the struggle will be long and difficult and may span several generations this is often portrayed in religious terms to exploit belief in the transcendental nature of the divine and the afterlife to give strength to religiously motivated insurgents guilt this theme is directed at the enemy government and supporters lt will play upon the sensitivities of the populations of liberal democracies this theme is heavily exploited using modern communications technologies to publicize real and contrived incidents bad faith this theme seeks to undermine attempts by the government to reach out to insurgent supporters and to portray government efforts to improve the lot of the people as fagade meant to dupe the people security force lncompetence this theme will try to demonstrate an inability of the government to provide safe and secure environment as well as an impotence to stop the insurgency this theme will be supported with violent actions targeting security forces themselves as well as segments of the population legitimacy lnsurgencies will ultimately attempt to develop legitimacy through both deeds and words advance insurgent elements will use international propaganda to paint themselves as popular representative of populations and will use reconstruction aid to create this sense of legitimacyl00 oo an emple of this is hezbollahs international propaganda campaign in the summer of 2006 and infusion of reconstruction aid in wardevastated neighbourhoods in lebanon immediately after the cessation of hostilities with lsrael the goal was to demonstrate both the illegitimacy of the enemy lsrael and the powerlessness of the secular government to provide for the needs of the peoplee g h k m bgl323004fp003 81 3counterlnsurgency operations gredibility the ultimate purpose of propaganda is to establish credibility in the eyes of the civilian population developing credibility is an important step to gaining the outright support of the civilian population 814 summary 1 commanders and planning staff must understand the aims of insurgent propaganda and seek to counter these themes and the objectives that they support they cannot wait for the propaganda to appear and then attempt to counter it they must anticipate the messages and aims of the insurgent propaganda and actively preempt them this will be preemption on the psychological plane section 4 information operations activities in counterinsurgency 815 general 1 the primary influence activities grouped under the lnfo ops title are psyops pa clmlc ppp and deception all may be applied in an offensive or defensive sense all save for ppp are discussed in detail in their respective manuals which should be read in conjunction with this chapter the specific uses of each activity in coin campaign are discussed in this section 816 psychologicaloperations 1 the primary purpose of psyops is to influence the understanding perceptions attitudes will and ultimately behaviour of selected individuals or groups in accordance with mission or campaign objectives psyops has first order effects on the psychological plane 2 unlike pa which simply provides truthful information for dissemination by others psyops retains direct control over content and dissemination of message and focuses on specific target audience psyops is not propaganda in the pejorative sense cf psyops only disseminates truthful messages the use of falsehoods or misleading information only undermines legitimacy over the longterm and is therefore not practised 3 effective psyops requires timely provision of resources such as linguistic support graphics and print capability and various electronic broadcasting means mediums for the broadcast of messages include facetoface contact print radio television loudspeakers the lnternet faxes pagers and mobile phones 4 psyops is one of the most costeffective components of coin campaign coordinated with other influence activities and fires and properly applied psyops can ensure that the indigenous population receives and comprehends the activities and objectives of the campaign strategiclevel direction and close coordination between all command levels are required to seamlessly integrate themes messages and actions all messages must be reinforced with action because deeds and words must not be contradictory close coordination does not indicate requirement for rigid control the need for consistency in theme and message is essential but it must not be regarded as requirement for restrictive control of subordinates 5 although the distributive means may be similar the purposes of operational and tacticallevel psyops differ operationalthemes will address longterm objectives tactical psyops should support and reinforce operational themes but may also have very limited 814 bgl323004fp003lnformation operationslnfluence activities tactical aims such as the surrender of insurgents in specific area lt is only through seamless integration and coordination of psyops into the overall campaign plan that conflicting messages can be avoided 6 pa is used at the strategic level to communicate information modern information technologies make it impossible to limit the target audience for strategiclevel products and thus preclude the use of psyops at this level at the operational level psyops are typically directed at modifying general attitude sets to alter longterm behaviour typically this will involve some form of rational argument that may be forcefully or subtly presented an example of forceful message would be continued publicizing of public infrastructure projects in province an example of subtle message would be the broadcast of popular music targeting 1525 year olds to emphasize that religious ideals and liberal societies are not incompatible ln many ways operationallevel psyops can be viewed in marketing terms as building brand recognition ln essence the messages and themes are trying to build relationship between the target audience and the campaign that is the brand101 lmmediately prior to the launch of operation enduring freedom leaflet campaign was planned to communicate the purpose of the mission to the afghan people the first leaflet that was to be used pictured b52s bombing green valley ihe leaflet almost identical to one used in the 1991 gulf war against lraq was deleted from the campaign at the last minute out of concem that the pamphlet would create the perception that ihe afghan people were being targeted for retribution for 91 1 further confusion over the proper uie of both the dissemination method leaflet bomblets and the target audience psyops planners designed the leaflet for tactical not strategic application highlights the requirement for coordination and the need to tailor psyops products to specific audiences source christopher lamb review of psychological operations lessons learned from recent operational experience washington dc national defense university press sepfem ber 2005 p 71 7 at the tactical level psyops will present concise message geared towards modifying specific behaviours the target audience will be more specific than at the operational level and emotive and rational arguments may be used in the message the goal is to cause target audience to act rather than to think about and rationalize message examples of tacticallevel psyops are leaflets informing village of an impending operation or posters hung along popular thoroughfares demonstrating safe driving behaviour around military convoy l nuanced understanding of the sociocultural environment in which psyops are conducted is essential to success mere awareness of the sociocultural milieu is insufficient for those involved in the conception design and approval of psyops products tribal or clan relations are also necessary consideration urban operations hold the potential for vastly different sociocultural constructs in different neighbourhoods psyops products must be specifically tailored to the target audience the potentialfor unintended effects is great if an error in target audience analysis is made to tim calkins the challenge of branding in alice tybout and tim calkins eds kettogg on branding hoboken nj wiley 2005 pp 14 as quoted

including the security situation some products may be unsuitable for example leaflets may endanger anyone possessing leaflet in locale where insurgents are highly active and coalition presence is sporadic ln such situation another medium such as television radio or text messaging may be more appropriate poor product is worse than product at all 10 time is an uncedain ally on the one hand psyops themes and messages need to be lasting and continuous to make an impression on the other hand overprolonged exposure to single message may result in boredom and irritation fine judgement is needed to draw the line between the advantages to be gained from the consistent exploitation of fact or theme and the dangers of saturation the audience is not stupid 11 political and military oversight must ensure that psyops and supporting activities are consistent with the hn and national policies and conform to any specific political guidance the psychological dimension of counterinsurgency is so important that psyops staff officer should be nominated in all formation headquarters and indeed at the battlegroup level if deemed appropriate staff officer specializing in psyops may work under the g3 g5 for plans and will be in addition to any psyops detachment or platoon commander supporting the formation at lower levels the psyops detachment commander will have the combined role of commanding his capability advising the commander and assisting in planning 817 public affairs 1 the aim of pa is to protect the credibility and legitimacy of operations and promote widespread understanding thereby gaining support for military operations while not compromising essential elements of friendly information eefi pa accomplishes this task by communicating information to audiences through the medium of local national and international news media and other means unlike psyops pa has control over the production or dissemination of the information it presents lts task is simply to provide information for others to analyze 2 an important facet of any military operation is to communicate the principal themes and messages while providing clear and complete understanding of the operation but all the while maintaining operations security opsec although pa is primarily focused on informing and educating audiences its impact is much wider lt is therefore essential that pa staff and those of other lnfo ops capabilities work together closely to ensure that coordinated message is delivered to the intended audiences and that all of them are coordinated with fires particular attention must be paid to local and regional media and to other media sources that are influential with indigenous populations to avoid giving the false impression that the media are being manipulated in any way clear distinction must be maintained between psyops and pa however this does not obviate the requirement of pa to be fully integrated into the overall plan and to understand the desired effects of influence activities 3 ln coin operations it is essentialto conduct media relations in positive manner such relations must project an accurate and balanced picture of the aims of the campaign in general and of the role of security forces in particular they must demonstrate the practical contribution soldiers are making to the solution of difficult and frequently

information service the news media office must receive prompt and accurate information from subordinate headquarters and units lt must also receive early warning of planned operations together with clear instructions on how to deal with news media enquiries preferably in the form of media response lines or questions and answers 6 ln many aspects dealing with the news media is different in coin campaign than in any other operation when speaking to the news media and in accordance with security regulations individuals must talk in their official capacity only about their own job their own expertise and responsibility statements are to be made concerning government policies political decisions or topics likely to be politically sensitive nor are they to speculate large numberof journalists representing the print radio and television can be expected to reporton coin operations to facilitate an effective twoway passage of information and to better manage and reduce news media queries standing orders should give guidance on the limits of information that can be disclosed before any information is passed to the news media it must be cleared for release by the appropriate military agency e9 g2 g3 and the appropriate hn or police authorities and where applicable approved by the commander through the pao 7 unnecessary hindrance is to be offered to journalists freedom to do hisher job lt is in the interests of law and orderthat the news media should have facilities to expose terrorism acts of violence and the intimidation of civilians members of the news media have the same rights liberties and obligations under the law as any other citizen furthermore enabling free press presents positive example to be emulated by hn government agencies and the populace in

their ability to inform demonstrate persuade influence and even coopt cimlcrelated activities are influence activities that affect understanding perceptions will and behaviour of the target audience for example the building of essential services and the development of governance institutions will build campaign legitimacy and influence individuals and groups to create enduring solutions to the

cimic is centralto any coin campaign because the perception of host government competence and campaign legitimacy must be reinforced lt is often key capability in addressing the root grievances of an insurgency the perception of competence and legitimacy is tied to security and the ability to provide for the dayoday needs of the populace lmproving the social physical and economic wellbeing of the populace is central goal of any coin mission thus cimic actions aimed at infrastructure development reconstruction and assistance to governance are crucialto achieving success 4 cimic provides information in the form of physical evidence of the legitimacy credibility and competence of the host government cimic will comprise significant proportion of the deeds that must support the words of campaign failure to follow through on promises made will alienate the population and damage credibility and legitimacy care must be taken that expectations are not created in the population that cannot be met cimcrelated activities therefore need to be coordinated within the overall plan in terms of impacts upon civil audiences and their leaders in order to ensure that activities work to support overall objectives 5 cimic facilitates cooperation between military forces and the civilian environment by considering and assessing social political cultural religious economic

have significant impact on perceptions and attitudes particularly on neutral or potentially adversarial audiences deploying even limited capability to the right place at the right time can add substantial credibility to messages being delivered through other channels and provide major contribution to the deterrence of threat similarly too heavy presence with one dimensional menacing profile may cause misperceptions and mistrust as to the purpose of mission the posture of troops on the ground can demonstrate both commitment and intent and must be considered and balanced with the requirements of force protection the decision to wear berets instead of helmets can make considerable difference to the perceptions of both the adversary and local people the public profile of commanders at all levels will impact on perceptions and therefore the public role of the commander must be carefully analyzed and opportunities used to transmit key messages commanders must understand and assess the attendant risk that accompanies any decision regarding posture and profile against the need to send particular message 2 the profile and posture of troops will have to be considered carefully in relation to the local culture serious robust image will help dissuade potential attackers however it may be needed to impress even local potentially friendly populations who are attracted to symbols of strength this profile however cannot be the only image presented to the populace lt must be carefully blended with an approachable cooperative and protective aspect when dealing with the

political military and law enforcement elements were together at the start tne posiure of the soldiers and the presence of the manoora and other patrolling navalvessels demonstrated readiness and decisive military superiority the police and civilian political elements successfully created competent nonthreatening reassuring and committed perception with the populace moreover throughout the

counterinsurgency coin campaign and are just as applicable in that context as in any other campaign however the characteristics of coin campaign will cause some to be emphasized more than others in their application these principles are foresight b economy c flexibility d simplicity cooperation f selfsufficiency g visibility h responsiveness and i survivability 2 given the characteristics of coin campaigns with their dispersed nature their need of comprehensive approach and the pervasive threat the principles that will be emphasized the most in coin campaigns will likely be flexibility cooperation responsiveness and survivability 3 regardless of the nature of coin and indeed partly because of it the echelon system of integral subunit unit and formation echelons remains valuable asset that must be maintained and used failure to use such system contravenes the principles of sustainment 902 factorsaffectingsustainment 1 some modifications to normal combat service support css practice and procedures are necessary to allow for the circumstances under which coin operations take place dispersion noncontiguous deployment of the security forces in small detachments over wide area increases difficulty in the provision of support there may be tendency to fragment and disperse css units to support widely deployed security force elements however the support of isolated subunits and platoons may be problem better solved by increasing the level of self sufficiency through robust echelons nevertheless some dispersion of css units may be inevitable security there will be host of security threats 1 surfacetoair missile and small arms threat may complicate the provision of replenishment by aira b bgl323004fp003 91counterl nsurgency operations c d2 dependence on local resourceslabour for endeavours such as construction purchase storage and perhaps distribution adds to the overall security problem 3 static installations should be sited in an area secured and protected commensurate with operational and geographical factors lf the scale and intensity of the operation warrant the establishment of forward support groups fsgs their elements are likely to be more at risk requiring greater security force effort to defend them 4 the greater the amount of air and helicopter lift that is available the more it will be possible to cut out intermediate bases with the advantage of economies in ground resources convoys guards and theatre transport the use of aviation support will allow rapid resupply of forward echelons where possible the use of seabased echelon would ease some of the physical security and protection demands 5 with respect to operational security opsec care must be taken that css preparations do not prejudice the security of information and plans sudden increases in stock levels exceptional amounts of road rail and air movement the arrival of new css units in certain areas and the local purchase of unusual items are just some examples of changes in normal pattern of replenishment which might betray future operation combination of secrecy insofar as it is possible to hide css preparations and convincing deception plans help to preserve security discretion in dealing with contractors and taking care not to discuss operational matters especially future plans within hearing of local labour are essential if elementary precautions are to keep our intentions secret manpower because coin operations are manpower intensive there will be pressure for economy in css manpower while on the one hand low rates of expenditure of combat supplies reduce the css burden the dispersed deployment of units in coin campaign increases it manpower limitations may increase dependence on local labour multinational forces canada will most likely deploy as part of multinational coalition security force this could lead to potential coordination and standardization problems 92 bgl323004fp003903 combat service support reconnaissance plan 1 given the nature of coin it is unlikely that campaigning forces will have to make forced entry into the theatre of operations thus the deployment of troops and supporting reconnaissance parties will have the consent of the standing government where central authority exists and deployment is supported by an international or perceived mandate an entry bgl323004fp003 93counterlnsurgency operations may be forced or at least must expect little indigenous support until some sort of permanent presence and representation have been established 2 the reconnaissance plan may have to be adjusted given the situation lt may have to be conducted from third nation from which forces may be staged or it may be the responsibility of the advance party regardless of the situation the need for some form of reconnaissance and confirmation of planning details needs to occur prior to the deployment of the main body 904 reconnaissanceparty 1 prior to initial deployment to the campaign or in support of relief in place css reconnaissance party will be deployed lt may return prior to deployment of the main body or remain in theatre to link up with the advance party and main body upon their arrival lnformation would thus be passed back by electronic means points to note in the mounting and conduct of the reconnaissance party are the reconnaissance party sent to new theatre will be organized on joint service basis the party will aim to make early contact with the host nation hn government through the local diplomatic representative ln doing so an assessment of the resources available in the theatre must be undertaken to provide an estimate of the requirements which must be sent out from canada b ldeally the reconnaissance party will represent the campaigns comprehensive approach in that the support elements of other government departments also deploy in support of their planning lf this is not the case but the campaign is to include known agencies other than the military then css planners may have to consider the sustainment of these other agencies ldeally responsibilities between agencies for sustainment will be cleady delineated prior to the departure of reconnaissance parties c the joint reconnaissance party must include strong css element headed by sufficiently senior officer who is fully aware of the envisaged operation and of the css requirements to support it he should have the executive authority to arrange liaison with the hn and allies to make decisions and to make recommendations to the task force commander and through the diplomatic staff to the appropriate hn ministry d the earlier the reconnaissance party is sent out and the sooner css preparations for the arrival of forces are made the better 905 strategic reconnaissance 1 j4

facilities and storage accommodation at and near the main port of entry unloading and lighterage facilities at small ports inland water transport and road and rail exits liaison with the harbour authorities should occur if possible 2 airports agreement should be sought on the main entry airfield and availability of fonryard airfields or airstrips in conjunction with the air force component of the reconnaissance party agreement should be reached on aircraft schedules leading to planned flow of troops reinforcements and supplies 3 railroads rail transport within the nation must be assessed along with access from third nations 4 road system and network roadways need be assessed along with the measurements and classifications of bridges and tunnels on main supply routes and theatre entry

might include assistance to other agencies e9 delivery of humanitarian aid the mentoring or training of indigenous security forces especially staff and planners and the provision of medical services

take into account his expectations and envisioned scheme of manoeuvre national authority is required to undertake activities and tasks such as the provision of national medical supplies to the indigenous population 3 lack of host nation support lt must be remembered that situation may exist in which the hn government lacks real control over ports of entry into the nation or in which forced

2 sa also demands that uptodate and accurate figures be known for sustainment requirements of the lower echelons robust communications on dedicated administrative nets from unit level upwards will

recovery evacuation and sustainment needs 908 replenishment through air aviation and sea basing 1 ln certain situationsbe they influenced by terrain threat or combination of other elementsfixed or rotary wing aircraft may become the method of choice for replenishment for the following reasons forces can be supplied in inaccessible areas thus avoiding the necessity for vulnerable surface supply route b troops are better able to move with light scales of equipment unencumbered with echelon transport thus exploiting the principle of flexibility to give them good level of tactical mobility c subject to the capacity of the airlift resources weather and terrain air replenishment is quicker than overland resupply d reserve stocks can be reduced and held centrally allowing the establishment of fewer but larger bases situated in more secure areas reducing the dependency on surface routes lessens the risk of ambush and cuts the convoy protection commitment aviation replenishment may become the preferred method in situations of high threat f rapid casualty evacuation improves wounded soldiers chances of survival thus improving morale g the urgent needs of the civilian population in isolated areas can be met quickly 2 aerial delivery parachute or unmanned aerial vehicle iuavi means of replenishment is less economic than air or aviation landed resupply but is often necessary in very broken country where there are landing zones even for helicopters and for covert special forces the penalties for air dropping are that the recovery of parachute equipment may be difficult or impossible and there may be risk that the supplies fall into insurgent hands 3 landing strips and helicopter landing zones lzs should be constructed whenever possible and as soon as possible to economize in airlift lt should be standard operating procedures sop that whenever forces stops or plans deliberate activity such as cordon and search helicopter lzs are designated initially from the

market and consequent price rises although this must be balanced against the advantages to be gained by boosting the local economy lf the civil population suffers from increased shortages and inflation the campaign will loose legitimacy and the insurgents will be handed ready grievance to exploit through propaganda 910 security 1 insurgent lnfiltration of labour lt must be assumed that hostile intelligence agents will infiltrate local labour at the very least their supporters will exist amongst ready labour pools lt will be difficult for incoming units and security sections to distinguish between loyal and disloyal elements to reduce the potential threat to base installations ports airpofts roads and railways reliance must be placed on good unit and installation security and an efficient local vetting system the method of vetting must be agreed with the host government whose police and security units may be largely responsible for its implementation the system may never be foolproof and measures must be taken to guard vulnerable installations from attack and to prevent the leakage of plans and intentions all soldiers especially css troops employing civilians must be carefully briefed on security matters 2 protection of labour labour must be protected from insurgent attack and intimidation lf the hn cannot provide suitable protection additional forces may have to be deployed in an escort and protection role rules of engagement must clearly reflect the moral obligation to protect civilian labour in the employment of campaigning forces this is especially

discouraging situation with propaganda means with or without hostile propaganda rumours spread and may be difficult to bgl323004fp003 99counterl nsurgency operations dispel or refute when troops are

good morale morale is key element to the moral component of forces fighting powerou while motivating soldiers by pointing out good and sound reasons for the conduct of the campaign itself and the need for continued patient commitment is the duty of the commander and function of leadership at all levels certain other measures can be taken to help maintain morale they include reliable information

conventional campaigns provides sound basis for the conduct of counter insurgency coin operations in terms of tactics techniques and procedures ttpfor offensive and defensive activities however in preparation for coin there is requirement for additional training that is campaign and mission specific this training and preparation across all ranks is as much intellectual as it is physical not only do units and subunits have to undertake skill training in preparation for the likely tactical tasks stability activities such as urban presence patrolling cordon and searches and vehicle checkpoints but they have to be trained in the principles unique to coin the importance of the support of the civilian populace and the importance of local cultural and social dynamics 2 lt must be remembered that doctrine for coin operations will provide guiding principles and methods for the conduct the most successful armies in coin operations have not treated doctrine as dogma but have afforded commanders trust and confidence and freedom of action within the allocated mission sound ttp can be identified and practised prior to any deployment but ttp will change rapidly in theatre of operations as the insurgents come to learn the ttp used by security forces and vice versa commanders at all levels must be flexible and dynamic and lessons learned at the lowest levels must be passed quickly for wider implementation sectton 2 operationallevel joint and combined training and preparations 1 the military is only one of many agencies that will be used in the conduct of coin lt is vital that the agencies involved in comprehensive approach plan train and prepare to the greatest extent possible in order that responsibilities and requirements can be identified and addressed prior to deployment 2 at the earliest opportunity all agencies and civilian and security forces should come together to conduct joint training ln some cases the military may have to take the lead in the education of agencies less knowledgeable in the conduct of coin this training can begin with seminars and conferences before developing to actualfield exercises standing points of contact and positions for liaison teams can be identified in much of this training 3 all security force elements designated for coin operations should come together at the earliest opportunity training should begin with seminars and war games for leaders and progress to tactical field exercises for all levels lncorporating other coin partners may be useful during such seminars and war games so as to provide the most accurate scenario possible and to become familiar with expectations 4 such early collaboration across agencies will help unity of purpose become unity of effort 5 training in simulated environments and in the field should encompass fullspectrum operations hence field training exercises ftxs should whenever suitable ensure that scenarios reflect the continuum of operations and the required changes to force structures tactics and intellectual challenges for example scenario may begin with entry into major combat campaign and then progress to an insurgency situation that will require greater balance between offensive defensive and stability operations this will force commanders and bgl323004fp003 1 01counterlnsurgency operations soldiers at all levels to adjust their plans orders ttp and mindsets in order to reflect the changing scenario 6 training with coalition partners will readily identify differences in approaches and methods in coin campaign and will identify potentialfor liaison positions particularly in the early stages of campaign this will also offer the opportunity to circumvent some of the coord ination and standard ization problems routi nely encou ntered 1001 lessons identified during campaigns 1 lt is vitalthat as actual campaigns progress lessons identified are captured assessed by doctrine staffs schools and training systems and then implemented pervasively this will require formal and informal reporting methods the submission of detailed afteraction reports their widest dissemination and staff visits to operational theatres formal links between lessonslearned staffs doctrine writers training authorities and trainers need to be established and exploited 2 commanders in the field must be forthright in lessons learned and honest and candid in the acknowledgement of errors so that others may learn missions may be better accomplished and unnecessary loss of life avoided sectton 3 train in g prior to dertaking cou nterinsu rgen cy operations 1 training plans in preparation for coin operation should consider inclusion of the following training in ttp for coin operations with great emphasis on the subunit level probably in noncontiguous battlespace there must be an emphasis on junior leader training computer based training in simulated environments offers very little benefit for section and platoon commanders their skills will only be truly developed when leading their subordinates through physical and intellectual challenges ranging quickly across the fullspectrum of operations b lnstruction in the root causes grievances and conditions that led to the insurgency and reasons for the motivations of the noncommitted populace the need to gain the support of the population must be placed foremost in the mind of the soldiers and their commanders and they must come to understand that all their actions will be seen to either build or undermine campaign legitimacy and public support c lnstruction

operation at the same time however commanders must ensure that all ranks particularly those in daily contact with the populace understand the pervasive threat posed by insurgents and the vital impodance of gaining and holding the support of the local populace sectton 4 in theatre training 1 when deployed on operations training must continue and commanders must ensure that they allocate appropriate time resources and supervision to it commanders should ensure that regular refresher training of ttp roes and equipment is conducted in theatre throughout the mission ln addition commanders and staff should consider the following reconnaissance and advance parties must quickly assess the operational and tactical situation and identify any aspects in training that troops may have not yet covered or that require greater emphasis lf these training requirements cannot be met prior to deployment then they must seek training venues for the units to use following their arrival but prior to operational commitment temporary battle schools may be established by the in theatre force to provide training to troops on new enemy ttp or equipment which was not available for predeployment training staff planners must balance the training need with the need to at leastg h k t m n bgl323004fp003 1 03counterlnsurgency operations begin to undertake tactical operations in support of the besieged authority and coalition commander commanders may precede their main bodies and be attached to units already committed to operations the lessons they learn can then be used to hone final training or guide in theatre training commanders need not return home but may marryup with their troops once they deploy physicalfitness training should continue in theatre to any extent possible physicalfitness will save lives troops should be given regular situation updates in terms of the overall mission and campaign progress and their contribution to it they should be briefed on what measures are proving successful and they should be given feedback as to the usefulness of the intelligence that their patrols are providing this will keep the troops motivated and focused on the success of the mission 2 units engaged in coin campaigns should undergo continuous training at all levels to ensure that basic individual and collective skills are maintained to high standard particular attention should be paid to the maintenance of individual skills during periods of little activityb c d 104 bgl323004fp003suggest readings suggested readings in counterinsurgency as well as
