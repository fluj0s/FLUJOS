6109c06 shspec50 subjective reality an auditor who believes there are engrams who has an intellectual understanding of the time track who has the idea that there are such things as masses and who is aware of pcs having been out of present time but himself has slightest idea of ever being in another time stream than now that auditor is dangerous auditor because he is escaping from then now is only an escape from then by definition this auditor will allow pcs to escape from then this is directly opposed to clearing which is showing someone he doesnt have to escape from then because he can confront then and when he confronts then he is longer stuck in then he must see that he can survive in spite of his demons that they were the shadows of life not its substance if you are showing him how to escape from life youre teaching him to be worse off an auditor who is letting the pc escape from the bank will make mistakes in auditing this is the most fruitful source of mistakes the pc feeling confidence arc breaking etc the pc knows down deep that its wrong not to confront the bank so he objects because he vaguely knows hes not getting auditing understanding is built on observation and familiarity person who has had experience of reactive mind trying to get someone to handle reactive mind makes dogs breakfast out of it you hear at times that scientologist is harder to audit than rawmeat pc there are several reasons for this he knows how it ought to go he is accustomed to handling an auditing session so as pc he is more accustomed to handling the session than an inexperienced pc would be he audits faster but he also arc breaks more he is more critical as pc because he cannot permit himself to duplicate bad session all his training tells him not to duplicate bad sessions so his havingness of the session vanishes when he recognizes it to be different from what he conceives it should be the amount of arc break here is not case indicator nothing shows up faster in an auditor than unfamiliarity with the bank and if the scientologist who is familiar with the bank is being audited by someone who isnt youll never get session theres outr so you get arc breaks one way to audit out bad session is what about the session the auditor etc would you be willing to be not be willing to be it is this unwillingness to be that makes it impossible for the session to occur if an auditor who is familiar with the bank flubs hell know what occurred so he can repair it and the arc break doesnt last long an auditor who has familiarity with the bank will put the pcs attention on the flub wont find what the pc is looking at on the backtrack so in trying to handle what he thinks wrongly is important he will pile up more noauditing thus creating more arc breaks he thinks the pc is just sitting in chair in pt nastily having an arc break you can make lots of flubs if you have an understanding of the pcs reality because you can fix them but person with subjective reality on the track wont realize that the pc isnt in pt and will drag him up to pt collapsing the track in pt and disorienting him disorientation is for one thing source of dreams and delusions the thetan in the skull cant find out where he is when the body is asleep so he puts up some false knowingnesses of where he is making dream or nightmare thats all dream is when you disorient thetan you have given him the only real shock he can get you have chosen him out for your randomity and told him to get lost and get confused in auditing you are in direct communication with the thetan he has problems most of which are disorientation problems he is down the track trying to find out where he has been if you spring surprise on him his first reaction is not to know where he is his next action is delusory knowingness he will tell you he doesnt know something like what you are doing he actually means that he doesnt know where he is he will put up delusory arguments to account for the shift the real reason for it is the auditors lack of reality on the pcs bank the pc is putting up delusory knowingness when he criticizes your auditing he is trying to find his unknown but of course he is in the unknown of thinkingness because he is confused enough not to be able to confront the unknownness of whereness unknownness of where requires more of the pc than the unknownness of idea because solids take more confront than ideas if you dont put him where he is in hurry he will keep adding delusion and significances in an effort to orient himself all the auditor has to do to shut it off is to find out where the pc has been and where he is but the auditor would have to have reality on the isness of the bank to know that thats the obvious thing to do dont pull the pcs attention to the arc break it just disorients him more and arc breaks him more if you have trouble with nightmares figure out how the nightmare located you and figure out where you are locate yourself or run locational if you give the wrong command let the pc answer it then ask him the right command dont yank the pc up to pt to give an auditor reality on the bank you could run what unknown would you escape from attack use any verb form that gives reach and withdraw as valence process you could run think of an unknown who would escape from it attack it or think of being what unknown would he escape from attack when you find person who has somatics and has reality on the bank he is of course not in pt he has escaped by total withdrawal from some ancient environment this process gets them to do what they are doing escape from and attack what they are in which is the unconfrontable past environment you could use another process who would escape from attack things you can run who would you be willing to be rather not be the reason why beingness is functional is that part of valence package is track so every now and then someone runs on track thats not his own he sees himself always from the outside and gets thin impressions of himself he has the bank of each person into whose valence hes gone this is disorienting it gives him an unreality of location valence has bank skills disabilities etc the person entered it on the basis of being unable to control the valence or terminal so of course he cant have or control any of the mechanisms of the valence so you cannot move that bank he hasnt enough ownership of it to run engrams etc there was point where the pc got the valence thats the only point where the valence will break by auditing beings not ideas or pictures youll get the valences blowing off routine three is very effective but shortcut would be any beingness process eg think of being this will give his his own track back sometimes youll have pcs with tremendous numbers of pictures they dimly recognize as not theirs the pictures are not familiar they are thin this gives an unreality on past lives when thats the quality of the pictures off the track of course in his past life he was another beingness people who have had valence trouble go out of valence easily so they have lots of wrong pictures so you take an incident of vast confusion and motion one is not willing to tolerate because it occurs with target that isnt appropriate to the motion and it causes disorientation as you protest valence could occur in that way ordinarily one who was there would pick up the valence of someone else so that all subsequent track is seen from the wrong point of view and it all stems from total disorientation an auditor who has too much valence trouble has great reality on somebody elses bank because his bank isnt really his its very thin set of pictures run him back and youll hit some tremendous explosion when twenty spaceships collided thats the type of incident which makes valence transfer not some mind incident an auditor who has reality on past lives hasnt collided with his bank very hard its not reprehensible its just symptom of valence and bank trouble so the guy doesnt get his own pictures and has conception of being stuck in pictures hell worry about his auditing flubs and why he cant quite handle his pcs hell worry about his ability to audit hes trying to orient himself with datum the datum hes looking for is this as long as he has low subjective reality of bank when pc gets into one his reality is not instantaneous so he will do little fumble or comm lag which causes an arc break because the pc loses confidence in the auditors ability to run the session its not that the person was trying to do something bad to the pc or that he didnt know scientology its just that his mechanisms of handling life have been escape from self into others and not getting in contact with the horrors of thenness the difficulties you encounter all come under the heading of auditor comm lag an auditors fumble is the unreality he has on what the pc is doing or going through you dont have time to remember the datum you have to know it and act instantaneously the only thing that teaches this is experiencing fumbling is not overcomable with rules and texts drill might help but it probably wouldnt because of outreality the only real cure is to audit the person enough to give him the reality however an auditor doesnt have to be cleared to learn to audit it would be nice but its not absolutely necessary the escape mechanism where person never tours the track surrenders fairly easily to auditing because it is based on another idea than that which degrades or aberrates thetan escape is simply method of handling bank not method of getting aberrated case deteriorates when the individual longer has confidence in himself as himself and thus adopts another packaged beingness to handle the situation then this beingness turns out not to be solution so he gets another etc etc and your backtrack of clearing could not be followed by the idea of escape because thats much too simple statement of the situation person can find himself inadequate in numerous ways besides the fact that they are trying to escape also there are situations when escape is wise but deterioration of confidence in ones own ability to handle life leads one to believe he must have another beingness in order to handle things for him now he starts living life on an irresponsibility eventually his adoption of new identities goes into the lifedeath cycle which is not at all usual in the life of thetans life invalidating the body and the valences gets down to the idea that the best thing to do is to chuck the mockup that just makes failure person ages to the degree that he feels invalidated the age of man in any lifetime is directly proportional to the accumulation of unknowns which of course is invalidation children probably grow up fast because they are moving through so much unknownness they have hope and confidence because they are growing up this hope is not necessarily justified person with valence trouble is especially effected by invalidation and is likely to have long lists of goals and terminals or to have more submerged goal there is positive correlation between the roughness of case and the length of time it would take you to find goal if you didnt take up the inval with rudiments invalidation could be said to be the basis of aberration how much inval person feels determines how aberrated he is give the auditor with slight reality on the track some auditing aimed at fixing his reality and his auditing will get better his invalidatability will decrease now he knows what hes doing and it was that which was in his road
