report on extrajudicial killings and disappearances overview of the report and sample cases ladies and gentlemen of the press mr hassan om ar hassan vicechair kenya national commission on human ri ghts members of csos present distinguished guests colleagues and friends the kenya national commission on human rights have called you here today to share with you our report entitled the cry of blood which is an account of serious blight in the state of human rig hts and the rule of law in kenya as we release this report we wish to declare here that the knchr strongly believes in the rule of law and the respect of the human rights of all kenyans we know that any society that opts to live by the law of the jungle where the mighty is the king always dies we wish to firstly disabuse the people of kenya of the misguided notion propounded by some that our criticis m of the police amounts to support for crimes we strongly associate ourselve s with and apprecia the countless police officers who serve the people of kenya nobly tirelessly selflessly and at great risk to their lives and famili exemplifying courageously the moto utumishi kwa wote in that regard and to that extent tuko pamoja similarly knchr strongly condemns in unambiguous terms any violence andor criminal activity directed agai nst the police andor any mwananchi of kenya by individual criminals as well as organized gangs and militia such crime must be fought relentlessly secondly we wish to state howev er that knchr disagrees with the proposition that crime should be fought outside the framework of the law it is the constitutional right of every k enyan suspected of having committed or indeed preparing to commit crime to be arrested brought before court of law within reasonable timeas pr escribed by the law and tried expeditiously being given every opportunity to defend themselves where after they may be convicted and sentenc ed according to the law any action by the police that falls short of that mark is clearly criminal and the allegations that the police have been invo lved in the extrajudi cial killings and disappearances of many kenyans are in deed serious because the numbers of 1killings involved here would lead any juri st andor ordinary kenyan to draw the inference that there have been case s of concerted institutional criminal activity within the kenya police that can only be described as ukatili kwa wote we hasten to add that this is not our perception of the police force as whole but it is certainly matter of grave concern that some among the police consider it all right to execute suspects after arresting them and before taking them to court such action is clearly unacceptable and itself breach of the law that the police should be enforcing the situation where some localities in kenya are inhabited by kenyans who live in as much dread of the police their mandated protectors as of the crim inals their tormentors is clearly untenable and must be addressed urgently apart from the many cases that t he knchr has received from ordinary kenyans of their loved ones being last seen under arrest in some cases by police officers known to them and therea fter either turnin g up in mortuaries sometimes far from the place of arrest or disappearing without trace the knchr received many reports of police xtortion under the guise of arrest for belonging to mungiki some of which it followed closely the knchr during the latter half of 2007 literally saved t he lives of some kenyans by responding to calls from families who had been th reatened with the death of their loved ones unless they produced amazing amou nts of money some of the cases are highlited below 1 stephen kabui on wednesday 211107 at around 230 pm the knchr received petition through caller from umoja estate
