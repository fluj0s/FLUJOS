officially still studying the issue of whether to associate with the copenhagen accord on climate change behind the scenes we understand serious discussions are taking place about which road will best serve the kingdoms long term interests on one hand saudi arabias lead climate change negotiator has criticized the copenhagen process in private and in public arguing that the unfccc process is the only acceptable legal framework on the other hand saudi officials are very eager to obtain investment credits for carbon capture and storage ccs and other technology transfer projects that will only become available once an agreement has been reached saudi officials express concern about the impact transition to lowcarbon energy mix will have on the countrys revenue stream at time when it faces enormous financing needs to transform its economy to create jobs for its young growing population it also fears imposed economic costs associated with demonizing oil part of the explanation for this schizophrenic position is that the saudi government has not yet thought through all the implications of climate change agreement in part because it may not fully understand the various demand scenarios there appears to be growing sense within the sag that it may be in danger of becoming isolated on climate change which may prompt reexamination of its position saudi officials have suggested that they need to find way to climb down gracefully from the countrys tough negotiating position more sustained engagement in coordination with other governments particularly if pitched as an effort to develop partnership may help them do so end summary saudi arabia not yet decided on copenhagen accord 2 c saudi arabias lead climate change negotiator dr mohammad alsabban told econoffs february 3 the united states should adopt more inclusive transparent approach to united nations forum for climate change cooperation unfccc negotiations although he was encouraged by president obamas attitude towards developing country partners in the negotiations alsabban said the parties needed to learn from the mistakes of copenhagen in thinking about preparing for the next conference of parties cop in mexico alsabban said developing countries felt their danish hosts forced them to decide on the copenhagen accord with practically notice heads of state were also called into the negotiations too early and they applied too much pressure when the deal was not there he said in specific response to the us request for support for the copenhagen accord ref h alsabban said saudi arabia was still studying the accord to determine its position the sag cares about the environment but it also must care for its citizens he said addressing saudi economic concerns key to progress 3 c asked how to move forward on global climate change commitment alsabban agreed negotiations need speedy outcome and said countries need to rebuild trust and confidence through more transparent negotiations he reminisced fondly about the inclusive nature of the initial kyoto protocol negotiations which he said should be replicated in cancun alsabban said climate change negotiations should remain under the unfccc and not be pursued under alternative frameworks 4 c asked about tangible actions to reach national climate change goals alsabban said saudi arabias nationally appropriate actions would include carbon capture and storage ccs credits he emphasized saudi arabias need for technology transfer and foreign direct investment to mitigate the adverse impact that emissionsreducing policies may have on the kingdom alsabban said the sag had closely studied climate change policies potential negative impacts the kingdom will need time to diversify its economy away from petroleum he said noting that us commitment to help saudi arabia with its economic diversification efforts would take the pressure off climate change negotiations 5 c alsabban said the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies was key to addressing saudi arabias domestic energy demand and he acknowledged the need for increased energy efficiency awareness the deployment of ccs technology he said was crucial for saudi arabia he said the us administrations rhetoric to end dependence on foreign oil reiterated by president obama in copenhagen is antagonistic and causes genuine fear in saudi arabia the sag is concerned about the outlook for oil demand and global production and fears it will not be able to diversify in time to reach its development goals shadow negotiator suggests partnership 6 c senior advisor to the president of meteorology and environment pme fawaz alalamy told econoffs january 27 the us and saudi arabia share the same values on climate change but have different negotiation tactics alalamy who joined pme in late 2009 and led saudi arabias world trade organization wto negotiations said saudi petroleum minister ali alnaimi wants to move forward in unfccc negotiations note pme sends three representatives with alsabban to climate change negotiations end note alsabbans negative approach to negotiations disheartens him as does the ongoing blame game on climate change saudi arabia like china and india needs to behave like an emerging economy rather than developing country he said alalamy noted he had met the previous day with both the chinese and the indian ambassadors to the kingdom to discuss climate change 7 c alalamy recommended several steps for us engagement with saudi arabia on climate change including active outreach to all the key players including alsabban petroleum minister alnaimi and pme president prince turki bin nasser alalamy recommended the us reach out to the gulf cooperation council gcc secretary general who has the power to tone down the alarm in the rest of the arab world such as in egypt alalamy recommended the us continue to coordinate its approach with other embassies which he said has been very effective asked how to get beyond the kyoto protocol lens through which alsabban views climate negotiations alalamy quickly replied he only has two more years to talk about kyoto before it expires 8 c alalamy said that minister of petroleum alnaimi strongly supports solar energy as he believes it will displace oil currently used in the power sector and ultimately increase oil exports saudi arabia currently uses 15 million barrels per day to produce electricity and water he said the kingdom is considering beginning civilian nuclear program and top leadership including minister of foreign affairs saud alfaisal supports the increased use of renewable energy sources some however view copenhagen as serious threat to saudi arabias economic stability ask any saudi alalamy said they all think saudi arabia will be asked to foot the bill for climate change alalamy outlined saudi arabias top concerns including its strong aversion to mixing trade and environmental priorities if duties are placed on oil and gas saudi arabia will not be able to move ahead with its economic diversification plans and this creates phobia of climate change talks he said the saudis also resent the us when it makes decisions without consulting its friends alalamy said saudi arabia and alsabban in particular needs to feel like partner of us decision making is alnaimi the problem 9 s minister alnaimi has consistently been rational and practical in talking with western delegations about climate change noting that saudi arabia had to address its development concerns but conceding that the world needs to work together to address climate change these reassuring statements stand in sharp contrast to alsabbans public comments such as questioning the science behind climate change just before copenhagen and his often obstructionist behavior as reported by number of embassies in riyadh during workinglevel negotiations senior ministry of petroleum officials have reassured us after each of alsabbans public outbursts over the last six months that he has been tamed and brought back onto the reservation the frequency and number of times that alsabban steps out of line and the apparent lack of any sanction raises questions about the real saudi position on climate change 10 s recent conversation with uk embassy officers suggests that indeed alnaimi may have some questions about climate change they report that alnaimi was sharply critical of the copenhagen meetings and the climate change effort in general in marked contrast to earlier meetings he complained that heads of state were brought in to negotiate the final stages which prevented saudi arabia from voicing its true opposition to several elements he also questioned the legality of the copenhagen process and its future direction 11 s senior ministry of petroleum official explained that leaving copenhagen the saudi delegation was convinced that the copenhagen accord would not attract significant support apparently largely based on alsabbans analysis the ministers office was unpleasantly surprised by midjanuary when it was clear that number of countries had already associated themselves with the accord assistant petroleum minister prince abdulaziz bin salman told econcouns that he had spent two days walking minister alnaimi through each of the 90 plus submissions on the unfccc web site prince abdulaziz told the minister that saudi arabia had missed real opportunity to submit something clever like india or china that was not legally binding but indicated some goodwill towards the process without compromising key economic interests the prince intimated to econcouns that alsabban would not long retain his position and said the challenge for saudi arabia was to find way to climb down from its negotiating position comment 12 c all indications are that saudi officials are intensely discussing what position the country should take we believe that the message is getting through that there is broad consensus among countries that tangible action needs to be taken now to address climate change we also think that saudi leaders are beginning to understand that they are in increasing danger of being left behind they do have significant legitimate concerns about how this process will affect their longterm livelihood our conversations however with officials in finance petroleum and the other economic ministries suggests that they have not done sufficient economic analysis of the various scenarios to understand what the real impact of climate change agreement might be such discussion might help provide the kind of dispassionate basis to address legitimate saudi concerns while also making better case for the need to take action to mitigate increasing emissions we take as an encouraging sign the fact that several saudi officials have noted to us that the kyoto agreement only runs for two more years suggesting that some at least understand the need to chart more assured future course we take the suggestion seriously that we help the saudis find way to climb down from their current position ideally by offering the hand of partnership which may help persuade the rest of opec to follow suit for now we believe that success will require sustained broad engagement with saudi leadership as we think the problem is more than just rogue negotiator but some broadly shared fears about the future and uncertainty about the way forward smith
