are two cpis the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu and the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw social security benefits are indexed to the cpiw and

quantitative economics government and finance division summary the consumer price index cpi is pr obably the most important measure of inflation published by the federal government it is used to adjust social security benefit payments as well as personal income tax brackets to keep up with inflation nonetheless it has been subject to criticism because the cpi does not take into account consumers ability to insulate themselves from inflation by changing their spending patterns it overestimates how much they would need to raise total spending to maintain constant standard of living this is referred to as substitution bias as part of the continuing effort to improve the cpi the bu reau of labor statistic s bls is introducing supplemental measure which will be known as the chained consumer price index for all urban consumers ccpiu the ccpiu uses continuously updated expenditure weights and thus reflects changes both in pr ices and in the composition of the consumer marketbasket because the new ccpiu w ill be subject to revision with the final release two years after the reference date it is an unlikely alternative for automatic indexing provisions this report will not be updated the consumer price index cpi is probably the most impor tant measure of inflation published by the federal govern ment published by the bur eau of labor statistics bls of the department of labor it is used to adjust social security benefit payments as well as personal income tax brackets to keep up with inflation1 nonetheless it has been subject to criticism2 the current cpi is fixedweight index httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21245crs2 3 the cpi is strictly speaking modified fixed weight price index in that the marketbasket is periodically updated until recently however t hose updates occurred only about once every 10 years with the release of cpi data for january 2002 the marketbasket was updated to reflect spending patterns in the 19992000 period and bls now plans to update the marketbasket every two years thus while the marketbasket may not be allowed to get too far out of date it is always somewhere between two nd four years out of date 4 ana m aizcorb and patrick c jackman the commodity substitution effect in cpi data 198291 monthly labor review december 1993 pp 2533one of the criticisms in particular is that because the cpi is fixedweight index it does not adequately reflect changing buying habits3 as the overall level of prices rises relative prices change as well some prices rise faster than average and some prices rise more slowly than average when goods are reasonably close s ubstitutes consumers can change their spending pattern s and buy relatively more of those goods whose prices are rising slowly and fewer of those g oods whose prices ar rising rapidly if overall consumer satisf action is unchanged once pur chasing patterns respond to changed relative prices then price index based on fixed marketbasket of goods and services will overstate the increase in cost of given standard of living because the cpi does not take into account cons umers ability to insulate themselves albeit to limited extent from inflation by changing their spending patterns it overestimates how much they would need to raise total spending to maintain constant standard of living this is referred to as substitution bias4 the current cpi is fixedweight or laspe yres price index in the simple case of two periods and two goods the value of the index in the first period is one the index value in the second period is function of th quantities in the first period and the prices in the two periods it is weighted sum the first step is to calculate for each good the ratio of the price in the second period to the price in the first period the ratios are then summed using expenditure shares in the firs t period as weights to see how fixed weight price index is calculated see box 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21245crs3 5 information from bls about the ccpiu is available on the internet at continuedindex sp p1tl i1 iit i1 box 1 calculating fixe dweight price index to illustrate consider the formula where i refers to the good t

cost quantity price cost 1 10 4 40 6 10 60 100 2 12 2 24 4 19 76 100 the index for period 1 is 1000 and the index value for period 2 is index 0 42 40619 102l index 1 3402l using expenditure weights from the first pe riod in the case of beer the expenditure weight is 40 100 040 and for wine it is 60 100 060 yields an index value in the second period of 1340 which indicates an overall increase in the price of this marketbasket of 340 in this case the measure of price change does not take into account the fact that the hypothetical c onsumer bought more beer and less wine because of the change in relative prices the new chainweighted cpi as part of the continuing effort to impr ove the cpi as measure of changes in the cost of living bls is introducing suppl emental measure which will be

of federal government programs the im of the ccpiu is to produce measure of change in consumer prices that is free of substitution bias the final release of the ccpiu will be calculated using törnqvist index formula6 this formula uses expenditure weight s in both periods thus it reflects both changes in prices and changes in the composition of the marketbasket to see how törnqvist price index is calculated see box 2 box 2 calculating törnqvist price index the törnqvist index formula looks like this in this case for each good i the pr ice in the second period in this case pt is simply p2 is divided by the price in the first period p1 and the exponent applied to that ratio is the average expenditure weight of that good in both periods in this formula the j symbol indicates that each of the weig hted price ratios for the goods in the marketbasket are multiplied together continuing with the same hypothetical numbers from the previous example and us ing the törnqvist formula gives using the törnqvist formula yields an index value for the second period of 1175 indicating an increase in the price of this hypothetical marketbasket of 175 because the törnqvist index requires data on expenditures in both time periods it can not be published concurrently with existing cpis expenditure data are not available in time however bls will publish an initia l estimate of the ccpiu based on an alternative formula the release of this initial estimate will coincide with the release ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21245crs5 7 neither the cpiu nor the cpiw is subject to revision that the ccpiu will be subject to revision may make it less attractive for indexing purposes 8 geometric mean is the root of product of set of numbers the geometric mean of two numbers is the square root of their product the current cpi already makes use of geometric means in calculating some of the component inde xes geometric means were adopted for the cpiu in january 1999 for use in aggregating some of the component indexes where goods in given category were relatively close substitutes at the time it was estimated that the change would result in 02 percentage point drop per year in measured consumer

the following february the ccpiu estimates based on the törnqvist formula will be released7 the initial release and the first revision or interim release of the ccpiu will be based on the same expenditu re weights used for the cpiu but the overall index will be based on geomet ric mean formula8 in contrast with the laspeyres index in which the quantities are held constant in both periods the geometric mean index formula holds expenditure shares price times quantity constant that means that if the price of good rises the quantity consumed implicitly falls to see how geometric mean index is calculated see box 3 box 3 calculating geometric mean price index the formula for geom etric mean price i ndex looks like this using the same prices and quantities as in the previous example with this formula gives using the geometric mean approach to calculating the price index for period 2 yields an increase of 114 between the two periods less than either of the other two

pp113125 10 ibid 11 as part of that effort bls sponsored panel of experts to examine the cpi and make specific recommendations the panel on conceptual meas urement and other statistical issues in developing costofliving indexes was chaire d by charles l schultze their report was published in 2002 by the national academy press under the title at what price conceptualizing and measuring costof living and price indexes some research has suggested that the geometric mean based price index may actually have negative substitution bias in other words it assumes that consumers respond to changes in relative prices more than is actually the case9 in estimating the initial and interim releases of the ccpiu which will be calculated using the geometric mean formula an adjustment will be made to the numbers based on the historical differences be tween the geometric mean inde x and the törnqvist index so that the initial and interim release will be closer to the final index number in the case of the first rel ease of ccpiu data for the month of july 2002 the initial release will occur in august 2002 the interim release will occur in february 2003 and the final release will occur in february 2004 the earliest data av ailable will be for january 2000 and the index base period w ill be december 1999 ie december 1999 will equal 100 the expectation is that the ccpiu will indicate slightly slower rate of increase in prices than the cpiu historical estima tes suggest that the difference could be about 02 percentage points per year10 the publication of the ccpiu is part of continuing effort by bls to produce more accurate measure of inflation11 at minimum the ccpiu should yield better estimate of the extent of substitution bias in the existing cpi its immediate practical use however may be limited the final ccpiu wh ich is calculated using the most recent actual expenditure data will only be available two years after the reference date if it turns out that revisions to the ccpiu are very small then it might become the preferred measure of inflation for those simply keep ing track of overall ec onomic conditions but because it will be revi sed and because the revisions w ill take some time it may be an impractical measure of infl ation to use for indexing it seems unlikely that the methodology of the ccpiu will be incorporated into the existing cpis any time soon the methodology of all the price indexes published by bls is entirely within bls discretion and th methodology of the existing cpi will likely continue to change as it has over the years but one aspect of the existing cpi that seems unlikely to change is that it is not usually subject to revision once it has been published that is one reason why the existing cpi is attractive for indexing given the time it takes to get the data for calculating the final ccpiu it would not be possible to incorporate the ccpiu methodology into the existing cpi without also making it subject to revision
