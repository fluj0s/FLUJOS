agricultural exports5 highvalue product continue to rise but according to usda bulk commodity exports account for threequarters of the year toyear increase in agricultural export value with about onequarter of that increase from volume gains6 usda attributes the fy2008 level of farm exports to continued strong demand tight global mark ets higher prices for grai ns and oilseeds and weak dollar in addition to these current factors other broader variables also influence the level of us agricultural exports inco and population growth and tastes and preferences in foreign markets and exchange rates us domestic farm policies that affect price and supply and trade agreements with other countries also influence the level of us agricultural exports while many of these factors are beyond the

subsidies of agricultura l products through the export enhancement progra m eep and the dairy export incentive program deip export enhancement program eep8 eep was established in 1985 first by the secretary of agriculture under au thority granted in the commodity credit corporation charter act and then unde r the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 the program was institu ted after several years of declining us agricultural exports and growing grain stockpile veral factors contributed to the fall in exports during the early 1980s an overvalue d dollar and high commodity loan rates under the 1981 farm bill made us exports relatively expensive for foreign buyers global recession reduced demand for us agricultural products and foreign subsidies especially those of the eur opean union eu helped competing products make inroads into traditional us markets eeps main stated rationale at its inception was to combat unfair tradin g practices of competitors in world agricultural markets the office of the general sales manager in usdas foreign agricultural service fas operates eep the sales manager announces target countries and amounts of commodities to be sold to those countries and then invites us exporters to bid for bonuses that effectively lower the sales price an exporter negotiates sale with foreign importe r calculates the bonus necessary to meet the negotiated price and submits the bonus and price to fas fas awards bonuses based on bids and amount of funding availabl initially awarded in the form of certificates for commodities owned by the ccc bonuses since 1992 have been in the form of cash most eep bonuses have been used to ssist sales of wheat in fy1995 the last year with significant program activity 72 of eep sales were wheat 8 flour 6 poultry and the remaining sales were eggs feed grains pork barley malt and rice although many exporters have received bonuses since 1985 three exporting firms have received almost half of the total of all eep bonuses which now ex ceed 7 billion the former soviet uni on egypt algeria and china were major beneficiaries of eep subsidies the united states agreed to reduce its agricultural export subsidies under the 1994 uruguay round agreement on agricultu re the agreement requires that outlays for export subsidies fall by 36 and the quantities subsidized by 21 over six years 19952001 legislation to implement the uruguay round agreement pl 103465 reauthorized eep through th year 2001 and specifi ed that eep need not be limited to responses to unfair trade practices as in the 1985 food security acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33553crs6 9 see for example the article by paarlberg and seitzinger simulation model of the us export enhancement program for wheat in the presence of an ec response at httperaeoxfordjournalsorgcgicontentabs tract164445 government accountability office gao report found that eep increased exports and helped bring competitors notably the european union to the

httpwwwfasusdagovexcredits deiphtmlbut also could be used to develop expor t markets eep was reauthorized most recently in the 2002 fsria authority to spend ccc f unds on eep expires in fy2007 eep has been controversial since its initiation in 1985 many oppose the program outright on grounds of economic effici ency eep they argue like all export subsidies interferes with the operations of markets and distorts trade others noting that the uruguay round agreement on agri culture restricts but does not prohibit agricultural export subsidies point out that as long as competitors such as the european union use export subsidies the united states should also be prepared to use them the effectiveness of eep also has been an issue several studies of the use of eep found that wheat exports woul d have decline somewhat if eep were eliminated suggesting that the eep program increased wheat exports other analysts however found that subsidizing wheat exports under eep resulted in displacing exports of unsubsidized grains9 recent eep activity although almost always under some pressure from interested commodity groups to use eep more extensively usda has limited its scope and funding since 1995 usdas rationa for not using eep is based on the argument that using it might depress world market prices for eligible commodities some analysts say that not using eep also strengthens the us hand in ongoing wto agriculture negotiations where major us aim is the elimination of agricultural export subsidies in fy1995 the last year of signifi cant program activity eep bonuses were valued at 339 million from fy1996 to fy2006 total of only 17 million of eep bonuses were awarded there were eep bonus awards from fy2002 through fy2007 dairy export incentive program deip10 deip most recently reauthorized in the commodity program title not the trade title of the 2002 farm bill was established under the 1985 farm act to assi st exports of us dairy products its purpose was to counter the adverse effects of foreign subsidies primarily those of the european union early bonus payments were in the form of sales from cccowned dairy stocks later they were generic commodity certificates from ccc inventories now they are cash payments as with eep usda announces targ et countries and amounts of dairy products that may be sold to those countries under the program exporters negotiate tentative sales and bid for bonuses to subsidize the prices of the sales the uruguay round subs idy reduction commitments see eep above apply also to deip legislative aut hority for deip expires on december 31 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33553crs7 11 additional information on map is available at httpwwwfasusdagovmosprograms mapasp while many oppose subsidizing dairy pr oducts for reasons similar to those held by eep opponents the program has strong support in congress dairy producers consider deip an integral part of us dairy policy an important adjunct to domestic support programs recent deip activity deip bonuses were awarded from fy2005 through fy2007 the program level fo r deip in fy2003 was 32 million and in fy2004 it was 3 million administration farm bill proposals the administration calls for the repeal of the export enhancement program eep usdas justification for this move is that eep is longer useful t ool for us agricultural exports it has been inactive since 1995 and its elimination would not materially affect us exports eep the secretary says is inconsistent with the us goal of eliminating export subsidies worldwide in doha round negotiations farm bill legislative action the housepassed bill extends authority for eep through fy2012 while the senate version ca lls for the repeal of eep both the senate and house farm bills also extend the

2007 at an annual level of 345 million the program which began in 1955 is like map in most major respects its purpose is to expand ex port opportunities over the long term by undertaking activities such as consumer pr omotions technical assistance trade servicing and market research as with map projects under fmdp are jointly funded by the government and industry gr oups and the government reimburses the industry organization for its part of the cost after the project is finished like map fmdp is exempt from uruguay round ag reement reduction commitments unlike map which mainly promotes consumer goods and brandname products fmdp mainly promotes generic or bulk commodities map and fmdp issues some of the same issues raised with respect to map are also raised about fmdp and in some cases all the export programs the basic issue is whether the federal governme nt should have an active role in helping agricultural producers and agribusinesses market their products overseas some argue that map and fmdp are forms of cor porate welfare in that they fund activities that private firms would and could fund fo r themselves others argue that the principal beneficiaries are fo reign consumers and that funds could be better spent for example to educate us firms on how to export program supporters emphasize that foreign competitors especially eu memb er countries also spend money on market promotion and that us marketing progra ms help keep us products competitive in thirdcountry marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33553crs9 13 additional information on the emerging markets

countries critic s including the administration point to delayed arrivals of up to f our months when us commodities are shipped in response to emergency situations ocean transpor tation costs can be high in fy2006 usaid estimated that almost half of its food aid allocations went to paying the cost of transportation ocean transport and internal shipping costs26 ocean freight rates vary from year to year but paying such costs is one reason that both usda and usaid have proposed in various budget proposals allocating so portion of funds available to pl 480 title ii emergency programs to purchase commodities in areas near to the emergency the administration argues that with local or regional purchase not only could more food be purch ased at lower prices but the food could be delivered more rapidly congressional and other critics of the local purchase proposal maintain that allowing nonus commodities to be purchased would result in undermining the coalition of commodity groups private voluntary organizations and shippers that support the program and in reductions in us food aid27 related to the question of costeffectiveness is the cargo preference issue the cargo preference act pl 83644 ugust 26 1954 as amended contains permanent legislation concerning the tr ansportation of wate rborne cargoes in usflag vessels the act requires that 75 of the volume of us agricultural commodities financed under p l 480 and other concessiona l financing arrangements be shipped on privately owned usregistered vessels maritime interests generally support cargo preference but proponents of p l 480 argue that it increases the costs of shipping us commodities to poor c ountries and potentially reduces the volume of food aid provided gao report found th at shipments of food aid on usflag vessels did little to meet the laws objective of helping to maintain us merchant marine and that cargo preference requirement s adversely affect operations of the food aid programs chiefly by raising the cost of ocean transportation and reducing the volume of commodities that can be shipped28 the monetization selling in local market s of food aid commodities also is an issue pl 480 provision section 203 fi rst included in the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 allows private voluntary organizations and cooperatives to sell percentage of donated pl 480 commodities in the recipient country or in countries in the same region under section 203 of pl 480 private voluntary organizations or cooperatives are pe rmitted to sell ie m onetize for local currencies or dollars an amount of commodities equal to not ss than 15 of the total amount of commodities distributed in an fiscal year in country the currency generated by these sales can then be used to finance inte rnal
