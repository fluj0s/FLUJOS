central topic when president bush met with andean leaders at the summit of the americas meeting in canada in april 2001 in midmay 2001 briefing on the and ean regional initiative administration spokesmen set out three overarching goals for the region that could be called the three ds democracy development and drugs the first goal was to promote democracy and democratic in stitutions by supporting judicial reform anticorruption measures human rights improvement and the peace process in colombia the second was to foster sustainable economic development and trade liberalization through alternative economic development environmen tal protection and renewal of the andean trade preference act atpa the third was to significantly reduce the supply of illegal drugs to the united st ates from the source through eradication interdiction and other efforts3 under consideration by the congress in 2001 critics of the initiative argued that it overempha sized military and counterdrug assistance and provided inadequate support for human rights and the peace process in colombia supporters argued that it tinued needed assistance to colombia while providing more support for regional

of the administra tions request argued in the context of the post september 2001 war on terrorism that colo mbia and the region should be supported and they urged the administration to seek expanded

should transmit to congress fo r its consideration proposed legislation consistent with united states law regarding the protection of human rights to assist the government of colombia protect its democracy from united statesdesignated foreign terrorist organizations and the scourge of illicit narcotics critics argued that the new request would expand the us military role in colombia previously strictly limited to counternarcotics into problematic counterinsurgency one critics who emphasi ze human rights considerations argued that such role would inevitably involv tolerance of the linkages between the colombian military and paramilitary groups that are repor tedly responsible for gross violations of human rights particul ar concern is the lifting of human rights conditions concerning paramilitary groups in the fy2002 supplemental request see below others who believe us military power shoul d not be committed unless it can be effective warned that the proposed assistance falls far short of that required to have any significant effect on the situation in colombia many also worry that the united states is slowly being drawn into vietnamlike morass providing assistance to government that does not have the credibility and political will to pay for and successfully wage its own war and conclude just peace congress passed 11 of 13 appropriations bills in an omni bus bill

in colombia at 400 each although this cap only applies to us personnel in colombia in support of plan colombia bush administration officials have stated that they will stay within those limits except in special cases rela ted to searchandrescue ope rations in february 2003 it was reported that the number of military personnel had topped the 400 cap the additional personnel bein g deployed to search for seve ral american contractors who were being held by the farc after thei r plane crashed according to defense department officials these numbe rs returned to under 400 in may 2003 expanded authorities as in the fy2002 supplemental congress provided authority for unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist organizations and to take actions to protect health and human welfare the was done the conference report notes in recognition that the narcotics indus try is linked to the terrorist groups including the paramilitary organizations in co lombia however the conference report also states however the managers still conclude that coca provides the revenue and motive for the violence committed by both guerrilla and paramilitary groups therefore the managers expect counternarcotics alternative development and judicial reform to remain the principal focus of united states policy in colombia the expanded authority is not signal from the managers for the united states to become more deeply involved in assisting the colombian armed forces in fighting the terrorist groups especially not at the expense of the counternarcotics progra ms but to provide the means for more effective intelligence gathering and fusion and to provide the flexibility to the department of state when the distinction between count ernarcotics and counterterrori sm is not clear cut expanded authorities would end if the secretary of state has credible evidence that the colombian military is not conduc ting vigorous operations to restore government authority and human rights in areas under the effective control of paramilitary and guerrilla organizations the report also calls for the secretary of state to report within 90 days of enactme nt the changes in policy including

nvolvement that the ability of the peruvian air force to shot down aircraft will include enhanced safeguards and procedures to prevent similar accidents request for emergency fy2002 supplemental aid on march 21 2002 the bush administration requested 271 billion in emergency fy2002 supplemental assistan ce which was mostly to support department of defense and homeland security counterte rrorism efforts but would also provide 38 million in additional fundi ng and authorities re lating to colombia and the andean region included in this submission was request for 4 million of incle funding for colombia police post support 6 million of fmf funding for colombia for infrastructure security 3 million for ecuador for counterterrorism equipment and training and 25 million of nonproliferation antiterrorism and demining funding for counterkidnapping program for members of colombias police and armed forces the submission also included reque st for up to 100 million in department of defense funding for defens articles services and trai ning to be used worldwide to support foreign nations in furtheran ce of the global war on terrorism on such terms and conditions as the secretary of defense may determine and for 30 million to assist indigenous forces alt hough the request contained indication that the administration intended to use any of these funds for colombia or any other ari country critics feared the precedent that would be set by granting such assistance such funds they argued could be used by the department of defense to carry out foreign security assistance prog rams free of the cong ressionally mandated controls on state partment programs the supplemental submission proposed to broaden the authorities of the defense and state departments to use fy2002 and fy2003 assistance and unexpended plan colombia assistance to support the colombian governments unified campaign against narcotics trafficking terrorist activities and other threats to its national security according to the administrations explanation these provisions would allow broader authority to provide assistance to colombia to counter the unified crosscutting threat posed by groups that use narcotics trafficking to fund their terrorist and other activities that threaten the national security of colombia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31383crs8 such change would allow the administration to expand the scope of us assistance particularly military assistance to colombia allowing state and defense department funds to assist the colombian government to counter any threat to its national security the immediate and widely discussed effect of this change would be to allow the us government to broaden the circumstances under which it currently shares intelligence with colombia n security forces providing intelligence not only for counterdrug operations but also for military operations against the colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries the change would also permit the plan colombia helicopters and othe r equipment that the united states has provided to be used for such purposes as proposed by the administration the leahy amendment conditions in the foreign operations and defense appropriations forbidding assistance to military and police units credibly alleged to engage in gross violations of human rights would continue to apply as would the current caps of 400 each on the number of us civilian contractors and us military personnel s upporting p lan colombia activities in colombia the new proposed military activitie s ie infrastructure protection and antikidnapping assistan ce are not however plan colombia activities except for those two specifica lly mentioned conditions however the administrations proposal stated that f unding would be provi ded notwithstanding any provision of law that statement w ould lift conditions like those of section 567 of pl 107115 the fy2002 foreig n operations appropriations act which has stiffer provisions regarding human rights vi olations by security forces and requires the armed forces to address the continuing links of some of its members with illegal rightist paramilitary groups it would so lift pl 107115 conditions regarding aerial fumigation spraying and alternative development the house approved the conference re port on hr 4775 hrept 107593 on july 23 2002 and the senate approved it on july 24 2002 the president signed the bill into law pl 107206 on august 2 2002 the conference report funded 25 million for counterkidnapping training for co lombia as requested by the president 4 million in additional count ernarcotics funding and 6 million for protection of colombias canolimon oil pipeline but changed the source of funding from the fmf to the inc account the supplemental so granted broader authority to pursue new activities in colombia but with modifications that blended house and senate provisions the bill provided identical expanded authority for the use of inc and department of defense dod funds including prior year funds but used different language than that proposed by the admin istration that nguage stated that fy2002 f unds sha ll be available to support unified

the ability of colombian security forces to combat the leftist guerrilla s and to expand their control throughout rural areas thereby undercutting the rati onale and support for military groups those who favored an expanded military approach did not necessarily favor continuing the eradication and alternativ development programs unde r current circumstances however some argued that these programs

who wa nted to expand military aid nonetheless argued that further military assistance s hould not be provided until the armed forces have adhered to current cond itions on assistance requiring that

instead the committee provided that funds would be available to support unifi ed campaign against narcotics trafficking against activities by organizations designat ed as terrorist organizationsand to

discretion to decide on the uses of two new pots of money in the bill totaling 130 million requested to assist foreign nati ons and indigenous forces with defense articles services and training although colombia was not specified as potential recipient of these funds they could concei vably have been used there the primary responsibility of the secretary of state for foreign assistan ce and in particular military assistance is well established according to the report existing provisions of law already provide sufficient authority for the purposes identified in the presidents request the
