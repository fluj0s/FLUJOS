analyst in social policy domestic social policy division the us commission on civil rights history funding and current issues summary the civil rights act of 1957 was enacted to investigate issues concerning the civil rights of american citizens among other provisions the act provided for creation of united states commission on civil rights commission as an independent executive bipartisan factfinding agency the mission of the commission was to inform both the president and congress on implementation of civil rights protections currently the commission is composed of eight members four members are appointed by the president and two each by the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house on the recommendations of the majority and minority leaders in each chamber more than four members at any one time can be of the same political party since 1957 the commission has been reauthorized number of times most recently with passage of the civil rights commission amendments act of 1994 pl 103419 which expired september 30 1996 however congress has appropriated about 9 million each fiscal year since 1995 for the agency on september 30 2008 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 was enacted into law pl 110329 hr 2638 which provides for the commission to be funded in fy2009 at the fy2008 enacted funding level of 85 million until march 6 2009 for fy2009 the bush administration requested 88 million for the us commission on civil rights which was 300 thousand above the fy2008 funding for the commission according to some observers discrimination has become more subtle since the establishment of the commission and continues to affect women and certain racial and ethnic minorities resulting in inequalities that affect income job status and educational attainment these advocates believe that the commissions mandate allows it to support special legislative measures to overcome these socioeconomic inequalities opponents of this view however contend that the purpose of civil rights laws is to ensure equality of opportunity not to guarantee actual socioeconomic equality among racial and ethnic groups and between the sexes they state that when the commission seeks group preferences and benefits it becomes more of an advocate for special interests rather than an impartial monitor of legal equality for several decades tensions have increased among advocates of these fundamentally different approaches to addressing the issue of civil rights when determining whether or on what occasion it is appropriate to consider race gender or other factors in forming policy the issue of civil rights triggers strong beliefs and emotions making it extremely difficult to reach consensus on the commission as consequence some allege that the process for appointing members to the commission has become major tool in controlling debate on civil rights and molding public policy on the issue

forbade the commission its advisory committees or any person under its supervision or control to appraise study or collect information about federal laws and policies or any other governmental authority on abortion civil rights commission authorization act of 1979 the civil rights commission authorization act of 1979 pl 9681 authorized appropriations for the commission for fy1980 and directed the commission to appraise the laws and policies of the federal government to determine if americans of eastern and southerneuropean ethnic groups were denied equal protection of the laws and to report its findings to congress the report had to include an analysis of the adverse consequences of affirmative action programs encouraged by the federal government upon the equal opportunity rights of these americans early 1980s debate over the commissions independence because the commission was established to apprise the federal government when denials of constitutional rights occurred it traditionally was believed that the commission should be independent of the president and that its members should be protected from removal for political reasons in 1982 debate developed over the work of the commission and the presidents power over it that year president ronald reagan nominated reverend b sam hart to the commission hart was opposed by some civil rights groups including the national urban league naacp legal defense fund national organization for women mexicanamerican legal defense fund and national gay task force because of his opposition to busing for school desegregation the equal rights amendment and the concept of homosexual rights5 president reagan eventually withdrew the nomination of reverend hart6 but 4 us commission on civil rights constitutional

he sought to replace three more commissioners who had been frequent critics of his administrations civil rights policies when some senate opposition to replacing the commissioners developed the president fired them rather than waiting until the senate confirmed their replacements7 president reagans firing of the three commissioners triggered debate on the commissions independence who should appoint its members and its mandate approaches to civil rights this debate revealed fundamental differences in approaches to addressing the issue of civil rights some members of congress and civil rights activists charged that president reagan was undermining the commissions traditional independence some members of the us commission on civil rights maintained that despite legal guarantees of equal opportunity inequalities persisted between minority groups and women on one hand and white males on the other in income job status and educational attainment they believed that the commissions mandate allowed it to support special legislative measures to overcome socioeconomic inequality because such inequality resulted from discrimination8 the administration and its supporters argued that the federal governments role in enforcing civil rights should focus on discrimination against an individual rather than against groups of individuals who historically have been victims of discrimination further according to this view the us commission on civil rights mandate did not extend to seeing that equality of opportunity resulted in actual socioeconomic equality among racial and ethnic groups and between the sexes9 supporters of president reagan argued that in pressing for what they called group preferences and benefits the commission had become less an impartial monitor of legal equality and more an advocate of particular interests thus in this view the commission politicized itself and consequently forfeited its traditional independence from the president united states commission on civil rights act of 1983 differing views of the commission led to congressional proposals to allow the thenexisting civil rights commission to expire and to create new civil rights commission in the legislative branch eventually congress and president reagan compromised on the issue the united states commission on civil rights act of 1983 pl 98183 was enacted on november 30 1983

continued the house proposed to stop funding the agency in 1986 but reached compromise with the senate that made the commission parttime operation congress in making the commission part time cut the fy1987 appropriation for the commission placed restrictions on how the money could be spent and limited the pay of commissioners the number of employees they could hire and the amount of money spent for consulting contracts pl 9959110 with enactment of the civil rights reauthorization act of 1989 congress extended the commission on civil rights for 22 months until september 30 1991 pl 10118011 civil rights reauthorization act of 1991 for years there were complaints that the commission was not carrying out its factfinding responsibilities it was charged that only one report had been produced in two years criticism of the commission was that it was spending too much time on divisive rhetoric others questioned whether the commission was even needed civil rights spokesmen attributed the commissions drop in production to the reagan administrations appointment of commissioners who opposed programs such as busing and affirmative action the chair of the commission arthur fletcher however pointed to the reduction in funding as contributing factor to the commissions drop in productivity12 congress responded in 1991 by enacting the us commission on civil rights reauthorization act of 1991 pl 102167 hr 3350 unlike previous acts that allowed the commission to submit reports to congress and the president at the discretion of either the commission congress or the president this act requires the commission to submit at least one annual report to the president and congress that monitors federal civil rights enforcement efforts although president george h w bush requested that the commission be reauthorized for 10 years at 10 million for each fiscal year congress only extended it for three fiscal years to september 30 1994 for fy1992 congress authorized 716 million for the agency and an additional 12 million for relocation of the commissions headquarters office according to the law at that time when the commission was not authorized appropriations it had to terminate its operation during senate consideration of samdt 1276 to hr 3350 senator simon stated that if further legislation enacted different level of appropriations for fiscal years 1993 or 1994 then the

closely monitor the commission and those who felt that short reauthorization would force the commission to focus too much on its own survival13 according to the congressional quarterly almanac commission officials were unhappy with the final provisions believing they needed more money and longer authorization to meet congressional goals14 civil rights commission amendments of 1994 the civil rights commission amendments act of 1994 pl 103419 amended the us commission on civil rights act of 1983 among other provisions it reauthorized the commission until september 30 1996 although

established in the district of columbia and for an advisory committee to be composed of citizens of that state or district the 1994 act amended the language of the 1983 act which set in place the original staggered term requirement and specified the manner in which an unexpired term was to be filled the 1994 act directs that the initial membership of the commission shall be the members of the united states commission on civil rights on september 30 199415 the act further provides that the term of office of each member of the commission shall be six years the term of each member of the commission in the initial membership of the commission shall expire on the date such term would have expired as of september 30 199416 congress has not passed legislation to reauthorize the commission on civil rights since 1994 although it has continued to appropriate funding for the agency issues since 1994 number of concerns have surfaced regarding the commission including its authorization and funding management and members in addition the government accountability office ga0 has issued several reports on the commission which have been critical of its management the following section reviews gao reports on management issues as well as concerns that have been raised about state advisory committees and controversies involving commission members congress may want to evaluate these

appropriate funding for the agency the appendix provides funding requests and appropriations for the commission from fy1959 through fy2009 as the appendix shows since fy1995 appropriations for the commission have remained at approximately 9 million per year as mentioned earlier in this report some have criticized the level of appropriations for the commission attributing its drop in productivity in part to lack of sufficient funding on september 30 2008 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 was enacted into law pl 110329 hr 2638

accountability office gao17 has released several investigatory reports on the us commission on civil rights gao report of 1986 that focused on personnel actions of the commission found irregularities in the hiring of permanent and temporary staff the appointment of consultants and in the maintenance of personnel records18 successive gao reports continued to recommend improvements in management of the agency including project management financial activities the contracting process and the commissions relationship with the state advisory committees sacs for 17 formerly known as the general accounting office 18 us general accounting office the operations of the us commission on civil rights report abstract march 29 1986 crs11 fy1990 appropriations congress restricted how the commission could spend funds on regional offices monitoring of civil rights contracts and hiring staff and directed gao to determine if the commission had complied with the restrictions in 1992 gao reported that the commission had complied with provisions of the fy1990 appropriations act19 1997 report again in 1997 gao found the commission could not provide important cost information on aspects of its operations such as regional offices the process for referring complaints public service announcements and one project in addition key documents on the commissions decisionmaking process were lost misfiled or nonexistent to correct these managerial problems gao made two general recommendations that the agency develop and document policies and procedures that assign responsibility for management functions to the staff director and other commission officials and provide mechanisms to hold them accountable for proper management of daytoday operations of the commission three specific recommendations gao made to the commission were to update the code of federal regulations on the commissions operations update the commissions internal guidance and establish management information system not all of the commissioners agreed with gaos findings but all of them agreed to implement its recommendations20 2003 report more recently congress asked gao to assess the commissions financial activities its project management procedures and its contracting process in its report of october 2003 gao found that although the commission had improved its operations it still was not operating in manner completely consistent with sound management principles specifically gao recommended an external audit of the commissions financial statements because none had been conducted in 12 years furthermore gao found the project management procedures followed by commissioners and staff in planning implementing and reporting the results of approved projects did not allow commissioners to review many commission reports before they were published according to gao this significantly reduced commissioners influence in shaping findings and recommendations of report and policy implications of civil rights issues gao was concerned about commissioner control over contracting procedures as it found key documentation was missing on how the commission awarded contracts also it reported that the commissions contracting activities did not comply with established federal regulations21 these findings were not unchallenged as jin then commission staff director observed that the commission had significantly improved its management 19 us general accounting office us commission on civil rights the commission has complied with fy90 appropriation act provisions may 1992 pp 12 20 us general

commissioners according to him historically the commissions career civil servants researched and drafted reports and based conclusions on the facts however commissioners have the power to change this process mr jin also believed the commissions contract practices were fundamentally sound noting that any deficiencies that gao found were not based on fraud abuse or managerial impropriety despite disagreeing with gao findings jin stated that the commission accepted and had already started to institute gaos recommendations but would not be able to implement all of them because of limited funding23 in its report of 2004 gao found that the commission still had not implemented three of the four recommendations for improving the agencys management and procurement practices24 2006 report in 2006 gao reported on the commissions quality assurance policies for its products gao found that the commission lacked policies for ensuring the objectivity of national products reports briefings or hearings25 gao reported that the agency lacked policy for ensuring varied perspectives in its national office reports neither did the commission have policy for determining when and how to select external reviewers the gao report compared the commissions policy on using external reviewers with the national academies and the congressional budget office agencies that use external reviewers to assess the completeness balance and objectivity of their reports according to gao the guiding principle used by these agencies is the more controversial the topic the greater the number of reviewers they use26 an inspector general retained by the commission and the staff director of the commission recommended several procedures to address these concerns including mandatory use of external reviewers paid or unpaid to certify that agency procedures were followed projectsreports can be assigned to different responsible project offices such as the office of civil rights evaluation the office of general counsel or others which then would ensure that agency procedures are followed each responsible project office would then submit reports to the commission for subsequent review and approval the office of the staff director would certify that input from program staff regional offices sacs and others was sought27 22 ibid 23 ibid pp 4050 24 us government accountability office

state advisory committee charter30 the purpose of state advisory committees sacs is to inform the commission on civil rights matters in their state such as denial of the right to vote based on discrimination or fraud and denial of equal protection of the law and advise the commission concerning the preparation of reports to the president and the congress receive reports suggestions and recommendations from persons in both public and private sectors in each state initiate and offer advice and recommendations to the commission when requested and observe open hearings or conferences

sacs has declined since 200034 in surveys of sacs and interviews with committee members gao heard complaints that 1 reduced funding had resulted in limited meetings and travel and reductions in regional staff who provide essential operational support and 2 the commission did not review their reports in timely manner35 changes in sacs under the old guidelines and policy of the commission sac members were appointed for twoyear term the length of the charter with limits on the number of terms the commission wanted sac membership to reflect the states population with respect to ethnicity race religion sex political affiliation age and disability status it required minimum minority group membership on the sacs of 40 or not more than 65 and diversity of experience and knowledge from business labor and other perspectives36 in its 2006 report gao found that members of sacs reflected the state populations eg political affiliation and sex although they generally relied more heavily on minority populations especially blacks and religious minorities for instance whites comprised 35 of committee positions while constituting 72 of the national population blacks comprised 29 of committee members while constituting 134 of the national population on the other hand hispanics with membership of 15 were comparable to their national proportion of the population 15 disabled individuals constituted 16 of membership compared to the proportion of their national population 19 historically professions of committee members included state legislators university professors lawyers and ministers which allowed them to be influential on local civil rights issues37 in february 2006 the commission changed the criteria for membership in sacs which affects the term of committee members their diversity political representation knowledge and potentially alters committee membership new rules limit appointments to maximum of 10 years or five 2year terms38 the commission objected to the thenexisting regulations and policies on sac membership which were established by members of an earlier commission that it viewed as highly restrictive39 replacing them with ones that emphasize knowledge of academic technical skills such as law and statistical analysis among other reasons the commission chair explains this change as response to staff shortages in regional offices the commission intends to have sac members themselves 34 gao us commission on civil rights gao06343 pp 2731 35 gao us commission on civil rights gao06343 pp 3234 36 gao us commission on civil

representation on sacs the old criterion for political representation required sac membership to reflect the bipartisan character of the commission although the commissions new criteria require sac members to be of both political parties its staff director reportedly informed gao that having one minority member on committee of 11 would fulfill this requirement this interpretation appears to conflict with the faca requirement that sac members be fairly balanced both in points of view and functions to be performed41 also gao found reference to political independents in the commissions new criteria on political representation although they comprise about quarter of sac membership42 problems concerning the sacs in its 2006 report gao noted the important historical relationship between the commission and the sacs and recent changes the commission has made in the criteria for membership on sac gao identified several problems concerning the relationship of the commission with sacs according to this report the commission had not issued timely renewal of state advisory committee charters leaving majority of sacs without current charters that authorize them to operate 38 of the 51 sacs lacked authorizing charters since the gao publication and institution of the above identified changes the commission has reported that it has rechartered 27 of 51 sacs leaving 24 state advisory committees without charters43 although sacs as in the past have continued to operate while their applications for renewal are being considered faca prohibits sacs from meeting or conducting business without charter44 gao also found that the commission had not sought the views of the sacs when making organizational changes that directly affect the committees or fully integrated the committees into the accomplishment of its mission45 the report found that generally the commission had not incorporated the role of the sacs into its strategic planning and decisionmaking processes for example sac input was not sought when the commission approved the staff directors proposal to reduce expenses by closing two regional offices in fy2006 in addition regional directors the liaisons to sacs were not notified of the closings until three days after the decision had been made two regional directors learned of the decision from sources outside the commission the sacs were not involved in development of the commissions draft strategic plan until congressional staff asked about the sacs role in it according to the report only after several members of congress commented on the lack of sacs

2006 report47 controversies surrounding commissioners kirsanow appointment president bushs nomination in 2001 of peter kirsanow to the us commission on civil rights was opposed by some commissioners and some civil rights advocates for two primary reasons first some commissioners said they did not believe that vacancy existed on the commission in november 1995 president clinton appointed judge leon higginbotham to six year term on the commission judge higginbotham died in december 1998 before the expiration of his term of service which would have been november 29 2001 on appointing victoria wilson to the vacancy in december 1998 president clinton in his appointment certificate indicated that her term would expire on november 29 2001 however her attorney leon friedman claimed this was clerical error friedman was reported in the washington post as stating that statutes governing the commission did not allow for the appointment of members to interim or acting status and that all terms were for six years48 on december 6 2001 president bush appointed peter kirsanow labor lawyer and former chairman of the center for new black leadership to replace victoria wilson on the commission according to an article in the washington post kirsanows appointment was opposed by some civil rights advocates and commissioners49 moreover some commissioners did not believe that vacancy existed on the commission50 because the commission on civil rights act of 1994 provides that all commissioners serve sixyear terms commission chairperson mary frances berry insisted that wilsons term did not expire for six years according to newspaper accounts berry and other commissioners charged that president bushs appointment of new commissioner was intended to muzzle the commission 46 gao us

presidential election in florida51 in establishing the commission as an independent entity insulated from political influence congress through the act of 1983 provided for lengthy fixed staggered terms of office political balance in the membership of the commission and protection of commission members from presidential removal by limiting removal only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office on the basis of provisions of the civil rights act of 1983 that related to the terms of commissioners the bush administration maintained that commissioner wilsons appointment ended on november 29 2001 because she was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by judge higginbothams death it argued that the civil rights act of 1994 intended to preserve the same staggered sixyear term for commissioners that was provided in the 1983 act otherwise it would allow president before leaving office to appoint majority of his people to the commission52 in 2001 when peter kirsanow appeared at meeting of the commission it refused to seat him by vote of 5353 the bush administration responded by filing federal suit seeking removal of commissioner wilson and the seating of kirsanow us district judge gladys kessler ruled in wilsons favor on appeal three judge panel of the us court of appeals for the dc circuit unanimously ruled for kirsanow holding that the 1994 act did not disrupt the staggering of terms of commission members established in the 1983 act54 the second reason voiced for opposition to the appointment of kirsanow reportedly was his perceived hostility to civil rights policies supported by many black americans critics charged that kirsanow opposes affirmative action and with history in the struggle for civil rights was appointed to the commission largely because of his race according to critics his mission is to lobby against the policies responsible for his prominence55 in appointing peter kirsanow to the 51 hanna rosin bush swears in disputed choice for rights

passed and it is time to go in new direction57 and those who wanted to continue the traditional approach of pointing out civil rights violations and pursuing policy changes58 political balance on the commission the most recent controversy concerning appointees to the commission involved two current commissioners who reportedly changed their party affiliation as noted earlier more than four members of the same political party can serve on the commission at any one time59 the vote of five commissioners is needed to approve report or make recommendation abigail thernstrom and gail heriot on december 6 2004 president bush appointed two republicans to the commission gerald reynolds as chair and ashley l taylor bringing the total number of republican commissioners to four abigail thernstrom was originally congressional appointee to the commission as republican60 however the boston globe asserts that in october 2004 six weeks before president bush appointed her to the commission as vice chairwoman and also before the reynolds and taylor appointments she changed her political affiliation to independent according to this same report gail heriot changed her party affiliation from republican to independent in 2007 seven months before senate republicans appointed her to the commission further the report asserts that when questioned about the switch in parties both thernstrom and heriot denied that their change in registration had anything to do with the commission61 the current website of the commission indicates that thernstroms political affiliation is republican and heriot is an independent62 56 congressional record concern for the integrity and reputation of the united states civil rights commission december 6 2001 pp s12530s12531 57 steve miller bushs choice to join

globe reports that former commissioner russell redenbaugh who resigned in 2005 appears to have changed party affiliation twice during his tenure on the commission most recently in 2003 when he switched from republican to independent this move created republican opening on the commission63 party affiliation provisions the political balance provisions of the civil rights act of 198364 do not address whether the party affiliation of commissioner is considered only at the time of appointment or whether commissioner who changes party identification would be bound by the old party affiliation ceiling or not in december 2004 the department of justice doj issued memorandum to the white house in response to request for an interpretation of this issue the doj office of legal counsel olc wrote specifically you have asked whether in the appointment of new member to the commission the relevant consideration is the party affiliation of the other members at the time the new member is appointed which would take into account any changes in party affiliation by those other members after their appointment to the commission or whether it is the party affiliation of the other members at the time those other members were appointed which would not take into account any such postappointment changes in party affiliation we conclude that the plain language of the statute makes clear that the relevant consideration is the party affiliation of the other members at the time the new member is appointed65 critics of this interpretation charge that it violates the spirit of the law which intended to achieve bipartisan approach to investigating alleged violations of civil rights by limiting the number of commissioners affiliated with particular party66 through the leadership conference on civil rights and citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington some civil rights groups including the national association for the advancement of colored people mexican american legal defense and educational fund national womens law center and national congress of american indians also challenge olcs interpretation of the statutory provision concerning the political affiliation of
