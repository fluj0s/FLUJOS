similar conclusion see hr rep 94238 at 5 this language of section 201a is not intended to grant any additional authority to the president rather it indica tes the general nature of the circumstances in which declaration might be issued the proclamation would be immediately transmitted continuedeffect of proclamation shortly after the issuance of the pr esidents septembe r 8 2005 proclamation questions concerning the validity and effect of the proclamation were raised some argued that the national emergencies act nea requires the president to declare national emergency before he may suspend the prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act14 enacted in 1976 the nea identif ies procedure for declarations of national emergency by the presiden t prescribes accountability and reporting requirements for the president and pr ovides for the termin ation of national emergencies15 the nea was enacted in part to provide for the orderly implementation and termination of future national emergencies16 because the proclamation was seemingly issued without regard to the nea critics maintained that it could be invalid17 section 201 of the nea provides for the declaration of national emergency by the president and discusses the effect of such declaration on other laws section 201a states with respect to acts of congress aut horizing the exercise during the period of national emergency of any special or extraordinary power the president is authorized to declare such national emergency such proclamation shall immediately be transmitted to the congress and published in the federal register18 in the senate report accompanying the nea the senate committee on government operations indicated that section 201a was not in tended to grant additional authority to the president the president can only exercise those powers delegated to him in other statutes the purpose of this statute is to prescribe the procedures to be followed in the event that the president proclaims national emergency as authorized by some other statute19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33276crs5 19 continued to the congress and published in the federal register 20 50 usc 1621b 21 s rep 941168 supra note 16 at 5 22 id the house committee on the judiciary again reached similar conclusion see hr rep 94238 at 56 subsection b limits the effectiveness of provisions of law to be exercised during national emergency to periods when presidents declaration of national emergency is in effect and then only in accord ance with the balance of the provisions of the bill this latter provision has particular reference to the provisions of section 301 which requires that the president specify the provisi ons of law he will utilize or under which other officers of the government will act 23 50

201b of the nea furthe r provides in relevant part any provisions of law conferring power s and authorities to be exercised during national emergency shall be effective and remain in effect 1 only when the president in accordance with subsection of this section specifically declares national emergency and 2 only in accordance with this chapter20 the senate committee on government opera tions maintained that section 201b establishes that the statutes granting powers to the president during national emergency shall have effect only during times the president has declared national emergency and then only if he has acted in accordance with the provisions of the act21 the committee also observed that th stipulation in section 201b has particular reference to the provisions of section 301 which require that the president specify the laws he or other officers will utilize22 both the language of section 201b nd the legislative history of the nea appear to support the position that declara tion of national emergency must be issued in accordance with the nea to be effectiv section 201a of the nea requires declaration to be transmitted immediatel to the congress and published in the federal register section 301 requires the president to sp ecify the provisions of law under which he proposes that he or other officers will act23 section 301 also states that such specification may be made either in the declaration of national emergency or in subsequent executive orders24 although the presidents september 8 2005 proclamation did not mention the nea and was not identified as declarati on it seems possible to have argued that the proclamation did comply with the neas requirements25 the proclamation stated that conditions caused by hurricane katrina constitute national emergencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33276crs6 26 proclamation 7924 supra note 1 27 see hr doc 10955 2005 151 cong rec s9831 daily ed sept 8 2005 report on the suspension of subchapter iv of chapter 31

as the provision of law under which the president proposed to act28 thus while the proclamation did not follow identically the nguage or structure of other declarations of national emergency under the nea it ppeared to satisfy generally the acts substantive and pro cedural requirements29 if the proclamation was f ound to comply with the neas requirements it seems likely that the statutes other provisions would have become applicable for example section 202b of the nea requi res that each house of congress meet to consider vote on joint resolution to terminate the emergency later than six months after the emergency is declared and within each sixmonth period thereafter during the course of the emergency30 in addition section 202d provides for the termination of national emergency on the anniversary of the declaration of that emergency if within the ninetyday period prior to each anniversary date the president does not publish in the federal register and transmit to the congress notice stating that such emergency is to continue in effect after such anniversary31 thus although section 6 of the davisb acon act does not identify time period or expiration date for suspensions brought under that section the nea would have likely prompted the automatic termination of the suspension if the president did not provide for the extension of the national emergency questions about the termination of th suspension and the relationship between the proclamation and the nea however seemed to disappear following the issuance of second proclama tion on november 3 200532 this second pr oclamation revoked the september 8 2005 proclamation and reimposed the preva iling wage requirements of the davisbacon act and the relate d acts although the september 8 2005 proclamation did not
