developments in the automotive sector consolidation of the american steel industry occurred during and after the period of presidentially termined safeguard relie f from import competition in 200203 it involved the shedding of pensi on and health care lia bilities particularly on the integrated side of the industry but while the domestic steel industry including the integrated steel mills the united steelworkers union uswa and the largely nonunion steel minimills all supported trade relief they were divided among themselves on legacy cost issues these divisions within the industry prevented it from developing an agreed position on legacy cost legislation consequently when many steel mills went bankrupt pensioners and workers lost companypaid health care and pension benefits

act of 2002 pl 107210 the big three do not face as high ratio of retirees to active workers as the steel industry but they find themselves supporting large number of retirees and health care beneficiaries because of be nefits established and enhanced through several decades of collective bargaining unlike the steel industry total automotive manufacturing employment in the united stat today is about the same as in 1990 not in steady decline however much of the gain in employment has been at internationally owne d assembly plants and their suppliers generally nonunion and frequently outside the midwest auto be lt while the big three have downsized employment by 600000 jobs in north america since the early 1980s unless all sides of the industry including the big th ree the

introduction many congressional offices have expre ssed concerns regarding the october 2005 bankruptcy filing by delphi corpora tion major automotive parts supplier especially regarding the impact on retirees adding to these concerns are the continuing high costs and competitive impact of pension and health care benefits paid by the three large usorigin manufacturers of motor vehicles the big three of general motors gm ford and the chry sler group of daimlerchrysler these costs have contributed to large global 2005 financial loss for gm and large net annual loss for ford in its north amer ican automotive manufacturing operations only chrysler the smallest of the big three managed to earn profit in north america the recent experience of th steel industry with respect to pension and health care legacy costs may influence the ongoing developments in the automotive sector legacy costs is the common term for worker pension and health care benefits that were negotiated in past collective bargaining agreements the issue of legacy costs was major factor in the restructuring of the us steel industry1 the automotive industry is the largest sectoral customer of the steel indus try in north america one commentator has suggested for example as the major unionized automotive manufacturers take aim at legacy costs the gyrations of the steel industry provide road map of how they might reconfigure their i ndustrial relations2 the automotive industry seeks to reduce legacy costs the largest usbased automotive part s manufacturer phi corporation on october 8 2005 filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code delphi was spun off from general motors gm in 1999 it includes wide range of partsmaking operations in th united states and abroad although

coverage tax credit authorized by the trade act by julie stone and bob lyke s 329 has been introduced in the 109th congress by sens rockefeller and leahy to provide all retiree beneficiaries with health care coverage with secured claim under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy codesome members of congress have become increasingly concerned that these developments presage termination by the domestic motor vehicle manufacturing industry of responsibilities for legacy cost s under collective bargaining agreements number of commentators have drawn attention to paralle ls with industries such as airlines and steel particularly the latter in which management has used the bankruptcy process in order to shed legacy costs and to force unions to accept streamlined and downsized workforces19 pension liabilities that were formerly the responsibility of these private sector compan ies have been taken over by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc an entity chartered by congress that insures qualifying private sector pension funds pb gc calculates that as of the end of its 2005 fiscal year its net deficit of lia bilities over assets wa s approximately 23 billion and that the total underf unding of all insured privat sector pension plans was 450 billion20 moreover the maximum pension benefits insured by pbgc are frequently less generous than the benefits guaranteed in the corporate plans that pbgc takes over from the retirees point of view that is still better than the case for private health care plans for which there is similar federal guarantee plan participants have ssentially lost such coverage in bankruptcies though they may receive assistance if their coverage is from prefunded health care plans see below retirees may also qualify for partial fe deral reimbursement of coverage under qualified plan thr ough the tax code21 comparing steel and automotive legacy costs the ratio of retirees to active workers wa s much higher in the steel industry at the peak of its financial di stress after 2000 than it is in the automotive industry today in terms of numbers of indivi duals affected by loss of or changes in coverage caused by companies economic circumstances the bankruptcies of three of the largest integrated us steelmaking companies bethlehem ltv and national steel in 200103 led to the loss of corporate pensions and health care coverage of about 200000 retirees compared to about 30000 active employees at those three companies leo gerard president of the united steelworkers union estimated that total of about 600000 retirees received re

in health care costs burden gm by 4 billion ceo says detroit free press feb 11 2005comparison after declining by 50000 ove r ten years the total number of steelworkers at integrated works and minimills was less than 125000 in 200222 the automotive industry as whole has not seen such decline in employment total employment in the industry in cluding the manufacture of parts and components plus heavy trucks and bodi was more than one million in 1990 and was still more than million in 200523 however the structure of that employment has changed the deintegration of the traditional big three automotive manufacturers gm ford and chrysler meant that those companies shed more than 600000 jobs after 1980 some of those jobs were transferred to gm and fords spunoff parts makers princi pally delphi and visteon24 as consequence of this reduction of di rect employment by the big three they are moving in the same direction as the steel industry they now provide pension and health care benefits dete rmined by defined benefit contracts negotiated through collective bargaining and support base of retirees and depe ndents that outnumbers the remaining active employees gm by 2004 employed less than 180000 in its us automotive operations ford about 110000 and the chrysler group about 80000 total of 370000 active big three employees the automotive trade policy council atpc joint big three repres entative organization calculated in 2004 that its members supported more than 800000 re tirees thus the total potential claims of automotive industry pension f unds on pbgc would be much greater than all the liabilities pbgc has assumed to date atpc also calculated that its member companies spent approximately 10 billion annually on employee and retiree health care more than half of that by gm alone in widely publicized statemen t gm ceo g richard wagoner has noted that each of his companys vehicles produ ced in north america includes an average cost of 1525 in health care benefits and asserted that gm is the worlds largest private provider of health care benefits25 delphi has lower ratio of active employees to retirees than its former parent according to information from pbgc 75000 delphi employees are in pbgc insured pension funds including 13000 retirees who have retired from delphi since it was created in 2000 pbgc has calcula ted the estimated ter mination liability of the delphi pension plan total liab ility would be 108 billion of which 41 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33169crs8 26 data from crs interviews with pbgc deput director vincent snowbarger oct 1920 2005 confirming liability estimates reported in bill to boost us pension agency meets resistance by businesses wall st journal oct 17 2005 p a2 27 the shares of pension liability attributable to pbgc gm and delphi in case of potential termination of the delphi pension pl an and the conditions under which gm retains liability for beneficiaries are complex subj ects and are still subject to litigation see for example delphis miller rethinks divisive rhetoric detroit news auto insider oct 28 2005 28 quotations from richard truett delphis first prospectus foreshadowed problems automotive news oct 24 2005 p 17would be the amount covered by pbgc26 the responsibility for the balance per agreement between gm and the unions when delphi was estab lished may revert to gm thus adding to gms own overall pe nsion liability this amount could include some responsibility for delphi retirees hea lth care currently and in the future27 although gm is not bankrupt and still s strong cash balance position despite recent losses these responsibilities would add to its already considerable legacy cost burden delphis ability to bear the burden of high and ongoing legacy costs has been considered by the company to be key competitiveness issue from its very beginning for example 2005 automotive news article quoted from delphis original prospectus of 1999 substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to meet our pension funding obligations as result of these and certain other obligations our liquidity position may be adversely affected if we fail to meet our expected cash flow from operations while such disclaimers might be considered as routine in corporate prospectus the article goes on to note that in this case it proved prophetic in press conference on the bankruptcy f iling ceo m iller emphasize d declining revenue from its former parent gms d eclining light vehicle market share and production volumes he concluded the impact on delphi has been to reduce revenues by several billion dollars year worth of parts given our high fi xed costs and inflexible labor costs the result has been devastating28 thus while the number of retirees directly affected in the delphi filing does not approach the levels seen in the steel industry bankruptcies after 2000 how legacy cost issues for retirees and continuing empl oyees are to be resolved is important both in the development of bankruptcy reorga nization plan either through collective bargaining or through the judicial process furthermore legacy costs affecting both retirees and current employees will likely be an issue for the big three automotive companies particularly ford and gm arising from the former partsmaking affiliates pension and health care plans in this respect there are

later began producing cars at the same location in ohio on the blishment of the socalled transplants see crs report rl32883 us automotive industry policy overview and recent history by stephen cooney and brent d yacobuccicompetitive splits in the automotive and steel sectors both the steel industry and the automotiv industries in the united states are bifurcated in manner that indicates sharply different perspectives on legacy cost issues the nature and sources of the bifurcation are different in the two cases however the us steel industry is divi ded between integrated steel mills which produce steel from iron ore and other input s in basic oxygen furnaces and minimills which produce steel primarily from remelted ferrous scrap in electric arc furnaces each of the different technol ogical sides of the industry presently produce about half of the total us annual production of about 110 million tons of steel output each year the minimills have been gaining share however and after 2000 overtook the older integrated side of the industry as the main domestic producer of steel the minimills led by nucor by far th largest of the minimill producers tend to be nonunion operations mostly located in states or regions that are not traditional steelproducing areas such as arkansas and south carolina the integrated mills today are concentrated in the great lakes region particularly northwest indiana and maintain production in ohio pennsylvania michigan ma ryland west virginia and downstate illinois across from st louis since utahs geneva steel shut down in 2002 integrated steel mills are located west of the mississippi river all of the integrated mills are organized by unions primarily the united steelworkers uswa29 this split parallels that in the automo tive industry between the traditional big three assembly plant operators which in the 1950s produced virtually all of the volume car production in the united states and the internationa lly based operators which began building plants in the united states after us political and diplomatic pressure led japanese companies to begin doing so in the early 1980s30 the big three assembly plants and concomitantly their affilia ted and unaffilia ted supplier operations not coincidentally ar concentrated in the same part of the country as the integrated steel mills socalled auto belt of midwestern states around the great lakes all big three assembly plants spunoff and formerly affiliated supplier operations and many independe nt parts plants in this region are represented by organized labor by contrast the major japaneseowned manufacturers later joined by german and korean companies have opened their us assembly plants in the south with the notable exceptions of two honda assembly plants in ohio toyota

yacobucci fig 9southwest indiana and an early toyota gm joint venture plant in california virtually none of the intern ationally owned ssembly plants are unionorganized31 many of their suppliers are also foreign investors in the united states some are affiliated companies that have invested in the united states such as denso and aisin seiki both controlled by toyota and part of its keiretsu others are independent companies such as robert bosch faur ecia and siemens vdo many of these operations are also southernbased and nonunion32 the preference by foreign companies for locations outside the traditional auto belt is shifting the geographical focus of th auto parts industry while noting that it remains centered in the midwest economist thomas klier of the federal reserve bank of chicago calculates that the location of new assembly plants in the south has tended to shift the supplier industry also in that direction for both the big three and the foreignowned companies for ex ample his model posits that if gm had located its new saturn assembly plant in michigan instead of spring hill tennessee there would have been 42 more supplier plants located in the michiganindianaohio auto belt and 37 fewer such plants in tennessee and neighboring southern states similarly if bmw had located its new plant in michigan instead of near spartanburg south carolina about two dozen new supplier plants would have opened in the three auto belt states klier calculates instead of states in the south33 while the division in the structure of the steel industry is based on technology all the automotive manufacturers are essen tially producing the sa type of products passenger cars and light trucks in the same way assembly line methods using parts and components brought in by truck from more or less remote locations the key differences between the two sides of the domestic us automotive industry can be summarized as ownership the automotive industry unlike the steel industry is split between the traditional big three all of which have their roots as us companies and the fo reignbased manuf acturers all of which started by exporting cars to the united states and which continue to supply about half their sales through imports34 this difference remains significant notwithstanding the fact that one of the big three the chrysler group is now owned by

are foreignowned but this is recent development and the location of ownership appears to have played systematic role in the policy perspectives of the two sides of the industry35 labor relations as noted above all of the big three operations and many of their suppliers ar unionized the international automotive manufacturers and many of their suppliers are not this difference does parallel an impor tant distinction between the unionized integrated steel mills and the generally nonunion minimills geographical focus the big three and their suppliers are concentrated in the industrial midwest and neighboring ontario in part this is because plant closures have been subject of collective bargaining and also because most suppliers to an assembly plant are now located within about 400 miles one days truck drive by interstate highway of the plant36 similarly the integrated steel industry is now mo stly located in states surrounding the great lakes while the minimill side of the industry is spread more widely around the country it has been suggested that minimills should be called market mills because they can be located anywhere near the ultimate consumer product focus the steel industry is increasingly divided on product basis with the integrat ed mills focused largely on high quality sheet products especially as used in automotive products and appliances and the minimills fo cused more on long products especially those used in cons truction mineral exploration and development and specialized industr ial activities in contrast both the big three and the foreig nbased auto manufacturers now produce across the full range of light vehicles sold in the american market from passenger cars to minivans sports utility vehicles and pickup trucks however fore ignbased

especially mercedes benz and bmw they now outsell the big three in these products while the big thr ee still dominate in sales of suvs and other truckbased vehicles this difference while it has seriously affected relative market performance has not so far led to radically different positions within the automotive industry on fuel economy policy issues in summary the key issue within th steel industry that may provide an instructive parallel to the po licy perspectives within the automotive industry is the division based on labor relations and to some extent geographical diversity the big three including many of their suppliers and integrated steel mill companies have unionized workforces based largely in the industrial midwest newer competitors the steel minimills and foreignowned automotive manufacturers are largely non union focused on flexible manufacturin g approaches and with production locations in states spread around the count ry but whereas the automotive industry is split between the traditional big three ma nufacturers all domestic in origin and foreignbased companies fo reign and domestic companie s are on both sides of the division in the steel industry between integrated producers and the minimills seeking consensus on legacy costs lessons from the steel industry the american steel industry in 200103 succeeded in reaching consensus on how to deal with the economic threat pos ed by rising imports during period of domestic overcapacity and low demand while policy consensus was never absolute integrated steel mill companies minimill operators and unions together asked for trade remedies under section 201 of the 1974 trade act representatives of these parties tes tified in favor of trade remedy action under this law before the us international trade commission i tc had support from some members of congress in the process and succe ssfully lobbied for executive action37 there was such unity within the steel industry on the issue of legacy costs as imports increased and the domestic st eel industry foundered financially after 1998 the uswa supported comprehensiv legislation known as the steel revitalization act hr 808 in the 107th congress this bill among other proposed measures would have created governmentmanaged health care and pension systems financed by tonnage surcharge on all steel sold in the united states domestically produced or imported the measure would have relieved the domestic integrated mills of legacy cost s but the measure was never endorsed by the american iron and steel institute re presenting both integrated producers and minimills it was opposed by the steel manufacturers association smahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33169crs13 38 details of these legislative proposals and positions are discussed in

failed to gain the necessary support of majority of house members38 in 1999 congress approved the emergency steel loan guarantee program pl 10651 loans guaranteed under this prog ram could be used to bolster pension funds and pay health care costs but in practice the steel an guarantee program did not play major role in alleviating fi nancial difficulties in the steel industry in total three loan guarantees were taken up primarily by two of the smaller integrated producers geneva steel and wh eelingpittsburgh one of the beneficiaries geneva nevertheless ceased operations and was li quidated the program was extended and modified in later legislation but efforts were not ccessful to increase the use of guarantees by liberalizing the conditions under which they are authorized such efforts were generally opposed by the sma39 congressional action to pr ovide relief beyond pbgc pension plan takeovers in response to loss of benefits by steel i ndustry retirees consiste d of measure added to the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 this provides health coverage tax credit hctc equal to 65 of the cost of the premium for participating in qualified health care plan available to persons who receive their pension from the pbgc or others who receive trade adjustment act assistance40 study by private research body suggests that about 22 of eligible persons may actually be receiving the hctc not counting people who are disqua lified because they have medicare or other coverage such as through their spouse41 regardless of whether they are eligible for the hctc retirees who lose their health insurance also lose employer paid prescription drug benef its that often are more generous than any alternative coverage they can acquire including the new medicare prescripti on drug benefit that started in 2006 the lesson that may be drawn from this history for those concerned with legacy costs in the automotive industry is that unified industry position on any plan will likely be necessary to resolve this issue if the industry is to seek any government guarantees or assistance this means in itially the full support of the big three the uaw and other unions it may also mean the acquiescence if not the active support of the foreignowned manufacturers in th united states and their representativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33169crs14 42 crs report rl32883 us automotive industry

belt and are critical to those states economies furthe rmore the spread of automotive plants to these states suggests that generating congressional consensus on how to deal with the legacy cost issue may be difficult as seen with the issue of steel legacy costs an approach to the automotive legacy issue that does not address the different perspectives of all parts of the automo tive manufacturing industry as it presently exists today in the united states is unlikely to succeed congressional options on automotive legacy costs as mentioned above in th late 1970s and early 1980s the big three and the uaw sought to gain relief from the rising competitive force of imports through number of legislative and regulatory po licy actions these included an unsuccessful effort to win safeguard trade relief congressionally approved loan guarantee that helped save chrysler corporation from bankruptcy and voluntary restriction on cars exported to the united states from japa n by the late 1980s the big three were again profitable and the interest in such measures mixing trade and industrial policy dissipated in the 1990s the clinton adminis tration tried to fo rce japan to open its automotive parts market threatening to retaliate against japanese luxury car exports to the united states and did achieve japanese commitment to alter certain policies44 at the present time there are legislativ

issue has not taken the form of specific legislative proposal an editorial in the industry weekly automotive news asserted because of the health care cost trauma in detroit catastrophicclaims pool underwritten by the government might be good first step57 legacy costs and the issue of moral hazard overlaying these considerations regarding defined benefit legacy costs as presented in lengthy analysis in the new york times is the question of moral hazard which means that insurance against loss encourages more risktaking than would otherwise occur the term b ecame familiar during the 1980s in financial crises such as foreign government debt problems and as the author of the times article writes foolish risks taken by sls of that era in part because their deposits were insured he continued given that pension promises do not come due for years it is hardly surprising that corporate executives and state legislators have found it easier to pay off unions with benefits tomorrow rather than with wages today since the benefits were insured in the case of pensions union leaders did not much care if the obligations proved excessive during the previous decade especially when it seemed that every pension promise could be fulfilled by rising stock market employers either recklessly overpromised or recklessly underprovided or both for the commitments they made58 on the other hand such view may s eem unduly harsh in that workers often accepted the security of define d benefit promises pensions and lifetime health care as part of deal involving voluntary ear ly retirement layoffs and downsizing in industries and companies that needed fewe r and fewer workers per unit of output or faced increased competitive pressures as in steel so now in motor vehicles congress may reconsider the public sector role in determining whether the promises made as part of these legacy costs are kept
