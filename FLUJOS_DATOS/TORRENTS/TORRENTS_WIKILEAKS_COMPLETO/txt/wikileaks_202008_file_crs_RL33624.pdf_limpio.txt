been reduced from 02 of funds appropriated under section 9 to 013 this reduced percentage reflects the fact that two freely associated states fassmicronesia and the marshall islandsare longer eligible for perkins funding because the united states and these fass have signed an agreement to extend their compacts of free association 6 in addition pl 109270 increases the amount of direct grants to outlying areas section 115 under perkins iii guam received direct grant of 500000 and american samoa and the northern marianas each received direct grants of 190000 remaining funds were then distributed to the pacific regional educational laboratory prel which would make grants to these three outlying areas and to eligible fass under current law direct grants are 660000 for guam and 350000 each for american samoa and the northern marianas for the first fiscal year after the enactment of perkins iv fy2007 the secretary distributes remaining funds to prel as before in subsequent years remaining funds are divided equally among the three outlying areas finally palau receives direct grant of 160000 for as long as it is eligible for perkins funding as table 2 illustrates the percentage reserved for assistance for indians and native hawaiians under section 116 has not changed however the reservation for incentive grants has been 5 currently outlying areas receiving f unds under this provision are american samoa guam the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and the republic of palau palau will cease to be eligible for perkins funding when it enters into an

allotted to states based on the formula detailed in section 111 the underlying formula is identical in perkins iii and perkins iv funds are initially allotted based on three population groups population ages 15 to 19 20 to 24 and 25 to 65 7 these initial allotments are adjusted by states per capita income pci such that states with below average pcis tend to receive somewhat increased grants and those with above average pcis tend to receive somewhat decreased grants perkins iv maintains the state allotment formula used under perkins iii unless additional funds are available above the fy2006 funding level if funding allotted to states contains additional funds the formula is unchanged that is the initial formula factors are applied subject to the minimum grant provisions and to the provision that holds states harmless at 100 of their fy1998 grant amount 8 assuming appropriations are leve l funded at the fy2006 amount states with growing populations such as arizona and north carolina will tend to receive increased grants states at their fy1998 grant amounts such as vermont and wyoming will continue to receive those grant amounts9 other states grants will tend to decline as funding shifts to states with more rapidly growing populations pl 109270 modifies the state allotment formula when there are additional funds above the amount allotted to states for fy2006 additional funds are defined as amounts in excess of funds allotted to states for fy2006 plus the amount setaside for incentive grants for fy2006 and 827671 these additions to the amount allotted to states in the base year ensure that funds previously reserved for incentive grants and funds previously reserved for outlying areas longer eligible for funding the specified dollar amount are not considered additional funds which trigger the formula changes discussed below 10 table 3 illustrates how additional funds would be calculated assuming 1 overall increase in fy2006 appropriations under section 9 first the fy 2006 state grant amount would be calculated by subtracting the setasides from the total appropriation 1182 billion minus 265 million 1156 billion which was the amount allotted by formula to states for fy2006 next the amount 7 each population group is weighted in the formula with the 1519 age group r eceiving the largest weight 8 for detail discussion of the state formula under perkins iii see crs report rl33419 vocational education state grant formula under current law and reauthorization issues by rebecca r skinner and richard n apling 9 if funding drops below the fy1998 amount allotted to states approximately 1 billion state grants will be ratably reduced ie all grants will be reduced by the same proportion 10 the calculation to determine the amount of additional funds available is complicated by two factors first beginning in fy2007 funding for incentive grants will longer be setaside funds that would have been setaside in previous years will be distributed through the basic state grant formula thus to avoid having the additional funding available for state grants as result of the elimination of the incentive grants be considered additional funds this amount must be added to the fy2006 base that must be ex ceeded to trigger the new formula the change to the percentage of funding setaside for outlying areas creates similar situation as less funding is needed to support the outlying areas in fy2007 and subsequent years than was needed in fy2006 the excess funds are distributed through the state allotment formula the amount of excess funds 827671 must be added to the fy2006 base that must be exceeded to trigger the new formula thus neither the addition of the incentive grant money nor the excess funding for the outlying areas is considered additional funds

the local level ie to eligible recipients such as local educational agencies leas and community colleges states may reserve up to 10 of the funds distributed to the local level for eligible recipients in rural areas and in areas with high percentages or high numbers of career and technical education students states have complete discretion in how much of local funding is distributed for career and technical education at the secondary level versus postsecondary career and technical education states may reserve up to 5 of their grants or 250000 if that amount is greater for administration of the

132 the act does not change the distribution of funds for eligible postsecondary institutions eg community colleges and consortia of such institutions funds continue to be distributed based on each eligible institutions number of pell grant recipients and recipients of assistance from the bureau of indian affairs for example if an eligible institution accounted for 10 of all such recipients among all eligible institutions in state that institution would receive 10 of the funds the state setaside for postsecondary career and technical education 13 pl 109270 does change the substate formula for distribution of funds for secondary school cte programs although this change should have practical impact under prior law 30 of funds designated for secondary education programs were to be distributed based on school districts shares of resident population ages 15 to 19 and 70 of funds were to be distributed based on shares of individuals ages 15 to 19 from poor families the act permitted the secretary to waive this formula if state could demonstrate that proposed formula more effectively targets funds on the basis of poverty section 131c1 because population and poverty data for the 15 to 19 age group are not available at the school district level the secretary has waived the application of this formula apparently for all states instead the secretary has allowed states to use resident population and poverty data for ages 5 to 17 which is available at the school district level because these data are used to allot grants under title ia of the elementary and secondary education act esea pl 109270 codifies this pr ocedure in law 30 of funds designated for secondary education programs is distributed ba sed on school districts shares of resident 11 the perkins act has other matching requirements 12 see the discussion of state leadership activities for required and permitted uses of these funds 13 this assumes that the grant is at least 50000 which continues to be

perkins iii an independent advisory panel advises the secretary on the evaluation and assessment of cte programs funded under the act perkins iv however includes greater specification of membership on the independent advisory panel16 the contents of the assessment are similar under perkins iii and perkins iv but perkins iv adds additional requirements for example in examining teacher preparation and qualifications it is recommended that this include whether cte faculty meet teacher certification or licensing requirements the evaluation must also consider career and technical education achievement in addition to academic achievement and employment outcomes it must also examine the extent and success of the integration of rigorous and challenging academic and career and technical education and the outcomes of such integration on academic and technical proficiency achievement the assessment must also determine whether cte programs are preparing students for employment in

section the application must include information as required by the secretary as well as information based on trends provided in accordance with section 15 of the wagnerpeyser act18 perkins iv also alters authorized statelevel activities under section 118 for example perkins iii states that designated entities must provide programs to assist individuals to improve career and occupational decision making perkins iv changes the language to students and parents as appropriate possible impact of such changes would be to target occupation and employment information programs rather than to make such programs available to the population in general other changes include an emphasis on preparing relevant staff to provide parents and students with exposure to high skill high wage or high

recipients to meet at least 90 of an adjusted level of performance for each core indicator of performance or be required to write an improvement plan allows the secretary to withhold only state leadership and administrative funds from eligible agencies that fail to make progress or show improvement but longer allows funds withheld to be redistributed to other eligible agencies and permits

perkins iv establishes six explicit core indicators of performance at the secondary level both eligible agencies and eligible recipients are required to establish measures for each of the indicators many of the core indicators of performance included in perkins iv are similar to those required under perkins iii but include several modifications such as establishing links to esea it should be noted that perkins was last reauthorized in 1998 prior to the reauthorization of esea that included the new requirements of the child left behind act under perkins iii eligible agencies were required to include measures of student attainment of challenging state established academic proficiencies in their identification of core indicators of performance the first core indicator of performance under perkins iv must measure student attainment of challenging academic content standards and student academic achievement standards the standards used in this measure must be the ones adopted by the state under title ia of the esea section 1111b1 and b3 student attainment of these standards must be based on the state determined levels of proficiency for assessments required under title ia of the esea in math language arts and beginning with the 20072008 school year science 19 similar to perkins iii the second core indicator of performance must measure student attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies unlike perkins iii however it does not require the student attainment of challenging career and technical skill proficiencies perkins iv specifies however that measures of student attainment may include student achievement on technical assessments that are aligned with industryrecognized standards if such assessments are available and relevant the third core indicator of performance is also similar to an indicator included in perkins iii eligible agencies must measure student rates of attainment of secondary school diploma they must also measure student rates of attainme nt of general education development ged credential or state recognized equivalent for high school diploma including alternative standards for individuals with disabilities states must also measure student rates of attainment of proficiency credential certificate or degree in conjunction with secondary school diploma if the state makes this option available to students based on the most recent performance data available only 17 states offered the latter option to students 20 the fourth core indicator of performance requires eligible agencies to measure student graduation rates as required under title ia of the esea under the esea graduation rates for secondary students are defined as the percentage of students who graduate from secondary school with regular diploma in the standard number of years section 1111b2cvi thus students who take longer than the standard number of years to graduate earn ged in lieu of regular diploma or earn some type of alternative high school diploma would not be counted as graduates under this measure perkins iii did not include similar core indicator of performance the last two core indicators of performance are nearly identical to those included in perkins iii the eligible agency must measure student placement in postsecondary education or advanced 19 for more information about the testing requirements under title ia of the

perkins iv includes five core indicators of performance at the postsecondary level both eligible agencies and eligible recipients are required to establish measures for each of the indicators several of the core indicators of performance included in perkins iv are similar to those required under perkins iii similar to perkins iii the first core indicator of performance must measure student attainment of challenging career and technical skill proficiencies perkins iv specifies however that measures of this attainment may include student achievement on technical assessments that are aligned with industryrecognized standards if such assessments are available and relevant 23 the second and third core indicators of performance focus on completion and retention at the postsecondary level the second core indicator of performance requires measures of student attainment of an industryrecognized credential certificate or degree the third core indicator of performance requires measures of student retention in postsecondary education or transfer to bachelors degree program while perkins iii addressed completion and retention it was not as specific as perkins iv for example it did not require measures of student transfers the fourth core indicator of performance similar to perkins iii requires measures of student placement in military service or placement or retention in employment perkins iv adds placement in apprenticeship programs to the required measures it also specifies that measures of employment must include student placement in highskill highwage or highdemand occupations or professions the final core indicator of performance is identical to the final core indicator of performance at the secondary level eligible agencies and recipients must measure student participation in and completion of cte programs that lead to employment in nontraditional fields 24

levels of performance for each of the core indicators for which they will be held responsible for eligible agencies this process is essentially identical to the process used under perkins iii based on input from eligible recipients the eligible agency establishes levels of performance for each of the core indicators in its state plan the eligible agency then negotiates adjusted levels of performance for the core 21 the core indicator of performance under perkins iii also required measures of completion or retention these have been included under the core indicators of performance at the postsecondary level under perkins iv 22 the core indicator of performance under perkins iii referred to nontraditional training and employment perkins iv now refers to this as nontraditional fields 23 this indicator is nearly identical to core indicator of performance for the secondary level except that at the secondary level attainment of challenging career and technical skill proficiencies is not required 24 the core indicator of performance under perkins iii referred to nontraditional training and employment perkins iv now refers to nontraditional fields

under perkins iv if state fails to meet at least 90 of an adjusted level of performance for any of the core indicators it is required to develop and implement program improvement plan this plan must give special consideration to performance gaps identified among categories of students perkins iii required state to develop and implement program improvement plan if it failed to meet the state adjusted levels of performance in practice this meant that states only had to develop an improvement plan if they missed their adjusted levels of performance in the aggregate eg poor performance in meeting one adjusted level of performance for core indicator could be compensated for by exceeding the adjusted level of performance for another core indicator similar to perkins iii if the secretary determines that an eligible agency is not carrying out its state plan appropriately or is not making substantial progress in meeting the goals of the act as 25 eligible agencies and recipients are not required to disaggregate data for category of students if doing so would reveal personally identifiable information

same core indicator of performance for three consecutive years the secretary may after providing the eligible agency with an opportunity for hearing withhold all or portion of the eligible agencys

meet its state adjusted levels of performance for two or more consecutive years the secretary was also permitted to withhold any funds received by the state under this title including funds th at would otherwise be provided to eligible recipients 26 perkins iv requires that funds withheld from an eligible agency be used only to provide technical assistance assist in the development of an improved state improvement plan or other relevant improvement activities to benefit the state the secretary will longer be permitted to redistribute funds withheld from one eligible agency to other eligible agencies as was possible under perkins iii finally perkins iv retains the exception included in perkins iii that allows the secretary to waive financial sanctions due to exceptional or

under perkins iv the requirements for improvemen t plans and sanctions for eligible recipients are similar to those imposed on eligible agencies if after reviewing the eligible recipients progress in meeting its local adjusted levels of pe rformance the eligible agency determines that the eligible recipient failed to meet at least 90 of an agreed upon local adjusted level for any of the core indicators of performance the eligible recipient will be required to develop and implement program improvement plan the program improvement plan must provide special consideration to performance gaps identified among categories of students under perkins iii if an eligible agency determined that an eligible recipient was not making substantial progress in achieving the state adjusted levels of

the eligible recipients progress in meeting the state adjusted levels of performance under perkins iv eligible agencies are required to provide technical assistance to eligible recipients failing to

been used frequently if at all for program year py2000 through py2004 federal register notices have been published indicating whether states exceeded their adjusted levels of performance for their core indicators of performance across these years only three times did state fail to exceed its adjusted levels of performance for two consecutive years it is not clear whether these states also

to select performance measures most appropriate for meeting their goals27 this resulted in multitude of definitions and measurement strategies across states making statetostate data comparisons virtually impossible28 in response ed awarded grant for the performance measurement initiative project to develop and pilot test new secondary and postsecondary assessment and accountability measures for academic and career and technical programs that build on existing state and local data systems perkins iv contains language that may partially address the data comparability issue it requires that when identifying core indicators of performan ce and other indicators of performance states shall to the extent possible define the indicato rs so that they are aligned with similar data collected for other federal and state programs the usefulness of this requirement however may depend upon how it is implemented by states and interpreted by ed for example if states rely on definitions used within their states and these definitions vary from state to state it may be difficult to obtain comparable data among states the data comparability issue could also be complicated if some states opt to use federal definitions for measures while other states use state definitions that do not match the federal definition as pointed out by ed however if the measures of the core indicators of performance selected by each state were valid and reliable as required by perkins iv it would be possible to make comparisons of an individual states performance from year to year even if the performance of all states could not be compared 29 27 under national activities section 114 the secretary is ch arged to ensure the performance information system is compatible with other federal information systems 28

challenging academic standards and relevant career and technical content in coordinated nonduplicative progression of courses aligning secondary and postsecondary education the programs may also include opportunities for dual or concurrent enrollment or other strategies for students to earn postsecondary credits finally the programs must lead to an industryrecognized credential or certificate at the postsecondary level or an associates or bachelors degree the state plan must also discuss how the state will link cte with requirements included under the esea for example the plan must specify how funds will be used to improve or develop new cte courses that are aligned with student academic achievement standards adopted by the state under the esea section 1111b1 the eligible agency must

as perkins iii with some modifications and adds several new uses of funds section 124 for example eligible agencies will have to use state leadership funds to provide professional development focused on the use of scientifically based research and data to improve instruction professional development must be high quality sustained and intensive and should not be based on oneday or shortterm training sessions in addition professional development programs must support education programs to ensure that teachers and other staff are able to develop higher level of academic and industry knowledge and skills in cte and effectively use applied learning while perkins iv retains many of the same permissible uses of funds as perkins iii there are some notable differences for example perkins iv adds new uses of funds for career guidance and academic counseling facilitating transitions from subbaccalaureate cte programs to baccalaureate degree granting institutions developing assessments of technical skills developing and enhancing data systems and improving the recruitment and retention of cte staff and the transition of individuals from business and industry into cte eligible agencies are also permitted to use state leadership funds to award incentive grants to eligible recipients meeting various criteria such as exceeding local adjusted levels of performance developing connections between secondary and postsecondary education integrating coherent and rigorous content that is aligned with academic standards and technical coursework or having special populations meet local adjusted levels of performance incentive grants may also be awarded to eligible recipients that combine funding with other eligible recipients for innovative initiatives
