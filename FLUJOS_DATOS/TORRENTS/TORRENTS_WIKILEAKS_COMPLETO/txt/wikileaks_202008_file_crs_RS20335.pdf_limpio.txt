industry and trade foreign affairs defense and trade division summary major financial deregulation is underway in japan that could have farreaching implications for usjapan economic relations the process has been accelerating since the socalled big bang announcement by former prime minister hashimoto in november 1996 calling for the realignment of japans financial markets to make them comparable to those of europe and the united states the reform process includes allowing financial institutions to establish holding companies and enter heretofore prohibit ed lines of business it also is expected to open markets to more foreign participation along with the financial services agreement under the world trade organization and bilateral agreements with the united states on liberalizing japans insurance market these measures are expected to open the management of approximately 10 trillion in personal assets in japanese financial markets to us banks brokerage houses and other financial service companies the us treasury has been negotiating with japan on financial deregulation under the usjapan enhanced initiative on deregulation and competition policy this report will be updated as events warrant background japans major financial deregulation began in november 1996 with the socalled big bang proposed by former prime minister hashimoto it was aimed at deregulating japans financial markets to make them comparable to those in europe and the united states by the year 20001 the theme of the big bang has been free fair and global japans financial markets are to become free from excessive government interference fair in the sense that access is to be open and prices determined by market forces and global in the sense that competition is to be international the essence of the big bang is to reduce direct government intervention into the operations of financial markets to eliminate barriers among banks trust banks securities companies and insurance companies to direct regulation more toward providing market information and reducing fraud rather than toward influenc ing specific activities of financial institutions and to subject japanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20335crs2 2 see crs issue brief ib10035 financial service s modernization legislation in the 106th congress by f jean wellsfinancial institutions to more international market pressures the impetus for deregulation was given boost by the asian financial crisis in 199799 the crisis highlighted weaknesses of japanesetype financial systems that had been established in other asian countries and emphasized the need to move toward more marketdetermined financial system throughout the asian region financial deregulation in japan is of interest to the united states because it affects us financial firms and investors and promises to open the management of more personal assets on japanese financial markets to us and other financial services companies the deregulation and market opening if carried out as planned could make more financial opportunities available for us firms japan has pool of individual savings and other financial assets of around 10 trillion larger than the gross domestic product of the united states half of which is now invested in savings accounts that are paying interest of only 1 or 2 per year if more of these assets were invested in us stocks and other assets both the inflow of capital from japan and the us trade deficit may rise this deregulation combined with depressed equity values in japan also has lowered the cost for us companies to acquire or merge with japanese companies in distress the asian financial crisis in 199799 also highlighted the need for more marketb ased decision making in japan and less governance based on intercompany relationships and guidance from government bureaucrats which was successful during most of japans postwar period of rapid economic growth but lacked the flexibility and market discipline required for financial firms to compete in the new global economy japanese financial deregulation parallels deregulation passed by the 106th congress on november 4 1999 grammleachbliley act pl 106102 that significantly modernizes american finance by breaking down barriers among banking brokerage services and insurance sectors2 it also means that japan is abandoning the heart of the financial policy heretofore followed by its finance ministry in which its banks and other financial institutions were considered to be convoy and the stronger ones had to assist weaker members in order to keep them all moving forward together the us treasury along with the us trade representative are pursuing us interests in japans big bang and other financial deregulation through the usjapan enhanced initiative on deregulation and competition policy announced by president clinton and former prime minister hashimoto in june 1997 the two sides meet periodically to negotiate and assess progress being made the rationale behind japans big bang is threefold first tokyo and osaka are falling behind other world financial centers operational costs are high and new product approval has been difficult second many japanese financial institutions have been in serious difficulty several banks and credit unions have been restructured or forced to merge and the banking industry has been grappling with an overhang of nonperforming loans the 199799 asian financial crisis also exacerbated japans financial distress and underlined the extra risks generated when nonmarket criteria were used to allocate financial resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20335crs3 3 previously banks and securities companies were allowed to hold only 5 stake in nonfinancial companies while insurers were allowed 10 stake 4 us trade representative 1998 national trade estimate on internet at httpwww ustrgovreportsnte1998contentshtml p 218221table 1 shows the major elements in japans big bang and other financial deregulation the centerpiece of japans big bang was the financial system reform law which took effect on december 1 1998 rather than new law it actually was set of amendments to existing financial laws some of the major changes in japanese law are to allow financial institutions to establish holding companies3 nonregulated foreign exchange transactions new financial products derivatives investment trusts unregulated brokerage commissions stock trading by bankowned securities companies and insurance sales by both securities companies and banks the ministry of finance has lost considerable authority the bank of japan was given more independence from the ministry and much of the ministrys supervisory and inspection authority was transferred to the financial reconstruction commission and its subsidiary the financial supervisory agency banks engaged in international operations now must meet the 8 capitalasset requirement of the bank for international settlements or undertake prompt corrective actions for japans financial community the changes have been monumental on bilateral basis the united states and japan have long been engaged in market opening negotiations in the financial services sector on february 13 1995 the two nations concluded comprehensive financial services agreement that provided for liberalization of legal and operational constraints that impede access by foreign financial services providers in the areas of asset management corporate securities and crossborder financial transactions according to the us trade representative over the first two years of the agreement the japanese government implemented the vast majority of commitments within the time frames specified in some areas japan had either accelerated the implementation of certain commitm ents or expanded their scope at followup meeting to the agreement in october 1997 however the united states emphasized the need for further improvements in financial disclosure and transparency these concerns were addressed in the december 1998 financial system reform law access to the insurance sector in japan has long been in dispute in usjapan relations japan is the second largest market for insurance in the world but foreign firms account for only 39 of the market as compared to 10 to 33 in other industrialized nations4 in 1994 the united states and japan concluded bilateral insurance agreement that committed japan to enhance regulatory transparency strengthen antitrust enforcement introduce notification system for approval of insurance rates and products and undertake specific liberalization measures the 1994 agreement also contained provision related to mutual entry of life insurers into nonlife insurance markets and of nonlife insurers into life insurance marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20335crs4 table 1 major provisions of japans financial deregulation date measure 1996 prime minister hashimoto announces the big

primary sector insurance deregulation by the ministry of finance these measures also defined the scope of business activities of japanese insurance subsidiaries in the third sector consistent with japans commitment to avoid radical change beginning in july 1998 twoandonehalf year clock began in which japan is to open this third sector of japans insurance market in april 1999 during bilateral consultations the united states raised several concerns about japans administration of its insurance sector these included lack of transparency with respect to government actions potential radical change occurring in the third sector the us side recognized however that the deregulatory steps taken have yielded important results with more foreign firms in the market and an increase in rate and product competition5 the continuing banking crisis in japan also has induced the japanese government to take action to resolve the problem of nonperforming loans of banks under the prompt correction

of the financial system law october 23 1998 financial institutions can request government capital injections by having the governments deposit insurance corporation subscribe to their preferred or

providing opportunities for foreign firms to expand into the japanes financial services market acquire existing japanese companies and obtain faster approval for new products on macroeconomic level the deregulation is likely to encourage net outflows of japanese capital as japanese investors pension fund managers and other capital account managers diversify more of their holdings into foreign assets and as foreign firms take over more of the management of financial assets in japan such net outflows of capital are likely to weaken the yen and increase japans current account surplus trade in

microeconomic level the big bang and other financial deregulation are producing numerous responses by japanese and international financial service providers to prepare for future competition or to move into heretofore prohibited lines of business among japanese financial institutions the combination of the overhang of nonperforming loans financial deregulation and stricter performance standards is causing major bank restructuring the major japanese banks have responded by merging into four large groups mizuho financial group includes daiichi kangyo and fuji banks as well as the industrial bank of japan to form the worlds largest financial holding company with assets of 13 trillion sumitomo and sakura banks are forming another group assets of 900 billion as are the bank of tokyo and mitsubishi bank assets of 635 billion who in 2001 plan to add three trust companies to their group the fourth large group is being formed by merger of the tokai asahi and sanwa banks assets of 970 billion these mergers are reportedly aimed at competing with global banking giants and indicate that japans financial industry is following wave of financial institution consolidation occurring in the united states and europe7 japanese financial authorities seem to be aiming for new banking structure with three levels of banking institutions megabanks or money center banks superregional banks and
