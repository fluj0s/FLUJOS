submitted its recommendations to the entire senate committee on civil service the committee then gave attention to the subject matter and reported favorably bill s1537 eightieth congress but insufficient time was left for the discussion of the matter in the senate and the portion of the bill relating to the topbracket officials was deleted when the measure was passed after months of study

commission in submitting its fy1969 report to president lyndon b johnson on december 2 1968 urged him to bring the matter of the presidents salary to congresss attention the report stated the commissions belief that to preserve equity and balance in the pay structure of government the salary of the president should be changed from 100000 to 200000 13 in 1969 the salary of the president was increased to 200000 per annum when congress passed hr 10 and president johnson signed the bill into law on january 17 1969 14 the salary became effective at noon on january 20 1969 when richard m nixon was sworn in as president with the inauguration of mr nixon set to occur at that time congress needed to consider the legislation expeditiously or any adjustment in the salary would have been delayed at least until noon january 20 1973 on january 3 1969 speaker of the house john mccormack addressed the house and explained the scheduling of hr 10 on the legislative program in the case of the next president of the united states unless something is done with reference to increasing his salary on or before january 20 even if we pass the bill later he could not take advantage of it during his term of office for period of 4 years we are faced with very practical situation here with respect to the organization of the committees this will take time and 12 oclock january 20 is the deadline so if we are going to take any action in connection with an increase in salary for the next president of the united states it has to be done on or before noon of january 20 if we took action 11

advantage of the increase in salary that the congress might provide we feel it is only fair and just this action was initiated by the majority leader and myself in conference with the minority leader and the whip and the chairman of the house committee on post office and civil service and the ranking member of that committee it was decided that every effort should be made to try to put bill through before januar 20 providing for an increase in salary for the president of the united states now next monday is the only suspension day that we could take advantage of so the leadership and i felt that we should do so at this opportunity otherwise in spite of every effort we might make the chances are it would be difficult to get bill through before january 20 15 during consideration of hr 10 on january 6 1969 house majority leader carl albert one of the bills sponsors reiterated the constitutions proviso against sitting presidents salary being increased and emphasized that the legislation was initiated by members of congress and not by the president of the united states we have not asked for recommendation either by the present president or by the incoming president16 when the senate considered the bill on january 15 1969 senator hiram fong stated that he wished we had more time really to discuss the bill because i think the committee on post office and civil service should discuss it thoroughly17 majority leader mike mansfield responded that he agreed and then stated but as the senator knows we are stymied because following the traditions precedents and customs of the senate we could not take up proposed legislation for consideration until after the president had delivered his state of the union message 18
