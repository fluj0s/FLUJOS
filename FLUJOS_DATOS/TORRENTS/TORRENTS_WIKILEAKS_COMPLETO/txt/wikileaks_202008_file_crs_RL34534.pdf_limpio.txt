presidential public campaign financing program is funded through checkoff designations on individual income tax returns choosing to partic ipate or not in the checkoff does not affect ones tax liability or refund candidates who choose to participate may receive taxpayerfunded matches of privately raised funds during primary campaigns and grants during the general election contest public funds also subsidize nominating conventions the public financing system has remained largely unchanged since the 1970s however there is general agreement that if the program is to be maintained updates are necessary to provide greater financial resources and higher spending limits to participants this report discusses current controversies and arguments for and against public financing of presidential campaigns legislative history elements of the program taxpayer and candidate participation financial status of the program current legislation and analysis of various policy proposals if congress chooses to alter the program consensus will be necessary in what has historically been particularly complex and contentious area of campaign finance policy four bills introduced in the 110 th congress hr 776 s 436 hr 4294 and s 2412 would update the program those bills which are substantially similar would greatly increase the financial resources available to candidates particularly through escape hatch provisions designed to allow candidates to respond to highspending opponents that feature does not currently exist overall under the proposed increases publicly financed candidates could spend as much as 450 million compared with approximately 126 million today plus approximately 14 million in exempt fundraising legal and accounting costs part of the increased benefits to participants would be funded by increasing the checkoff designation from 3 for individuals to 10 and from 6 to 20 for married couples filing jointly it is unclear how taxpayers would respond to this change particularly because the effects of proposed public education program cannot be predicted taxpayer participation in public financing declined the only previous time that congress increased the checkoff amount but the higher designation amounts nonetheless substantially raised the balance in the presidential election campaign fund at least in the short term finally two bills hr 72 and hr 484 would curtail part or all of the public financing program these approaches are likely to be attractive to those who believe that public financing is unnecessary an improper use of taxpayer resources or both however removing the option of public subsidies would leave presidential candidates entirely dependent upon private donations or personal resources as this report discusses various options each with potential strengths and weaknesses exist for revisiting the presidential public financing system this report will be updated as events warrant

presidential public financing has been to reduce the need for private money in politics1 public financing proponents argue that the program has increased competition in presidential elections by permitting those without personal wealth or substantial private fundraising resources to seek the office2 public financing therefore relieves candidates from at least some of the burdens of timec onsuming private fundraising finally public financing is attractive to some because it can encourage candidates to limit their campaign spending in exchange for public subsidies nonetheless even those who support the presidential public financing program generally agree that it needs to be updated before the 2012 elections3 except for increasing the checkoff amount in 1993 congress has essentially left the program unchanged since its enactment in 1971 many of the concerns surrounding public financing highlight financial competitiveness among candidates as this report discusses publicly financed candidates must adhere to spending limits unlike their privately financed opponents those limits however are increasingly regarded as too low to permit effective campaigning since 2000 some major candidates have chosen to forgo public financing during the primary campaign the 2008 campaign cycle is regarded as perhaps the final one in which the program as it currently stands will remain viable option for the most competitive candidates as one scholar has noted by 2008 it was clear that the public financing system with its relatively paltry spending limits was luxury serious candidate could afford at least in the primary season 4 nonetheless and despite that sentiment several candidates chose to participate in public financing during the 2008 election cycle the eventual republican nominee senator john mccain initially applied for public funds in the primary but later withdrew from the system senator mccain will however receive public funds for the general election5 the democratic nominee senator barack obama announced in june 2008 that he would not participate in public financing for the general election he also did not 1 this report supercedes crs report rl32786

majorparty nominee since the programs 1976 inception to decline public financing for the general election although much of the recent debate over public financing has focused on how to save the system some suggest that congress should end the program for those who oppose presidential public financing the declining taxpayer participation rate discussed later in this report provides evidence that the program lacks public support opponents also contend that the program has failed to improve competition 7 some also object in principle to governmentfunded campaign subsidies question whether truly competitive candidates need public financing or both8 finally the federal election commission fec was unable to administer parts of the public financing program between january and june 20089 due to senate stalemate over nominations to the commission in january 2008 the agency lost the quorum required to make most policy decisions that included certifying candidates eligibility to receive primary matching funds or generalelection grants convention grants were certified before the commission lost its quorum the commission was also unable to cons ider enforcement actions or advisoryopinion requests related to public financing on june 24 2008 however the senate confirmed five nominees to the fec 10 those five will join sixth commissioner who had remained in office the commission now stands at full operating strength g4g155g146g142g143g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 despite calls for publicly financed presidential campaigns early in the 20th century congress did not actively consider the idea until the 1950s in 1966 congress first enacted legislation authorizing taxpayer support for presidential and vicepresidential candidates and political parties however legislation enacted the following year essentially terminated the original program before it took effect11 the current presidential public financing system was established in the 1971 revenue act which permitted individual taxpayers except nonresident aliens to designate 1 2 for married couples filing jointly to the presidential election campaign fund pecf12 amounts in the pecf are diverted from the treasurys general fund for use by qualified presidential candidates or party nominating conventions although congress enacted the program in 1971 due to

beginning checkoff designations13 candidates did not begin receiving funds until the 1976 election cycle the federal election campaign act feca acted in 1971 and amended throughout the 1970s expanded the scope of the public financing program and set various criteria for participation14 in particular the 1974 feca amendments extended public financing originally reserved only for generalelection candidates to presidential primaries and nominating conventions the 1974 amendments also established the fec and charged the agency with certifying eligible candidates authorizing payments from the pecf and conducting audits related to public financing despite relatively minor changes the presidential public financing program has essentially remained unchanged since the 1974 feca amendments 15 congress most recently altered the program in 1993 when it tripled the checkoff designation from 1 to 3 for individuals and from 2 to 6 for married couples filing jointly 16 the 2002 bipartisan campaign reform act bcra the most recent major change to the nations campaign finance laws did not affect public financing17

constitutional challenges to feca the court upheld spending limits associated with public financing because candidates voluntarily accept the limitations in exchange for receiving taxpayer support

in 2008 plus approximately 14 million in fundraising legal and accounting costs which are exempt from the base spending limit but the amount of funds participants receive depends on their ability to secure government matching payments based on private fundraising participating candidates individual contributions of up to 250 may be matched at rate of 100 each for example privately raised contribution of 200 would be matched for 200 bringing the candidates total receipt of funds to 400 on the other hand contributions of more than 250 are matched only for the first 250 30 for example contribution of 1000 would only be eligible for 250 in matching funds31 the primary matching fund program which was designed to magnify small donations applies only to individual contributions pac or

individual contributions of more than 250 each in at least 20 states32 if they choose to participate the democratic and republican nominees are automatically eligible for public financing in the general election nominees of third parties called minor parties in feca whose candidates earned at least 5 of th popular vote in the previous general election are eligible for lesser amounts than

convention grants and generalelection grants shortfalls in primary matching funds occurred in 1996 and 200041 shortfall also occurred briefly in 2004 but major shortfalls were avoided as eventual

the balance in the pecf appears to be sufficient to cover current obligations but the fact that one candidate has chosen not to accept the generalelection grant provides the fund with substantially more money than it would have otherwise even with sufficient resources to cover current obligations shortfalls occurred previously during the 2008 cycle additional discussion appears below in december 2007 the fec projected that the approximately 1662 million balance in the pecf as of november 30 2007 would be insufficient to permit matching payments scheduled to begin in january 2008 43 by the spring of 2008 however the pecf had accumulated sufficient balance to permit matching fund payments although the fec was unable to certify matching funds between january and june 2008 the commission certified an additional 74 million in primary matching funds in july 2008 according to treasury department data as of september 11 2008 the pecf balance was approximately 1071 million44 that amount is more than sufficient to cover remaining pecf obligations for the 2008 election cycle apparently now limited to relatively small primary matchingfund payments if however both major candidates had accepted public funds for the general election the amount available in the pecf would have declined substantially45 in particular the additional 841 million generalelection grant would bring the available pecf balance to approximately 230 million therefore if candidates had more fully participated in the public financing program or if they did so under the current structure in 2012 the pecf balance may have been or may be insufficient to meet the funds obligations these circumstances suggest that if the presidential public financing program is not altered before 2012and if candidates choose to participate in the program during the primary and the general and assuming that taxpayer designations remain near current levelsshortfalls could be continuing challenge 41 for additional

matchingfund payments during primariesa critical time for candidates to establish their viability and recognition among the electorate generalelection subsidies are also concern although generally not viewed as pressing as primary funds regardless of the phase of the election higher balance in the pecf could facilitate higher spending by candidates provided that congress raised spending limits

an increased checkoff amount would affect the pecf the one previous increase in the checkoff amount did not result in greater taxpayer participation in public financing rather the checkoff rate fell

amount did substantially bolster the fund balance as shown in table 3 and figure 3 the fund balance grew from approximately 41 million in 1992 the final year of the 1 checkoff to more than 308 million in 1993 the first year of the 3 checkoff decreases in the fund balance are to be expected during election years when most disbursements are made thereby depleting much of the balance however the percent increase in the fund balance between 1992 and 1993 was far more than in the increase in the postelection years that preceded the checkoff increase 1977 1981 1985 and 1989 the median percent increase in the fund balance between those years and those that preceded them was 565 compared with an increase of more than 650 between 1992 and 1993 49 even with that infusion of funds and as is typical the fund balance decreased sharply during the 1996 election cycle overall the 1993 change suggests that if taxpayers respond as they did when congress last raised the checkoff amount the participation rate will fall if congress raises the amount again as noted elsewhere in this report in 2006 109 of taxpayers made designations although the 2007 checkoff percentage is not yet available decline from the 2006 rate commensurate with the 44 point percentage drop in 1993 suggests that fewe r than 10 of taxpayers 65 would make designations to the pecf if the checkoff amount is increased however the designations that do occur because of the higher dollar amounts could nonetheless increase the amount of money in the pecf it should also be noted that the proposed public education campaign could either encourage or discourage participation

raise at least 5000 in contributions of 250 or less in 20 states for total of 100000 by contrast hr 776 s 436 hr 4294 and s 2412 would require candidates to raise at least 500000 to qualify for matching funds the 20state threshold would be maintained although the matchingfund amount would decrease from 250 to 200 those requirements would make it harder for some but not most candidates who have recently met the primary qualifying criteria to do so again as shown in table 2 above the fec certified only two candidates duncan hunter and dennis kucinich for matching funds in amounts less than 500000 in 2007 in the entire 2004 cycle only one candidate alfred c sharpton was certified for less than 50000050 this suggests that increasing the qualifying threshold to 500000 would not have had great effect on the number of publicly financed candidates during the current and immediate past presidential elec tion cycles assuming that those candidates could meet the higher statebystate fundraising th resholds 25000 instead of 5000 raising the qualifying threshold to 500000 also would not prevent any candidates from receiving public funds if those candidates were able to meet the qualifying criteria indeed candidates who could meet the new criteria would receive more matching funds than they do currently however increasing the qualifying threshold could preserve some money in the pecf at least until candidates met the new criteria assuming they could do so of course congress could consider other options to increase qualifying criteria beyond those envisioned in the current system or the legislation introduced in the 110 th congress this assumes however that congress wishes to limit the number of candidates who may receive public funds to preserve money in the fund or for other reasons g20g142g140g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g146g151g144g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g146g152g155g146g157g146g142g156g561 as noted previously public funds are currently disbursed in the following priority 1 convention grants 2 generalelection grants and 3 primary matching funds prioritization of the convention grants has been criticized recently because these events are heavily subsidized by local host committees51 some observers have contended that conventions also benefit from soft money funds not regulated under feca that is otherwise banned in federal elections52 if congress believes that funding candidates should be the top priority in the public financing program deprioritizing convention funding could be an attractive option two of the bills introduced in the 110th congress s 436 and s 2412 would remove the conventionpriority language from current law doing so could help avoid future shortfalls in primary matching funds by preserving money in the pecf that would cu rrently go to conventions first nonetheless 50 federal election commission fec approves matching funds for 2004 presidential candidates 51 for an overview see anthony

convention grants unless they were eliminated entirely more generally congress could also consider eliminating one or more segments of the public financing program for example if congress felt that convention funding were longer necessary these subsidies could be eliminated entirely however those concerned about the influence of private money particularly soft money in convention financing could object to conventions that are completely dependent upon private funds in addition given recent concerns about the viability of primary public financing congress could choose to eliminate matching funds and shift remaining amounts to the general election convention grants or both these options could facilitate maintaining public financing in some form and even bolster remaining portions of the program without allocating new funds g17g157g145g142g155g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g21g152g158g155g140g142g156g561 current law requires that support for the program be limited to checkoff designations specified at 3 or 6 congress might also consider allowing taxpayers to contribute to the pecf in ways beyond the checkoff mechanism currently taxpayers are not permitted to determine how much they wish to designate toward the presidential public financing program rather they may only indicate whether they wish to designate the fixed amount displayed on the 1040 form instead congress could permit additional taxpayer donations to the fund allow taxpayers to specify designation amount or expand the number of designation choices53 if taxpayers chose to make larger contributions than the 3 amount revenues in the fund could increase they could also decrease if taxpayers chose to make smaller designations than the current 3 rate

have been solely responsible for the funds resources if it chose to do so however congress could appropriate some or all funds necessary to cover public financing needs all four bills introduced in the 110th congress that propose to maintain the program would permit appropriations to cover increased benefits for the first election after th new laws enactment the pecf however would have to repay those amounts with interest to the treasury54 congressional appropriations could have the advantage of supplementing or replacing declining checkoff designations if regular and sufficient appropriations could be secured the financial stability of the public financing program might also be more predictable than is the case today however some members could find appropriations objectionable appropriations are also subject to being reduced or eliminated in short the pecf does not currently benefit from appropriations but it also is not dependent upon the annual appropriations process 53 caps would be necessary however to prevent taxpayers from designating their entire tax liability for the pecf 54 both treasury funds and pecf funds are generated by tax revenues meaning that one form of public funds would be used to repay another

if candidates are to be convinced to accept public financing they must be persuaded that the programs benefits outweigh its constraints this calculation often depends on opponents behavior particularly whether they too are expected to accept public financing when two opposing candidates choose to participate even low spending limits or benefits are likely to be sufficient because both sides are equipped with the same financial resources and face the same constraints if on the other hand candidates believe that they can fare better outside the system or that their opponents are likely to opt outparticipation is less likely those scenarios seem to have discouraged participation during the primaries in recent elections the additional benefits to candidates and associated increases in spending limits proposed in hr 776 s 436 hr 4294 and s 2412 would dramatically increase publicly financed candidates resources as table 4 shows in 2008 the maximum publicly financed candidate could spend under the current system is approximately 126 million plus about 14 million in legal fundraising and accounting fees 55 under the four 110th congress bills that would maintain the system maximum candidate spending could increa to as much as 450 million if facing an opponent who had opted out of public financ ing and with maximum escapehatch funding additional funds provided through the escape hatch could be particularly attractive to candidates and could dissuade candidates from opting out of public financing unless they expect to privately raise funds that exceed the higher escapehatch amounts potentially unlimited coordinated party expenditures currently limited to about 19 million are also likely to be attractive to candidates increased matchingfund amounts and spending limit s could also be attractive to primary candidates who choose to participate in public fina ncing under the four bills that would maintain the system primary candidates would see small contributions matched not at the current 100 rate but at 400 those who remained in the primary race beyond march 31 of the election year would receive an additional 100 match for total match of 500 of the donors original contribution up to 200 under that structure contribution of just 200 if matching at the full rate could facilitate 1000 benefit to the candidate after 500 match the proposed matchingfund changes arguably democratize presidential campaigns by placing renewed emphasis on small donors perhaps even more so than now as the maximum matched contribution would be 200 rather than 250 56 the extra 100 match is apparently designed to provide additional money to publicly financed candidates between the end of the primaries and the nominating convention some publicly financed candidates have struggled financially in the past between the end of primaries and conventions because generalelection grants are not released until after the candidate is nominated it is also possible that offering the additional 100 match to candidates who remain in the race after march 31 might prolong the nomination contest even if the contest were essentially decided before march 31 candidates who have hope of winning the nomination might choose to 55 this assumes candidates participate in public financing during both the primary and general elections 56 some preliminary evidence suggests that small donors are already enjoying renewed clout particularly in light of some candidates successful internet fundraising during the 2008 cycle see for example campaign finance institute

there is little current information about how well taxpayers understand the public financing program58 fec focus groups conducted nationwide in 1989 found that citizens may not know why the public funding program was implemented or how it works the fec research also revealed however that taxpayers would like to know more59 in response the fec conducted an educational campaign in 1991 and 1992 that featured publicservice announcements and media appearances by commissioners60 taxpayer participation has nonetheless generally declined especially in 1993 when congress increased the checkoff designation amount in opinion polling support for public financing at various levels fluctuates with question wording61 although respondents tend to favor limiting the influence of private money in politics they often react negatively to references to taxpayer funds or government support for campaigns it is possible therefore that americans support an alternative to private campaign financing as we know it but nonetheless object to subsidizing campaigns through tax dollars even though the checkoff designation does not change ones tax liability without updated research on how 57 on 527

unclear whether the low participation rate is due to lack of knowledge objection to the program or other factors it is also unclear whether more taxpayers could be persuaded to make checkoff

checkoff rate is the popularity of taxpreparation software some such software has been criticized for set ting as default response to the checkoff question62 all four 110th congress bills that would retain public financing would require the secretary of the treasury to issue regulations requiring that taxpreparation software not automatically accept or decline public financing designations it is unclear what effects this requirement could have on the checkoff rate although voluntary changes in the past appear to have had little effect in november 2005 hr block and intuit major vend ors of taxpreparation software reportedly agreed to requests from thenfec commissioners michael toner and scott thomas and the campaign finance institute to revise some softwa re to not automatically select yes or options in response to checkoff question and to revise instructions to more accurately reflect irs descriptions of the program 63 irs data do not clearly address the effects of those changes but the changes appear to have had little if any effect on the overall checkoff rate as table 1 and figure 2 above show the checkoff rate fell slightly in 2005 compared with 2004 from 92 to 91 respectively but rose to 109 in 2006 it is possible that the increase between 2005 and 2006 was result of the software changes but it is impossible to know for certain with currently available data irs data do not isolate returns filed with particular commercial software nor do they contain information about taxpayer knowledge or intent with respect to commercial software

to considering various options and amending relevant law to change the program the preceding section on reconsidering funding priorities explains that repealing convention funding could preserve remaining amounts for primary matching funds and generalelection grants this option could also provide financial boost to the pecf overall without allocating additional funds to the program in 2008 convention grants account for approximately 336 million of the pecfs obligations that same amount if not obligated for conventions could reduce the threat of shortfalls for matching funds or if necessary in the future generalelection grants on the other hand those concerned about the role of private funds in convention financing could object to repealing public funds hr 484 would terminate the pecf entirely and return the remaining balance to the treasury for those who object to public financing repealing the program could provide tens of millions of dollars annually for other purposes as of 2006 most 15 billion had been designated for the pecf as shown in table 1 repealing the program would also remove taxpayer funding from presidential elections role that some lawmakers and others believe private contributions should fulfill on the other hand repealing public fi nancing completely would leave presidential candidates entirely beholden either to selffinancing or to private contributions even strong candidates may have difficulty raising enough funds to be competitive or may be uncomfortable with the notion that their candidacies are beholden to donors for those who believe that candidates should be able to financially support their own campaigns or garner private contributions to do so ending public financing would likely be acceptable however for those who believe that private contributions or personal wealth should not automatically include or exclude otherwise qualified presidential candidates public financing remains an important resource in addition if public financing and its required spending limits were longer options the pace of private campaign fundraising and unlimited spending are likely to increase as candidates are constantly on guard for the next election and potentially high spending opponents g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g5g152g150g150g142g151g157g156g561 warnings about the public financing systems demise are not unique to the 2008 election cycle even at its peak the taxpayerparticipation rate has never exceeded 29 although fund balances were sufficient to meet candidate needs thr oughout the late1970s and 1980s by the early 1990s the system began to show signs of strain tripling the checkoff amount in 1993 provided significant financial boost although checkoff designations have generally continued to decline even with the larger checkoff amount shortfalls have occurred at least briefly during the primary matchingfunds phase of the program since the 1996 election cycle overall almost from the beginning the program has faced obstacles even as most presidential candidates have participated in public financing the 2008 campaign cycle has however shown evidence of unique challenges to the system although several candidates chose to participate in public financing during the primaries those candidates who continued to actively pursue their parties nominations into the spring and summer of 2008 chose to opt out of primary public financing some candidates have in just few months or less raised more through private contributions than the entire primary spending limit for publicly

financing during the general election as noted previously media reports suggest that senator mccain will accept public funds for the general election in addition throughout the cycle candidates from both major parties have raised record amounts through private fundraising between january 2007 and april 2008 presidential candidates reportedly raised almost 1 billion65 historically the public financing program provided access or at least faster access to more money than all but wealthy selffinanced candidates could raise privately that proposition now appears questionable at least for some candidates some major candidates could still choose to participate in public financing but the threat of major candidates not participating is likely to make the current program less viable in the future as candidates will potentially feel increasingly compelled to forgo the system to be competitive the current system also does not provide additional resources to counter spending from outside groups such as pacs and 527 organizations for some observers these challenges and possible resurgence in small donors suggest that public financing is unnecessary and should either be allowed to fade away or should be repealed ou tright others however contend that the program has provided vital assistance to highquality candidates who are nonetheless unable to raise large sums of private contributions or who choose not to do so the four bills introduced in the 110 th congress that would maintain the program concentrate on increasing benefits to and spending limits for participating candidates these measures are likely to make the program more attractive to potential participants they will certainly provide more financial resources than are currently available to publicly financed candidates however in the absence of constitutional amendment granting congress the power to cap campaign spending or require participation in public financing even the most ambitious reforms cannot guarantee that participants will not be outspent by nonparticipating opponents or outside interests any policy choice that maintains the public financin g system with expanded benefits is likely to be expensive on the other hand proponents argue that the increased cost is worthy investment in presidential campaigns the congressional budg et office cbo has not issued cost estimates for the four 110 th congress bills that would maintain the system although senator feingold has stated that the total cost of the changes to the system based on data from the 2004 elections is projected to be around 365 million over the fouryear election cycle66 in the senate bills some of those expenses would be covered by proposed offsets to certain federal programs additional checkoff designations could also offset addition costs precise costs would depend on funding sources program elements and candidate participation 65 campaign finance institute presidential candidates fundra ising activity

it could be useful to consider what goals that system should pursue and how the ex isting model of the checkoff designations appears to be either poorly understood by the taxpayers unpopular with the taxpayers or both if that model is to be maintained commitment to educational outreach and perhaps basic research about public opinion of and knowledge about pres idential public financing could be useful perhaps more fundamentally if congress chooses to reform the program doing so will require consensus among lawmakers about one of the most complex and contentious areas of campaign finance
