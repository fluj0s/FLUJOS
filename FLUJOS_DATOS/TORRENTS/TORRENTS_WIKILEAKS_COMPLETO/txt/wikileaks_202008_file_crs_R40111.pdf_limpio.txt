conservation investments in fy2007 defense spending on energy to operate its facilities reached almost 35 billion in the last decade congress has appropriated 443 million in defense energy conservation projects and the value of contracts to install energy savings improvements has exceeded 28 billion while the defense department has reduced its energy consumption its energy spending increased due to higher energy prices congress continues to look at furthering energy efficiency improvements in aging defense facilities and buildings as means to rein in energy consumption and

the department of defense dod accounts for approximately 63 of the energy consumed by federal facilities and buildings1 this makes dod the single largest energy consumer in the united states even though consuming only 1 of national sitedelivered energy2 its annual spending on facility energy has averaged over 34 billion recently in the early 1970s congress began mandating reductions in energy consumed by federal agencies primarily by improving the efficiency of buildings and facilities and by reducing fossil fuel use initially 10 energy reduction goal was established for federal buildings as measured against 1985 baseline3 by fiscal year fy 2005 dod reported 283 reduction in energy consumption compared to the baseline recent legislation and executive orders establish further energy reduction goals presidentelect obamas recently publicized economic recovery plans include improvements in public building energy efficiency recently introduced bills in congress have called for establishing national building efficiency codes this report reviews the energy conservation provisions in past and recent legislation applicable to dod executive orders that apply to all federal facilities 4 and operations and the office of the secretary of defense osd directives and instructions to the military departments and agencies dod spending on facility energy is annually reported to congress as originally mandated by the national energy conservation policy act necpa da ta reported over the last decade have been summarized in this report annual defense appropriations that fund energy conservation measures along with dod energy conservation investments are also summarized this report does not cover the subject of transportation fuels

traced back to the start of the federal energy management program femp in 1973 the 1978 national energy conservation policy act necpa public law pl 95619 began the program of retrofitting federal buildings to improve energy efficiency the 1985 deficit reduction act pl 99272 amended necpa by authorizing energy savings contracts of up to 25 years the 1992 energy policy act further amended necpa by adopting energy savings performance contracts espcs that offered federal agencies novel means of making energy efficiency improvements to aging buildings and facilities see discussion below necpa

dod energy conservation projects dod investment in energy conservation adds another 250 million and the value of energy savings performance contracts espcs exceeds 28 billion despite the investments dod annual energy spending has been increasing since 1999 as have electricity and particularly natural gas prices further investment in energy conservation is expected to meet the future mandated energy reduction goals espcs have become preferred means of making energy efficiency improvements because in part funds do not have to be directly appropriated or programmed however as energy savings contractors escos assume certain risk in gu aranteeing savings through espcs the risk is factored into their cost also espc commitments may extend up to 25 yearsan indication of the time needed to recoup the escos investment as energy efficiency improvements made through uescs do not necessarily come with savi ngs guarantees and thus risk the lower cost may translate into higher savings federal agencies may not be taking full advantage of this savings opportunity this may be due to individual utilities limited role promoting uescs installation managers unfamiliarity with uescs and escos influence in promoting espcs aging buildings may have limits in meeting ener gy efficiency goals and investment in energy conservation may eventually see diminishing returns in energy savings overall goals may be achieved ultimately through the replacement of older building with new buildings built to leed standards and even newer highperformance bu ilding standards being developed the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae 33 whether future investments in energy conservation projects and espc commitments should give way to replacing older inefficient building with new construction is an issue that congress may eventually wish to consider as an alternative congress may wish to consider expanding the eisa section 518 epsc provision nonbuilding applications to study renovating energyinefficient buildings to leed and highperformance standards 33 the ashrae initiative known as the standard for the design of highperformance green buildings
