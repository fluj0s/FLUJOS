crisis j f hornbeck specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary despite backing from the international monetary fund imf capital flight from brazil in 1998 prompted the government to jettison its pegged currency stabilization program and float the real on january 15 1999 becoming another casualty of the volatile international capital markets brazil adjusted to its financial crisis faster than expected which is now considered over this report provides final summary of brazils financial crisis and related imf assistance in support of congressional interest in various aspects of the 1990s global financial turmoil it will not be updated facing increasing investor uncertainty and prolonged capital flight brazil devalued its currency the real on january 15 1999 following mexico asia and russia as the next casualty of the 1990s global financial turmoil although brazil had ample foreign exchange reserves and international monetary fund imf support nervous investors withdrew net 40 billion from brazil over the four months following the august 1998 default in russia yielding to market pressures brazil attempted an 8 controlled devaluation on january 13 1999 only to increase investor anxiety and capital outflows rather than risk depleting its international reserves in the hope of outlasting the global run on its currency brazil chose to float the real causing major devaluation that eventually halted capital flight but left the economy disrupted in other ways combination of policy decisions and political events left brazil exposed to the vagaries of international capital markets first brazil had an overvalued exchange rate and huge fiscal deficits which together could not be sustained indefinitely second brazil became increasingly dependent on the very capital markets that tend to abandon countries when they need them most finally two political events in january triggered the final run on the real 1 failure to pass legislation that would have addressed the large budget deficit that epitomized the countrys fiscal excess and 2 announcement of moratorium on federal debt payments by large state government to grasp how these events made brazil vulnerable to capital flight however it is important to understand the role of economic policies implemented earlier in the decade congressional research service the library of congress crs2 background economic stabilization and reform in the 1980s and early 1990s the brazilian economy struggled with slow growth and high inflation aggravated by inefficient wasteful and at times questionable public oversight policies to stabilize the economy repeatedly failed but in july 1994 then finance minister and now president fernando henrique cardoso launched the real plan to beat brazils high inflation as an exchange rate stabilization strategy it centered on eliminating price indexation and creating new currency the real that was pegged to the dollar as link to us monetary stability to maintain credible peg brazil had to adopt responsible tight fiscal and monetary policies to restrain those pressures that could cause the currency to appreciate in real inflationadjusted terms table 1 brazil selected economic and financial indicators 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 gdp growth 41 60 42 27 34 00 08 33 inflation cpi 2730 1224 178 95 52 17 89 56

avoided and inflation fell rapidly declining from over 2000 in 1993 to less than 20 by 1995 see table 1 the plan also included policy of real inflationadjusted wage increases notably the minimum wage which combined with falling inflation effectively redistributed income to the poorest sectors of the economy and broadened the stabilization programs appeal1 beyond stabilization brazils longer term goals were promoting fast growth and deeper economic reform deeper reform involved structural changes such as continuing to open the economy to foreign trade and investment overhauling financial market regulation privatizing governmentcontrolled firms allowing markets to function more freely and most importantly in brazils case reducing large fiscal deficits economic challenges and delayed reform the failure to complete reform and the volatility of global capital markets were two factors that together eventually forced brazil to abandon the real plan although brazil 1 for details see dornbusch rudiger brazils incomplete stabilization and reform brookings papers on economic activity 1 1997 pp 37478 brazil it should be noted still suffers from one of the most unequal income distributions in the world crs3 had succeeded in bringing inflation down to historical lows the reform program did not proceeded as swiftly as anticipated and was further impeded by inadequate economic growth three interrelated economic problems developed exchange rate valuation pegged currency stabilization plan was the foundation of brazils economic reform program which meant that inflation had to be reduced rapidly high inflation with pegged currency causes exports to become less competitive and imports more so leading to growing deficits in trade goods and on current account goods services and investment income in effect it causes the currency to appreciate in real inflationadjusted terms if an appreciating currency is perceived to be seriously overvalued it raises the prospect of future devaluation and such speculation is frequently critical factor causing investors to discontinue financing countrys debt leading to capital flight and financial crisis inflation and large capital inflows did cause real appreciation of the brazilian currency the real appreciated immediately when fixed to the us dollar in 1994 and continued to appreciate because of brazils relatively high inflation rate in 1995 brazil countered by tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation and by instituting crawling peg exchange rate that would reduce the nominal value of the real with crawling peg the real was traded within narrow band that was depreciated over time in small increments crawl of about 06 per month to help offset currency appreciation the central bank bought and sold the real to maintain the exchange rate within the band from 1995 to 1998 with inflation falling renewed investor confidence and high real interest rates led to large capital inflows which then became the major threat to currency stability these inflows fueled the current account deficit placing further upward pressure on the value of the real over time consensus emerged that the real was in fact overvalued by 1530 increasing the risk of sudden investor withdrawal and currency crisis and thereby placing additional pressure on brazil to support the real with appropriate macroeconomic policies particularly fiscal austerity2 fiscal deficit although monetary policy was tight in part to defend the real plan lax fiscal management was second critical economic challenge the persistently large budget deficit hit 8 of gdp in 1998 roughly half federal half state and local raising three problems first the need to attract capital meant domestic interest rates had to exceed foreign rates which increased the cost of financing government debt hampering correction of the fiscal deficit even if budget cutting had been taken seriously second brazils dependence on foreign capital debt service grew more burdensome as the debt 1 increased dramatically in size 2 shortened in maturity and 3 became increasingly indexed to the dollar and shortterm interest rates third fiscal excess by pulling in foreign capital put upward pressure on the currency value thereby impairing credibility of the exchange rate peg fiscal discipline proved elusive because it required brazils congress to make sweeping changes to social security pension and tax laws three large structural components of the deficit with welldefined and politically active constituent groups on december 2 1998 the brazilian legislature failed to pass the major reform bill suggesting that the government would be unlikely to meet its fiscal targets although other savings had been found legislative gridlock raised serious question about brazils commitment to fiscal austerity and broader economic reform 2 dri inc world markets report brazil october 1998 crs4 current account deficit the third major economic issue was the current account deficit which exceeded 4 of gdp in 1998 although below levels seen as unsustainable eg 8 in the case of mexico in 1994 it was higher than generally considered desirable 3 the current account deficit may be viewed as function of brazils low domestic saving rate brazil used foreign capital to supplement the shortfall of domestic savings to finance private investment and the government deficit to bring about higher saving rates brazil would have had to encourage private sector saving over consumption which is not easily done through public policy or directly increase saving on the public side by cutting the federal budget deficit which it had failed to do by january 1999 brazil had to support policy of high real interest rates to attract foreign capital required to finance the fiscal and current account deficits rather than reduce interest rates to help stimulate the economy given this constraint on monetary policy shrinking the fiscal deficit was key to resolving brazils economic problems smaller fiscal deficit would have reduced the need for foreign capital and related high interest costs effectively lowering the current account deficit while increasing saving which would have exerted downward pressure on interest rates and the exchange rate although this would have taken time decisive movement toward fiscal austerity might have allowed capital markets to retain confidence in brazils financial future capital flight and the imf package3 following russias devaluation and default in august 1998 investors viewed brazils overvalued currency weak fiscal position and policy gridlock with great skepticism capital flight ensued and brazil approached the imf for aid even before fullscale currency crisis had erupted on december 2 1998 the imf approved standby arrangement comprising financial commitments from the imf world bank inter american development bank idb and 20 individual countries including the united states see table 2 the imfs overriding goal was to provide private capital markets with sufficient assurance of brazils shortterm liquidity to avoid speculative attack on the real it was intended to buy time for brazil to 1 pass reform measures aimed at addressing deeper economic problems particularly fiscal reform and 2 increase the depreciation rate of its crawling peg to allay concerns over exchange rate valuation4 total financial assistance amounted to 415 billion the imf had the largest portion at 180 billion with 55 billion 30 offered under the normal standby arrangements provided at slightly above us treasury rates and disbursed over three years subject to imf reviews of brazils policy commitments the remaining 126 billion 70 was made available through the imfs new supplemental reserve facility srf at higher rate and for only oneyear period both the world bank and the idb provided three year loans of 45 billion available in 1999 twenty countries also committed to guarantees of loans made through the bank of international settlements bis of which the us portion was 50 billion commitment from the us treasurys exchange stabilization fund esf 3 for imf details see crs report rl30575 the

from exchange stabilization fund esf us department of the treasury5 source imf idb and us treasury there were some ground breaking aspects to the brazilian package first it used the srf which was established by the imf only one year earlier in december 1997 to meet shortterm liquidity problems in countries that have experienced sudden loss of market confidence but that also have reform measures in place to suggest that market confidence can again be obtained relatively quickly second for the first time the imf activated the new arrangements to borrow nab to finance the brazilian loan the nab is new agreement with certain countries to have them lend supplementary funds to the imf to assist with financial crises at times when the imfs liquidity is low third it was originally preemptive loan arrangement in which brazil requested support before it actually had financial crisis fourth the imf front loaded the package allowing most funds to be disbursed in 1999 brazil drew 94 billion in december 1998 divided between imf and the bilateral commitments the draw was conditioned on following number of policies including reducing its fiscal deficit following strict monetary policy enacting various structural reforms and maintaining its pegged exchange rate the reals stability at this point depended on the credibility of brazilian policies which was lost when brazils congress failed to pass reform legislation the resulting capital flight forced brazil to float the real within month its value dropping by 40 at its low point moving from pegged to floating exchange rate meant that technically brazil was longer in compliance with initial imf conditions requiring renegotiation of terms on march 30 1999 with reforms underway the imf in its second review agreed to new terms with brazil one week later brazil drew second installment of 49 billion from the imf another 49 billion from the bilateral commitments the full 45 billion from the idb and 10 billion from the world bank subsequently as condition for making available the remaining imf resources the fund conducted three more reviews of the brazilian economy on july 28 1999 november 5 for details on the esf see crs report rl30125 the exchange stabilization fund of the us treasury department purpose history and legislative activity by arlene wilson crs6 29 1999 and may 31 2000 the economy adjusted faster than many analysts had predicted and brazil did not need to access the full amount of the imf package from the imf alone it drew total of 11 billion but repaid all the higher interest loans from the srf and bilateral agreements in april 2000 six months ahead of schedule as of june 1 2000 brazil had an outstanding imf credit balance of 19 billion from the threeyear standby arrangement outlook and implications economic indicators suggest brazil has clearly beat all expectations regarding its recovery from the january 1999 devaluation and effectively brazils financial crisis is over although at one time brazil was expected to enter deep recession gdp actually grew by nearly 1 in 1999 employment increased by 25 and the annual inflation rate was restrained to 9 within the target range expected by the imf the current account deficit was higher than anticipated due to weak export prices and the rising cost of oil as well as slower than expected response of export prices to the devaluation foreign capital has begun to return to brazil however so the current account deficit has been fully financed with foreign capital and brazils reserve position has stabilized even as it has repaid the imf improving trends in 2000 so far support brazils optimistic assessment that its worst economic problems are now past economic policy and imf assistance appear to have been two important variables reducing the severity of brazils financial crisis although implementing economic reform earlier might have averted the crisis to begin with clearly the economic fallout could have been much worse structural reforms played an important role particularly the fiscal effects related to congressional action in 19992000 on redefining the public and private pension systems the fiscal responsibility law and broader tax reform which affects federal state and municipal budgets and heightening regulatory oversight and consolidation of the financial sector fiscal and monetary policy have held firm keeping check on inflation while supporting solid economic growth in 2000 fiscal excess viewed by many as core problem has improved as seen in the expected rise of the primary fiscal balance excludes interest expense from 0 of gdp in 1998 to over 3 in 2000 although reducing brazils public debt remains longterm challenge many view the brazilian imf program as success providing liquidity and credit enhancement as capital fled and conditionality working as major catalyst for policy reform which brazil clearly resisted right up to the january 1999 devaluation the devaluation rather than imf assistance however was the major event halting capital flight decision brazil would have faced in the absence of imf assistance brazil also would have probably had to make policy adjustments in any case but the fact that the imf worked closely with brazil even prior to the actual crisis suggests that there may be some merit in evaluating preemptive imf assistance in cases of perceived potential crisis versus responding after the fact finally the fact that brazils recovery hinged on its ability to pass longdelayed reform measures speaks to the importance of pushing for such change before the onset of financial crisis debate that is currently flourishing over the broader issue of defining appropriate imf assistance enacting such deep structural reform while also addressing severe social problems remains one of the major political challenges facing brazil and the rest of the developing world for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98987
