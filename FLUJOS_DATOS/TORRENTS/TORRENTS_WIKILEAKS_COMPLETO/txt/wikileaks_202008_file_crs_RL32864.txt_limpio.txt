in kyrgyzstan developments and implications background kyrgyzstan is small and poor country that gained independence in 1991 with the breakup of the soviet union1 it was long led by askar akayev who initially was widely regarded as reformer but in recent years appeared increasingly autocratic despite this the country was still considered the most open progressive and cooperative in central asia according to the us agency for international development2 the united states has been interested in helping kyrgyzstan to enhance its sovereignty and territorial integrity increase democratic participation and civil society bolster economic reform and development strengthen human rights prevent weapons proliferation and more effectively combat transnational terrorism and trafficking in persons and narcotics the united states has pursued these interests throughout central asia with special strategic attention to oilrich kazakhstan and regionalpower uzbekistan and somewhat less to kyrgyzstan the significance of kyrgyzstan to the united states increased after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states the us military repaired and upgraded the air field at the manas international airport for transshipping personnel equipment and supplies to support coalition operations in afghanistan and the region in early 2005 the base hosted about 800 us and 100 spanish troops3 the coup and its aftermath many people both inside and outside kyrgyzstan were hopeful that the national legislative election on february 27 2005 would strengthen political pluralism easing the way for peaceful handover of executive power in late 2005 when president akayev was expected to step down nearly 400 prominent politicians and businessmen and 40 parties many united in blocs ran for 75 seats in the highly contentious race many in kyrgyzstan thought it unseemly that the presidents and prime ministers children were running for seats along with many other family 1 it is small in terms of its population of 51 million and its size of 77415 sq miles similar to that of north dakota and poor in terms of many natural resources and its high rate of poverty estimated at 3050 of the

justification for foreign operations for fy2006 crs2 members and friends of high officials balloting resulted in the filling of less than half the seats with runoffs held on march 13 in districts where one candidate received over 50 of the votes cast on march 22 the central electoral commission cec announced that results for 71 districts were valid less than 10 of seats were won by opposition candidates although there reportedly were many close races where they lost only by few votes these results incensed many in the opposition camp who alleged massive vote fraud an initial report by election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and the european parliament fueled this discontent by stating that serious irregularities had taken place including the questionable exclusion of several opposition candidates from running biased statecontrolled media and other heavy government use of administrative resources and problematic voter lists4 after opposition candidates won only two seats in the first round opposition partyled demonstrators called for new election and for akayev to resign in southern kyrgyzstan protestors stormed and occupied government facilities including in the regional centers of osh and jalalabad many of these southerners including majority ethnic uzbek community viewed themselves as discriminated against both economically and politically by central government dominated by northerners5 some counterdemonstrations in support of the government also were reported protests widened throughout both the north and south in the wake of the march 13 runoff akayev hastily convened the new legislature immediately after the cec announced voting results on march 22 and urged the public to focus on the upcoming planting season rather than past election he blamed foreign ngos and religious extremists for the protests and his spokesman warned that the unrest marked efforts by drug lords and terrorists to take power akayevs ouster kyrgyzstans capital bishkek remained relatively calm until an opposition rally on march 23 was successfully dispersed by police and armed akayev supporters the next day thousands of angry demonstrators converged on government offices according to one account violent attack on the protesters by some of akayevs supporters enraged the demonstrators and they stormed and occupied the presidential and other offices akayev fled the melee and he and his family soon flew to moscow akayevs prime minister resigned the protesters released opposition party leader feliks kulov from prison where he had been held on embezzlement charges that many observers had deemed politically motivated going to the occupied compound he hailed the revolution made by the people6 4 osce office for

the kyrgyz statistics committee 2001 estimate 6 the coup was variously called the tulip revolution the yellow revolution the lemon continued crs3 indicative of the chaotic legal situation the kyrgyz supreme court on march 24 recognized the former legislature as still duly empowered deputies from the former legislature met that night they were shocked by rampant looting in bishkek and appointed kulov to oversee the security interior police and defense ministries they also appointed opposition figure kurmanbek bakiyev acting prime minister and the next morning named him acting president as well bakiyev quickly proposed provisional government composed of opposition politicians most prominently roza otunbaeva as acting minister of foreign affairs adakhan madumarov acting deputy prime minister and azimbek beknazarov acting prosecutorgeneral for further information on selected politicians see the appendix the old legislature wrangled with bakiyev over the appointments perhaps spurring him to decide to dispense with it and endorse the powers of the new legislature over the weekend the constitutional court bakiyev kulov and newly appointed head of the cec proclaimed that the new legislature was constitutionally legitimate and should be empowered although granting that twenty or more district races might need to be held again the new legislature met on march 28 and elected omurbek tekebayev as speaker and reaffirmed bakiyev as prime minister and acting president the interim government has announced that presidential election will take place on july 10 2005 akayevs formal resignation as president on april 4 2005 was major boost to the legitimacy of the interim government the resignation agreement called for akayev to foreswear running for president again and for the new kyrgyz authorities to respect existing law that grants retired presidents immunity from prosecution russia pledged to assist the parties in honoring their commitments the kyrgyz legislature accepted akayevs resignation on april 11 among early policy decisions bakiyev on march 29 stated that he would combat corruption that siphons away investment capital and compromises the educational and legal systems he also announced that personnel in the former government responsible for electoral fraud and attacks on demonstrators would be prosecuted and that some property belonging to the akayev family might be confiscated both bakiyev and otunbayeva stressed that kyrgyzstans foreign policy would not change including its close relations with russia and the united states and the presence of their military bases in the country 6 continued revolution and the pink revolution by opposition groups and commentators crs4 implications for kyrgyzstan and the region observers remain divided on prospects for kyrgyzstan with some suggesting that it will continue to democratize because it has relatively vibrant civil society compared to the rest of central asia others are less optimistic pointing to the economic development challenges facing kyrgyzstan and the high level of disaffection among its population they also point to the social fragility of country where the north and south have differing interests and where even ground transport back and forth is difficult during the winter because of mountainous terrain the main division among the groups vying for power and influence during the late march events appeared to be between proakayev regional clan and family groups which together constituted the political and economic elite and other regional clan and family groups that felt deprived of their share of political and economic power ethnic issues appeared at least initially less significant since many ethnic uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan joined other southerners in toppling the regime however ethnic tensions remain of concern beyond their antiakayev stance and demands for redistributing political and economic power the opposition parties mostly lack welldeveloped policies and strategic plans for the future of kyrgyzstan some observers have raised concerns that interim government leaders are engaging in nepotism and other corrupt practices rather than combating them several commentators view the coup as involving two antiregime groups the dispossessed and the political opposition to some degree the former are younger and the latter are older the former were the active agents in taking over government offices and reportedly were motivated more by poverty and unemployment than by opposition politics otunbayeva stressed that mainly poor people rather than party stalwarts stormed the government complex on march 24 these commentators warn that if new government fails to remedy economic distress more violence could occur7 other analysts have placed less credence on the poor people theory suggesting that at least some of the political opposition may have planned to forcibly oust akayev on march 248 one opposition leader appears to enjoy overwhelming public and elite support although bakiyevs influence appears to have grown in recent months9 as was the case in georgia some of the most influential opposition leaders appear at least initially to be cooperating in running the government however the planned july presidential election appears to be accentuating tensions within the opposition camp in particular between bakiyev and kulov10 bakiyev representing southern 7 foreign broadcast information service daily report hereafter fbis mar 28 2005 doc eup17 mar 29 2005 cep19 mar 29 2005 cep213 8 daniel

his power base by wooing northern politicians such as otunbayeva and many of those elected to the new legislature such actions could reduce kulovs strong appeal in the north on the other hand many of the oppositionists remain outside the bakiyev government and at least some may unify to support kulov in prospective presidential race kulov also is trying to woo former akayev supporters by endorsing akayevs immunity from prosecution however some proakayev and northern interests have created the akyykat justice political movement to challenge opposition candidates in the election some observers raise the specter of highly contentious and problematic presidential election that may deepen civil disorder another source of likely disorder may then come to the fore later in the year if the 1520 or more disputed legislative seats are recontested or if new election of the whole legislature is carried out unless these elections take place however the legislature will remain illegitimate in the eyes of many kyrgyzstanis calls by some in kyrgyzstan for rewriting the constitution to remove what are viewed as illegitimate changes made during akayevorchestrated referenda create still more uncertainties about kyrgyzstans stability during the next few months some optimistic observers suggest that the relatively bloodless march coup 3 deaths were reported and reduced public passions after akayevs ouster may bode well for the avoidance of violence or political instability in the near term11 other observers who caution that political disorder may deepen suggest that islamic extremists could bid to take power they maintain that hizb uttahrir and other islamic extremist groups have gained members in kyrgyzstan in recent years and warn that such groups are antiamerican and antirussian12 before the coup there appeared to be some cooperation among ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in protests in kyrgyzstans south in contrast to intercommunal violence there in the early 1990s many ethnic uzbeks and kyrgyz joined in supporting ethnic uzbek opposition leader anvar artykov in osh the emergence of such cooperation appeared buttressed by regionwide parades and other celebrations to mark akayevs overthrow however while some ethnic uzbeks have supported bakiyev others have criticized him for appointing people to leading government posts whom they regard as kyrgyz nationalists and for not appointing enough ethnic uzbeks13 10 continued politician in the country otunbayeva was among the top ten and kadyrbekov among the top twenty fbis feb 26 2005 cep139 since he was freed from

have belied the views of some who asserted that the relatively authoritarian regimes in central asia would endure for the foreseeable future the coup has galvanized opposition throughout the region and caused palpable unease among regional elites who unanimously condemned it as bloody putsch kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev for example told his citizenry that the coup was the work of 5000 convicts who had escaped from jail and were looting kyrgyzstan some observers suggest that kazakhstan might be the most likely candidate among the remaining central asian states where the opposition could influence political change because nazarbayev has not completely crushed civil society however he appears to be taking measures to head off kyrgyztype coup he has for example raised salaries and pensions among security measures perhaps inspired by the kyrgyz coup the legislature quickly approved electoral law changes banning political rallies immediately after an election zamanbek nurkadilov leader of newly formed opposition bloc called in late march for nazarbayev to step down when his term expires in 2006 so that democratic and nonviolent leadership transition may occur14 in late 2005 tajikistan faces planned presidential election which the incumbent authoritarian leader emomali rakhmanov is expected to win although some political opposition parties were legalized as part of the 1997 settlement of tajikistans civil war they have faced increasing harassment the osce and the tajik opposition have criticized the rakhmanov government for gross interference in past elections including the february 2005 legislative race but the opposition has not reopened the civil war following the events in kyrgyzstan however the tajik opposition may consider the conduct of the 2005 presidential race as decision point for its future cooperation with the government15 in uzbekistan the government strictly censored news about the kyrgyz coup restricted public gatherings in regions near kyrgyzstan and closed the border president islam karimov harshly condemned the coup as an illegal act some uzbek opposition leaders hailed events in kyrgyzstan as call to arms in uzbekistan but most of the major opposition leaders are in exile and little political expression is allowed within the country the coup in kyrgyzstan at least temporarily set back the already limited cooperation among the central asian states with kazakhstan and uzbekistan putting restrictions on crossborder trade and travel some of which remain in place the regional presidents have contacted the interim leaders of kyrgyzstan to establish working relations to replace initial strains these strains at times appeared to be exacerbated by statements made by the interim kyrgyz leadership while otunbayeva at the end of march assured the regional leaders that the guidelines of 14 monde mar 28 2005 p 4 fbis mar 31 2005 cep53 eurasia insight apr 1 2005 jeremy bransen rferl report mar 31 2005 15 baran wall

same thing that the other countries in central asia will follow our path16 while opposition forces in the region include those espousing democratic principles they also include islamic extremists and ultranationalists it appears unlikely that islamic extremists soon could come to power many observers argue more likely islamic extremists could use weakened kyrgyzstan as base to support affiliated groups throughout the fergana valley which is shared by kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and tajikistan thereby enhancing threats to the regimes of these countries17 another possibility could be the rise to power of an ultranationalist regime it such regime came to power many observers suggest there might well be increased discrimination against ethnic uzbeks russians and other minorities that could lead to violence kyrgyzstans foreign relations with neighboring countries could also suffer if it pressed sensitive border claims or stopped cooperating as critical source of water supply for the downstream countries of kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan implications for afghanistan the coup does not appear to have affected the operations of the us base in kyrgyzstan in support of coalition actions in afghanistan more democratic and stable kyrgyzstan might be considered for longer term prepositioning of military supplies or other enhanced use the change of government in kyrgyzstan could result in greater efforts to combat crossborder criminal terrorist and drug smuggling activities that conceivably could have positive effect on afghanistan drug traffickers however could switch to other routes out of afghanistan kyrgyzstan and afghanistan might also cooperate in bolstering democracy in each others countries and throughout the region implications for russia and other eurasian states some analysts view the coup in kyrgyzstan as harbinger of political transformations in other soviet successor eurasian states others view it as prompting tougher repression by authoritarian leaders intent on retaining power russia quickly shifted in late march from harsh criticism of the kyrgyz opposition to offers of aid to the interim government this volte face was made easier after bakiyev and others pledged that kyrgyzstan would remain russias strategic partner some observers suggested that russia had realized that its heavyhanded approach to political liberalization in ukraine and georgia was only making these countries more determined to gravitate toward the west putin reflected this stance when he allowed that while it is regretful that once more in country in the post soviet area political issues are decided by unlawful means he hoped that he could 16 fbis mar 29 2005 eup68 17 luc perrot afp mar 24 2005 fbis mar 30 2005 cep229 crs8 work with

raised concerns that the coup marked further decline in russian influence in other former soviet successor states nikolai bordyuzha general secretary of the collective security treaty organization of the commonwealth of independent states19 raised concerns that the csto had proved impotent since akayev had refused an offer of help from the csto in the days before the coup and the interim leaders of kyrgyzstan also were ignoring it perhaps portending greater tension in usrussia relations some stateowned television commentators in russia alleged that the coup was simply another example after similar coups in georgia and ukraine of us meddling in eurasia reflecting an ultranationalist perspective one private russian newspaper even darkly warned that the us goal was direct control over eurasia including russia and that russia appeared to lack the political will to resist20 other authoritarian states in eurasia have followed uzbekistans example and cracked down on civil society rather than liberalizing in belarus president aleksandr lukashenka ordered military exercises on march 28 that he stated would make sure that people are afraid of replacing the authorities by attempted force21 in azerbaijan the government moved even before the kyrgyz coup perhaps in response to democratization events in ukraine to restrict youth participation in future electoral campaigns azerbaijans opposition musavat party head isa gambar hailed the kyrgyz coup as proving that muslim countries could roll back dictatorship and called on opposition parties to unite in bringing democratic revolution to azerbaijan by winning legislative elections scheduled for november 200522 leaders of moldovas transnistria and georgias abkhazia and south ossetia regions in april appeared

contrast to these leaders ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and georgian president mikheil saakashvili hailed the kyrgyz coup and dispatched their foreign ministers to bishkek at the end of march to offer advice and support to the interim leadership the ministers proposed that kyrgyzstan join democratic choice coalition just formed by the two presidents to cooperate on democratic reforms reportedly democratic activists from both countries had traveled to kyrgyzstan before the coup to give advice to activists there24 implications for china china is concerned that the coup could lead to more democratic kyrgyzstan that would inspire chinese democrats and embolden some ethnic uighurs turkic people who advocate separatism in chinas xinjiang region bordering kyrgyzstan groups such as the east turkestan independence movement etim designated by the united states as terrorist group have bases in central asia akayev had reached agreement with china in 2003 to step up cooperation in combating these groups and china is anxious that such cooperation continue china may also be concerned that peaceful uighurs within democratic kyrgyzstan might become more politically active in advocating for their kin in xinjiang25 apparently there were some attacks on chinese businessmen in kyrgyzstan during the coup that might be classified as hate crimes china is also concerned that instability in kyrgyzstan could result in increased crossborder smuggling and other crime chinas foreign ministry spokeman on march 29 stressed chinas paramount concern that law and order be reestablished with kyrgyzstan and that good neighborly relations continue including cooperation in combating terrorists26 the latter includes work within the shanghai cooperation organization sco

the effectiveness of the scos emergency consultation provisions implications for us interests the us administration has considered akayevs government as less objectionable than others in central asian and hoped that planned late 2005 presidential race would become model for peaceful democratic transfer of executive power in the region27 in line with these hopes the administration and others were

for emerging needs as political developments there unfold29 reportedly opposition leaders tekebayev and otunbayeva have stated that us democracy assistance was helpful to their endeavors for example both were participants in the international visitors program to observe the 2004 us presidential election other aid included printing press operating since november 2003 that prints all opposition newspapers which earlier had faced obstacles in obtaining services at statecontrolled facilities in the runup to the legislative race one opposition newspaper did an expose on the alleged wealth of the akayev family akayev denounced the article as libelous few days later electricity mysteriously was shut off to the press the us embassy strongly protested and lent generators to continue operations until power returned week later30 although accepting some credit for the role us democratization aid has played in facilitating the development of civil society in kyrgyzstan the administration has been careful to stress that it did not mastermind the coup secretary rice also has tried to reassure russia that the united states and the west are not attempting to encircle russia by instigating democratic revolutions throughout eurasia but that these are indigenous developments that will benefit russia as these countries become more stable and prosperous31 the administration at least initially appeared to follow the european union and other international institutions and governments in cautiously assessing developments in kyrgyzstan during the chaotic period leading up to

future the interim leadership appears to support important us interests in the region kulov seems to be strongly prous but he also has argued that up to one million kyrgyz 20 of the population may be working in russia that their repatriated earnings constitute major portion of the kyrgyz budget and that russia provides oil so we cannot quarrel with moscow35 some observers suggest that even if
