refugees unhcr has helped 369 million afghan refugees return to afghanistan since march 2002 marking the largest assisted return operation in its history in addition more than 111 million refugees have returned to afghanistan without availing themselves of unhcrs assistance bringing the total number of returnees to at least 48 million despite the massive returns possibly 35 million registered and unregistered afghans still remain in these two countries of asylumup to 246 million in pakistan and more than 900000 in iranmaking afghans the secondlargest refugee population in the world these numbers are far greater than the initial working assumption in 2002 of 35 million refugees in fact the total is believed to be more than 8 million the united states spent approximately 33237 million between fy 2002 and fy 2005 on humanitarian assistance to afghan refugees and returnees through the department of states bureau of population refugees and migration prm it continues to provide support to refugees and returnees the 110 th congress faces several relevant challenges the safe and voluntary return of refugees to afghanistan is not only major part of the us reconstruction effort in afghanistan but also an important indicator of its success to the extent that refugees continue to return it can be seen that afghans are taking part in the future of their country it is becoming more difficult however to encourage refugees to return those who were most capable of returning did so in the early years those who remain have progressively less to return tohouses livelihoods familyin afghanistan furthermore maintaining the high pace of returns will require greater levels of reintegration assistance to anchor returnees in th eir homes and help them reestablish their lives in afghanistan security will also be major factor in population displacement within and across borders the status of afghan refugees in pakistan and iran has also been somewhat controversial in recent years as these governments want all afghan refugees to return to afghanistan officials in pakistan have become concerned that the concentrations of afghans in the country pose security and crime risk as individuals and goods are smuggled across the border at the same time however many observers argue that afghan labor migration may be beneficial to both iran and pakistanwhich take advantage of cheap and effective immigrant laboras well as afghanistan whose citizens benefit heavily from remittances nt in from abroad to cut off this source of income for many poor afghans could have disastrous consequencesnot only humanitarian but in the security sphere as well as more than million afghans along the afghanpakistan border are deprived of livelihoods and resort to other means to feed their families reportedly many afghans cross the border regularly without documentation and islamabad does not appear to have the resources to control this flow future challenge will thus be to balance reasonable concerns about security with the importance of afghanistans labor plans in the regional economies and the forces that drive its migration patterns it remains to be seen what effect the pakistani governments recently announced plans for controlling and securing the afghan border through the construction of fences and planting of landmines will have on refugee movements this report will be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33851g3g143g144g145g138g151g561g20g142g143g158 g144g142g142g156g497g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g138g151g141g561

when the marxist peoples democratic party of afghanistan pdpa overthrew the gove rnment of muhammad daoud who had himself seized power from his cousin afghan king zahir shah in bloodless coup in 1973 the trickle of refugees accelerated when the soviet union invaded in december 1979 ostensibly to restore order to the country as the pdpa became increasingly splintered while political infighting was certainly problem some observers also noted that afghanistans leadership had begun irking moscow by making decisions without soviet pproval the soviet attempt to subjugate the afghans was at times particularly brutal including the alleged use of torture and collective punishment 5 by the beginning of 1981 some 37 million refugees had fled to iran and pakistan6 smaller numbers of refugees continued to flee afghanistan for the next decade as the soviets fought an insurgency mounted by loosely allied group of mujahideen or holy warriors in 1988 the soviet union agreed to withdraw from afghanistan and unhcr and the international assistance community prepared for the massive repatriation of refugees7 largescale returns did not begin until 1992 however when the sovietinstalled leader najibullah was finally forced from power sooner had some million and half refugees returned however than kabul descended into armed disorder as various mujahideen factions began fighting for control of the capital and the surrounding area new wave of people was displaced possibly up to million majority of whom remained within afghanistans borders as internally displaced people idps8 after yearlong siege the taliban took kabul in 1996 and had gained control of most of the country by 1998 although they brought measure of peace to the areas they captured many afghans especially the educated fled the talibans particularly austere vision of islamic propriety with its severe restrictions on womens activities education and social and cultural life 9 final wave of refugees numbering 200000 to 300000 left afghanistan during the usled invasion of october 2001 with the defeat of the taliban month later unhcr led consultations with the three governments centrally involved in the afghan refugee issuespakistan iran and afghanistanand began planning for another mass repatriation 10 beginning in 2002 unhcr along with afghanistan established separate tripartite agreements with pakistan and iran to provide legal and operational framework for voluntary repatriations from each country these 5 kakar m hasan afghanistan the soviet invasion and the afghan response 19791982

g345g561agreements have been renewed several times since then11 the working assumption at the time was that there were approximately 2 million refug ees in pakistan and 15 million in iran almost everyone was caught offguard when subsequently 215 million afghans returned in 2002 and yet most of the camps in pakistan and to some extent the cities in iran continued to house large numbers of afghan refugees it turned out that there were far more afghans living in pakistan than most analysts had thought alt hough the numbers of returns declined in subsequent years it can be seen from table 1 that through 2005 the pace remained very strong12 g18g155g152g143g146g149g142g561g152g143g561g20g142g150g138g146g151g146g151g144g561g20g142g143g158g144g142g142g156g561 unhcr estimates that as of december 2006 perhaps 246 million registered and unregistered afghans are currently living in pakistan and more than 900000 in iran who among these afghans is refugee and who is not is matter of debate in each country still perhaps as many as 35 million registered and unregistered afghans still live in exile in pakistan 80 percent of those remaining have been there for more than two decades 50 percent were born in exile 13 g20g142g143g158g144g142g142g156g561g146g151g561g18g138g148g146g156g157g138g151g343g346g561

first time in years of the afghan population in pakistan the census found 3049268 afghans living in pakistan 42 of them in camps and 58 in urban areas over 81 of the afghans were pashtuns with much smaller percentages of tajiks uzbeks turkmen and other ethnic groups see figure 1 11 refugee issues have also been incorporated in broader discussions for example in the 2006 london compact which focuses on stability reconstruction and development issues for background information and r ecent developments on afghanistan see crs report rl30588 afghanistan postwar governance security and us policy by kenneth katzman 12 by contrast the number of internally displaced persons idps within afghanistan is estimated to be 150000 some figures suggest that up to 500000 idps have returned to their

pakistan arrived in the first years of the refugee crisis over 50 arrived in 1979 and 1980 alone second it appears that very substantial number of the afghans remaining in pakistan were in fact born in pakistannot afghanistan see figure 2 15 encouraging afghans who have been living for two and half decades outside their countrysome of whom in fact may never have even set foot in afghanistanto repatriate may be distinct challenge in the coming months and years 15 the census estimates that 562 of the afghan refugee population is under the age of eighteen since the census directly assessed only the number of respondents under the age of five 191 the overall age profile of the population is estimated by extrapolation based on detailed demographic information available from repatriation data according to the census 806 of the afghan families in pakistan arrived over eighteen years ago applying this percentage to the undereighteen population it may roughly be estimated at least 45 of

have migrat ed in response to crop failures drought and other problems often across international borders to look for temporary work 16 while the numbers crossing into pakistan in 1979 an d 1980

designed to update the original convention by among other things broadening its scope beyond the implicitly european focus of the original document is considered to have the same legal force as the 1951 convention the united states is one of three countries that is signatory to the protocol but not the convention the most recent signatory to both documents is afghanistan which signed on august

them in the northwest frontier province nwfp and few in balochistan although the gop did not allow the primarily rural afghans to own or work the land it did permit them to freely move and work within the country nevertheless it was assumed at the time that most afghans remained in the camps where they received food rations along with basic health and educational services the subsequent realization that there were far more afghans in pakistan than anyone knew suggests that urbanization was far more extensive during this period 19 the camps were and are overseen by unhcr and the pakistani chief commissionerate for afghan refugees ccar division of the ministry of states and frontier regions safron unhcr and ccar contracted with number of international and local ngos to provide health education water and sanitation services in the camps these have included major usbased ngos including mercy corps international rescue committee save the children american refugee committee church world service and others in 1995 the world food programme wfp determined that afghans were capable of providing for their own food needs and it ceased providin g rations to the camps the gops position toward the refugees began to harden as the flow of international aid began to diminish and more afghans were driven into cities to look for work 20 with the cessation of food aid the sole identity document given to afghans refugee passbook became meaningless therefore afghans until very recently had identification in pakistan factor that doubtless contributed to the general uncertainty about their numbers g18g138g148g146g156g157g138g151g514g156g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g138g151g141g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g5g152g151g140g142g155g151g156g561 with the defeat of the taliban the gop began strongly advocating that conditions were appropriate for the return of all afghans to afghanistan21 the gop appears to have both economic and security concerns about the afghan population in pakistan on the economic level some pakistani politicians believe that afghans are taking jobs that might otherwise go to pakistanis additionally afghans are reportedly willing to work for lower wages than pakistanis causing some pakistanis to believe that wage levels are being depressed some recent research has shown that several business sectorsparticularly transport and constructionmake heavy use of afghan labor22 economic worries about the afghan population have become more persistent in recent years as the overall level of international funding for refugees in pakistan has decreased the census provided more fuel for this concern when it revealed that despite the record repatriation millions of afghans still remain in pakistan 18 under the 1951 convention

concerned that afghans represent security risk for pakistan these fears concern lawlessness terrorism and antigovernment activity there is perception among many pakistanis including government officials that afghans are responsible for great deal of the smuggling of stolen goods narcotics and weaponry across pakistans western border the socalled smugglers marketson the outskirts of peshawar and quetta for instance where one can allegedly buy anything from counterfeit passports to heroin to kalashnikovs are alleged to be run by afghans and to flourish because of their proximity to afghanistan 23 pakistani police in justifying their sweeps through afghan areas have cited the imperative to crack down on crime24 one of the reasons the smugglers markets have been difficult for islamabad to deal with is that they exist in the socalled federally administered tribal areas fa ta where the central governments writ is weak 25 although each of the fa ta s seven agencies is ostensibly governed by political agent appointed by the government in islamabad in practice the tribal areas are ruled by traditional pashtun leaders exercising blend of personal decree islamic law sharia and traditional pashtun legal practices known collectively as pushtunwali despite islamic proscriptions against drugs and alcohol the smugglers markets have been an important source of revenue for some fata leaders who continue to permit this operation26 it is not merely lost economic revenue or local law and order that concerns pakistani government officials many experts and officials believe that the fata is being used as staging area for militant activity some of it directed against coalition forces in neighboring afghanistan and some against the pakistani government this worry has grown more acute in the wake of several assassination attempts against pakistans president pervez musharraf in light of the difficult to verify but nevertheless oftstated presumption th at osama bin laden and other senior members of qaeda are hiding in the mountainous tribal ar eas of pakistan perhaps with the knowledge of local leaders the governments efforts to gain control over these areas have gained urgency27 security was considered to be one of the reasons behind the gops decision to close all of the remaining refugee camps in the fa ta the gop had for at least two years declared its desire to clear out the fa ta camps but only began the operation in summer 2005 when it closed refugee camps in south waziristan agency camps in north waziristan were next with the most recent 23 the

the gop received some criticism during each closure operation for failing to identify suitable relocation alternatives for afghans unable to repatriate because they lacked shelter or the means to earn living in afghanistan or other reasons according to some reports this resulted in many afghans crossing the border into afghanistan without the desire to do so and without adequate preparation support or security on either side of the border according to the terms of the tripartite agreement between the gop the government of afghanistan goa and unhcr which was signed in march 2002 and extended several times since all returns must be voluntary while there have been isolated reports of forced deportations most observers believe that the gop has largely abided by the agreement 29 on january 17 2007 pakistans government announ ced the pending closure of four afghan refugee camps in the border areas stating it was doing so in order to ensure security two camps will reportedly be closed in march 2007 with another two to follow later in the year the camps are located in the provinces of balochistan and north west frontier some closures had been announced several years ago but were postponed until 2007 the move could affect as many as 250000 afghan refugees the united nations and other humanitarian organizations have expressed their concerns for the wellbeing of the refugees affected30 g20g142g144g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 in order to gather more information on afghans in pakistan and ultimately to sort out those who have legitimate protection concerns from others the gop conducted census in february and march 2005 that has become the basis for the registration program developed with unhcr and the government of afghanistan registration of afghans began on october 15 2006 and is being conducted by pakistans national database and registration authority nadra with the support of unhcr and the governments commissionerate for afghan refugees to encourage afghans to come forward for the registration those who are registered are given new identity document entitling them to live and work in paki stan for three years the validity period of the documentation is still being negotiated among unhcr the gop and the government of afghanistan initially only those afghans counted in the census about 25 million could register but in december 2006 the list was expanded to include all afghans who could show documented evidence as proof that they were living in pakistan at the time the census was conducted 31 the idea was to provide for transition period during which afghans may reconnect with afghanistan and ultimately return home as of january 17 2007 15 million had registered32 the registration was supposed to end on december 31 but has been extended twicethe first time until january 19 2007 and then again to february 2 2007 28 despite the camp closures the recent census indicates that tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands

each passing year however it may become more difficult to encourage refugees to return voluntarily to afghanistan according to unhcr data the refugees who have already returned to afghanistan have spent on average less time in pakistan than those who remain33 this may suggest that those who left in the early years did so because it was easier for them they still had connections with afghanistan those who remain by contrast may find it especially difficult to return to country to which they have relatively speaking few ties unhcr the development program undp and the pakistani authorities are

on registration initiative undertaken by the government in november 2005 there were approximately 920000 registered afghans in iran as of may 2006 this figure includes only officially registered refugees however36 it is likely that additional hundreds of thousands the government of iran goi estimates perhaps close to one million afghans are living in iran as undocumented workers 37 it is

g343g342g561afghans sought work in iran during the oil crisis of the 1970s and when because of increasing international demand and high oil prices iran both needed and could afford foreign workers39 the crossborder flow picked up dramatically however after the soviet invasion of 1979 by 1981 some 15 million afghans were estimated to have fled to iran the number would expand to over 3 million by 199040 the status of afghans in iran went through several changes over the course of the refugee crisis although iran is signatory to the 1951 refugee convention afghans fleeing the soviet invasion were initially greeted not as refugees panahandegan but as involuntary religious migrants mohajerin while this category based on islamic principles was technically not an international legal designation it was considered higherstatus term than refugee in postrevolutionary iran41 mohajerin were given indefinite permission to reside in iran and had access to free education and subsidized health care and food42 after the soviet withdrawal however the status of afghans began to change although 14 million afghans are estimated to have repatriated in 1992 well over million remained in iran beginning in 1993 new migrants were longer deemed to be fleeing religious persecution and were categorized as refugees panahandegan instead of being granted indefinite residency status they were issued with temporary registration cards after the fall of the taliban afghans once again began to return in large numbers to afghanistan see table 1 g14g138g139g152g155g561g15g146g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 as in pakistan there is ample evidence that afghan labor migration now plays in important role in both the afghan and iranian economies remittances from afghans working in iran bring good deal of revenue to their families in afghanistan and afghans continue to be an important source of labor in iran where they are particularly prevalent in construction and agriculture 43 one measure of the continuing importance of afghan labor in iran is the fact that the goi has recently offered to permit some 200000 afghans to work in iran as guest workers44 key aspect of this offer is that the afghan workers will be required to leave their families in afghanistan presumably to ensure that they will not attempt to emigrate in fact however number of recent research papers commissioned and published by the afghanistan research and evaluation unit areu show that this migration pattern has ready been model for some time many young afghan men travel to iran for period of months or even years to supplement their family income while the women and other men remain in afghanistan45 this contrasts with many of the 39 stigter elca and

leaving their families in pakistan return to afghanistan in search of higherpaying seasonal work and to look after family assets46 although there has not yet been systematic st udy of population movement across the afghan iranian border similar to the international organization for migration iom study of the afghanpakistani border it is clear that since 1979 the volume and frequency of afghan migration to iran is much less than it is into pakistan to begin with traffic across the iranian border is more tightly regulated than it is across the pakistani border it is not possible to simply walk from afghanistan into iran furthermore afghans crossing into iran must pay for passport and visa obtaining these legally is expensive and timeconsuming obtaining them illegally is even more expensive in addition there is much less settlement along af ghanistans rather arid border with iran than there is along the border with pakistan afghans wishing to work in iran must travel fairly deeply into the country before reaching the major population centers of tehran and isfahan even irans eastern city of mashad is over 200 miles from herat in afghanistan the cost of transportation can be prohibitive for many afghans for these reasons afghan migration to and from iran does not happen as frequently or as casually as it does along afghanistans eastern border 47

agreement signed with unhcr and afghanistan iran holds that the deportees are illegal immigrants and not refugees and that tehran is thus legally permitted to send them back to afghanistan52 afghans who are clearly on the amayesh list have encountered increasing difficulties in recent years whereas afghan refugees in the past have received subsidizedor even freeeducation health care and food rations the goi has begun implementing measures to force afghans to pay for these resources these efforts reached peak in february 2004 when the goi announced afghans would lose their exemption to paying school fees and have to pay increased health care premiums additionally the goi announced in early 2005 that afghans would be subject to nominal tax previously afghans had received free education and paid the same amounts as iranians for health care 53 unhcr which felt that the service reductions were particularly draconian considering its own budget cuts in iran has reported that the goi has not been overly fastidious in enforcing the new rules54 nevertheless irans position like that of pakistan has generally been that it is time for afghans to return home and these efforts are part of an explicit effort to encourage afghans to return to afghanistan55 in both cases goi and gop argue that relative stability has returned to afghanistan and there are further reasons that afghans require protection abroad indeed the gois directorgeneral of the interior minist rys department for immigrants and foreign nationals amad hoseyni recently announced in early 2006 that iran plans to voluntarily repatriate all afghansno matter what their status isby march 200756 there is certain implicit contradiction in this and other such statements by both tehran and islamabad if repatriation is indeed to be voluntary many afghans may choose to remain in countries of asylum thus rendering somewhat questionable the governments assertion that all afghans will leave 57 the gois announcement that it is considering extending limited number of work visas to afghans suggests that the goi is remaining flex ible in its planningor that there may be some disagreement among leaders

exceptionally high re fugee return numbers the population of afghan refugees in pakistan and iran remains the secondhighest in the world63 if recent returneesalso central to prms mandateare added to this number afghans represent by far the largest population of refugees and returnees in the worl d funding for afghan refugees has however diminished both overall and as percentage of prms total annual budget since fy2002 the united states thus faces the challenge of maintaining its crucial assistance in this area of the world despite competing priorities this challenge may become even more difficul t in the near future because maintaining the successful repatriation program is likely to become more not less expensive as time goes on this is because the refugees remaining in pakistan and iran have fewer resources in and ties to afghanistan than those who returned earlier they have also on average spent far more time outside of afghanistan than earlier returnees see figure 2 64 as time goes on it becomes increasingly more difficultand expensiveto encourage remaining refugees to voluntarily return to afghanistan thus as funding is declining its importance may be increasing related issue may be whether pakistan and iran would be receptive to encouragement to grant citizenship to afghans who do not want to return to afghanistan 60 see unhcr country operations plan 2007

sustainability of previous returns to afghanistanthat is the degree to wh ich returnees are being adequately anchored in their communities whether they are receiving health care education and opportunities to make living integration of returnees increasingly is examined in both studies and reports and getting the attention of policymakers65 the success of the repatriation program thus depends on the success of the overall reconstruction effort in afghanistan including the extent to which returned refugees and idps are integrated into reconstruction efforts there is already evidence that many afghan returnees do not remain in afghanistan traffic across the pakistani border in particularin both directionsis heavy66 to certain extent and as noted above this is historical pattern that predates not only the repatriation program but the refugee crisis as well cause for concern may emerge however if it is concluded that many of the afghans crossing back into pakistan and iran are doing so because they could not sustain themselves in afghanistan renewed outward flow of afghans in addition to signaling the possible inadequacies of the reconstruction effort in afghanistan could increase tensions with host countries both the goi and the gop indicate some possible flexibility on the future of afghan migration but have nevertheless made clear that they believe the refugee crisis in afghanistan is over and that there is excuse for afghans to remain in their countries on humanitarian grounds future study of the reasons for afghan population movements is required in order to determine their reasons for migration 67 it remains to be seen what effect the pakistani governments recently announced plans for controlling and securing the afghan border through the construction of fences and planting of landmines will have on refugee movements68 humanitarian groups have voiced their concerns and condemned the plan pakistan is not signatory to international conventions banning the use of landmines and the government says the plan is necessary step to increase border security69 president hamid karzai apparently also objected strongly to the announcement not only for political and humanitarian reasons but because he does not believe the plan will be effective in preventing terrorists from crossing the border into afghanistan70

livelihood opportunities it remains to be seen what role the united states might take on this issue despite its economic advantages establishing such labor migration regime in south asia may prove politically difficult on the pakistani and iranian domestic fronts segments of both the goi and gop have indicated that they believe afghans are net drain on the economy maintaining security along the border with afghanistan is also concern afghans in pakistan are blamed for good deal of lawlessness in the country and there are few down sides for authorities to engage in this kind of scapegoating 72 ultimately however afghans will likely continue to live and work outside of afghanistan regardless of the legality of doing so understanding and regulating as much of this migration as possible may be one way to ensure that it is done so in secure humane and effective manner g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 rhoda margesson
