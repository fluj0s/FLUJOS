social democr acy of romania pdsrthe reformed communist party that had governed from 1990 to 1996 not only did the cdr fail to win another plurality it failed even to pass the minimum threshold needed for representation in parliament in addition foreign observers and many romanians were alarmed by the strong show of votes for ultranationalist candidate corneliu vadim tudor and his greater romanian party prm how can this result be explained the cdr coalition took the reins of government in 1996 amid high hopes but its tenure was plagued by continual infighting the political squabbling stymied

of policies will iliescu redux put in place some observers believe that he and the pdsr have already stumbled several times others however argue that the new government pressured by domestic nationalists from one side and by international organizations from the other is making the best of difficult situation the elections and current political situation on election day romani ans chose among 20000 parliamentary candidates representing 80 political parties and dozen presidential candidates early polls indicated that the pdsr would win the most parliamentary seats and that forme r president ion iliescu head of the pdsr would place first in the presidential race followed by center right candidates however support for ultranationalist vadim tudor and his party surged in the final weeks before the election after the votes were tallied the pdsr had won 37 followed by the prm with 20 three other partiesthe liberals the democrats and the ethnic hungarian partyeach picked up about 7 in the presidential contest iliescu received 36 and tudor was runnerup with 28 voter turnout was 575about 20 less than in 1996 since presidential candidate received more than 50 runoff election was held on decemb er 10 and iliescu defeated tudor 67 to 33 many romanians and foreign observers were surprised and concerned by the rise of tudor before the fall of communism tudor was court poet who composed paeans extolling nicolae ceau õescu the stalinist dictator who ruled romania from 1965 until his death before firing squad in 1989 in 1990 tudor founded the greater romania party prm and began publishing romania mare xenophobic tabloid that blames the countrys ills on roma gypsies jews and ethnic hungarians2 political figure compared by some to russias zhirinovsky tudor has called for romania to be ruled from the barrel of machine gun and has proposed to end corruption and crime with mass stadium trials3 in addition many regard his use of the term greater romania as an implied pledge to reacquire territories that were once part of romania viz bessarabia now in moldova and bukovina now part of ukraine in his 1996 presidential bid tudor won less than 5 of the vote four years later onethird of the voters cast their ballots for him analysts attribute this shift in support to several factors first of all by voting for tudor and the prm romanians were signaling their deep discontent with parties of both the left and the right each had had chance to bring order and prosperity to romania and each had failed secondly tudors messagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20886crs3 4

seats in the chamber of deputies the lower house of parliament and 65 of the 140 senate seats the pdsr spurned tudors offer to form coalition and chose instead to form minority government there is effective opposition the main party of the former ruling cdr coalition the national peasant partychristian democratic pntcd is longer represented in parliament two of its leaders former prime ministers viktor ciorbea and radu vasile bolted the party to join other political groups although there are indications that ciorbea may be returning to the fold the pntcd has reorganized itself under new leadership but many regard it as spent force for the time being in the meantime the liberals pnl and the party of ethnic hungarians udmr have stopped short of joining in coalition with the pdsr but have agreed to support the government in an effort to thwart the influence of the prm which has about 25 of the seats in the legislature now that he is president once again how will iliescu govern in one view this may be the last chance for iliescu and the pdsr they can leave legacy of what may be seen as continued corruption and footdra gging on reforms or they can consolidate and accelerate the economic changes launched recently by former prime minister isarescu if they choose the first path and romania is better off when the next elections are held in 4 years then even more voters may be sufficiently frustrated to cast their votes for tudor and the prm the february 2001 election of communist government in neighboring moldova reinforces this possibility4 it is possible that the cdr failed because it was hobbled by lack of experience in governance former president constantinescu had been university rector and the three cdr prime ministers also were relative newcomers to politics this is not the case with iliescu in addition the new prime minister adrian nastase is head of the pdsr and having served in the early 1990s as foreign minister and chairman of the chamber of deputies brings considerable political experience to the office several members of the cabinet also served in the previous pdsr administration iliescus critics contend he has started off on the wrong foot they point to controver sial appointments in romanias intelligence establishment to legislative proposals that they maintain would inhibit human rights and to questionabl media policies5 more optimistic

under the poverty threshold officially put at monthly income of less than 30also note that pdsr policies will likely be tempered by the need for the support of the more centrist pnl and udmr supporters also point out that the new cabinet is not composed entirely of retreads from the last pdsr administration but includes five womennoteworthy because women have not yet been as successfully integrated into leadership roles in romania as they have in west europe and young nonpolitical technocrats the new government has full agenda not only does the economy urgently need to be restructured host of other issues must be addressed as well for example several chemical spills have demonstrated the need for more stringent environmental regulation the worst such incident occurred on january 30

issue of the election the country has suffered decade of economic decline and stagnation while the economies of many of its neighbors have taken off according to the wall street journal romania is the one country in central and eastern europe where conditions have actually worsened in the past decade7 although romania is rich in natural resources most observers agree that it cannot prosper until the government relinquishes control over key sectors of the economy permits the growth of private financial institutions and eases barriers to foreign investors romanias economy which had been devastated by decades of mismanagement under ceau õescu was showing signs of improvement by the mid1990s but began to experience serious difficulties in 1996 the cdr coalition governments economic reforms to the extent they were implemented had harsh impact on the economy gdp which had risen by healthy 71 and 39 in 1995 and 1996 respectively it fell 69 in 1997 54 in 1998 and 32 in 1999 before

interviewromania aims shake off laggard label in eu reuters december 17 2000romania has applied to become member of the eu and hopes to join by 2007 but many observers believe that entry by that date would be impractical and unlikely given the current fragility and weakness of the economy in its november 2000 economic progress report on the twelve accession candidates the european union ranked romania last and concluded that the country cannot be regarded as functioning market economy and is not able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union in the medium term it has not substantially improved its future economic prospects10 in january 25 2001 eu enlargement chief guenter verheugen cautioned romania that we want to see clear results promises written papers are not sufficient11 iliescu campaigned from the nationalist left declaring that romania would not be ordered around by the imf the world bank or the european union12 instead he pledged to pursue dignified entry to nato and the eu13 some observers believe that this was said mainly for domestic consumption as it resonates with romanians many of whom are fatigued by frequent exhortations for sacrifices in order to join the two organizations the main reforms called for by international organizations privatization and economic restructuringhave not been carried out but that fact may be unapparent to romanians who have seen their living standards slide year after year political analyst stelian tanase summarized the new governments predicament as one of being trapped between the demands of voters and the demands of the eu14 public support for association with the eu remains strong september 2000 polls showed that 89 of romani ans favored membership15 this enthusiasm however may be based in part on unrealistic expectations one analyst noted that some romanians believe that eu integration substitutes for reform 16 both iliescu and prime minister nastase realize they must institu reforms although iliesc u may have implied during the campaign that he would adopt goslow approach nastase has already announced marketoriented initiatives in several areas including taxation investment and privatization however nastase also hopes to avert worker protests by maintaining wide social safety net to ease economic adjustment the government must show results and soon as the new foreign minister and former ambassador to the united states mircea geoana declared the honeymoon will be shorter than ever17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20886crs6 18 iliescu tipped for easy win over

past decade has aimed at integration into the eu and nato is not expected to change significantly during iliescus new termalthough the emphasis may us defense analysts believe that romanias troubled economy its limited track record of real reform and its illequipped armed forces scuttled its chances for entry into nato during the first round of enlargement and that membership in the near future is unlikely21 perhaps realizing this the government appears to have shifted its sights more toward eu membership which foreign minister geoana has characterized as romanias biggest domestic policy objective its the big project for our society the overarching goal22 usromanian relations though problematic in the early 1990s have been increasingly cordial over the past 6 years in 1996 for example the united states granted permanent mostfavored nation now referred to as normal trade relations status in addition romania has cooperated with the united states in number of international initiatives
