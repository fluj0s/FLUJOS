including seasonal temperature precipitation atmospheric circulation sea level with local to hemispheric coverage these will be combination of instrumental historical rigorously calibrated palaeoclimate proxies the characteristic variability contained in these data sets will be compared with the output of the forced unforced climate models by integrated analyses of the simulated reconstructed climates we will evaluate the credibility of these climate models identify externallyforced climate signals reassess climate change detection results that are currently based on untested

simulations under historical external forcing to evaluate the reliability of stateoftheart climate models that are currently used in climate change signal detection studies and for future climate predictions to analyse simulated climate variations for the period ad 15002000 using two advanced climate models forced with natural volcanic aerosols solar irradiance and orbital changes and combined natural and anthropogenic greenhouse gases ozone and sulphate aerosols forcings to provide improved regional estimates of the natural variability of climate on annual decadal and century time scales over the last 500 years based on new compendium and calibration of instrumental documentary and palaeoclimate records climate variations from ad 15002000 simulated using two stateoftheart coupled climate models run under natural and also combined naturalanthropogenic forcing will be analysed the results will be intercompared and also compared with long control integrations to identify climate responses to external forcings accurately dated annuallyresolved palaeoclimate records and existing reconstructions will be assembled giving dense and widespread coverage over much of the northern hemisphere and the tropics spanning the last 500 years the palaeodata will be calibrated against instrumental records to yield climate reconstructions with explicit timedependent uncertainty methods will be developed to allow likewithlike comparison between palaeo and model data simulations will be compared with the proxy data to evaluate the veracity of the climate models comparison of means and variances of temperature precipitation and important climate indices nao enso etc and on statistics linked to extreme events will also be employed signal detection techniques will be applied to attempt to detect in the proxy data the largescale simulated response to external forcing the proxy and model data will be merged to obtain improved estimates of natural variability the improved spatiallyexplicit evidence of natural variability will be used in detection studies that previously used only unforced model integrations sea level variations will be diagnosed from the climate model simulations utilising an existing glaciermelt model and oceanic thermal expansion and compared with recent palaeo sea level and tide gauge estimates for two north atlantic regions month 12 climate
