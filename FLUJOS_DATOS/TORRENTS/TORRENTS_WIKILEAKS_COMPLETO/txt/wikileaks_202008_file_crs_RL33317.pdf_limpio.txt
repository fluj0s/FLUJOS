both the fastest growing motor vehicle market and the fastest growing vehicle producer output and sales have grown from less than two million vehicles annually before 2000 to nearly six milli on vehicles in 2005 in the number of vehicles that it manufactures china has passed korea and france is on pace to overtake germany and would then tra il only the united states and japan disproportionate share of ch inas output has always been heavy vehicles but since 2000 chinas growth has been led by the increase in passenger cars they now account for about half of chinas production china exports or imports few motor vehicles less than 200000 of each exports are growing much more rapidly than imports and are mostly light trucks shipped to developing country markets chinas industry has veloped extensively with the aid of foreign direct investme nt unlike those of korea and japan this investment has been from major international automobile manufacturers that are unlikely to promote chinese exports in co mpetition with their own products in other markets as consequence the chinese companies that have expressed an interest in exporting cars are those who are less dependent on such cooperation and may struggle to meet safety and emission standa rds in industrial countries most experts do not see high volume of exports from china into these markets in the near future by contrast chinese auto parts exports are already making inroads into the united states while us motor vehicle trade with china was insignificant in 2005 the united states imported 54 billion in parts from china while it exported about onetenth of that amount china accounted for about 6 of us auto parts imports in 2005 but the amount has quadrupled si nce 2000 many of these imports are aimed at the aftermarket as most of what china now exports to the us market are standard products such as wheels brake pa rts and electronics but with high rates of investment in china by the leading us manufacturers of both car s and parts major companies such as gm look to increase sourcing from china the bush administration has noted that the new chinese auto policy announced in 2004 eliminated

most transforming development in the early twentyfirst century within this process the growth of chinas automotive industry may be the most important development in the automotive sector since henry ford veloped the assembly line process for manufacturing cars and changed the produc t from convenience item for wealthy consumers to nearly esse ntial component of everyday life in industrial economies there have been three key aspects so far to the evolution of the chinese automotive industry the spectacular growth in volume of the chinese automotive industry in recent years in 2005 china produced nearly five times as many motor vehicles as in the early 1990s with annual production nearing six million vehicles it is on pace to overtake germany as the third largest na tional vehicle producer and would trail only the united states and japan in total vehicle output partnerships with major indus trial country motor vehicle manufacturers chinese products are increasingly sophisticated because of this technological cooperation an active government policy has economically liberalized the chinese automotive industry in some key respects but it requires foreign manufacturers to undertake joint ventures with chin partners in order to obtain market access the stated goal of the chinese government is to achieve market dominated by limited number of internationally competitive joint venture assemb lers supplied by local parts manufacturers producing to world standards the most significant impact on domestic us industry may be in automotive parts while uschina trade in motor vehicles is very limited and likely to remain so us exports and imports of automotive parts to and from china have grown rapidly since 2000 albeit from very low base congress and the bush administration ve not taken any steps to impede the growth of chinas automotive sector or uschina automotive trade however congress and the administration have expr essed concerns about the conditions under which us manufacturers must compete with chinese firms in china and in globalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33317crs2 1 quoted in jim mann beijing jeep case study of western business in china boulder co westview press 1997 ed p 296markets including the domestic us mark et the concerns have focused on such issues as chinese currency policy which continues to

industry then chrysler corporation ceo lee iacocca is said to have reflected that chinas modernization process would be long haul very long haul 1 it is now clear that the process has picked up considerable speed china becomes major motor vehicle producer figure 1 illustrates the speed with which china has become major automotive manufacturer china first produced more than two million vehicles of all types in the year 2000 since then it surpassed s outh korea 2002 and france not shown on graph in 2003 with 52 million units of total production china drew close to the production level of germany europe s largest national producer and number three in the world in 2004 china was on p ace to overtake germany in total vehicle production in 2005 moreover among the leading vehicle pr oducers china is the only one showing substantial growth in its production level since 2000 the european union including only the 15 members before 2004 and north america each produce more than three times as many vehicles as ch ina but between 2000 and 2004 total us production dropped by net 800000 units nd the two leading producers general motors gm and ford registered losse s in production and domestic market share in 2005 both canada and mexico also regist ered net declines so that the total north american output declined by 13 million its despite large increases in north

including russia and ukraine increased only from 29 million units to 30 million between 2000 and 2004 japan the secondlargest producing country and the largest motor vehicle exporter also has shown little or ove rall growth in production in part because of the lost decade of slow economic growth in the 1990s its total output has stagnated around 10 million vehicles per year strengthening exports including to china and the united states led to an increase to about 105 million units of production in 2004 chinas increase in volume output has also placed it far ahead of other developing countries that ar considered in the industry as actual or potential major automotive producers production in thailand has actually increased at faster rate than in china from 300000 units in 2000 to 900000 in 2004 and probably more than one million in 2005 brazils produc tion was stable from 2000 through 2003 then increased by 400000 units to 22 million in 2004 india viewed by some sources as being comparable to china in terms of its potential as both an automotive market and location of production saw its annual assembly volume increase from 900000 units in 200002 to 12 million in 2004 the

2005 this article notes the pref erence of international manufacturers for thailand over china as regional export base in part because of the lack of bureaucratic interference with development of the industry 4 wards automotive yearbook 1999 p 72 5 however in chinese data the truck category includes light trucks while the bus category appears to include at least some type s of minivans thus the key variable would appear to be the rise of the share of produc tion devoted to passenger cars which indicates rising demand among middleclass consumersthailand which is the worlds secondlarges t producer of pickup trucks trailing only the united states despite assembling onl about one million vehicles per year3 in the mid1990s out of total output of 12 million vehicles china produced 300000 passenger cars with the remaining output accounted for by more utilitarian products namely tr ucks and buses figure 2 the data in the source for the figure do not distinguish among different types of vehicles in the latter category as trucks and buses are grouped together through 2001 the united states in the 1990s also produced more trucks than passenger cars but in the us case trucks overwhelmingly consisted of minivans suvs and pickup trucks that were generally considered products for persona l consumer use in china the truck category in the 1990s was much more oriented toward heavy duty and mass transit equipment wards automotive yearbook for example notes that in 1998 china produced 16 million vehicles state figures show including 610000 heavyduty trucks 4 that would be nearly 40 of all vehicles co mpared to less than 10 of us output similarly the data for 20022004 for which wards breaks out truck and bus entries separately indicate that nnual production of each type of vehicle was more than one million units annually as late as 2004 comb ined truck and bus production in china was still slightly higher than output of passenger cars5 the pattern had begun to shift decisively after 2000 prior to that year chinas leading automakers were joint ventures w ith foreign partners with product mix and output subject to bureaucratic interv ention and negotiations process well documented in the book beijing jeep cited above but this began to change as noted in wards annual review although the products were often illsuited to market conditions multinational automakers agreed to build them in orde r to get foothold in the potentially high volume chinese market in 2000 china granted the wishes of many global automakers allowing them to build small affordable vehicles

payoff for companies waiting to tap chinas boundless potential6 passenger car output increased slowly from quarter of motor vehicle production in 1994 to about 30 in 200001 after that it was the

groupscomprehensive automotive joint ventures each more than 50 controlled as matter of policy by major foreign nameplate automotive manufacturer which will become the leaders in bringing automotive technologies to china these companies will work with local suppliers to produce parts components and equipment that meet international automotive standards according to this plan22 but some chinese in the industry have number of doubts about the effectiveness of the joint venture approach in assisting devel opment of the national automotive industry from the foreign join t venture partners perspective chinas intellectual property rights ipr regime provides insufficient protection for foreign partners iprs as will be discussed in the section on trade below from the chinese perspective however operating through join t ventures has been least satisfactory in terms of the perceived benefits for local research and development activities moreover they assert cooperation through joint ventures inherently restrains the chinese partner from independe ntly developing its own export market outreach in this view support and planning for global vehicle sales must be coordinated within the sales and service network of the international partner the inside china report reveals widespread belief that the approach undertaken in the governments 2004 auto policy leading to consolidation of major producers all operating within fore ign joint venture arrangements probably will not work if the goal is competitive independent chinese industry in this view the evolution of the industrys deve lopment under this framework may be too slow on the other side the report says foreignbased companies will be reluctant to withdraw from the market if they are not among the leading companies because of chinas vast market potential for exam ple see above the efforts being made by ford and toyota in china after their respective late starts the report concludes that both government restrictions on foreig n ownership of vehicle manufacturing companies and the governments significance as direct participant in the industry may fade away it may be noteworthy as an example that government planning and support in japan and korea did not lead to the i ndustrial outcomes envi sioned by bureaucrats two major japanese compan ies fell under effective fore ign control nissan and

american vehicle production in current practice ma jor vehicle parts components and systems must be produced more than several hour s transport distance from final vehicle assembly and delivered not only just in time but also just in sequence for different styles and models built to order off the same vehicle platform justin time manufacturing differentiates essentially between discrete standardized parts that may be used in many different vehi cles and large bulky parts and systems or modules that may only be installed in specifi c models such as front ends or cockpit units smaller standard parts may be produced globally and sourced from anywhere based on low labor and other production costs42 major system modules may be built up in part by integrating st andard parts and components thomas klier and james rubenstein analysts writing for the federal reserve bank of chicago report in what was imported from china we find that the rapid increase was overwhelmingly in aftermarket parts sold to retailers not manufacturers rather than original equipment for example 29 of all imports from china during the first half of 2005 were wheels and tires china passed canada as the leading source of wheels in 2002 and has expanded its share of the market since then producers of aftermarket parts face more pressure to minimize price than to maximize quality43 the manufacture of aftermarket parts is the smaller share of the us auto parts industry about 30 of the total the commerce department has cited private sector report predicting that the fastest growing product group in the aftermarket will be electrical and elect ronic products partic ularly sound systems44 trade data cited above indicated this is one of the major strengths of chinese automotive exports to the us

factors th at underlie the basis of trade such as exchange rates and alleged g overnment subsidies to indus trial producers from the perspective of the administration the main effort besides focus on exchange rate issues has been on ensuring that china lives up to the spirit as well as the letter of trade policy commitments that it has made including in the auto sector49 administration focus on chin auto sector commitments the united states and other members of the world trade organization wto had been highly critical of chinas 1994 i ndustrial policy for the automotive sector this policy was replaced by new one announced in may 2004 the us view is that it is important that china fairly treat imports of end produc ts as well as parts that can be exported competitively to its market to

new chinese auto policy of 2004 bolished many formal restrictions and domestic content rules however the us trade representative ustr is concerned about the vague nd unclear nature of many statements in the 2004 policy such as how china plans to regulate imports in keeping with its new registration system for auto manufacturers and whether china will effectively allow imports of complete knockdown kits50 moreover as cited above the new policy still requires foreignowned manufacturers in china to ope rate through joint ventures in which their ownership is limited to more than 50 the united states and other countries be lieve that the chinese government may be seeking to establish facto policies that would restore or maintain local content rules that it had to give up as part of its wto accession agreement with respect to formal tariff rules china reduced its duties on imported cars and parts from much higher levels to unified rate of 25 on imported vehicles and 1014 on parts by july 1 200651 however china has subsequently established regulation measures on importation of parts for entire automobiles which may effectively reestablish discrimination in favor of local content motor vehicle manufacturers are required to register their parts if more than 60 of the value of vehicle is accounted for by imported parts the manufactur er must pay duties of 25 on all imported parts in

seeking to address ipr issues directly with the chinese government the next section includes discussion of action taken by congress to tighten the law against us imports of counterfeit auto part s and

producers against what is perceived to be unfair competition from china these efforts which have increased in the 109th congress have not been specific to the automotive industry but have instead focused on the broader aspects of economic competition the issues that have generated the most attention and that have led to bills that have made progress in congress are the exchange rate question and us trade remedies against chinese government subsidies chinas government has maintained fixed exchange rate against the dollar leading many us manufacturers to claim that in twoway trade this is

bush on march 16 2006 pl10918160 conclusion there appears to be consensus among observers of both the global automotive industry and the industry in china that china is not yet ready to challenge the major international producers of fully assembled vehicles in their home markets most of the sources reviewed in the c ontext of the present report talk about competitive chinese industry in fiveto ten year time frame or even longer the british experts graeme maxton and john wormald rate china among countries still trying to develop an indepe ndent auto industry as having the best chance of doing so but they are skeptical that china with statedeveloped plan for the industry and the worlds largest market pot ential can achieve this goal within the near term each additional one million vehicles sold per year in china they noted is the equivalent of one weeks worth of sales in the advanced industrial countries even if china succeeds in creating an export industry its greatest impact in the markets of i ndustrial c ountries may be in small lowpriced vehicles which many companies already import rath er than producing locally61 chinas impact on the automotive parts industry is much more at hand already china is major supplier of parts to the united states and the only one if the european union is counted as single entity whose parts exports are not linked to the export of vehicles many us companies both nameplate automotive manufacturers and parts supplie rs have set up operations in china and parts from those operations are increasingly being circul ated in global trade moreover chinese companies themselves have become active in this business especially in the aftermarket beyond the aftermarket how ever chinesemade parts and equipment are being used by original equipment ma nufacturers in assembled vehicles the pressure to use chinese parts will likely increase as the major international vehicle manufacturers increase their commitment to pr oduction in china for the sake of the local market there it is thus likely that chinese production will be increasingly integrated into international motor ve hicle and parts production and distribution networks this gives chinese firms direct access to the us justintime automotive manufacturing market but also allows them firsthand access to and experience withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33317crs23 modern us technology the
